{"text":"Just had an early dinner with the kids tonight (kids eat free from 3-6pm btw).  I had the prime rib and my wife had the fish special, kids had the mac and cheese. All were great meals. The reason to go here is to sit on the patio, it's fantastic!  Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when I'm with the family, I'd just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Don't have a bar pickup section outside if your 3 bartenders can't handle over 10 guests total. Had to ask for a share plate for our SHARE starter, had to ask for silverware and napkins. 
We were told we were done a favor for making the sandwich we ordered because it wasn't \"on the dinner menu\" .... okay then don't hand out lunch menus at 8:30 pm. Regardless it came out cold and gross anyway. 

To finish you'd think out of the 3 bartenders you have at least one of them would be able to make an old fashioned properly. 

Better luck next time... actually not a next time."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and we have always had great service and great food! Today we met the manager Chris and his service was phenomenal. We are so happy we found this place and frequent it on the weekends. Favorite dishes: Howie burger, Santa Fe baked eggs, short rib hash, and blueberry pie! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food but perhaps the most pretentious dining experience ever.   I can't believe we waited for 45 minutes to down a $15.00 cheeseburger.  By the way, the cookie bell at the front door is a \"hot zone\".   Stay away from it.  We witnessed a never ending grab of grubby fingers instead of use of the provided serving utensil.   Nice try Chelsea's but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"They have good food. I had the filet mignon and let me just say that it was delicious. At the end of the meal I had the red velvet cake and I was surprised that it wasn't too sweet, the texture and taste was good. I will be returning to Chelsea's kitchen to try their chilaquiles since I hear those are also good"}
{"text":"I have to say that my most recent visit was an A+++!  The sever was very attentive and when ordering the mimosas, she suggested the bottomless which was well worth every penny.  My glass was never empty.  The food came out promptly and it was delicious.  I will definitely recommend Chelsea's Kitchen to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. My parents, who live in WI, come to visit 4-5 times a year and we ALWAYS have to eat at Chelsea's at least once per visit. This last visit was extra special because my Dad was flying to LA for the weekend and had a 3 hour lay over in Phoenix. We called the manager before hand(Brian) and he took excellent care of us (our waiter did too). Not only did he make sure we got a table quickly (at 730pm on a Friday night), but they got us in and out in time to get my Dad back to the airport in time to catch his next flight. 

I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I really enjoy it all! My favorites would have to be the Ahi taco's and the Brussel Sprout Salad (which is also great with chicken on it!). Other great choices are the Howie Burger, Del Mar Salad, Short Rib taco's and the Short Rib meal, and the Halibut. The melon salad is great too (Especially with the ahi taco's!) The kids meals are amazing as well. My daughter loves the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese. They both come with side fruit and fries (or i'm sure you could sub fries for another side)

Great food. Great Sevice. One of the best patio's in the area. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid restraunt for a very nice lunch or a good dinner.  Great atmosphere and everything is a little better there."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. Great tuna. Love it every time. 

The prices are reasonable for what you get. They range from $15-25.

The Service is generally good as well.

The ambiance here is unparalleled. Best patio in Phoenix hands down. 

What I continually struggle with here is the hostess and seating rules. There are just too many rules and it's not welcoming to guests. I feel like it is stressful to get a table because of all the rules. 

1. Only take a certain number of reservations.
2. No reservation for party less than 6 people.
3. No reservations for the patio.
4. Whole party must be there before seating. No exceptions.
5. If there is no wait when you arrive, but not everyone with you - then you wait and they seat other groups ahead of you to the point when there may now be a wait for a table when your whole group arrives.

The list goes on. I get the logic for the rules but it seems like there has to be a better way. It is a big turn off to enter a beautiful restaurant and then be bombarded with instructions from the hostess. I mean, I need cliff notes to have dinner here. 

I just feel like dinner shouldn't be that complicated for the guests. It should be easy, fun, and delicious. Nothing more."}
{"text":"Hostesses here are difficult and make you feel unwelcome. They wouldn't let me sit at a patio table to enjoy a drink and an appetizer while the patio was 2/3 open tables. I had to promise to be no more than 30 minutes so that a 'real diner' could have the table instead.  Sorry for inconveniencing you Chelsea's Kitchen. Not to worry, we left after 30 minutes as promised for fear of being asked to leave if we ordered a second drink. For a place that doesn't take reservations, you would think they would allow a first come, first serve patron to enjoy their beautiful patio. Sadly, the hostess took the enjoyment out of a otherwise lovely Saturday afternoon. She could at least smile."}
{"text":"Three friends and I were visiting Phoenix for the Rock n Roll marathon, and a local recommended the place for our post-race meal.  We called ahead for a reservation, and when we arrived, they seated us on the back patio.

Service was really good - they moved a few heat lamps around to make sure we were warm - and we all ordered a drink.  But the star was the food - our Vegan friend totally dug the vegetarian tacos, and two of us went to town on the fried chicken, green beans, cinnamon roll and mashed (or mac n cheese).  Nothing bad at the table - period. 

The food was simple, but very fresh, and the atmosphere was something we Chicagoans wish we could take advantage of more - outdoor setting, perfect service, great food.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I recently went here for brunch/lunch with my mom since I eat at the Chelsea's airport location quite a bit. I always hear from people at the airport that the street side location is so nice and I have to say I agree. It's so pretty, the layout and the patio area was gorgeous the day we went since the weather cooperated. Since the street side location has more items than the airport, I decided to venture to give them a try, such as the lobster slidersand the mac and cheese, both items that I wish were available at the airport cause they were delicious. The service was awesome; the staff were really friendly. 
Next time, I totally need to try the veggie tacos or the tuna burger. My mom liked her Howie burger and I told her to get it with the kale slaw, but I ended up eating her kale slaw and she had to get a side order of fries lol. I really wanted to do dessert, but that didn't happen cause I should have known better; I should have known to leave room for dessert. I know, I was a ditz that day and wasn't thinking, but next time I'm all over it."}
{"text":"Had some extra time at the airport so thought we would try out Chelsea's since we like the original.  Such a disappointment!  I have never seen such an unengaged staff wandering around a restaurant unable to figure out what to do with themselves.  (How 'bout filling up the water glass?).  Service was slow especially since there was a 1:1 ratio of staff to tables.  I had the French dip since they were out of the seafood for the salad. It was bland and needed salt at least.  Fries are tasty.  The chicken sandwich was good but spicy for my husband.  No refills on that drink to quench the spice!   Don't think we will rush back here since no one seemed to be able to crack a smile. Must have to pay extra for that."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a weekend brunch!  I had an amazing experience here while dining with my sister and brother-in-law on Easter Sunday, one of their BUSIEST days of the year.  I was able to get a reservation just days in advance and was able to get right in with absolutely NO wait time!

Our server was Della, she did an amazing job and was so accommodating and cheerful. I ordered the chilaquiles and white sangria, which was highly suggested, and so glad I did!  Chef Andrew Z. is the bomb!  He puts a lot of heart into his beautiful and delicious dishes and even graced us with his presence at our table!  What a treat and very rare!

Thanks, Chelsea's Kitchen, for giving me the best first experience with your establishment!  It truly was a day to remember.  I will certainly return for another meal very soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu and service. Brought a group of 8 and we sat outside on the front patio. Our waitress was great and service was really attentive. The menu choices are really unique and everyone loved their food. We shared the Brussel sprout salad, which sounded a little scary to some but all loved it. The short rib tacos were amazing. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Why do I bother spending 1 minute of my time on this...because entrepreneurs that are doing well deserve praise and those that don't deserve to be exposed.  The waiter I had the pleasure of dining with had a fine sense of timing, patience and service.  My food was tasty and well presented.  Their egg white omelet with herbs was very well prepared, hot & the light avocado on top added a touch of creaminess!  Franky, I was surprised at how well this egg white omelet was prepared (compared to others I've tried).  And their french press coffee hit the spot (I couldn't imagine Starbuck's hitting the spot like this did...wow!).  Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.  Keep in mind that you're in an airport, so you may need to wait a few minutes at the podium for them to seat you.  Cheers to Chelsea!"}
{"text":"After my negative review, i was contacted by a customer service mgr at Chelsea's and offered a gift cert to come back.  Finally had the chance to return with my friend who was with me the day we had bad service.  We had a great server (Christy) and the food was much better.  Thank you for the chance to come back and have a good experience."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is pretty dang awesome. Went there last Saturday for brunch and graciously took advantage of the bottomless mimosas for a mere $13! I was not upset with the frequent arrival of a new pitcher throughout our meal. 

I was pretty impressed with the crab cake Benedict. The crab cake was pretty much all meat, so that was a pleasant surprise. I am pretty obsessed with Benedict's as of late, so I feel like there couldn't be much that went wrong. It came with fresh fruit and it was definitely fresh. A couple of my friends got the green chili burger. My sister told me not to long ago that that is the best burger she has had in her life... sooooo... I will be making a trip back to Chelsea's in the very near future. 

Aside from the drinks and food be amazing, the wait staff was STELLAR! Like I said before, they never forgot to replenish the mimosas of our table of 8. Out waitress was nothing short of the unbelievably kind. She kept saying how great, wonderful, and polite we were (that is something I have never heard someone say about my group of friends and I). Needless to say, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos. Great corn tortillas. Deliciously spiced fish or brisket. Kale slaw has a unique flavor."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is hands down one of the best restaurants in Phoenix!!!

I am a frequent restaurant visitor and my job requires me to have meetings with clients and prospective customers over lunch or dinner. When the time comes for me to decide where to take a client and I want a place that is trendy, classy and features great food...I always end up going to Chelsea's Kitchen.  

Chelsea's Kitchen is my favorite place to take clients, friends, and family for lunch or dinner because it has a unique modern atmosphere, exceptional food, and consistently thorough and attentive service. I have never had a bad experience at Chelsea's Kitchen. 

During a recent visit to Chelsea's Kitchen, their staff and management went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years and have visited numerous restaurants...I can honestly say I have never experienced such attention. Chelsea's Kitchen truly cares about their guests."}
{"text":"The consistency here is great.  Servers have a bit of an attitude but this place is always rocking.  I had cold coffee which was surprising.  Their fries are great and veggie burger rivals houstons.  order a greyhound.  they make it with fresh squeezed grapefruits."}
{"text":"Ok, now I'm really shock! Having the chicken mole tacos. Unbelievingly great! I hope they keep this quality up! Heck, before you know it,  I'll want to come to phx airport for the food!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy stopping here for a quick snack and drink before a flight. I typically sit in the bar since the bartender is friendly and quick with my order. Highly recommended! And excellent bloody marys."}
{"text":"Back patio has great ambiance.  Tuna sandwich is yummy and the fries are fantastic.  Good service.  An enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Great place! Prime rib French dip was awesome! The staff was hopping and super cool outdoor space. Don't miss the opportunity to frequent!"}
{"text":"I don't  know what Brian is talking about...I came here today on my way home.  Service was outstanding; Brittany was vivacious and efficient.

The food was delicious  (I recommend the green chile burger).  When I come back through Sky Harbor i will be sure to stop here again."}
{"text":"Who knew that Chelsea's Kitchen would have the most delicious fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Wanted a sit down lunch after checking in @Sky Harbor... what a find.  Ordered the Howie Burger, wife had the Veggie Burger... both were excellent, mine came with a side of kale slaw that was the bomb... kale, grapes, tomatoes & a bit of quinoa.  Also totally surprised to find St. Bernardus Abt 12 on tap!  A very highly rated 10% ABV Belgian Ale... rarely will you find it in any liquor store, much less on tap at an airport restaurant. Service was top notch from Host and Waiter.  Big screen TV allowed us to watch Tiger clean up @Firestone while we ate.  Don't lose track of time though... the restaurant is outside of TSA.  We ran into a 45 minute line and made our flight just in time."}
{"text":"Well, it happened. Somewhere along the way, I turned 23. It happened without fanfare, or angels descending from the heavens with rare Tori Amos bootlegs. In fact, it passed quietly, with a certain stately dignity, marked only by the receipt of some not-so-modest gifts and some co-workers taking me (and a few other co-workers with October birthdays) to Chelsea's Kitchen for lunch. Oh, and my boyfriend baked me a cake. And decorated it. And is the most wonderful and amazing boyfriend, ever. But this isn't his review, so the lovebird shout-outs stop here. I promise.

Chelsea's Kitchen is just \"the cuteness.\" I know that, unlike my birthday, the phrase \"the cuteness\" is devoid of all dignity. I know this. But, the fact remains: Chelsea's Kitchen is \"the cuteness.\" The landscaping and decorative touches outside, (the little pond! the lovely patio), to the bright and rich interior...I pretty much knew I'd like it when we were walking up. Note: many reviews mention that it is a cutthroat parking situation during lunchtime. My work caravan arrived at around 12:15, and parking was easy. Maybe we were lucky. Maybe it's not actually that bad most of the time. I don't know!

Our waiter was friendly and courteous, and attentive without being overbearing. He kept the Arnold Palmers coming, which was much appreciated. Speaking of the Arnold Palmers, they were awesome. I know it's just lemonade and iced tea with a wrinkled little mint leaf floating on top, but, damn. I was hitting them, and I was hitting them hard. I might've just been in a cheery mood and feeling overly generous, but they were totally the tastiest Arnold Palmers I've ever had. 

I eat red meat very sparingly, but the Green Chile Burger was too tempting to pass up. And, guess what. I ordered it...medium well! My mother instilled me with a fear of Ecoli so strong and persistent that I have never ordered a burger or any other cut of meat without making sure that it would be \"well done.\" This was a momentous occasion, but I kept my triumph to myself. Why share my crazy with my innocent co-workers? Gotta save this weird shit for Yelp. 

The burger was delicious. I don't really even like burgers, and I thought it was super tasty. The fries are seasoned, crisp, and equally tasty. Paired with an Arnold Palmer from the gods, I was a happy little birthday clam. The desserts were tempting, but we were all stuffed and ready to head back to the daily grind. Even the kids menu looked pretty good. PBJ sushi? Cuteness! \"The cuteness,\" to be exact.

Pricey for lunch, but worth it, I think. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Because of my less than stellar review of Chelsea's Kitchen, the management reached out to me and offered a gift certificate to come back and try it again. So I did. We had the same fantastic service, and I must say our food was better prepared this time around. French Dip Sandwich was amazing! And a burger at our table was cooked exactly as ordered. Huge plate of deviled eggs for the kiddo and we were set.  There are definitely more items on the menu I want to try because all the food coming out of the kitchen looked so good. Thanks Chelsea's Kitchen for allowing us to give you a second chance. We'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service.  Short rib tacos were great and the kale slaw was also surprisingly very good.  The portion size was perfect.  Enjoyed the experience overall!"}
{"text":"I ate here in 09. I loved the simplicity yet smart spin on turning fare into variations of themselves.  Place was busy , we had no reso so we ate at the bar.  Good drinks, cool attractive bartender, had the ribeye tacos... Freakin delicious.... Clean, trendy fun ambiance, only a lil pricey.  I don't know how people gave this place 2 stars in reviews? Guess we all experience different things at different times.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Visited here on Monday evening, January 21st, before a flight.  Can't believe it, but this might be some of the best airport food I have ever had.  The Caesar Salad and French Dip were awesome.  The fresh squeezed lemonade was fantastic!!  Green Flash on tap, are you kidding me?  Definitely will make this a regular stop when going through the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Every time I travel to Phoenix I eat at Chelsea's Kitchen.  I've eaten all over the world, and I love this place best for many reasons:

1.  Amazingly attentive waitstaff (even when you aren't their customer.)
2.  The food is fresh, tasty, and beautifully presented.
3.  The atmosphere--beautiful, open, perfect lighting in the evening.
4.  Complimentary valet service.

If you're visiting Phoenix give it a try!  I promise that Chelsea's Kitchen won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great wait-staff, always friendly. Food is superb. They keep the menu small, so they can use fresh ingredients and unique items. I have not had anything here that wasn't above average. Short ribs are great. It is small, poplular and they do not take reservations. My wife and I's favorite place to eat dinner now."}
{"text":"So the wife loves this place,  it was my first time here and I can say for sure I will be back... 

I ordered the Chelsea's cheeseburger and fries.  The wife got the Brussels sprout salad.  Both were amazing.  I am not sure what they use for seasoning the burger but it was amazing.  The fries have kind of a seasonal on them that went well with the burger.  

They have a great menu,  and the atmosphere and staff were great."}
{"text":"Good selection of ipas, good music, the chicken nachos were amazing. Came with a very generous amount of quality guacamole. Enjoy.

Excellent service."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and an early dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday yesterday (Wednesday).

Happy hour is a VERY good deal.  I think it was half off drafts, $5 wines, and 4 or $5 wells.  Their wells were VERY nice stuff;  Herradura silver for tequila, Buffalo Trace for the bourbon.  We sat on the large patio in the back.  The weather was perfect, and the scenery was nice, although the trees were dropping a good deal of pollen.

People ordered a bunch of appetizers to share.  I remember the ceviche was nice, and the guac and salsa were quite good.  The salsa had a nice smokiness to it.

For dinner, I had the green chile burger, which I ordered medium-rare.  It came out overcooked, but it was still quite good.  One of my companions' burgers also came out overcooked.  I noted this to our server, and she apologized and took both burgers off of our tabs.  Excellent service.

I think my wife had the tuna sashimi tacos.  I tried some of the fish and it was good, but not really my thing.

After we finished up, we moved to the bar to clear our table for a party that had been waiting, and the manager bought us (five people left, at this point) a round on the house, in celebration of the birthday girl.  Very classy, nice gesture.  The old fashioned was excellent, quite possibly the best I've had in Arizona.

Great experience over all.  Good food and drinks, plenty of reasonably priced options if you don't want to splurge on an entree, which were in the $22-$33 range if I remember correctly.  The service was attentive and very professional, and the place seemed to be well-managed.  I warn that it did get quite busy by the time we finally left around 830, despite the fact that it was a Wednesday night.

In all, quite a nice restaurant with solid food and drink options and a great happy hour that runs until 6pm.  Very pleasant atmosphere out on the patio on a mild April evening.  Other than the overcooked burgers (to which the staff reacted appropriately), a perfect experience.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Ok service - very expensive even for an airport restaurant.  Chips and guacamole pretty average.  Chicken Cesar salad nothing special."}
{"text":"I always have lunch here when I am visiting my parents back in Phoenix. Lovely atmosphere, great food. But the best bit is the desserts!! Too many wonderful choices. I have to go to the gym extra after eating here!"}
{"text":"Sitting outside on the patio one might find a lot of leaves from the mesquite trees in their coffee or food on a windy day... but it's worth it. Food and drinks always wonderful. If you go on Sunday, bottomless mimosas are a plus. They don't take reservations and the parking lot is limited (if you choose to self park) they do have valet for busier times. Kid friendly place as well."}
{"text":"Good place for a nice lunch.  Sword fish tacos are amazing.  Good atmosphere and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Let's limit this review to Saturday/Sunday brunch.  Get their early and sit in the garden patio if weather permits.  There are Peach-faced lovebirds in the trees!!! Ambiance is first-rate.  Menu has many attractive items with a Southwestern flair. Service is always good.  We bring guests; they are impressed as well.  Lots of like about brunch there. Valet parking is a negative. It seems pointless, when you can park your own car."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience, great service, great drinks and bartenders.  Menu is fantastic, rotisserie prime rib is best in Phoenix!  This is my favorite restaurant hands down."}
{"text":"I was up in Phoenix for a 3-day convention and a friend took me to Chelsea's Kitchen.  I had never been there before. I was so impressed with the food and the service.  We got there on a Friday evening without reservations about 8 pm.  Fortunately they had a table open up right away.  We had a great experience.  We both had  the Watermelon Gazpacho Soup.   I had the Brussels Sprout Salad (bacon, almonds, manchego cheese) And my friend had The Del Mar Salad (shrimp, crab meat, iceberg, avacado, olives).  The salads were so huge and filling and delicious.  We enjoyed our meal and our time together so much that the next night I decided we should go back.  We did and the same server was there and was so sweet.  She remembered us even with all the many customers she serves.  It was just as great the second time.  Love Love Love Chelsea's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Came at prime time on Friday night. Was a bit of a wait, but not excessive. The king crab appetizer was enough to serve as an entree. It came with microgreens and summer squash, and was worth the $19 price tag. We also had a side of steamed tricolor cauliflower with ponzu sauce-worth the 3 bucks, but so much more could have been done with this. The roasted corn and poblano soup was outstanding.  Try the fruit pie and gelato for dessert.  I will probably try short ribs next time I come.  Jody, our server was top notch. \"Howie Burger\" with the gruyere cheese and caramelized onions was good combination per friend's report.  Aside from the burger, all the items we ordered were from the small featured menu, which generally features local seasonal ingredients. 
It's noisy inside, so pick somewhere else if you want an intimate romantic dinner.  There is a back patio if outside dining is a realistic option."}
{"text":"So, I read all the wonderful reviews and thought how great--fabulous food at the airport!  I was seated promptly and spoke to the waitress, Christina, about vegetarian options and, on her recommendation, ordered the veggie burger (no bun) and the side veg of broccoli rab, which she described as \"yummy\"and asked for a glass of water with a slice of lemon. Water arrived: no lemon. Food arrived, delivered by someone other than Christina. Burger on large slab of iceberg lettuce. I  took a first bite of burger--lukewarm temp. But the sauce on the side was good. Brocolli rab was cold. When (with the assistance of the gentleman at the next table), I was finally able to get Christina's attention, I asked if the vegetable was supposed to be cold. No, she said. So, I sent it back.
Take two: at my prompting, Christina reached over to the bar and dumped a piece of lemon into my glass of water. A third person came to my table with a veggie burger and broccoli rab but no sauce. I tried to point out to him that the sauce was missing and he waved me away. I tried the brocolli rab the second time--this time literally handing a piece to Christina and asking her if she thought it was warm. She didn't. She asked me how the burger was this time around and I said that as I was still waiting for the sauce chances were that if it were hot, it wouldn't be by the time that I got the sauce and a third try on the vegetables.
Decided to find a place that can actually serve hot food--maybe even the first time. 
So much for fab food at the airport."}
{"text":"This is NOT your typical FAMILY restaurant. the food here isn't great compared to their restaurant in town.  Very disappointing service and food.  They had a kitchen fire at their SKY HARBOR location. It makes me wonder how that happened.  Btw, Don't order the soup!"}
{"text":"We tried to go on Friday nite, but we couldn't even get into the parking lot at 6pm.  We decided to come back for Sunday Brunch at 10am.  Good call since the restaurant quickly filled and the noise level steadily increased by 11a when we left.  

Holy Moley on the Portion sizes!  I got the green chile burger and fries and despite help from DH, I still couldn't finish this overwhelming sized burger and fries.  Bring a friend or an enormous appetite when you go.  Delicious food: guacamole was chunky and fresh, salsa was spicy and chips were freshly made, burger was good, but perhaps not a date nite food due to sloppy spill factor, coffee was terrific and orange juice was fresh squeezed.  DH got the Chilaquiles and LOVED them.  I snuck a little taste and loved the mix of red ranchero and green salsa pools at the bottom of his plate.  

We skipped lunch due to the size of this delicious  brunch."}
{"text":"One of my other favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  My absolute favorites are:  the tuna tartare, bbq seasoned fries, and the short rib tacos.  OMG, the short rib tacos are DELICIOUS!!! I definitely recommend that dish for anyone who haven't tried Chelsea's Kitchen.  It is my favorite!!!

Very cute restaurant, kind of a random location tucked away.  Definitely a mixed crowd and not your senior citizen restaurant that you get every where else in the Phoenix metro area.   They offer complimentary valet service, so it's great on nights when it's crowded!  Don't forget to get some cookies on your way out!"}
{"text":"Oh Chelsea's your a tricky little spot, you have tasty tuna tacos (by far the best fish taco I've had in phoenix) but that little tuna delight cost 18$ which is no big thang except that I work within walking distance of the place and 18$ for a lunch taco dish is straight baller status. The outside patio is great and the service is what it is, Its a good corporate lunch spot but stay away when it comes to dinner, its kinda boring, OH YEAH IF YOU DRIVE BY THIS PLACE THEY PUT SOME CRAZY TASTY SMELLS IN THE AIR SO BE STRONG AND KEEP DRIVING YOUR WALLET WILL THANK YOU."}
{"text":"I love the food, atmosphere and service!  I just wish they didn't have the valet parking...it's silly and unnecessary."}
{"text":"Went to Chelsea's Kitchen for a special Mother's Day late lunch/early dinner on the Saturday before because we knew everywhere would be packed on Mother's Day. 
We sat in the beautiful Patio and our server was Christina M. Wonderful service and we ordered the deviled eggs (delicious) and short rib tacos (good, too). The margarita's were very good but the best part was the relaxing atmosphere and very good service. The food came quickly and it was a wonderful day. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the white sangria was deeee-lish!

The food, in my opinion, was overpriced and mediocre. I had the tacos and they were nothing spectacular. My friend had the ribs and I thought they were not very flavorful either. We did have great service though.

I would definitely go back as I think it's a nice place for the girls to sip sangria and catch up. but I'll skip the food.

UPDATE: CK sent me a gift certificate after this review and my friend and I went on a BUSY bustling Saturday night. I ordered the tacos again and they changed the recipe and now they were yummy! I changed it to 4 stars purely for the ambiance and decent food, and the drinks still rock. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times but recently decided to try the eggs benedict. They are not my favorite. The Howie burger is perhaps one of my favorites! Their fries are well seasoned leaving ketchup as only an option. I have enjoyed the nachos and other items on the menu. I even like the key lime pie although I am generally not a fan. The red velvet cake is the best of any place ever! My fiance ordered this for my birthday a couple of years ago and it was decorated with fresh blueberries and strawberries. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere, great menu. I wanted to try EVERYTHING. But went with Crab Cake Benedict instead. Absolutely delicious. Looking forward to visit again and I already know what I want to try next."}
{"text":"Fabulous patio, the best sangria, and excellent service!  We started with chips and guacamole and then enjoyed a delicious burger and fries. The nachos looked and smelled INCREDIBLE. This was my first time, but Chelsea's will be on my list next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Chelsea's when I read on it here on Yelp but unfortunately maybe my hopes were too high.
It was a long drive to Scottsdale to experience Chelsea's and upon arrival I was impressed with the appearance of the place. I was quickly seated and was given a menu. That menu however had coffee all over it.??? I asked for and received another menu and notice that my companion also had coffee all over her menu.???
 
I had some of the LGO English Muffins and they were quite good. They're not your grocery store variety of English Muffin that you usually get at so many places in that they were larger than standard. Not the Wolferman's(look it up) size of EM but larger than grocery store variety. What was special about it is the whipped butter with a bit of orange marmalade in it. Very good. A suggestion would be a butter knife served with the Muffins instead of the cutting knife that adorns the settings.

I ordered some coffee and was pleasantly surprised to be served French pressed coffee. What a nice touch.

I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict as that's what really caught my eye on the online menu. The CCB is billed as having Jumbo Lump Crab in it, however, what wasn't mentioned is that it was \"pan fried\". The result, IMO, was a greasy patty of something that could have easily been Pollock and who would have known. Maybe my taste buds were all ready for something else, like freshly steamed crab meat or just plain steamed crab meat. Oh well, my server Kim was great about everything and graciously comped the dish since the main selling point came well short of the mark.

A side note that needs to be mentioned is the issue of dead insects on the window screens and sills. This is not very appetizing if you sit near the windows and at least they were contained in the dead space( no pun intended) between the window and inside screen. I was assured that it is an issue that the management is addressing but all you should have to do is vacuum the screens and sills prior to opening for the day. I was there early enough that this shouldn't have been an issue yet it was. 

My dining companion had a French Dip plate that she liked. The Fries served with it were very good as well."}
{"text":"Deviled eggs are very good 1/2 portion available but not on menu. 

French dip with chiles on it, mayo on side is excellent."}
{"text":"Server Alyssa was amazing, everything she recommended was delicious.  The paella was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.  Loved the atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for brunch! The patio is beautiful and nice to sit and enjoy a leisurely meal. Parking was hard to find, but they have complimentary valet available. We started off with a pitcher of the white sangria, which I highly recommend. It had a nice hint of oranges, apples, and lemons, but the wine wasn't completely overpowered and still managed to shine!

We started off with the deviled eggs, which were delicious and an excellent way to start off the meal. The huevos rancheros are out of this world! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the green chiles gave a nice kick, and the guacamole provided a nice creamy texture to counteract the crunch and chew of the chiles and tortilla. We also got the hotcakes, which were moist and fluffy, with some fresh berries on top. They were a nice way to finish off the meal after the huevos rancheros. Our waitress was great, and provided wonderful service throughout the meal. 

Great place to go for brunch, and I can't wait to go back and try it again for dinner. This is now my go-to restaurant to take people visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"this is another fav of mine in AZ and i usually go here once a visit. it's owned by my other favorite restaurant in AZ, Postino, the LGO group (owns Postino, La Grande Orange Grocery & Radio Milano). the atmosphere is very laid back and hip at the same time - go with your family or go with friends. 

the shizz: 
the outdoor patio (spacious and heat lamps for the cold desert nights)
the arcadia salad (brussel sprouts, manchego cheese, crispy  
                                 pancetta and dried bluberries & cranberries in a 
                                 light vinaigrette)
the tuna burger (not your average tuna B. hearty but not fishy)
the fish tacos (i don't like mexican food and i like these, hola!)
organic chicken (tasty & with spaetzel, i.e. awesome noodles)

love this place - if you go, you'll love it too. 
word."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I highly recommend the swordfish tacos and deviled eggs. Will definitely visit again! Delish."}
{"text":"Totally great for date night. Helpful staff, delicious food, warm heaters on the patio. Absolute perfection. We started with the totally amazing  deviled eggs, split two different taco plates and didn't have any room for desert. If I lived in the area this would be a staple."}
{"text":"My advice would be to eat indoors, too many birds and falling debris on the patio.  A bit over priced for the quality and quantity but they do offer some unique options."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed out to write this review but here goes: This place has a good atmosphere. The staff is good and attentive. The food is great too, the short ribs are excellent and if you get the egg on top its heaven. BUT this was definitely the last time i go here. For over a year they have had the same horrible selection of beer. I mean - there isn't one drinkable beer on tap for me. Green Flash - are you kidding me? Id rather drink gasoline. And Duvel? Its like Stella if Stella was brewed inside a homeless person's underwear. The only time i ever remember having a good beer here was when they had Turbo Dog for about a week. That was 2 years ago. I have been going back ever since torturing myself. WHY CANT THIS PLACE GET 1 NORMAL BEER ON TAP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARENT IPA AND BITTER BEER ENTHUSIASTS?! Ill never know. Peace out Chelsea's!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Chelsea's Kitchen for months now and finally made my way over there last night. Wow. I officially became a member of the clean plate club. I had the vegetarian nut burger -- delish!  I had the key lime pie for dessert and I'd definitley have it again. Our server, Christina, was super friendly and helpful when we were trying to decide what to order. We were there early evening so it was a little quiet but the restaurant has a warm, homey vibe. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"As always the food and service at Chelsea's Kitchen were exceptional. They are masterful at combining flavor, atmosphere and service to make every meal I've had there a memorable one. 

My only complaint isn't necessarily with the restaurant as much as it is this new trend to make Kale the hip vegetable that everyone should eat. People it's used in floral arrangements and is a plate garnish at best. Kale is the most gas producing, fart creating vegetable in the world. Why on gods green earth would anyone want to eat this crap? Please stop putting it on our plates. Yes, you too Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast before our flight.  Delicious applewood bacon. Freshly squeezed juices. The grapefruit juice wasnt sour  and had lots of pulp.  The  granola was good but the yogurt fruit mix was only ok.the fruit cup was fresh, and the potatoes were really good.  Their tea came in a huge pot so I had plenty of tea."}
{"text":"A great, dog friendly patio with shade year round.  Staff is super friendly and food is awesome!  One of our top 3 places for mimosas and lunch!  Great place for small and large dogs as it is a nice, large space."}
{"text":"Had breakfast and dinner here while waiting for flights and was impressed with the service and the food.  Will take friends here for dinner and add it to my places to eat."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch- especially their bottomless mimosas! Sitting outside by the fire place is so relaxing and smell great too! 

I was slightly disappointed when our heater ran out of fuel/gas right as we sat down and the servers said they couldn't A) move it and replace it with one not being used in the corner (even though the heaters have wheels and the patio was basically empty) or B) put a new tank in it...I would think for Saturday brunch when you know the patio is going to be full within the hour, an establishment such as this one should have an extra tank (or two) should the heaters need new one. Just saying...

Overall, one of my top favorite restaurants in town. :)"}
{"text":"The butternut squash soup w creme fresh was amazing. Short rib tacos will not disappoint. They come w home made corn tortillas and more guacamole and pico de galleo than you will be able to eat. A small kale and grape salad w quinoa makes this a great dish. I can't believe I am at the airport, this food is way too good! I'd seriously drive to Sky Harbor Airport and eat here even if I wasn't traveling."}
{"text":"The Ahi burger was the best burger that I have ever had in my entire life. This place is divine. Expensive, but divine. You'll always have a top notch experience here."}
{"text":"I have been to Chelsea's more than 10 times, and I have yet to have anything less than an incredible experience. I love the staff, the menu, the ambiance.... and especially the patio. 

It's a fantastic lunch spot, if you are able, sit on the patio. Even if it is chilly out, they will sometimes have a fire going in their adorable fireplace. If not, they have space heaters.

If you are going for dinner, anywhere you sit is a good time. It is not a quiet place inside, but that isn't the vibe of Chelsea's. 

The bar is fun to sit at - an indoor/outdoor set up, the staff is friendly and the drink selection varies enough that you can get an incredible vintage bottle, or a $26 bottle to suit your budget.

The food is incredible! I have enjoyed everything from their taco plates to pan-fried chicken to seafood. It is all delicious, and the servings are generous.

For dessert the hubs and I always get the ice-cream sundae, where you can add your own toppings at the table. May sound silly, but it's something fun we do... and it's a bit of a tradition now.  If you haven't had the pleasure of going to Chelsea's, drop by if you are able. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Eating nachitos on the patio! Could there be anything better? Well, they could offer take out. Although, I did get take out once and it was a disaster because when I showed up they had no trace of my order. It seemed to have disappeared into thin air. They made it right and offered a cup of hot cocoa while I waited. Good, friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was impressed by the bistro-like atmosphere. I ordered the soup and salad meal, which was pretty filling even though I totally thought it wouldn't be. The ceaser salad was great, and the soup of the day (was kind of like a tortilla soup) was nice as well. My other friends ordered the arcadia salad and a chicken salad; they both enjoyed it. We also ordered the shrimp ceviche appetizer which was ok, even though I think it's ridiculous to pay 15 bucks for an appetizer. The same price for a salad is also a little insane but I guess if you have the money, why not? Seeing as how I'm a struggling college student, this place is not for me but might be cool for special occasions and the like.

The service was bad. Our waitress was not very friendly and never checked back in on us (2 bites, 2 minutes rule). We had another girl serve us the food and totally gave everyone each other's orders so we had to awkwardly do the switch-around-the-plates thing. We had to ask another guy to refill our drinks. It wasn't hardly busy, which was the odd thing..."}
{"text":"Love this place
I'm a regular!
Great food, good service & my fav part is free salted freshly baked chocolate cookies!!!
Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Chelsea's about 5 times now and the experience has always been great. The staff, from the valet to the hosts and wait staff are always friendly and knowledgable. The shrimp ceviche is fantastic. I've tried various taco platters, including the tuna, short rib, and rib-eye and all have been great. I think they have a fairly good mix of price and food quality/quantity. Definitely a place you want to go to if you're near the Biltmore or Fashion Square area."}
{"text":"It is pricey, I admit.  But I really like the ambiance and the white sangria.  When eating at Chelsea's Kitchen, it feels like you are eating in a vineyard or spa... or somewhere more remote than Phoenix.  It is tucked in a quiet street surrounded by tree's and grass.  I've been here twice; once sitting inside, once outside.  Both options are great because you can eat without staring out at a parking lot.  Beware when sitting outside that leaves can potentially fall in your food.  But that is the price of sitting outside and I cannot mind that much.  The food was enjoyable on both visits, although again, a little expensive.  Swordfish tacos were grilled perfectly and the homemade tortillas were delicious.  The Del Mar salad was refreshing.  Tasty shrimp and crab although I wish they used something other than iceberg lettuce.  I'm going to keep on going back because the whole restaurant experience is very pleasant.  If they lower the food pricing a little, or give a little more wow factor to warrant the price, then this place will be complete.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I went here when I landed on Phoenix and when I took off, amazing food! ! I was blown away having such great food and service at an airport. I had the vegetarian tacos both times and it was delicious, my dad had the cheeseburger and the French dip and he said it was the best he's had in many years, and they give you delicious complimentary cookies on your way out, highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a great experience I had at Chelsea's Kitchen!  We had to wait 15 minutes, even with a reservation, which would have irked me a little bit if the Cardinals game hadn't been on TV in the bar area. The atmosphere is very nice, with real fireplaces both in the dining room and out on their beautiful patio.  It has the feel of a casual, slightly upscale gathering place for couples, friends, and families alike. Once we were seated, our server couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. We shared a small LGO caesar salad, identical to the one served at LGO (as the name implies) and thus delicious! For entrees, we shared the swordfish tacos and the short ribs with the over-easy egg on top. The swordfish tacos are, as promised, the best fish tacos I've had in the Valley, filled with big pieces of grilled swordfish, a little cabbage and tomatoes, guacamole, a slightly sweet sauce, and a great salsa on the side. The short rib dish is another one of their specialties.  The short ribs were tender and served with a yummy red wine jus, over mashed potatoes and veggies. I'm not sure what the egg on top adds to the dish (other than calories and cholesterol), and I personally would do without it next time, but you gotta give them credit for pairing such ingredients and having the dish still be great. I'm glad we tried Chelsea's Kitchen, and I'll be back many more times for their great food at reasonable prices, all with friendly service and in a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Brunch! Huevos Rancheros were so good, I can hardly wait until my next trip back to AZ! Loved the decor--service was great and just loved our meal there."}
{"text":"Another LGO restaurant... and a pretty cool one. 

Great ambiance. Excellent patio out back.  Super cool giant lamps inside.  I like the design quite a bit. 

The comfort food is nice, though may be a bit overpriced.  A few of the menu items are exactly the same as you'd get at LGO for quite a bit more.  For that reason, If you are heading to Chelsea's... go with the \"Very Special\" section of the menu... no need to have the burgers here.  

The short ribs were phenomenal... the mashed potatoes were stellar. 
Also tried the Wood Fired Rotisserie Chicken.  

Though i went with a friend, i think this would be a pretty good date spot.  If that's whatcher into.  ;)"}
{"text":"great food, freaky good service, fantastic atmosphere.  Highly recommend sitting on patio, inside looked a bit loud.  Patio is fantastic, it is one of a few in Phoenix where it doesn't overlook a parking lot.  This is my new favorite place to take visitors."}
{"text":"Very good food and very fun atmosphere. I love the patio especially! Always a great ambiance. I have been here a few times, and I have never disliked anything I had!"}
{"text":"Overpriced hit-list of local favorite foods executed well.  This is for you if you don't want any surprises and just want to get some solid food with good service in nice surroundings.

4 stars minus 1 star for lack of creativity (yawn........)"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Chelsea's Kitchen. We sat outdoors on the patio for an early lunch under the shady trees. The servers were friendly and the food was everything people have said it would be. The short rib tacos are seriously delicious. And the kale salad is an experience in gourmet wonderment. We also had the swordfish tacos--delightful. We will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of six Friday night. We had the white sangria by the pitcher and it was delicious. We had guacamole and ceviche for appetizers and I loved the guacamole. I had the steak tacos and everything was flavorful. The homemade tortillas were great and it went well with guacamole, rice, beans and red sauce. My only compliant is that my steak was really fatty. I couldn't eat at least 1/4 of it. I didn't upgrade to the filet but expected more. I would probably give it a 3.5 because of it but everyone else's food was awesome. One person had ahi tuna tacos, one had short ribs tacos, two people had the veggie burger and one had the posole. The outdoor patio was enchanting and the service was great. I'd give it another chance down the road."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant and we're regulars. I see from the reviews that the high rating sometimes hurts the restaurant because new clients are somehow expecting to be blown away. The truth is that part of the high rating is consistency of quality. Take for example the Ribeye Steak Taco: it's clearly superior to anything you'll have elsewhere but also consistently so. That's the hallmark of a 4 to 5 star restaurant. It's not that this dish will make you break out into an \"alleluia song\" at your table, but you'll be very pleased ... every time."}
{"text":"We visited this delightful restaurant last night and were seated on the lovely patio.  The atmosphere was perfect and we were able to visit and carry on a conversation.  The service was attentive and professional.  We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful.  It was truly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I actually split everything and it was just enough.   For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I truly avoid Five-Star reviews. Perhaps for French Laundry. But I think five stars are appropriate given that I am sitting in an airport restaurant. 

Chelsea's Kitchen is pre-security so if you are flying through Sky Harbor you have to make an effort to get here. If you have the time this is worth enduring TSA  (ugh) a second time. And if you are flying in for business, eat dinner here before you go to your hotel. 

I had the short rib tacos. Very good. Also the Kale salad.  Never would have thought I would say I liked  Kale salad!

This is definitely food worth an extra trip through security."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Patio is great and the food is always amazing.  Service was a little slow but otherwise a great place to relax."}
{"text":"To me, there are few finer patios in all of Phoenix than the one at Chelsea's!! Great ambiance, good jams and most importantly, yummy food! 

So I end up at Chelsea's at least once every two weeks, so I'll highlight some of my favs... 

Wine list - yes, their selections are bit pricey, but there are some hard to find bottles on that menu that are simply wonderful!! The Argyle Brut Rose that is only available at Sportsmans etc for half the year is always on the list and it does not disappoint! Bella Glos, Seghesio, Summerland and the Sinister's Hand - what could be better! I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it! 

For food - love the shrimp ceviche, although I wish they would ix nay the olives as they are a weird addition, but I just eat around them! Love all the tacos, the prime rib is delish and the rotisserie chicken - TDF! Don't forget your sides too at only $3 each!! How can you skip the french fries (extra crispy, extra ketchup!), mac and cheese and usually the farmer's market veggies?? Fabulous (said like Oprah!)

My most recent discovery yesterday was off the brunch menu - the chilaquiles!! WOW!! It is described as Mexican lasagna, but it is so freaking good and so much more that that! I'm usually part of the clean half your plate club, but this dish I showed no mercy! Amazing! 

Andddd, my review of Chelsea's would not be complete without a full nod to my favorite - the brussel sprout salad (add chicken!)! Simple, light, delightful! It really is a gem! 

My only knocks are that they don't take reservations for groups of less than 6 or 8 (I can never remember) and it's annoying for the GF BF that their corn tortillas have flour in them (no Chilaquilies for him!). Other than that, it's a dream that I hope to see again very soon! 

Don't forget to grab a salty, chewy cookie on the way out!!"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen has the perfect combination of ambience, friendly service, and delicious food! Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who offered us a sampling of their salty chocolate chip cookies. Tempted, we told her we would try after lunch. The wait staff was very attentive and took our orders promptly. Drinks came out soon after ordering and we did not wait long for our lunches either- 

white sangria: light and crisp, refreshing with the fresh fruit
Arnold Palmer: the perfect balance of lemonade and ice tea. On a hot Phoenix day it's perfect!
Short rib tacos: a must! The short ribs are tender and not fatty! Plus the tortillas are warm and just the right consistency to stand up to this meaty taco filling! 
Seared ahi tuna- good if you are looking for something light.

And for dessert: red velvet cake! This slice with cream cheese frosting was mouth-watering! There is a misproportion of cream cheese to
Cake, and the cake is slightly densier than we prefer, but it was flavorful and addicting the more you ate. The under study on this plate, but deserves recognition is the buttercream gelato! Yum-o!!! 

At the end of our meal, our bellies were full and satisfied. I would definitely recommend this place to others, although warning: it is on the pricier side as other yelpers have mentioned! 

Lastly, before leaving the hostess remembered I wanted to try the cookies. She came to the door and opened the jar before I left! How sweet!!!! (cookie was alright not my favorite)"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant.  The food is amazingly delicious.  The patio is super cute.  Service is always top-notch.  My favorites are the brussels sprouts salad and fish tacos.  Yummy!! :)"}
{"text":"The reason this gets an EEK is because of bird poop. The outside seating area is lovely, however,  c'mon Chelsea's Kitchen, put up a protective netting of some kind so people aren't getting poisoned by the poo. I was just ready to dive into my eggs benedict when boom, a bird did it on my entree! Then on my shoulder. Then on my friend's entree. YIKES! And that's just what we saw. Who knows how many people are having coffee flavored with I don't even want to say."}
{"text":"Good Arcadia/Biltmore area place that's in a neat setting off 40th St. and Camelback - you know, behind the gas station. 

The place is very popular and packed at lunch and early for dinner. Come at 11:30 or 1 or expect to wait and have to valet if the lot is not full. Food has been consistently good, fresh and well portioned. Place is loud and casual but upscale. I described it to one person as the kind of healthy fashionable place where the wives, mistresses and exes of all the guys eating at Houston's are eating ( I pause here to make a cougar claw motion with my hand), when they are not clogging up Postino's parking lot or backing into my f*cking car at La Grande Orange. They even have some similar menu items and do upscale \"American\" grill food like salads, burgers, pasta and the other usual suspects with a couple of surprises thrown in. 

The nice thing about the kind of generic menu is that there is something on it for every taste and dietary restriction no matter how fussy. I'll clarify, I don't use \"generic\" in the pejorative sense, I'm just saying they have all the usual stuff of a place of this type. Lots of loose action in the house here."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their Sashimi salad and the Carnitas w/ red sauce tacos. Can't wait to get back there again!"}
{"text":"Really great menu and generally great food. the fish tacos, fresh guacamole, and yummy prickly pear margs. Used to love their brussel sprout salad but the last two that I've gotten were not up to par and hit my stomach like lead; one had practically  poorly chopped brussel sprouts in it and the other had way too much oil on it. But everything else seems to be fairly consistent.  Would like to give that salad one more chance. I miss it."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions. Never disappoints.  Consistently excellent food. Great atmosphere.  Service always shines. Patio is a great spot."}
{"text":"Such a gem!! I love this place...the ambience is awesome. The patio is perfect at night. The food never disappoints, I always leave feeling totally satisfied. The drinks are always great and the service is Amazing!"}
{"text":"An oldie but goodie and the best patio in the colder months. Brussels sprouts salad, don't miss it and the nachos are Amazing and naughty and perfect"}
{"text":"How much do I love this place? 

First of all, it's one of a burgeoning number of places in the up and coming Arcadia area (which is great because I live close to there!) So, the location is perfect.

Second, you MUST have their ceviche! I love it so much that I often go there just to eat it and have a few drinks. It's SOAKED in lime juice and I salivate as I talk about it right now! It really is fantastic.

Equally as good (well, almost) are their Chicken Nachitos which are, believe me, a meal unto themselves (unless you're sharing... and I suggest you don't because they're so good.)

The only drawback at all is that it gets kind of loud in there. The acoustics aren't good when there's a crowd (and there always is.) 

Oh, and one more drawback is the parking is inadequate. Unless you're ok with valet (and I personally feel lost without my car keys with me at all times), you should try and go early or late. 

But, don't let these two things stop you. It's one of the best places in the Valley for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"Meh. Your BMW driving cliental doesn't impress me. Here is the deal, when I go out to eat I expect to be treated like a guest, not a potential tip. I think this is how it is supposed to be, am I right? 

Either way, my fiancee had just graduated Pharmacy school and was owed a dinner from her wonderful father in law to-be and she chose Chelsea's Kitchen. When we were seated, a server immediately came and took our drink order, which was nice... After that another person came by with the drinks, and then finally our server. Our server was a late 20' something that looked less than thrilled to see our water drinking selves. 

Anyways, ordered the Guacamole: $10 

not that it was bad or anything, but when we ran out of chips it took five minutes for the server to get to our table and an additional five mins to get the chips. Not super busy either... 

After this it was more of the same. I got the short ribs, which were supposed to be a specialty item. Now they were not bad, but I have had much and made much better. And they seemed a little dry. 

My dad and brother got tacos that were good, but they ran out of tortillas and it took 10 minutes to get new ones.

The lady got fried chicken and it was a little dry,with grilled broccoli which was not received well by the Pharmacist. Anyways, my point is this....The server didn't see us as a phat tip and it showed via her lack of service. Over all food was ok, but the server ruined it."}
{"text":"Always a great visit at Chelsea's! Guac/Salsa a favorite, followed by their ever popular cheeseburger - with the best, crisp fries (ask for extra ketchup and some ranch). Ended our visit with BOTH the Key Lime Pie (YUM!), and heavenly Red Velvet cake - super rich, and great cream cheese balance. Excellent wine selection. Always a can't miss meal, and Dani our server was TOP NOTCH - be sure to ask for her. Keep it up, Chelsea's - you continue to make us smile."}
{"text":"First of all, $16-$19 for tacos I have to assemble myself?  The kitchen only slaps stuff on a plate and the rest is up to you.  The tuna tasted fishy and the pork was flavorless.  The only thing that saves this place from getting one star rating is the corn tortillas.  Also, only 4 beers on tap?  The best is that they offer valet parking.  You could give them your car and watch them drive it 5 feet to park it in one of the spots in front of the door.  Or, you could suck it up and walk another 10 feet and park it yourself.  

I really want to like this place, but just don't get all the high ratings.  Maybe anything tastes good when it is 115 degrees out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at,the tough part is it's always incredibly crowded but if you're willing to be patient you'll never get a bad meal love love this place"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot. Unlimited mimosas, great french press coffee, delicious hot cakes and eggs benedict. Nom nom."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Simple as that.  Combine that with attentive staff and good drinks and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Wow. Awesome food, and awesome ambiance - particularly the patio! Apparently a lot of people complain about the birds? Well, we got lucky, because our server, Ashley, was a bird whisperer. Not sure how she did it, but she somehow learned to talk to the birds, and get them to move on command. Good thing, because apparently plenty of people have complained that Chelsea's hasn't done enough to take care of the bird issue. Who would've thought that an awesome patio, under a huge tree, would have birds around it?! Personally, I think one of the charms of eating outdoors is to get to hear the sounds of nature. But for those who are scared of flora and fauna, and yet want to sit outside, well, I'd recommend requesting the bird whisperer Ashley - not only is she super nice and super awesome, but she's also got a super power! Even Mowgli would be impressed. Oh, and get the fries - obvi. I could eat those fries all day."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful. Every single thing I've ever tasted here has been superb. They are happy to prepare beef and ahi rare or medium rare (and the menu encourages you to do so).  Their beef is tender and flavorful. Their mashed potatoes are blissfully light and creamy. Their house French fries are uniformly crispy and pack a hint of spicy kick. Their taco platters let you assemble your own tacos on soft warm white corn tortillas. Even their caesar salad is particularly good. 

As for drinks, I highly recommend the basil gimlet, Goodnight Emily, and their iced tea. One of these days I need to try their lemonade. 

The service is friendly and attentive. Both indoor and outdoor seating are pleasant, though the natural canopy of tree branches on the patio can sometimes result in full sun. I bring a hat just in case. 

Chelsea's Kitchen is absolutely on my favorites list."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast, sooooo good!:) I had the eggs benedict, which I found to be really delicious. Service was great too and I enjoyed the patio! Will definitely be back to try their dinner menu sometime."}
{"text":"We visited Chelsea's this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The service was excellent the food was delicious and we had no issues with the dogs that attended. The staff was really good about making sure each dog had its own drinking bowl and behaved well. I am so glad to know we can continue to enjoy this wonderful setting. Thanks Chelsea's for addressing this concern."}
{"text":"If you can do a late lunch/early dinner, you will leave MUCH happier.  Service has always been great for me.  Parking can be tight.  Lines can be long. 

Short Rib Tacos.  Did i mention the Short rib Tacos?  period.  Huge plate and so so good.  Howie Burger is solid.  Nachos are solid.  

If you can sit out on the patio, get that.  

I haven't had the breakfast, but i've had lunch /dinner 5+ times."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party with 20 people. The staff was wonderful about having such a large group. I ordered the Vegetarian Tacos and they were delicious. The serving size was very large so I was able to have left overs the next day. I would highly recommend visiting Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Delish!  I've been here a few times and my favorite dish I've had was huge tasty scallops with polenta and mushrooms!  Divine!  

Amazing ice tea.  Gorgeous restaurant.  Smells terrific inside!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously slow, just to get seated on a day that isn't very busy.  Don't eat here if you have a plane to catch."}
{"text":"Airport dining sure has come a long way.    Stopped here for a Bloody Mary upon arrival and then for a Bloody and breakfast upon departure 

Bloodies were very tasty (bartender indicates they make their own mix)

OJ was fresh squeezed and delicious

We had  \"The Commuter\" for breakfast ( a tasty breakfast sandwich that I recommend with Turkey and Avocado)

Everything was reasonably priced with good sized portions.   Definitely a solid choice for the  Phoenix airport!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my family had a horrible experience yesterday at brunch.  None of the food tasted good. The tortilla soup was not hot or tasty. There was barely any amount in the bowl, as well. They forgot to order the cornbread, so that never arrived. The burger kept sliding out of the bun.  The steak was tough, undercook and had to be recooked. I have eaten here before many times and it was great, but after yesterday, I will never return.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Chelsea's for years and I have witnessed their ups and downs with service and food. It seems that you can never have a great experience here with either of those areas. Either the service is shockingly poor or the food dissapoints. They have some great tasting food on their menu but if you come back often for that item you will be dissapointed. One particular item that was a favorite was their cheeseburger. My friend and I nicknamed it the \"O\" burger primarily because we always said \"OMG\" after one bite. Well they have completely ruined that burger because they changed everything about it. Whoever is back in the kitchen making these changes needs to realize when NOT to mess with a good thing. Fix your other menu items that are lacking. But if you are looking for a cool restaurant with nice patio and vibrant social scene, I'd still recommend going to Chelsea's. Just don't be surprised if your burger falls apart and you get a side of major attitude from the servers."}
{"text":"The Brussel sprout salad and green chili hamburger are amazing and large enough to share. Also, the patio is lovely. One of our favorite spots in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning the first visit. Second visit to pick people up closed at 8 vs 9 as stated on Yelp."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why people love this place. I have been here so many times..and for only one reason. My friends know where I live and they always suggest we go there. It's the same story everytime: \"I haven't seen you in so long! We should do dinner. Let's see, whats near you? Oh I know, Chelsea's kitchen! I love that place!\" Every time I search the menu, order something I don't really want because nothing sounds that appealing, pay too much for something I don't want, then go home bitter and vow I will never go back there again. I don't know what it is that I dislike this place. The food is never horrible, just not interesting or delicious. The staff is nice enough but I do feel they think I should feel privileged to be served by them."}
{"text":"When you go to Chelsea's kitchen, don't hold back. My favorite dish is the Hong Kong fish (hey, that rhymes!).  I believe it was halibut, and it was cooked perfectly. The sauce was amazing. I also splurged and split a side of the baked mac and cheese with a friend. I can't turn down mac and cheese, and in this case, I'm so glad I didn't.  We were in the mood for white wine, and our waiter recommended the sangria - awesome! All in all, I think Chelsea's is great - the food, the atmosphere, the service. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is a very late review but I wanted to share our wonderful experience in this restaurant.  We dined in a couple of father's day ago with our toddler who has many food allergies.  I called ahead to ask if there is any food option for him.  They had me talk to the chef and he told us that they can cook something for him.  When we got there, the chef even went out to talk to us about what he can make for my son and came to check on him when the food was served.  For a mother who has to make sure that my son can enjoy eating with us \"safely\" (with his life threatening food allergies)...this was an exceptionally great experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I only come into town every few months but every time I'm here chelseas kitchen is a must! I have yet to have anything but an amazing experience! This past time I went was for weekend brunch and sat on the beautiful patio and had preslee as our server! Can you say great customer service!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for anyone looking to have amazing food and a upbeat atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a very long time and it did not disappoint. The patio is so comfortable! The service was great. Food was good. I'll be back again. 

I do suggest that you get there right when they open at 11am if you are able to eat an early lunch. I can see how parking might get tricky."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is the place to go for impecable,  non pushy service.  Let say that eat out almost nightly and last night at Chelsea's was one of the best experiences I have had.  My evening started at the bar having a cocktail waiting for my and the bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive.  When my girlfriend arrived I checked in with hostess, who by the way was smiling ear to ear.  She stated that she had a table available either on the patio or in the inside, we choose the patio. From this moment on everything was almost to good to be true. Our server was attentive but not invasive, the food, don't get me started! 
I will say this... If u have not tried chelsea's Kitchen, then you have not experience amazing food and great service.

This foodie is now hooked on Chelsea's and I will be there  every week for my fish tacos, and red velvet cake! 

Thanks for the great time!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese: Absolutely amazing and big enough for a small dinner. 

Tuna sashimi salad: I found the dressing to have too much ginger. But the fish was sliced thinly and didn't have that obnoxious skin that some serve it with.

Short-ribs: Good. But a little lacking in pizzazz. 

Sundae: underwhelming. Just a little bland and not really anything to marvel over.

Chocolate nouveau cake. Wonderful. Tastes like a flourless chocolate cake or a really creamy/fudgey brownie.

Overall, I liked the presentation and the atmosphere. The service was great and everyone seemed very knowledgeable and professional. I just thought everything could use some more spice/flavor. It was too expensive for what it was, and I will probably not go back unless someone else chooses it."}
{"text":"I was coming home from college for the weekend and my dad asked where I wanted to go when he picked me up from the airport and I told him to surprise me. He definitely picked a good place! I got the short rib tacos and my dad got the ahi tacos. Both were cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious, and the kale salad that came on the side didn't disappoint! My short rib tacos were definitely better between the two though! I'm a little bummed that I didn't order the side of mac n cheese, but I will definitely be back to try it. I also didn't have room for a whole dessert but I ate one of the free co okies on the way out and it was so good that I wish I had grabbed another one before I left."}
{"text":"I appreciate the indoor-outdoor appeal of Chelsea's.  It's a little hard to hear if you sit inside, but that just means you can turn your attention to the patio. 

I've never loved anything I've ordered, but I have been more than once, so you know the food is still pretty good. Albeit spendy. 

Chelsea's is one of those places where you can take your parents and your dad will feel comfortable because he recognizes things on the menu, or you can meet your girlfriends for happy hour and everyone will be at peace in their cute shoes sipping cocktails.

Let this place help you make the most of our glorious spring!"}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about the place. Most of the appetizers are small portions and expensive. Service is okay! I had burger which it was very delicious."}
{"text":"Got more than the normal good food and prompt service at Chelsea's Kitchen this morning at Terminal 4 at Phoenix Skyharbor Airport.  

I typically stop here for a meal before going through security to catch my flight out.

This morning I inadvertently left my cell in the hired car.  Khristopher, my waiter at Chelsea's Kitchen, let me borrow his cell phone for 15 to 20 minutes so that I could make some calls to track down the driver and ask him to turn around and bring my phone back to the airport and meet up with him.   I recovered my phone and prevented what would have been a very difficult trip (I know, what did we ever do without these things).

Summary:  Above and beyond service --- thanks Khristopher."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice, I know that's not a lot, but both times I've been more than satisfied when leaving. We will return as much as possible!

I wrote a review a year ago stating their french dip was the best I've had in Arizona, and that still holds true. Their fries, also, are seriously incredible.

NOW I can say they have the best swordfish tacos I've ever had ANYWHERE! They also have amazing guacamole, and I HATE AVOCADOS. I can't even tell you how much I despise that green, weird tasting vegetable. But, at Chelsea's Kitchen? I almost ate the entire bowl myself. I also ate their pico de gallo, and my major dislike for tomatoes is much higher than it is with avocado. Chelsea's had me eating foods I never thought I would, ever. 

My husband ordered their Dixie Pan-Fried Chicken, and he loved that. I tried a bite and thought it was perfect! He said \"it's almost as good as my grandma's, and that's saying a lot!\" 

It was very busy, and being a Saturday night I wasn't surprised, but the service was still very friendly and quick! 

I just love this place, it's so delicious and I'm excited to try more and more!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, menu has much to be desired, the service is hit or miss...but for some reason this high potential hot spot never seems to add up to a great top tier restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I must be in LGO Hospitality's target demographic because I kept ending up in their establishments and loving them!  Chelsea's Kitchen is super cozy with an open kitchen and a fire going in the corner of the restaurant.  I splurged on the the $28 lobster tacos and they were divine.  A pan-roasted Australian lobster tail with all the taco fixin's.  I really think the atmosphere adapts to whichever purpose you're there for - either a casual meal with friends or an intimate, romantic meal."}
{"text":"Awesome! The deviled eggs, Mac-N-cheese, short rib tacos, and St. Bernardus beer were all amazing and delecious! My whole party enjoyed everything they got as well! Wonderful atmosphere and great servers! Thanks."}
{"text":"I had such a lovely experience here from beginning to end. My 2 children ate free and loved their fish meal. We got delicious burgers and lemonade. And to finish it off, a free and oh so yummy chocolate chip cookie. You must go here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place it is a great place for dinner and have been several times. The steak is always spot on and the white sangria is amazing. I would recommend on a date night."}
{"text":"Get to the airport early and relax with a nice drink and some tasty food at Chelsea's Kitchen @ Sky Harbor Airport. 

Good beer selection.

Tasty appetizers.

Wait staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I wish I lived closer!  I'd eat here all the time.  We got the crab cakes, green chili cheeseburger and short rib hash.  So yummy I'll be dreaming of this place when I'm home in California.  The prickly pear margarita is a nice stiff drink, like I like it.  Sit in the patio.  It's lovely."}
{"text":"Nice room.  Once I got past that, I was treated to a circus of many unavailable menu items, uninspired food (that was available), larcenous prices, and a triple crown of clumsy, thoughtless, inattentive service.  What a waste of a beautiful space.  If the kitchen can figure out how to deliver value for money, & the servers can figure out how to make any moment a customer service moment, they might have something.  But right now it's just pretentious nonsense.  Lovely interior, though."}
{"text":"Great place!  Monica at the bar was extremely attentive, Nicole was terrific at the table everything was spot on!  Had the Guac and chips which were great, then a spinach salad and short rib with the egg.  The short rib could have used a touch more sauce but all and all everything was very good.  My friend had the chicken and also thought it was the shit.  The restaurant was cosy with the fireplace and well dressed milf's prancing around.  Just how I remembered it =)  party on!"}
{"text":"It was the service, not the food that was terrible.     

I ate at the bar, as I frequently do.    The server could not have been less interested in me.     Asked for my drink order as she was sprinting away...took my meal order as she was sprinting away again....neglected to give me a set-up (napkin, knife, fork) so I had to filch one from a nearby table...failed to notice my empty glass.

And gave me the wrong order.    As she later explained,  she simply didn't listen.     

The \"right\" order eventually came... but not the way I had ordered it.     

OK, they did comp me on the meal.     And she did apologize....sort of.     But I had to wonder if the mix-up was due to the fact that I was the lone female diner in a steady stream of males.      So, ladies, forewarned  is forarmed."}
{"text":"This place is gross and overpriced. We sat inside and there were flies flying all over our food."}
{"text":"This was my 5th visit...the first for the rest of my group. Everyone loved it!

Excellent service and the food was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I Brought my family here for my birthday brunch. They're from out of town. We had to wait for such a long time it was ridiculous. I was so mad but the hostess  was so nice and apologetic that I did not complain. The food was great except for my nieces chicken finger or fish sticks but they were gladly to get her something else. As we were leaving the hostess caught me at the door and apologized again and thanked us for being patient and gave us two bags of yummy cookies they give out as you leave. It was nice of them."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Chelsea's Kitchen.  They have valet parking available, but there is lots of self parking in the same parking lot.  It's quicker just to self park.

We sat indoors both times.  When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is popular, but I prefer indoor seating.  It feels comfortable sitting inside.  The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table.

We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice.

For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  I've had the short rib tacos both times I've been here, and it's outstanding.  The braised meat is tender, and served with corn tortillas, beans, guac, tomatoes, etc.  All of our meals were good, but the short rib tacos were the best.

For dessert we shared the red velvet cake.  It comes with a small scoop of vanila ice cream.  It could have come with a little more ice cream.  The cake was moist and not too sweet.  It was gone in a minute.  

The bill for four including drinks and tip was $120.

On the way out, they have chocolate chip cookes with sea salt sprinkled on top.  A nice touch.  My son grabbed two cookies, and finished them on the drive back to the hotel.  Great dinner!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Its great for brunch. The seafood is superb (love the tacos). Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the dessert."}
{"text":"What a great ambience . I just love the food . I Am an Indian and not a big fan of American food . But this place made me fall in love with their burger and fries. I just loved the quality of the food and I could taste the freshness. I had a tuna burger and fries and it was awesome. I would love to give it a 5 start  but the reason I hav given four because the place was bit more noisy than a typical restaurant when I visited and it was kind of irritating for me . Other than that my family and I had a great time visiting to this place."}
{"text":"Went there 6 months ago for the first time and had not so great service but decided to try again and LOVED it! I love the food, love the cucumber press, and the outdoor patio is to die for!! One of my favorites while visiting AZ!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE LOVE Chelsea's' Kitchen and so I took company from out of town here last night to really showcase the great food that Arcadia's all about! It had been approximately a year since I had been to Chelsea's Kitchen. I hate to say it, but my experience was badddd:
*Server was not welcoming, actually quite rude. Did not welcome us - just went straight into \"what would you like to drink.\" We asked for a side of salsa - had to ask 3 times. Did not check on us throughout meal. It was bad.
*Food:
-expensive for what you get - $100 for 3 people. That was for 2 of the cheaper glasses of wines, 1 appetizer, 3 entrees. Maybe I wouldn't mind paying if it was worth the $100.
-largely the SAME menu that you can get at either La Grande Orange or Ingos for a FRACTION of the price (I wish I could underline FRACTION).
-Menu really hadn't changed in a years time!? I was excited to try something new here, and I didn't really have that option.
-Chips and guacamole for the appetizer. Guacamole and salsa were tasty! Chips were way over salted, a bit greasy. Come on, they're just chips.....
-I got the Ahi Tuna burger: came on a plain hamburger bun that I could have bought a Fry's. The Ahi was good. My side was French fries - the came out soggy, stuck together, and greasy. $15 wasted.
-Sea salt chocolate chip cookies upon exit? Yep none - they were out.
*Valet - awesome experience, those guys were working so hard.

Final thought: Thank goodness La Grande Orange and Ingo's are still affordable and amazing quality. I will be going back there, not Chelsea's Kitchen! Good luck."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible.  Got the filet which was amazing - but the prime rib we sampled was the best I've ever had.  The veggies were awesome, service superb, and ambiance was 5 star."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here as a great place to relax before a flight or people watch! Comfy seats! Great food! Try the shushimi tuna salad! Kale salad rocks too! Had their wild mushroom soup today! Totally rocked my world!"}
{"text":"Beautiful backyard/outdoor seating, contemporary decor, attentive services, delicious red velvet cake, sweet freshly squeezed oj,  if only the food was more impressive, I'd give at least a four-star...

It was my first try, and ordered the Egg Benedict, friends ordered the French omelet and the Daydreamer, presentations on all dishes were great, colorful and a sense of healthy. However, they were very salty, I mean really salty. Especially the canadian bacon in my egg benedict, I only had one piece, and that was swallowed with all the spinach, egg and muffin, plus the oj... I don't know how could it be that salty, but it was. I had to stop at the 2nd piece, I don't wanna spend the rest of my day with bottles of water... the French omelet according to my friend was good, but the Daydreamer, was a bit on salty side as well... I guess we just ordered the wrong food....

If you have allergies, I don't recommend you have the backyard seating., at least don't do it on a windy day. It's a bit windy yesterday, and while the 2 hours we were outside, every time the wind blew, the little flowers on the tree went flying everywhere, our hair, our table, and food! My friend was literally sneezing non-stop.. so just a little note to consider your own health."}
{"text":"YUM!!!  My friend and I stopped in for lunch because this looked like a comfortable place, and each of us was leaving from separate terminals, so it was convenient being right in the middle.  Delicious food at reasonable prices, whether or not it's an airport restaurant.  My friend had an onion soup, which surprised her with a kick from red pepper flakes.  I enjoyed a delicious bowl of chicken tortilla soup and although it needed a pinch of salt, it was a great consistency and very good with fresh avocado chunks on top.  We shared an appetizer of some mouth-watering deviled eggs with bacon sprinkled on top... comfort food to the max!  The restaurant is lovely and very cozy; the service is very good; and the prices are a good value for airport dining.  If this restaurant had a location in Sacramento, I'd be a regular!

NOTE:  If you don't want to sit down and dine, the restaurant has a take-away counter located to the right of their restaurant entrance.  Not sure whether they sell a limited or full menu, but I'd bet it's a great option if you're short on time and want something to munch on that's satisfying to the palate."}
{"text":"Great place, we loved it! We were stopping by from CA and I recommend this to anyone who is in the area. We will most definetly stop on the way back."}
{"text":"This place has been thoroughly reviewed by many folks. What else can I say, but this place has some good food. I went with the spare rib tacos and came away happy and full. You receive a generous portion of meat and then the salsa, guac etc. The tortillas are great.

The service was very good. My wife has gone there many times in the past and said the service was the one area of concern.

One thing that i find weird is the entrance is right next to where you pick up the food. That is a disaster waiting to happen! 

A great meal for a very reasonable price. A definite winner!"}
{"text":"We have used Yelp to find fun, unique & yummy places to eat our way thru Phoenix during our Spring Training  trip and this place did not disappoint! The service was wonderful, the deviled eggs are delicious and my French Dip with seasoned fries hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I went to this place when it first opened and I thought it was overrated. But I recently went back to meet a business client and it has changed! The service was great, the food was excellent - now I know why it is always packed now! 

Had the Crispy Chicken and spinach salad which was really good! Really fresh and the dressing was an amazing mix of flavors. We also had split an order of fries. Which were real good. My client had the Howie Burger and she liked it too! She told me that they have a new chef and has done some great things. Just lunch was enough to talk about. Cannot wait for Dinner! Free Valet rocks!"}
{"text":"Usually one equates airport food with dysentery. Not so at Chelsea's. 

Rib tacos were righteous. Kale salad was surprisingly edible. Usually kale is ass but these guys did it justice so don't be afraid. 

Best part was when I rolled my weary butt to the bar for an nice scotch Brittany immediately asked if I wanted a double!!!  Damn right I wanted a double. Mad props girl!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I took the family and visiting family to Chelsea's Kitchen.  I like the ambiance, its hip enough for the younger people in our family and relaxed enough for the older.  We wanted back patio seating but there was a wait for it and we were hungry.  Last time I was here I got the Ahi Tuna buger, which was really good.  This time I got the green chille burger, which turned out to be mediocre.  There was something missing about it.  The flavors were supposed to dance in my mouth...rather they laid there doing nothing.  Which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  If I could do 4.5 I probably would because everybody else in our party of 6 really enjoyed their meals.  

The other people in our group got:

- Short rib with mashed potatoes
- Mac and cheese for our daughter
- Short rib tacos
- Surf and Turf tacos

I shall go back soon and try another dish and hopefully I can upgrade my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Got the short rib taco. It was delicious !
Pricey but worth it.
Omg........and the kale salad was amazing too. I dont like salads or vegetables in general but it was so good I was staring at other people's plates...."}
{"text":"Had a great healthy breakfast of house-made granola......and a side of sangria.  Both were perfect."}
{"text":"Got the Chelsea burger and the Howie burger, food was OK, the fries were overloaded with seasoning, thought the seasoning was excessive but they treated good. Got a diet coke, $2.25 for a can of soda, wow. Not impressed with the place at all, server was nice but will not be returning."}
{"text":"Every weekend I like to do a nice long leisurely lunch... This weekend my friend Allison and I choose Chelsea's Kitchen after a past wonderful brunch experience.  Our second visit today did not disappoint.

We sat on the beautiful back patio shaded by trees and had a great lunch.  I enjoyed the very tender and generous portion of the short rib tacos.  Great service, atmosphere, and lovely relaxed atmosphere, we will be making this a tradition!"}
{"text":"Not much to choose from on the menu, but you can't blame a restaurant for that, considering what they had was decent.  We had a melon salad, which was weird, just some large melon squares with almonds.  We also had the cerviche which was good.  I had the short ribs tacos which were quite good, and my drinks were great as well.  I wasn't sure if it deserved four stars, but what they had was pretty good, the place was nice looking, and the waiter was great.  All in all, it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"OMG!  Love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Love it.  First, you MUST have the Chicken Nachitos!  The Roasted Chicken Spinach Salad is awesome. This is what I order most of the time because I think it balances the Chicken Nachito pig out that prefaces the main course.  However, the Fish Tacos are great too!  I love hanging out on the Patio.  It's so lovely and the weather is getting nice now to sit outside.  Perfection.  The staff is great and the service is fast but not rushed.  I wish the owners would open up a  place in South Phoenix -- we are \"hungry\" for  non-chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"The Del mar salad should have been called the Sub-Par salad.  Hardly any lettuce and very little shrimp and crab.  Sad, it use to be so perfect and a large portion.  Not sure what happened but it was the smallest salad I've seen in awhile."}
{"text":"Just had our first visit tonight for a friend's retirement party. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! More people showed up than was expected but heaven forbid we spill over into the outdoor dining area that was 90% empty. Don't care if the food is good, wouldn't know because the staff was not accommodating to our large party so my family of seven left. Even the guest of honor was extremely upset when they couldn't handle a small box of flowers on a table. Management and staff were only focused on keeping the table open for other guest. Shame on them...we will never go back here again."}
{"text":"It's hard giving someone a 5 star review becuase there is always something they can improve on... So, my only complaint is that you cannot call ahead and order food to go. Sooo annoying. You have to actually valet your car, sit at the bar, order and wait...by yourself, and chances are you will order a drink becuase you look weird if you don't. Probably bc the place is so packed that they don't want to be just a food joint... they want you to drink. They weed out the cheaper customers and get the more bang for their buck customers this way. 

This place gets 5 stars for the patio, the staff, the bbq seasoned french fries, the burgers, the tacos, pretty much any dish... yummy, yummy, yummy. It's tasty American food with a rustic/modern ambiance. It's great for a date the fire places, twinkle lights, and the comfy seating make it a warm place to enjoy a good dinner with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience, food, friendly staff. We went for brunch on Sunday before heading back to Chicago. Patio seating was perfect. Warm, sunny for mid November, virds chirping, wood fire burning. The white sangria was ok but tacos were delicious. Given 5 stars for the ambience and experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely best restaurant in Phoenix.   Came here for lunch on a Saturday.   Enjoyed a pitcher of their white sangria.   A must have.   I ordered the Howie burger.   It was good.   My friend got the wood fired rotisserie chicken which was incredible.   I would recommend getting that instead."}
{"text":"My wife treated me to Chelsea's Kitchen for my birthday. I was a little apprehensious when I saw the prices. Most spendy places that I've been to have small portions. I don't like to gorge myself, but I like to get a good value when going out to eat. I ordered the braised short rib tacos, which were around $16. The meat was in a big pile and it came with little tortillas, along with some guac, salsa, rice and beans. I made enough tacos to finish all of the tortillas, and was quite full. Then I noticed that I had only used about half of the meat. At about the same time the waitress arrived at the table asking if I wanted more tortillas and a to-go box. I ended up bringing the leftovers to work and it was enough for a full meal, so it ended up being a pretty good value. Everybody was very friendly and helpful. I probably won't go there on a regular basis, because of the prices, but I definitely will be back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas for $12! The white sangria is also really good. Its a little pricey but its quality food and a nice atmosphere. The patio area is super cute and is a great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal at Chelsea's Kitchen! Fresh ingredients, enticing menu and we didn't even know that kids eat free everyday off the kids menu from 3-6pm! It was a nice surprise! Staff was super friendly & the patio was great! Try the organic rotisserie chicken or the short rib tacos, you won't be disappointed! Grab a free cookie on your way out! A sweet way to end a fabulous meal!"}
{"text":"I was traveling through PHX and stoped to get breakfast. I had the breakfast burito which was quite good until I came to the last quarter and encountered a 2\" sharp bone in my food.
I addressed the wiat staff and the manager who really didn't do anything.....
Be careful what you eat!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I guess- didn't suck.  Large \"Gourmet\" taco menu. Serves Texas Pete in the bottle for hot sauce. Server was nice.  Valet parking is kooky- cars are five feet away. Get out your wallet, this place is proud of their food.  Don't feel like I need to go back."}
{"text":"Came here recently for Mothers Day and absolutely loved it! The decor and atmosphere was absolutely amazing- classy but not too over the top where you're uncomfortable. The open kitchen was also a huge plus!

Now on to the food which is really the main draw! I had the prime rib and it was one of the best I've had. Perfectly smoked, thick cut and the homemade au jus was fantastic! I tried my friends smoked chicken which was great as well- packed with flavor from the outside smoke rotisserie, it was juicy and cooked just right.

The drinks were also delicious! We ordered pitchers of sangria for the table and they were made to perfection (tip: go for the red over the white sangria). 

Overall, Chelsea's Kitchen is one of the best restaurants I've dined at in Phoenix. Definitely recommend it! Oh, don't forget to take a fresh salted caramel cookie on your way out."}
{"text":"My salad was ok. The rotisserie chicken add on was amazing though. I started off with the ceviche which was delicious and I'm giving this place 5 stars because of our service. He really stood out. He was attentive yet not obtrusive. He anticipated our needs and was around anytime we needed anything. He was funny and passionate. I forgot I didn't enjoy my salad as much as I had hoped because I was in awe at the level of service we were receiving: Servers are a dime a dozen but this guy was a professional. I forget his name but it was a Tuesday night Late so he must have been a closing server. Will definitely be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Food is very good. The service is unpredictable. Their timing isn't the best. I know they want to turn the tables over but at least let your diners finish the food they order. Last few times I've been the entrees were brought to the table within seconds (literally) of the appetizer."}
{"text":"Who would think to go to the airport for a really nice meal? My son and I both had the French dip and are very pleased. My husband is enjoying the prime rib and my daughter is enjoying the kid's chicken tacos. Such a pleasant surprise. Great service, an oasis in the mayhem of Sky Harbor. As Chelsea's is before security checkpoint I would come here for a great meal even if I lived in town. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went in on a spur of the moment before my flight to San Francisco because it had a nice look to it. Hadn't eaten since the day before and was famished and didn't know when my next meal would come. The prices seemed kind of high, but it's an airport joint, so I figured I'd give it a shot, so I ordered a green chili burger. Took awhile to come out and when I took the first bite, the burger was warm, not hot, with a lot of pink inside. I should have sent it back but I was in a hurry and just ate it. For the price it was nothing exceptional and I left thinking I should have just ate at the Burger King and saved money (and I'm no fan of BK). 

Man, I should have ate at Burger King because at 3:30 a.m. I woke with my guts twisting. I haven't been that ill from food poisoning in many a year. Lasted all the next day and put a huge damper on my trip."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, great kale and quinoa salad with broasted chicken, and also a killer green chili burger.  Sat by the entrance and there was a pedestal cookie jar full of salted chocolate chip cookies.  The waitress told us to help ourselves.  Food was excellent  and portions large.  Only downside is that it is a bit pricey; lunch for two with only one coffee and no alcohol was $47 including tip."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome and the food was unbelievable. It's simple but the chips and salsa and guacamole was killer."}
{"text":"Wow! I love this place! The atmosphere is so inviting. Sitting on the patio feels like hanging out at a friend's house rather than in a restaurant. The service is excellent. Our server was pleasant, engaging, helpful, there when we needed him and not when we didnt. Now for the food...I could have eaten the deviled egg appetizer for my meal it was so fantastic! The short rib tacos were so tender and flavorful I couldn't stop eating. Even the kale salad was good and I don't even like kale. We left full and happy and planning our next trip back. Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"Ahi tacos were perfect but I needed one more tortilla. Rice and beans were great too, and it all fit together masterfully. I will definitely be back. This was one of the best meals I've eaten in a long time. On the downside, we sat outside directly under one of the cooling mist makers and ended up soaked."}
{"text":"Such a good Saturday brunch spot. Our server, Kim, was the best - so nice and great conversation. We got the deviled eggs with bacon as an app, very very very good. I got a burger with the home-made fried, it was very tasty, better than I expected. The short rib tacos were amazing; I would only suggest adding a white shredded cheese, the home-made corn taco shells were such a nice touch and they tasted very fresh. The kitchen under-cooked a separate burger on the table, but they offered the fix it and they were concerned about the mistake (he ordered it well-done and it came out medium; I don't see this as a mistake as a burger should never be cooked well).

We got the unlimited mimosas - very quick to refill. 

The manager is very observant and walked around throughout our time in the resturant checking on tables - I liked this, it's nice to see people care. 

DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE RED VELVET CAKE!!!!!"}
{"text":"For such a nice looking airport restaurant, I was quite disappointed. Considering I am in Arizona I understand southwest cuisine, but their Bloody Mary tasted as if it was made with salsa juice. Also, the French fries were COVERED in a chili powder seasoning. Limited menu with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and one of the best patios in town make this a favorite for \"upscale' casual dining.  Everything is good, but nothing knocks my socks off.  I'd probably steer clear of the steak--it isn't bad, mind you, but the price isn't justified.  Try the steak tacos, instead.  It is a neighborhood joint for me, so I estimate I've been there 50 times."}
{"text":"Decided last minute to try and get in with a party of 8 to Chelseas after horrible service at a nearby restaurant.  After calling several nearby restaurants, Chelseas had the best service and was most accomodating.  Emily was our server and she was excellent.  Food and wine was good too!!"}
{"text":"My entree was so so, but all of the others praised their dishes.  Priced a bit high, but overall very good, great service, comfortable and easy. Definitely enjoyed and am thankful that we had a great night!"}
{"text":"Always love going to Chelsea's kitchen, but stay away from those cookies on your way out the door!! There has been SO much sea salt on them the past few times we've been there. I think they could actually induce vomiting!"}
{"text":"well, it is about time i find some time to update my review. Back in January, we went back, table for 3 for lunch. and it was just great. Great hostess, awesome waitress (forgot her name, but she made the place more beautiful, the food taste better, and our experience overall a success.) , the food was good.... we had a fantastic time. Everyone has bad days, I guess i went initially on a \"off day\", very happy we gave another chance. Kudos, good job."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was great. The only negative was the dry bun on the burger."}
{"text":"Casual, fun vibe. Great for groups. I used to come here regularly for lunch or after work with coworkers and always ordered their ahi tuna burger - the absolute best I've ever had anywhere - and red velvet cake. Friendly staff, great service. This place gets PACKED for lunch, so try to get here earlier."}
{"text":"YEAH! Best place in the airport!"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant for a night out with friends.  The indoor and patio seating options makes it inviting for everyone from the date night to the celebration party.  The pitchers of sangria were tasty and definitely encouraged people to indulge.  The guac and salsa app was awesome with a simply prepared guac, fire roasted salsa, and fresh tortilla chips.  

I had the fried chicken dinner and was less than enthused.  The chicken pieces were only partially breaded and fried.  After a few sangrias, I decided to enjoy my guilty pleasure... and there was barely any fried chicken skin!  Sadness.  It should have been called a breaded chicken because it was definitely not a fried chicken!  Ok... soapbox aside... my friend had the rotisserie prime rib and it was jam packed with flavor without the heavy salt crust.  Definitely something different to try."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great. Some of the best service we have experienced at a restaurant in a long while. Went on a Friday night - so nice to have complimentary valet - and they somehow got us in very quickly, right next to the fireplace on the patio on a beautiful night. Tonight we both tried the Howie Burger - very unique, unlike any other burger I've had. The best part was those chicken nacho things - it was huge, and the guacamole on top was great!  The menu has so many unique items we've never heard of - can't wait to go back and try something new!  Chelsea's kitchen offers the perfect combination of service, great food, and unique character."}
{"text":"Just tried Chelsea's because of a recommendation. It was awesome!
(Sometimes that adjective is overused but in this case I believe it is a fitting description!) 
I loved patio (even though we sat inside) I thought the patio was the 2 tables out front but turns out there is a large patio in back that is very quaint and comfortable. 
The kitchen is open and very busy. The service was prompt and servers were very attentive.
Now to the food !!! We ordered the devilled eggs as an app. They were delicious. My husband had the surf and turf taco platter. (Ribeye steak and lobster) so yummy!!
I order the chicken nachitos . The plate was huge and I had a hard time making a dent in them. Very tastey! 
We also had white sangria. Perfect!
Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. First off they have a parking lot, but it is VALET PARKING. Can't just drive in an park it is all roped off. Ordered rotiserie pork tacos, yuk hunks of   fattty greasy  meat..  I would have thought sheredded.
Uncomfortalbe  high stool chairs to sit on with a table that every time you touched it, it leaned way over.  Could not be fixed - we tried putting a knife under the table"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, patio was full so we waited at the bar for 10 minutes.  Once sat, I contemplated over the menu as there were many items I wanted to try.  I've been before, but it was so long ago when the place first opened so I feel like it was trying the place for the first time.  I ordered the braised pork tacos and they were very filling.  I was going to take a to-go box but there were like 10 birds in the trees above I was paranoid one slipped some shit into my plate while I looked away.  All that being said, lovely patio, busy with local diners, and the food is good with healthy options."}
{"text":"We came here for our 10th Anniversary. We sat outside by the fireplace with the twinkle lights overhead. The ambiance was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The food was tasty, the service was prompt and the night was perfect!"}
{"text":"Oh mama. If Barry White had a love child with Charlie Tuna, it would somehow result in their swordfish tacos. Best. Seafood. Tacos. Ever. Swordfish is so hard to do well...too often overcooked. Nice on tap beer selection. Lovely space. Do yourself a favor and just go already."}
{"text":"My husband and i have an addiction to this place!  We love the patio and the food is always great!  The burger is one of the best in town, the nachos are awesome and I would eat the brussel sprout salad everyday!  The servers are always very friendly and welcoming!  We take all of our out of town guests there for a great, relaxed dinner!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch while visting Phoenix for day.  Overall decor and patio are great.  Friendly staff.  Brunch menu is somewhat limited but know that you can order off the lunch menu where most of the items are avaialble.   

Chilaquiles was excellent with good spice and lots of flavor.  Veggie burger was a bit messy but taste and texture were excellent.  Fries good but not great."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen was a nice find (Thanks Yelp). Had the shrimp ceviche. Not the best ceviche I have ever had, but, solid.  The melon soup was sweet with just enough spice to make it interesting. The brussel sprout salad was outstanding. Service was good. This place fills up early."}
{"text":"Really fresh orange juice. Delicious food - Howie burger and rotisserie chicken are wonderful. Indoor ambience is good but little noisy. Recommend reservations for outside seating.
They say parking is limited and recommend valet. However the valet is nothing but half of their own parking lot that they block for valet."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely one of my favorites!! I have loved every item I have ever ordered off the menu! The drinks are delicious! A perfect place to celebrate an event with close friends and family. Plus, you get a chocolate chip cookie with sea salt sprinkled on top on your way out! Yum!"}
{"text":"Well, we gave Chelsea's at the airport another shot for breakfast.  Once again breakfast was a disappointing experience. Marginal food and very slow service.  Odd given how much we enjoy Chelsea's primary location for lunch and dinner. Note to management: most breakfast diners at airports are in a hurry.  Hit the accelerator, maybe add staff and convey a sense of urgency. Also, if you're going to charge $14 for a simple breakfast item, it has better be good.  Maybe lunches and dinners are better but again, diners at airports aren't there to linger. Step up the speed...."}
{"text":"My parents just got a condo in Scottsdale, and they took me to Chelsea's Kitchen. It was a Saturday night so we were told it would be an hour wait! We went to the back patio and ordered nachos, amazing! We decided to sit outside, such a good choice. I ordered the beef taco platter, unbelievable. I also had 2 margaritas that honestly were among the best I have ever had. I snuck a bite of the fried chicken my Dad had ordered and really enjoyed it.

Do yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious.  They have a great weekend brunch/mimosas at a reasonable price.  Their short rib tacos are one of my favorite restaurant items in Phoenix.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"I came here with my folks after they picked me up from the airport for the beginning of my chilaxin vacation over the holidays.

Brussell Sprout salad is tastey and a good way to start the meal.  Nothing jumped out at me on the menu so I went with the burger.  Was pretty good nothing special.  Decor is nice.  Outside patio and bar is really well done. 

Maybe I'm down on the spot because they took away the off track betting?

Not sure if it's because I left AZ so long ago but the main reason I was disappointed is because of the price.  Better quality food in SF seems cheaper than Chelsea's kitchen.  Not sure why it is so expensive AZ.  

Also, why the hell is there valet in Arizona?  There is a huge parking lot contigous with the restaraunt.  I know the valet parking is free but seriously.  I just had to get that off my chest."}
{"text":"Marginal food, terrible service.  Six of us jammed around a table for four. FIFTEEN minutes after being seated, we are asked if we need anything!  Asked to start with water for the table, and eventually she returns with five waters, and she is surprised we need six. TEN minutes later, a different waitress arrives, and announces she did not know it was her table, but wanted us to know it was not her fault. Could not get the drink we wanted from the bar, because it was no longer on the bar menu ( they had served it for years).  Food--- wrong entree was served! Kale and quinoa salad was a mountain of kale, very little quinoa in sight.  The smoked trout dip and saltines appetizer was delicious.  Overall, not what I expect from this restaurant, and will not return."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to short-rib heaven!

I was debating between the short-ribs and fried chicken - short-ribs won, but my mom ordered the fried chicken, so I did get to try it. Hands down, the food was amazing!

I would have given them 5 stars, but -1* for our nice, but over eager waitress who cleared my plate and utensils before I could start picking at my daughter's mac & cheese, who also cleared my friend's vodka martini before it was finished (bad move, sister) and who promptly took our friend's napkin, while he was still holding on to it.

Stay for the food, but the waitstaff needs to be educated on how to wait tables."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! We came in for Brunch on Sunday and were told it would only be a 25min wait for 2. We waited inside and were in awe of the way they were running the kitchen and getting food out! So organized and precise and clean. The dishes were also being watched to see how long a plate would sit on the counter without being delivered to guests. It was amazing to see that they cared so much. Next, we were seated, looked over the menu, everything sounded amazing. Our waitress came by and we asked her what she recommended, she recommended some plates but said, \"if you let me know what you are in the mood for, I can help guide you down the menu.\" Such great customer service! We went with the Chelsea Bloody Mary and prickly Pear as drinks started with the deviled eggs and the Cornbread. SO GOOD. As entrees, we went with the Short Rib tacos, and the Santa Fe Eggs. No dish disappointed. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Had my first visit at Chelsea's Kitchen on Sunday evening.  The ambiance in the evening is wonderful!  We ate outside and with the heaters, the blazing fireplace and the lighting in the trees it was perfect.  The food was excellent both in portion size and taste as well as presentation.  Our server was there when we needed her, but she didn't hang around too much or bother us, which I always appreciate.  Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Had an unenjoyable dinner at Chelsea's tonight. My daughter wanted her salmon cooked so that it was not raw and what they delivered was a very dry, tasteless piece of salmon with no lemon or sauce to try and cover up how bad the salmon tasted. We love good salmon. This was not edible. When we politely said so, the server asked if we had ordered it well... an implication that maybe we were the cause of this nasty entree. The four, small fingerling potatoes had way too much olive oil and my daughter was sitting there in a starving and sad frame of mind. She tried to eat the grilled broccoli and the red pepper flakes were too abundant so she'd grab water to get it down. I honestly think they'd run out of the grilled broccoli because I saw no evidence of such. My plate did not have the saffron yogurt sauce on the broccoli as promised. Where is the quality control? You'd think the server would notice that one plate has it on the broccoli and one doesn't. No such luck. They did bring her a different meal after we complained. I had the pork; it was fine but no real wow factor. Our server never filled my empty water glass; had to look for her and ask for some. She had no real concern in how dissatisfied we were with the meal or whether we were satisfied when my daughter received a different entree. Final surprise- when my daughter's entree came, there was a ton of sliced broccoli stalk that had definitely been grilled. So, I guess I was wrong on that broccoli. $50.00 later I wish I had cooked at home."}
{"text":"Great gluten-free options! 

The restaurant ambiance was lovely and cute. Service was good and drink options were extensive. I ordered the short rib tacos and really enjoyed them. My friends ordered burgers and enjoyed them as well. Portion sizes were quite generous and all of the food was cooked well."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is not a mom and pop shop who desperately needs our word of mouth to ensure their survival. They are in their own (lovely) stand-alone building complete with valet service for their private lot. The area is commercial and the local business crowd obviously loves this place, and with good reason.

Yelp was the driver for our lunch decision. We got there in the midst of the lunch rush and found the restaurant to be absolutely packed and the din pretty darn loud. I wondered for a moment if the noise itself wasn't going to be conducive to a group lunch but the throng of the crowd told me that the food was going to be worth it. I encouraged us to stay.

The wait wasn't crazy, 15-25 minutes for inside and immediate seating available on the front covered patio for those brave enough to deal with the heat. There is back patio seating with umbrellas but the hostess said it was simply too hot that day for it. Our group opted for front outside seating and we ultimately found that the ceiling fans and misters did do a good enough of a job to make it reasonably comfortable despite some long pants and long sleeved shirts in our group.

Wait staff was friendly, on it and helpful with recommendations and knowledge about the food. Portions are BIG - you'll be hard pressed to order an appetizer or salad for yourself and then go on to eat your sandwich and fries / other. Well you could, but most of us mortals would be sorry shortly thereafter.

Two of us split the brussel sprout salad - it was awesome! Bacon, manchengo cheese and almonds in a light vinegarette. Perfect for a hot day and frankly, just delish. I ended up going with a side for my main dish due to the portion sizes but I could not have made a better choice. If you are a mac n cheese lover, all I can say is welcome to paradise...this could and should, be your last meal. A beautiful bowl of perfectly done pasta with the creamiest, richest white cheese sauce imagineable. I don't know how I'm going to ever look at mac n cheese again...Chelsea...you've ruined me (thank you!)

Others in our party were nearly as enthusiastic as I about their dishes. The swordfish tacos were considered a complete win and the salmon special was cited to be \"excellent\". Clean plates said it all at the end - everyone left happy.

Tip - throw caution to the wind (so long as you have an alternate driver) and get the Shakin Lemonade. The Grey Goose Vokda and healthy sprig of rosemary will make any lunch meeting more fun...and two will put you into orbit. :)"}
{"text":"Rude staff... Way over prized. Spent $60 on two drinks and two servings...."}
{"text":"used to go here all the time. food and service was usually good and now a terrible experience. black fly/bug in one cesar salad and MAGGOTS in another cesar salad. not kidding. waiter freaked out and manager was mortified. will never return despite prior good service and food as this unfortunate disturbing experience is just too concerning."}
{"text":"Just had another fantastic dinner with friends at Chelsea's last night.  Had the short ribs with the brussels sprout salad.  Amazing and incredible - everything cooked to perfection.  And of course the service was fantastic too.  Consistently a great place to go!  Thanks much!"}
{"text":"Normally good food but just paid $7 for a ceased salad to go, tiny, maybe 4 bites - not fair"}
{"text":"First time i had been here over the weekend.  Took a business guest for dinner because i had several friends tell me about how good it was.  Must have been a bad night because there were several mess-ups.  Just a note to the restaurant on these things:

I ordered lemonade to drink.   This was the oddest tasting lemonade I have ever tasted.  I asked for something different and said it had an odd taste and I asked what was in it.  Server said fresh lemons and then egg whites.  EGG WHITES?  Why are egg whites in my lemonade?  What if someone had an egg allergy?  You wouldn't really expect egg in your lemonade???  Anyhow, i would stear clear of this concoction.

Ordered guacamole and chips.  That was slow coming and then the waitress comes out and turns out it was delivered to the wrong table near us and those people had been waiting to tell someone that it wasn't theirs.  So we finally got that order.  Upon eating it, got a big hard chunk in my mouth which was the 'stem' of an avocado..

Later, as we we waiting for our main course of filets, yet another server tried to give us food that was for someone else's table.  Is there a problem with this??

When the steaks arrived I will say they were the better part of the meal.  Cooked well and tender.  Luckily something came out good because next..

Was the dessert.  I ordered the chocolate flourless cake and it was fairly bland to me.  Maybe after eating the hearty steak my taste buds were off but i really didn't like this at all.  It was extremely heavy.  I only had a few bites.

Since i didn't really like that dessert i noticed that they had a big stack of chocolate chip cookies by the door.  They looked great.  However - they are NOT GREAT!!  Horribly salty and now i was leaving without anything to drink!!

Well, i guess someone likes this place because i know they are always busy but i don't think it was of my taste and i was embarrassed that i took my business guest here."}
{"text":"The company is licensed by Chelsea's kitchen and uses their recipes. They are slow to get the bill to busy travelers - so don't stop here if you need to get out within 30 minutes. 
The steel cut oatmeal is made in a large batch and sits waiting people to order it and use it- although the time it takes to get service they could make steel cut oatmeal to go . 
White and dark chicken are overcooked and dry - been here several times. 
Breakfast burrito is likewise partially made ahead of time and that is why sometimes they have quality that is not as good as freshly made. 
Overall better than most airport places - but it is clearly not the original Chelseas kitchen - 
the cookie at the end is still one of the best things around"}
{"text":"They made me believe Kale could be served as a salad. They have the perfect ending to the meal, with a chocolate cookie sprinkled with salt - sweet and salty to end the meal. They have valet parking, because it is a busy place.
Here are some things to try:
The burgers: made with fresh ground beef, you can feel safe in ordering a medium-rare burger (as they are meant to be cooked). They have versions of this depending on your taste, or your sense of adventure. 
The tacos: wife likes fish, I like short ribs. Wife likes lettuce wraps, I like the tortillas.
Brunch on Sunday: amazing eggs, and brunch dishes - and if you like mimosa - well, they seem to not run out of those.
HAVE THE SUNDAY: really - it is made the proper way, you won't be sorry because you ate the kale salad - its all about balance."}
{"text":"As new Phoenicians, Chelsea's Kitchen came highly recommended for brunch. It did not disappoint. While the food is incredible, the patio along the canal is the star of the show. The Short Rib Hash and the Huevos Rancheros were both top notch, although the homemade guac and tortilla that accompanied the Huevos made this the table favorite. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and we'll be back. Wonderful service, menu and food! Key Lime Pie, oh my."}
{"text":"We stopped here awaiting our flight,  mostly due to the good looking bar area, but we were amazed at the quality of the dining area,  the food, and the service. 

My Del Mar salad was full of crab and shrimp with avocado. My wife's chicken soup and brussel sprout salad were equally tasty!  Add the great service and we had one of our best meals in Phoenix  in the airport!! And reasonably priced!!  Crazy!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Every bite delicious. My husband had the Howie Burger which was an all time favorite and had the kale-quinoa salad with chicken and it was amazing!  Beautiful setting comfortable and cozy.  We will plan our cross country trips around a meal there.  Don't forget the deviled eggs. :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! My salmon was perfectly cooked. We shared a kale salad. It is enough for two. If your hankering for a hamburger this is the place. My Daughter enjoyed it tremendously. Huge hamburger!!!
Its a bit pricey. So maybe a once a month visit. Come early and carpool! The parking lot is super tiny."}
{"text":"I came here with three friends, and we should have made a reservation! I think we waited about 40 minutes because we wanted a table outside. It was worth the wait. The place has a great atmosphere and a large patio in the back.  The back patio has a lot of trees, nice lighting, candles, and a fireplace. 

This place is a little on the expensive side, but all of us enjoyed our food and it is worth it for the ambiance. I had the Howie Burger, which is a gourmet burger with gruyere (which is a cheese), caramelized onions, and Dijon sauce. It was delicious! The hostess and server were both friendly. The server even asked us if we wanted separate checks, which was refreshing and made things easy! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The 1 star is not for the food. The food is fantastic! I actually had Chelsea's yesterday while visiting Phoenix for business. I decided to have it again at the sky harbor airport today and was expecting the same great service along with the great food. Unfortunately, the hostess was horrible.  Her attitude was so horrible I decided to simply walk away. I asked a common question, 'can I sit next to the rail?' as she was setting me in a middle table. She already didn't have a pleasant demeanor about her. I must've added to her negative demeanor when I asked that question; she looked over to where I was pointing at and hesitated, then said 'No, that area is closed' and walks away...then, I look over at her and she looks at me with this disgusted look....that's when I decided to simply walk out. It wasn't si much that they didn't have that section open - I completely understand that. It was mainly her actions that made me feel very uncomfortable. Should this restaurant have a reputation management, I'd like to describe this person for the mere purpose to consider retraining her on her customer service; she had a brade hairstyle, was African American, and slender. It's unfortunate that I couldn't enjoy their awesome kale salad - especially since they don't have a Chelsea's in southern California.

About 3 hours later: I'm updating my review due to a Chelsea's representative acknowledging my experience so promptly. I've always had a enjoyable experience, and I don't want one employee to taint your great service."}
{"text":"This was our second evening at Chelsea's Kitchen.  It was outstanding!  The tuna tar-tar was amazing.  We had the fish tacos and the scallops special - all perfect portions and cooked perfectly.  The staff at Chelsea's Kitchen is so pleasant - it makes the evening great.  We finished off the evening with the red velvet cake - what a treat.  Kate, the assistant manager, was gracious and remembered us from the last time we were there over 2 months ago.  Overall - an outstanding evening - great food - great friends - great staff.  Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen!!"}
{"text":"So it was my second time eating here, but lunch instead of breakfast.

The place itself is comfortable to sit in, but the music can get loud, and this is annoying when your flying out earlier.

The food in general is good. Nothing special, but will do the trick if you're hungry. My only beef with this place is the service. Servers are great, but the orders are s...l...oo..www. More than what I expect to be honest."}
{"text":"A great place for a business lunch or happy hour.  The patio is perfect and the must try is the swordfish tacos."}
{"text":"While flying can be a pain in the butt, Chelsea's Kitchen eases that pain. Service is orderly and all employees are polite and caring. The burgers are delectable and the prime rib is definitely cooked to order, tender and rare. Pistachio gelato is awesome and a great way to cleanse your palette after a hearty meal. Wide selection of IPA's and wines make your trip all that much sweeter. If you plan to fly out of Sky Harbor head to Chelsea's before!"}
{"text":"Worst Service.  The hostess looks like she has no clue what is going on. Then tries to sit you in the worst section of the place next a huge family.  I walked out."}
{"text":"Just awful they think we are lucky they are waiting on us!!! They hate people from scottsdale they think we think we  are special in scottsdale so they hate us!!!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. This place the food is always good. The service sometimes is ok and other days ok. We will come always we love love coming here. See you soon!!"}
{"text":"The ahi fish tacos are outstanding-one of the best fish tacos I've ever experienced!!

The service is exemplary!  Ed, my server, was wonderfully attentive, interesting, and conversational-a true pro!

Next time I'm at the Phoenix airport, I'll be back ~"}
{"text":"Love this place! I was waiting for my flight and had some time to burn and needed to eat dinner, and since I'd never been to Chelsea's Kitchen I decided to give it  a shot. 

Big props to the creators for really thinking about what consumers might want. My phone was in dire need of charging, and it was one of the FIRST things I asked the hostess when I walked up. She said all bar seats had outlets, and since I was by my lonesome I really didn't need or desire a table. It drastically cut down my wait. But they really thought about the typical airport traveller when they put that feature in- so cool!

Phone plugged in and merrily charging away, I sat down and was fairly quickly given a menu. For my drink I got the French Sailor- delicious, fresh and refreshing and light, just the way I like my drinks. For my meal I got the fried chicken sandwich (what can I say? I was going on vacation. Calories don't count!). Both were fantastic. The sandwich came out promptly, and their fries are shoestring fries- my favorite. It does have a bit of kick- I think there is sriracha in that aioli, so beware. 

Now as a side note- it was a bit difficult to get my bartender's attention. I attribute it largely to being busy, really. Once I did he was prompt, friendly, and very helpful. I noticed it got MUCH better once the large majority of the patrons around me took off for their flights. So take note that if it gets busy you might have to wait a bit. Thankfully I wasn't in a rush. 

It does make me want to eventually check out the 'real' Chelsea's Kitchen. This place was pretty cool and I'd make sure to stop by next time I'm in T4 at Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting a friend and decided to try a new place. We went for a late lunch and just needed something small so we got the short rib tacos and shared. It was the perfect size for both of us and absolutely delicious. Lovely atmosphere and the server was very attentive. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had read some reviews and had a hankering for some real, solid food and a cocktail. I ordered the French dip w a side of horseradish and a refreshing Long Island Iced Tea. I'm on a mini vacay, so why not? I was so very pleased, with every element of my visit to this establishment. The service was excellent! The French dip was exquisite. Medium rare, tender and lean. The adult beverage was made with fresh ingredients and a generous pour to boot! Well worth the price, $36. Bravo!"}
{"text":"First impression. Not great. I love all the restaurants in this area, never been to Chelsea's kitchen so we thought \"why not?\" It was my boyfriends birthday lunch. The waitress was RUDE! We sent back cornbread because it was cold and her comeback was \"well it was sitting there for awhile\" she could've just taken it back and sent her apologies, not a big deal. Got my food and it was cold, I didn't bother sending it back because I didn't want to wait. And I'm sorry, 12$ for chips?! Rip off. And she took 20 minutes to get our check and run it. 
Overall, it's over priced. Food was cold and the waitress clearly had a bad day and took out on us. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING patio!  the ambiance and the food is to DIE for!
the brussel sprout salad and sword fish tacos....YUMMMM!"}
{"text":"I had the seabass and the significant other had the prime rib.  Prime rib was better.  No Lawry's but it was s on par with Black Angus but more expensive.  Nacho was good (thanks yelpers) but I've had better in LA.  I think it would prob be more worthwhile to come for happy hour if I can ever get there on time. Why does happy hour end so early in this city?!!!"}
{"text":"Simple but fantastic organic menu in a quiet, warm, friendly restaurant. Reasonably priced too. And the wine was amazing! Try any of the Pinots, my fave. The place was packed last night! Highly recommend this one!

Why not 5 stars... more family orientated, less chic, but if that is fine with you, then assume a 5. Great for a date too by the way."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic patio--so cute and plenty of shade from the hot sun. It's possible that it was partially a result of my excitement over finally being on a short vacation, but this was one of the best lunches I've had in a while. We started with the  smoked trout dip, which I honestly wasn't expecting to like very much. Wow was I wrong! It was so good that when we ran out of crackers, my husband (embarrassingly enough) finished it with a spoon...I got a burger and my husband got a tuna burger. Both were great! Here's a tip though: even though the kale salad is great, if your dining companion orders the fries you will be jealous. Not quite sure what the seasoning was, but how can you not like seasoned fries?"}
{"text":"Best short rib tacos so far!! The fried chicken is also really good for dinner. The tacos are definitely a must here. Great patio area too."}
{"text":"This was the best brunch I've had in a while and I'm very picky. I had a lot of questions and my server ethan answered them all fantastically. Would recommend this place to everyone! Especially with service that damn good."}
{"text":"All I have to say is ..... Mimosa Saturdays mmmkay!!! Oh and the bloody marys with the yummy little pickled green beans in them. Definitely winning!"}
{"text":"I have gone here in the past at happy hour. First time for lunch and food.
Took some clients. Was OK. Service was good. Had the crispy chicken tacos. Chicken was overcooked and there was very little of it. Add to that the higher than average prices that they charge and I have to give it two stars. There are many other better place in the immediate area to get a more enjoyable and better value lunch."}
{"text":"The white sangria is great. No idea what's in it. Ha-ha. The short rib tacos are amazing. Kale salad that comes with it amazing. The guacamole was perfect.  Great portions. Everything was great. Then again, it wasn't busy. 3 pm on a Thursday. You forget you're at the airport."}
{"text":"I would have given one star, but the food is delicious. However, when you go for brunch and order huevos rancheros wouldn't you expect beans and rice? Yes of course you would, because that combination is delicious and awesome. But not at Chelsea's kitchen - you now get a smaller portion of huevos rancheros with a side of... wait for it.... strawberries. SERIOUSLY??? NOT DELICIOUS! When we asked the server about the substitution she informed us the beans and rice have strictly been forebode from the menu. GROSS - how can you honestly serve huevos rancheros and tell me there is not one single bean or grain of rice in your kitchen?? We used to come here at least once a month for brunch, but we won't come back until the beans and rice have returned and we can enjoy huevos rancheros as it should be. Chelsea's kitchen - getting rid of this delicious side was an egregious mistake. Fix it."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner, wonderful service incredible cucumber cocktails! Love this place. Every Time we come to phoenix we make this a stop! Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife has COPD...immediately walking in we were hit with charcoal hickory smoke...we went to to the outside patio to get passed the smokey air...it did not help.
Over-iced and small size house margarita 10 bucks? Pa-lease.
I like shrimp ceviche...if you've ever been to Mexico...you know real ceviche. ..what was sent out to us was not it...immediately sent back. 

The burger was good and so were the steak tacos...

I go 3 out of 5 on food...I'm not cheap but simple fare for lunch seemed pricey. We all get the 10 buck burger...but 15 to 20? Dude, it's a burger.
Parking is strange...most of it is valet so you almost have to valet...i lucked out catching someone leaving...like Costco.
Would my wife and I go back...no."}
{"text":"Great patio and friendly staff. I recommmd the Ahi Tuna taco platter."}
{"text":"happy hour.  What a great addition to LGO family.  Awesome burgers and the cookies!!!  The Sunday brunch is spectacular .............."}
{"text":"Parking lot doesn't have many spots, you may be forced to valet or find a spot far away. Service was quick, servers were nice, and the food was good. Maybe a tad overpriced, but good. The room had good lighting but was a tad bit too loud. They have free cookies on your way out. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. Everything from food to service is excellent. This is the destination spot for a nice date night out and I can say that I would chose this place over any other any night of the week. The food is phenomenal, we've tried several different items and I can honestly say that my mouth still waters at the thought of the nachos. The service is perfect for the two of us having a night out. It's just enough to be friendly and attentive but distant enough for us to feel comfortable and have a nice time. I'm convinced that it can do no wrong. I wish I could remember our servers name and if I could I would love to give her credit for making our experience so great. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"We finally made here for the first time last weekend.  This place is the bomb!  Great food, great service, and great booze.  I had the green chili cheeseburger.  It was so good.  They put fresh roasted green chili and it was cooked to perfection.  BF had the french dip.  It was huge...definitely enough for two.  He loved it.  The fries they served with the sandwiches were really, really good.  They were crisp and had some sort of BBQ seasoning.  Last but not least... the white sangria.  OMG, best sangria ever.  Not too sweet and fruity.  You could actually taste the wine.  It was perfect.  Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Read about the key lime pie here and since my traveling counterpart was having a birthday next week we stopped here for lunch. We split the French dip sandwich, and it was amazing. Perfectly prepared and the French roll wasn't hard or too soft- and the meat was packed with flavor and tender. We ordered the key lime pie and my man who is a Keylime professional- said it was the best key lime pie he had ever had! My only complaint is the prices are a little steep- but to be fair you can taste the quality, but even the soft drinks were a bit expensive in my opinion. Great stop- We highly recommend it- and would love to return!"}
{"text":"Love Chelsea's Kitchen :) I had the Del Mar Salad, comprised of shrimp, lobster, olive, avocado, lettuce, and a salsa, with a champagne dressing, and a side of their Russian dressing. It was the perfect portion and delicious, and tasted very fresh. If I wasn't on a diet, I would have gotten what my friend got, the Chelsea's Kitchen Cheeseburger, which looked sooooo good! I'm going to keep going back there because everything on the menu sounded wonderfully delicious.

The service was awesome too. We were seated immediately, drinks a second later, and it seemed our meal was in front of us within minutes. All the servers were polite and efficient :) The interior design makes it a great place for anything too. My friend and I were just there for a casual lunch, but I can see going there with a large group, or on a date.

I'm certainly going to be a Chelsea's Kitchen patron from now on!"}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is nice especially the patio with fireplace, but service is average. I have eaten here a few times trying to give 2nd chances, but this place falls short. I would eat here again if family wanted to go, but I would bring low expectations regarding the service."}
{"text":"Pricey, but hey...it's an airport.  Burgers are solid and taste how fresh ground beef should taste like.  I have never had a burger over or undercooked.  My favorite has to be the green chile burger, but then again, I am a sucker for green chile when I am in the SW.  Service is good and I have never had to wait for a beer or water refill.  Beer selection is good for the small number of taps and there are always a couple of Arizona beers on tap."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Miami, when a friend recommended this cute spot. From the moment I walked in, the vibe was very cool. Laid back, but comfortable with dark rich wood hues, bug comfy booths and overall a very clean, fresh look. I originally wanted to go for brunch, but we ended up catching a late dinner and we weren't disappointed! First and foremost, I have to give a shout out to the brussel sprout salad! I happen to love these little green veggies and have never seen them served as a salad before, so Kudos to CK. We also ordered the chicken nachos, which were ok, but because nachos are always a big pile, the cheese melted very quickly and after a few minutes weren't too edible. We then got the chef's favorite taco platter, I believe it was short rib, which was nice and flavorful, my only drawback was that the tortillas are corn, not flour which I know are more authentic, but I still prefer flour! All in all, a great experience and I will definitely recommend to anyone heading that way."}
{"text":"Airport food is bad and as a frequent traveler I just accept it. But the Del Mar Salad at Chelsea's Kitchen is the best airport food I have had."}
{"text":"If you like Beans and Rice with your: 1) fish tacos, 2) huevos rancheros, 3) just about anything that requires black beans and rice to go with it.....warning when going to Chelsea's......black beans and rice have been stricken from the menu!!!

That's right....fish tacos now come with...gulp...a side of kale salad!! And when you want to pull some black beans and rice in with a bite of your huevos rancheros, think again!!! It's fruit!!! Huevos Rancheros....fruit?? ummm, ok

In addition,  skimped down portions of their famous ceviche!! I have been going to Chelsea's for years and years....something is up here, not sure what. 

Anyone else experiencing the same? Could it be new competition from North down the way??

Next to go....the complimentary salt chocolate chip cookies at the door??

Booooooh......"}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: upon walking into this location from the chilly weather outside, I was pleasantly surprised. There were big lamps, a fireplace, and just an overall cozy, warm atmosphere and the place was packed! The patio was set up with string lights and gas heating posts. While waiting briefly for a table, it was amazing watching the kitchen crew hustle in such a small space and organize the rapid delivery of plates. I was happy to recognize the same expediter from Ingo's. No food sat in the window for very long and didn't leave without total quality control! We were sat within 15 minutes, which wasn't long considering we didn't have a reservation and it was Friday night and Christmas week. This place has a very chic, upscale vibe with many families and couples and it was abuzz with conversations, but not too loud. 

FOOD: I was looking forward to the Dixie Pan Fried chicken, as fried chicken is my favorite comfort food. It came as 2 very moist and juicy chicken breasts with a crispy coating that was cooked perfectly, not too dark brown like at other places. They came on a generous portion of mashed potatoes and they went very well together. My only wish would be a jus or gravy to add to the mash, but this dish was amazing as is. I also very much enjoyed the daily vegetable of roasted heirloom carrots in what I tasted was ginger and honey. My dining companion had a burger with their homemade fries. It was very big and tasty using high quality beef like at Ingo's. I give high marks for restaurants that serve a middle size of wine between a glass and a bottle (10-12 oz. carafes). Everything was priced very reasonably for what you get. 

SERVICE: our server (and all the other servers we watched go back and forth) was always moving quickly and efficiently to every table. There is a real energy to this place that has a lot to do with the people that work here. I was impressed when a manager checked in with us to chat about our experience. You can tell that she really loves what she does as do everyone else here. 

I'm glad I found this restaurant as it will now become one of my favorites to frequent regularly."}
{"text":"I live in Phoenix and have never been to either location of Chelsea's Kitchen before, but since I live so close to the airport, I thought I would give this place a try since I love Ingo's and this restaurant is part of the LGO Hospitality group. Upon arrival and requesting to be seated in the back so that I wasn't in the front under the florescents and throngs of travelers walking by, the reaction from the hostess was one of bewilderment and unhappiness, as she didn't want to seat us in what was supposed to be closed section, even though there were already people there. The excuse was that they were understaffed too. Not a very good impression to give to a new customer, but we ended up there anyway, go figure.

SERVICE: our server, while she seemed a little frazzled, tried her best to be very attentive. Maybe it was the holidays or the short staffed situation or that she was possibly employed by the airport rather than directly by the restaurant that made her unhappy, who knows. Another server, maybe from the bar, poured my wine and spills a little in the process on the table, but had no desire to wipe it up. Really? You want me to clean up after your mess?

FOOD: I was hoping that they would have the same menu as their other restaurant and was looking forward to ordering the Dixie pan-fried chicken, but it wasn't on the menu. So I opted for the meatloaf instead. Unfortunately, both the meatloaf and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm and the broccoli was literally COLD and very under cooked (and I like crunchy veg); there was no way this dish came out of a hot pan or pot recently. And the meatloaf was dry and overcooked, lacking any kind of juiciness or color, just a block of brown meat in very little sauce. My dining companion's burger was hot, so I'm assuming my dish died in the window waiting for his dish. I wanted to send it back, but since our server didn't check on us for quite a while later and my companion was almost done with his burger, I didn't bother. Besides, the clock was ticking on my parking.

We dine out a lot and we have our local favorites so it's been a long time since I've tried a new restaurant and was very disappointed. It's not a great experience when you feel like you are being punished when you have done nothing wrong."}
{"text":"My friends and I always joke about the service at Chelsea's and we were willing to deal with it because the food and atmosphere are what we are looking for some days.  I have never had a problem with service on the restaurant side, only at the bar and patio.  I took a first date there on Sunday evening.  We arrived at 5 pm and were just going to get some cocktails and maybe an appetizer.  We sat in the bar area inside. Not at the bar, but at the pub tables.  We were talking, enjoying our conversation and about 10 minutes into our visit, we still hadn't been approached by anyone with a greeting or menus.  We kept talking but now I was trying get the attention of the server.  There were only 2 other people at the bar.  They weren't busy.  Being a first date, I didn't want to make a scene, so I suggested we go somewhere else.  I was still trying to get the attention of the server and/or bartender.  We kept enjoying our conversation and finally, after 33 minutes (I am not kidding) without so much as a \"hello\", we left and headed for Hillstones.  I was so embarrassed as Chelsea's was my suggestion.  I WILL NOT be giving Chelsea's my business anymore."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with the food. It was definitely just okay. The price is higher than average so I expected great food. Nope. The ambiance was very nice though."}
{"text":"Aside from this airport terminal being impressive, this restaurant makes a great addition among the little food court prior to TSA.  I had a few hours to kill before my Southwest flight, and was in need of some food because free peanuts was not going to cut it.  If you're a salad person, I suggest the Del Mar salad.  Oh-Em-Gee!  I wanted to keep eating even though I was already full from eating the mountain of yuminess.  The lettuce is topped with their shrimp ceviche.  It's massive!  It can definitely feed two people.  It was so flavorful that I didn't even need to use the salad dressing they gave me.  There is a bit of a kick to it most likely from the onions and cilantro, but it just adds greatness to the overall flavor.  I'm kind of sad they don't have this place where I live."}
{"text":"This was one of the best all-around restaurant experiences we've had in a long time! Pulled in to discover free valet, beautiful landscaping, and a classy entrance. Both the interior of the restaurant and the patio have elegant, modern decor. I was impressed down to the thought-out ceiling of the bathroom! The hostess was incredibly friendly and pointed out exactly where the person was that we were meeting. A very nice gesture, she seemed to know we hadn't met him before :) The bar is an indoor/outdoor setup, and we ordered a white sangria (YUM!) and a Green Flash IPA (pretty standard, nothing too special). We were seating within 15 minutes. Fantastic wait service, very positive and was at our table the perfect amount of times. Very gracious and gave us suggestions based on what the wait staff like to eat, which if you have worked in the restaurant industry, you know to listen! 

We started with the guacamole and salsa. The tomatillo salsa was roasted and had a unique flavor, we really liked it. The guac was just fantastic, very flavorful. We really like garlic in our guac and you could definitely taste it. Even the chips seemed well thought-out, a unique shape and puffy rather than your standard Tostito. They brought us more chips for free. For dinner we split an order of the Seared Ahi Tacos - WOW. Impressive all around. The menu specified that the Ahi was sashimi grade, which we were glad to see. It was perfectly seared and melt-in-your-mouth tender. I wouldn't be surprised if they make the corn tortillas there. They are on the smaller end (so you can eat more tacos, of course) and nicely grilled. They arrived wrapped and warm. The tacos also came with a very unique kale slaw instead of just your standard lettuce, which we absolutely loved. They also came with more guac, roasted salsa, black beans, a creamy sauce that we are used to having with fish tacos, and wedges of lime. They bring the plate to you fajita-style, so you decide what to put on your tacos. We were literally saying \"Oh my god, so good.\" pretty much the entire meal. Wish we could have tried dessert but after splitting an appetizer three ways and an entree two ways, we literally couldn't eat another bite. We had to struggle to finish the tacos. 

We were wearing dressy casual clothes (jeans/button up shirt for him, sweater/jeans/boots for her) and felt very appropriately dressed. The prices are in the medium range here, but well worth it. You get exactly what you pay for - very quality food in large quantities! Definitely make a reservation if you are going for dinner - we went on a Wednesday night with a reservation and still waited about 15 minutes. We can definitely see why this place is so popular. We are new to the area and can't wait to take friends and family to Chelsea's Kitchen when they visit!"}
{"text":"The assemble-yourself short rib tacos weren't bad. A bit over cooked.  

The kale slaw that accompanied the tacos would've been better with just little citrus to cut the tacos. Otherwise, not bad. 

The margarita was fantastic! Perfect compliment to the short rib! 

The service was great. No complaints.

{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. Everyone is very pleasant and helpful. Zach was a great waiter. The food is so delicious!! The deviled eggs were very good. They have French press coffee and it is very good quality coffee too! It is noisy, but that is because it is very popular and for good reason. I can't wait to come back and sit on the beautiful patio."}
{"text":"I give FIVE STARS to the service here.  I thought that we Midwesterners had cornered the market on friendly (cue the battle with the Southerners here...).  But these folks really made my day.  The airport can be stressful for most, and it's really helpful to get a warm greeting and smiling, friendly service.  Did I mention that the folks here were super-nice?  The food here is very tasty.  I've had carry out several times in the past.  This time I was able to sit down in their ample dining room located outside security.  I recommend the tacos.  There's too much for me to eat, and I always wind up with enough meat for two more tacos as a later snack.  The ingredients are high quality, and the design and execution of the dishes is excellent.  (If you miss out on this, you may be near their sister restaurant at the D gates, La Grande Orange!)"}
{"text":"Having a long wait at the airport and having luggage in tow, we were told by the hostess at Chelsea's Kitchen that we were welcome to bring them in, plenty of space to get them out of the way.  The restaurant is well located, pre-security which was perfect for us as we were headed in all different directions.

There were 6 of us with a 4 hour wait, our server came and offered help and we ordered and she came back regularly to see if we needed anything else. My husband and I travel a fair bit and we've spent several hour in airport restaurants and our \"typical\" experience for service is mostly \"probably won't see these people ever again, so what\" but not yesterday. Our server, Brittany was amazing! She was fun, always smiling, had great energy... Single handedly she concluded our weekend in Phoenix with laughter and fun, having us all smiling as we took different direction heading home.

Thank you Brittany for being You! We really appreciated your service! Hope to catch you again on our next travels through Phoenix!!

PS: Butternut Squash Soup was amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Revised from Original Review below:
Manager called back the next day and addressed the issues at hand. We will return for our weekly dine in at PHX next week.

Original Review: (Check your take out order!)
We frequent the establishment in Phoenix and come to the Sky Harbor location after our weekly travels. This week my wife flew in earlier, and I went to pick up dinner for us both. The issue is, I paid for two meals and only came home with one. The Manager has not seen fit to call me back. 

We will no longer be paying for this poor service in regard to your take home menu. I ordered from the bar and my wife has had issues with the bartenders not serving her as a woman but serving the males who come after her first. 

An establishment that doesn't serve equally and takes money for two meals and provides only one meal is not a place I prefer to frequent."}
{"text":"Believe the hype about Chelsea's Kitchen. When in Phoenix, this is the only restaurant that we MUST go to. There are only two negatives I can think of...the parking situation and the lack of reservations.

In the summer we'll eat inside but the patio is a must when the weather is nice. You have to get the tuna tartare & guacamole. It's one of the best appetizers you'll eat. I always get the short rib taco platter and leave with a doggie bag every time. They'll even give you extra house-made tortillas for your left overs! I've also had the brussels sprout salad, the kale and quinoa salad, the green chili burger and the ahi tuna taco platter. You really can't go wrong.

On the way out, don't forget to grab a freshly baked sea salt cookie!"}
{"text":"Walked right in...sat at the bar...instant service before my flight....waited about 5 minutes or less and my basic breakfast was right in front of me....along with this absolutely awesome butter that had orange grinds in it I used to top my English muffin.....friendly staff and perfect mimosa!"}
{"text":"My family has a second home in Phoenix and Chelsea's Kitchen is a must go to anytime we are out visiting. The Brussel Sprout salad and Short Rib tacos are TO DIE for. So delicious it doesn't get much better. Also, if you are a guacamole fan theirs is out of this world. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Chelsea's Kitchen and it was a great experience.  The outdoor patio was beautiful and a wonderful setting for dinner.  We had a problem with one of our dinners.  Hey, mistakes happen.  They handled it great.  Sent it back and got a new dinner.  Took the dinner off the bill and sent a ton of dessert over.  The chef came over himself to apologize.
That's the way to run a restaurant.
Everyone had a great dinner."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! Very clean and courteous staff combined with the world's greatest baked mac and cheese made for an amazing evening!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to eat here for a long time. We pass Chelsea's on our way to the PHX Chamber Music series. BUT on the weekends this place is way to crowed for me. We ended up here on a Mon. night with out of town guests, seated right away. everyone found something they liked on the menu. The food was really good, I had the tuna fajitas YUM! The fried chicken was good but not up to southern standards. The portions were large but we cleaned our plates. Tasty sides."}
{"text":"Tonight was my third dining experience here. I came with my family and ordered what I have ordered each time..ahi tuna taco platter with a side of french fries. While there are so many enticing menu options, the thought of this dish always makes my mouth water. 

The rest of my family really enjoyed their dishes, except for my mom. She really didn't like the red pepper soup, although she's not one to complain. Our waiter noticed she had barely eaten and asked if she didnt like it. She replied \"not really\" and he took the soup off the bill. I was really impressed by his service throughout the meal, but that was really above and beyond good service.

I only wish Chelsea's Kitchen was closer!"}
{"text":"Whenever my travels bring me to the Phoenix airport and I have a few hours to kill, I stop in here. Granted, that's only happened twice, but both times this place didn't disappoint. I love their kale salad. Most recently, I had it paired with their vegetarian tacos...so delicious! Service is friendly and quick (if you want it fast), but I just hang out a bit and never feel rushed to leave."}
{"text":"I had five hours to wait before my flight so my coworkers and I decided to have a couple drinks and some food at the bar. 

This place had great atmosphere for being in an airport! The bar was pretty, the restaurant was pretty. I liked it. The service and the food did not live up to the hype though. There were three bartenders working the bar and getting something to drink and eat was like pulling teeth. A coworker order the shrimp ceviche, it was less then impressive. It tasted like they mixed a can of salsa with shrimp bits... I had a chicken sandwich with some garlic mashed potatoes it was actually pretty good. The chicken had an spiciness that I've never had before not sure what ingredient or combination of ingredients it was, but it will be something I compare all other fried chicken sandwiches too. The best part about the experience was they had Delirium Tremens on TAP! I know odd right? Pretty awesome..."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch place ! And if the weather is nice, it is simply mind-blowing to sit out on the patio. Their patio is covered with tree shared so in any case, the temperature is lower than normal. Have visited on a couple of occasions and never been disappointed. Pricey, however. Good portions."}
{"text":"We dined at Chelsea's Kitchen with friends and everyone had a very good time.  We had the deviled eggs, which were amazing, the shrimp cerviche which was one of the better I have had at a restaurant and then also the tuna tartare with avacado which was the appetizer winner.  For dinner I had the  Howie burger which was made perfectly and also shared the Brussels sprout salad with my wife.  I was able to get a taste of the baked mac and cheese from a friend and was the best thing I ate all night and rivals the best m&c ever tasted by this palate.  The wait staff was excellent and  the manager was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. My \"go to\" spot for Sunday brunch. Bottomless mimosas and nachos... Best in town!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Came for brunch and sat on the patio- a beautiful experience!  Food was really great, and the service was superb.  If Yelp allowed half stars, I would give this restaurant a 4.5, but since I had to go with a 4 or a 5, it was easy to lean upward to the 5!"}
{"text":"Whoever Chelsea is, I want to hug and kiss her in all the right places, because she is doing it right!

Lucky and I arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm with no reservations- get off me, I have already taken my beatings for that.  But, as expected, there was a 45 min wait for a table.  And since it was Arizona in July, coupled with the chubby factor and my fight against fromunda cheese, we made the smart move to wait for a table inside.  The good news is that we found a couple seats at the bar to enjoy some adult libations.

What was supposed to be 45 minutes, was actually and hour and since we were pounding drinks, the bar tab was fairly hefty.  Not CK's fault, I just really like vodka and I was sitting at a bar, what else was going to happen?  But, the bartenders were good (AKA long poured) and my liver was in over drive.

Once we got to the table, we found the menu to look great just as others had mentioned, yet we asked the waiter for recommendations.  He suggested the surf and turf tacos as well as the pulled pork (hehe, I said pulled pork, but that was before our date), and the dude with the apron and hipster glasses knocked the cover off the ball!  They were awesome!  But, in the back of my head, I kept hearing this voice from past Yelpers... \"get the mac and cheese... get the mac and cheeeeeeese'.  So, I did what any almost sane/not-so-sober man would do, I got the mac and cheese for dessert!  Take that Dr. Your-Cholesterol-is-too-High!  I did it and I loved it.  If it wasn't so hot and melty, I may have smeared some on the body parts that my tummy blocks the view to!  So, do yourself a favor and get some, even Luddy Style- another meal for dessert.

Service- 4.5 stars- overall good, but the hipster said \"really?\" when I ordered my dessert.  F him.  Get a hair cut and good luck with your artist/acting career, Skinny Jeans.
Food- 5+ stars- I can't wait to go back and try some new things and get more mac and cheese- and give Chelsea a 'good game' on her back side.
Atmosphere- 4 stars- it reminded me a lot of Hillstone, so it was nice, but nothing special.  Though the patio will be perfect when it's not a bazillion degrees and the chances of down-low sweat decreases.
Overall- 4 stars, and it would have been 5 had the wait been a little more realistic.   Maybe they should get a hostess with the mostess that doesn't need to take off her shoes to count more than ten... just a thought.

In the end, it was a great overall date night dinner with Lucky.  A few too many cocktails, great food, fantasies about noodles and hot cheese that I stored away in my spank bank, and the company of the hottest girl in the place."}
{"text":"We were doing a stay-cation at the Biltmore and decided to partake in some of the finer culinary treasures of Phoenix. To that end we had heard a lot about Chelsea's kitchen and decided to go on July 4th for dinner. The restaurant was offering a $4 dollar 2nd entrée special so why not.

I had read some of the other comments and I see these comments all over other restaurants about being expensive and complaining about valet parking. You're not in Kansas anymore. Phoenix has become a major metropolitan area and if you want good ingredients you're going to pay a premium and as for valet parking welcome to the big city.

All that being said the restaurant was very busy for a holiday and many for the staff said they were not expecting the volume that they had. Looks like more of us are boycotting California these days. We took seat on the patio and enjoyed some wonder white sangria. This was perfectly balanced and I would recommend it if you're looking for something a little lighter in your alcoholic libations.

Were seated in about 25 min which as less than the 45minues we were told to expect. While the wait staff was extremely pleasant they were a little overwhelmed and the level of attentiveness could have been just a touch more during the dining experience.

We ordered the chicken nachito's to start. A note to those that order..Nachtios inferred to me small but this is a huge plate of nachos. This dish was so close to being stellar that it was sinful but missed the mark for a couple of reasons. The chips were fabulous as was the guac, however the there wasn't enough cheese on top and after we dug through we saw a huge mound of shredded and unmelted cheese. Maybe that was the intent. The chicken was bland and could have sued a little spice to perk things up. If they had done those two things this dish would have rocked the Kasbah.

We next ordered the Brussels sprout salad. I mean who gets brussel sprout salad. Te salad was a large portion and had beautiful texture with blue berries, cranberries, manchengo cheese, and some nuts. Brussel sprouts are not the lightest flavor in the house and when paired with the solidness of the manchengo cheese it needs a dressing to hold up. I know the chef was going for lighter fare in the salad as a whole but the dressing was a little limp in the flavor department compared with the stoutness of brussel sprouts and the cheese as well as the texture in the salad. Perhaps a creamy cumber or Dijon based dressing would have fared better but something a little more solid and this salad would have moved into the greatness department.

My wife ordered the Lobster tacos and I ordered the short ribs we wanted to sample the fries and the Mac and cheese (we sample a lot of everything and leave tons).

The short ribs were stellar and the portion for short ribs was the largest I have seen at any restaurant. You have the option of ordering an egg sunny side up on your ribs and I did just that and it was awesome. The lobster tacos were stellar and the fabulous guac they serve was a great compliment. I saw one reviewer had a little disdain for the corn tortillas. I have to agree. There was something just off about these corn tortillas. I believe he said they added flour to them. That could be.  East Coasters would never know the difference but to those of us that relish our Mexican food there was something not right about these corn tortillas even though they were fresh..Not bad mind you, but slightly off.

The fries were very good (hand cut) and the Mac n Cheese was a solid side. The restaurant does have a great patio and I would go back again.

Chelsea's Kitchen was close to greatness, but I alas I can only give three stars. A few tweaks and they move up at lightning speed."}
{"text":"Had been looking to go here on way back to Tucson and it was excellent. Great service & ambience as well as a good selection of food. Visitors from UK loved it too.."}
{"text":"So we had the French fries (dusted in bar b que seasonings), ahi appetizer, lobster and filet tacos and white sangria. Everything was amazing. Will definitely return! Also had a great server!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen the other night.  This is a solid restaurant.  Everything about it is good from the food to the service and the modern decor.  We had a variety of items on the menu and everything was good.  In particular, I enjoyed the nachos and the Cheeseburger!  The cheeseburger had caramelized red-onions which were outstanding! 

Desert was good too, we all shared red velvet cake and key lime pie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Az. Love the Dixie Fried Chicken with a side of their Mac and Cheese. My wife loves the Caeser salad with Rib Eye steak. The atmosphere is great and everyone is is very helpful. They finally received my 5 star rating when they turned the air condition down the other night. Warning the restaurant can be very cold under their fans and blowers. A sweater may be a necessity."}
{"text":"We had a nice evening here. It feels like a \"cozy date\" restaurant and all was delish. Came via a Yelp search and was pleased at the results. First of all the Margaritas are really really good. They make their own sweet and sour mix and it shows. Not too sweet, not too sour... just right. 
    We started off with chips and salsa and guac. Should have skipped this course as most of the items were repeated with the taco platters we ordered. Thought the chips were a bit dry and not salty enough. The salsa was different and interesting but certainly not memorable.  
    So why four stars? Loved the seared ahi tacos.  The ahi melts in your mouth and the homemade tortillas and guacamole coupled with this fabulous margarita? WoW. Partner ordered the short rib tacos and they were really good too but the ahi won out.  We will try the swordfish next time and start the meal with that fabulous quinoa kale salad that made us sing.
    The service was exceptional. We will return and plan on giving a dinner out at Chelsea's Kitchen as a Christmas gift to make sure that happens!"}
{"text":"I'm usually no fan of the grill (I tend to opt towards decadent pastas and sumptuous soups), but Chelsea's Kitchen always turns me into a T-rex eating every animal in sight.  The meats and carnivorious fares are absolutely delicious.  I'm a huge fan of everything with fish at Chelsea's.  For appetizer, I recommend the chips w/ tuna tartare and guacamole.  Not a fan of raw fish?  Well, first of all, you're missing out and lacking in taste--no offense.  But second of all, try just chips and guacamole.  So delicious!  For entree, I'm a huge fan of the ahi tuna burger.  The blend of flavors is absolutely incredible!  The swordfish and steak tacos are pretty delectable as well.  Finish your meal with a slice of red velvet cake (complete with a scoop of house-made gelato and a mint leaf) and a salted chocolate chip cookie on your way out.  However, you can't go wrong with any meal at Chelsea's.  I also highly recommend the Arnold Palmer--they say it's the same one as the Arnie at LGO, but I find Chelsea's Palmer to be much fresher and sweeter than it's counterpart down the street (or maybe it's just the juxtaposition between the general saltiness of the foods at Chelsea's and the inherent sweetness of tea and lemonade that makes it so particularly mouthwatering at CK).  But beware: Chelsea's does get pretty crowded on the weekend and even at dinnertime on weekdays, but the experience is well worth the wait.  If it's under 75 degrees, make sure to get a table on the inviting, intimate, and verdant patio.  If it's the typical 150 degree day, the cozy industrial-kitsch interior is fantastic as well.  Service is generally great and the servers are always extremely friendly and caring--however, they will subtly rush you if there's a wait, but the food and environment make up for any perceived rudeness you may experience.  Overall, Chelsea's is where I head to when I need to bulk up on protein.  Hope you have a yummy time at Chelsea's Kitchen!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is a little pricey for lunch, but if you have an expense account, what the heck.   
i have eaten here several times, as our HQ is next door, so its convenient.  

Fish tacos are incredible.  Not a bad mral in the house.   Great looking staff and good looking crowd for HH."}
{"text":"Allison is a 'radar detector' and liason for Chelsea's Kitchen and saw my less than unhappy 'yelp' about Chelsea's the day I wrote it.  She immediately connected with me wanting to redeem this landmark on 40th Street just a tad North on Camelback.  This is rare, so my interest was piqued!

My friend Linda and I were going to eat somewhere that day and thought I would give Allison a ring.  She immediately asked if I wanted to have lunch that day (She must have heard my hunger pains!) and let me know the General Manager would be awaiting my arrival.

Linda and I entered Chelsea's and I had a new awakening, like it was a total new experience.  I desired to give them an opportunity so my slate and plate were clean!

FIRST, everyone there was the epitome of 'the Dove girl', which is refreshing!  Perfect posture, not a hair out of place, loving, caring, lovely posture, and more than hospitable.  We were greeted by the hostess who let us pick the seating for our next 2.5 hours of delight, then our 'water girl' named Susanne who was joyfully friendly and chatted with us some about more than water and lemons.  Then we were greeted by Erica, our server, letting me know the menu was open to whatever we desired for lunch due to my last experience there at Chelsea's.  I FELT SO LOVED!  My son had passed away a year ago this week, and I so desired this energy of being taken care of by these lovely women who could have been my daughters.

Linda and I ordered the wine from Santa Barbara, (very near and dear to me as I raised my boys up and down the California coast) and we actually had the carafe, 1 each :-) !  We then enjoyed the deviled eggs with bacon which melted in our mouths, then the 'salad' which I added a touch more salt and then the main event:  The Chelsea Cheeseburger!  OH, how i hungered for a lovely burger, once in a while is a requirement for me!  Well done, ordered to perfection, crisp onions, juicy pickles, yummy Wisconsin cheese, tender bun, mayo, mustard, and ketchup.  They could hear my loving moans from the kitchen!  BECAUSE .....

After our main entre', the Executive Chef, Jorge Gomez, walked out smiling with a special desert and coffee (HOW DID THEY KNOW!!!).  He was a lovely guy, knowledgeable, precise, and in love with the love of good eats, both devouring and creating!  

During our meal, the General Manager gazed over to make sure we were smiling, laughing and most of all, relishing in our lunch extravaganza; Chelsea style.  I NOW give Chelsea's Kitchen 5 STARS, and as a bonus 5 EXTRA GOLD STARS for directing me back, inviting me to partake in a quality long-lasting relationship with them after they showed me just what they are made of!  Dinner is right around the corner!  Maybe Chelsea's tonight!

{"text":"Long over due review.....This is by far my favorite restaurant in the valley. I have been going to Chelsea's for several years now.  I prefer to sit out on the patio when the weather permits but indoors has a lovely ambiance as well. They have a fantastic brussel sprout salad add salmon and fish tacos that are unmatched!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have only visited it about three times. The bartender Matthew (I'm pretty sure) is so nice and friendly and makes the best drinks. This is one of the only two restaurants I will eat and can't wait to go back, OH and visit my parents in Surprise :"}
{"text":"My goto stop for dinner after an evening flight.  Everything I have tried on the menu from salads to tacos and sandwiches as been quite good.  This would be a three star on in the \"real world,\" but for airport food it gets a 4."}
{"text":"Absolutely adored this place! The outdoor patio area is gorgeous in the evening when the sun is setting and the lights are so pretty! Some of the guests there seemed a tad judgmental but I think you are going to get that anywhere that close to scottsdale. The food was excellent. I've enjoyed deviled eggs at this location, crab cakes, salad and divine wine! A must-try in PHX!"}
{"text":"Delicious food - I recommend the filet tacos and/or the kale and quinoa salad. The deviled eggs are also amazing and their patio is one of the best in the valley!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It had great food, it was really fresh, and my whole family loved it. Not too pricey, really delicious. For dessert, you should definitely get the red velvet cake - my family wolfed it down. That is why I give this place five-stars."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Didn't expect a French press when I ordered coffee!  Outstanding service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is my first time in this great spot!

Although I was recovering from a mexican food related stomach problem, I went there with 2 friends of mine.

The place is great, the patio is awesome and the service couldn't be better. Too bad I didn't ask the waitress her name because I should send a compliment to the place about the great service :)

So I ordered a tea (I know, it sounds weird but I was sick). The tea was tasteful and the serving was generous. 

After warming up with the tea and taming my upset stomach, I ordered the filet and the house pinot noir. 

Both were pretty good.

The mountain of mashed potatoes could be smaller and on the side, instead of under the filet and I didn't try the veggies. But all in all it was a great experience.

Did I say how awesome the waitress was? I'll have to go back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I am long past due on this update. Chelsea's emailed me after my first review and asked for additional feedback. I appreciated the outreach and was happy to share what details I could remember. Afterwards, they offered me a generous gift certificate and genuinely seemed to appreciate my feedback. A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal. My friend had the filet and I had the prime rib and both were fabulous. It was a very busy night and we sat at the bar. Service was good and management came to follow-up with us to ask us about our meal when I used my certificate to pay for part of our meal. I was very impressed with Chelsea's efforts to listen to customer feedback and also their attempt to make their customers happy. I will return to Chelsea's and continue to love the guacamole tuna tartar!"}
{"text":"Stopped here  while in the airport. Had always heard about it from numerous friends. I didn't think it was anything to write home about personally."}
{"text":"We loved Chelsea's Kitchen.  Great food, nice patio even in the heat of summer, good service.  It is a busy place and doesn't take reservations.  We went on a Thursday evening and were seated right away.  Key lime pie is excellent!"}
{"text":"Three for lunch on a Thursday...again, a great meal with great service.

Ahi & Lobster tacos as well as Howie burger ordered, all great.  Love the homemade tortillas.

Desserts were a hit, too.  (Red Velvet cake and dark chocolate/brownie cake thing)"}
{"text":"This place was really great! My parents took me here for my birthday, and I must say it was a wonderful time! Service at the bar was lacking, but the drinks were pretty decent once we got them. 

Started with a bloody mary, dad had a bloody maria--both served with pickled green bean in lieu of other garnish. Odd, bitter, inedible, but just the garnish. The drink itself was tasty and pretty well proportioned. It even had just the right amount of ice. 

We ordered the chicken nachitos, which were plentiful and delicious. Everyone munched on these hardcore, and we still had some left over when our entrées came out! 

My husband and I shared the Brussels sprout salad and neither of us found it appealing, which was a disappointment. We also shared the short ribs, however, and these were really to die for! The meat was fork tender, and the sauce was quite nice.  My father had the taco platter with steak, I believe, which I tried and found a little licorice-y. My mother had the cheeseburger, which was tasty but nothing special."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here some months back and had a good time. We waited in the patio with drinks before being seated. I remember getting the melon salad for an appetizer which was surprisingly really good, and as for my entree...well, I remember some sort of steak. Delicious, succulent, and juicy steak (I don't remember which cut, though - man, Alzheimers is already setting in). Complimentary cake for dessert. The service was attentive and friendly, and I dug the casual atmosphere of the place, even though the food was significantly greater than casual. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Nice place. The waitress was super sweet.  I got a chopped salad that was really good. Friends got the Nachitos! Huge and yummy! I also got a lemonade drink of some kind that was very good.  We went on a Tuesday but it was still very busy.... my salad came quick but the Nachitos took longer than I think they should have.  It was very loud and we all had to lean in to each other to hear what we were each saying but other than those couple things, nice classy place."}
{"text":"What a way to end our visit in Arizona. Chelsea's Kitchen was fantastic. Service and food were great. My favorite was the jalapeño cornbread. It comes out hot and fresh on a skillet and has a slightly crispy crust. I will be dreaming of their cornbread. 

Their short rib tacos are also delicious. Meat is tender and flavorful. I normally don't like pork because it can be tough, but I was told they slow cook their meat for hours.

Our waitress, Preslee S, was the best. She was attentive, accommodating, and very kind. 

Thanks Chelsea's Kitchen for ending our trip on a memorable note."}
{"text":"I have come here several times since my last review. Each time since my first visit here has been 100% better .
 Food here is amazing! So good every single time. They are always busy. But, they always get to you very quickly and your food comes out fast and hot. 
 I tried to get something different all the time. 
However, the brussels sprout salad is beyond amazing. 
I have to say it's my absolute favorite.
 Also, they have a kale salad that is fantastic with cranberries in it. Something they do with the kale mix is absolutely delicious. I like salad, I like kale, a lot. A lot of people don't. But, everyone I've ever given this salad to loves it!
The last time I was here I got  short ribs with the kale salad. So fantastic.  Check out the photo of that. 
 Something else I've had here that's also very good salmon dinner, and the prime rib dinner .
They have a full-service bar , and always fresh soups.
They have wonderful desserts as well. However, they always have fresh baked cookies that they let you help yourself to near the hostess stand. Even if you're not traveling anywhere , you could stop in and park inside the airport parking it's quick and easy."}
{"text":"Met my friend here for lunch on the day it snowed in Phoenix. At this time though, it was only rain. It snowed after lunch.
 I have to say this was a wonderful experience. Not like the one I had at Sky Harbor.
It was packed when I arrived,a 20 min wait. No problem, nice place and lots to look at here. Parking lot was jammed ,but I was blessed enough to find a spot. My friend Valeted,which was also nice as it was free.
 The fire place was going full steam, lovely since it was rainy and cold outdoors.
Our server was Cara, and she was lovely. She kept our drinks filled and was very attentive even though, she was very busy with a full house.
I ordered soup and the Brussel sprout salad, I have to say it is the best salad ever.
They had run out of soup of the day,and were substituting french onion.
I love French Onion, but this had no flavor. Cara got me something else right away. She was so awesome.
My friend got the French Dip, she said it is now one of her favorites. At $15.00 she said, well worth it. 
It was a lovely day and a lovely place. I am excited to go back.
 I may try the airport one again, I hope it can compare. My last time there was less than fun.
Any way, if you are looking for a lovely afternoon somewhere, this is the place. 
The staff is warm and friendly.  They seem very genuine and the place is beautiful. 
Bathrooms are nice and clean and very modern."}
{"text":"Used to live in Phoenix and ate here twice.  Most recently a few weeks ago.  Our food took 45 minutes to get and my wife's order was incorrect.  The person that delivered the food to her tried to insinuate that she had gotten the correct order until the waitress chimed in.  The person left with the plate and no apology.  When her short rib taco showed up the tortillas were just OK and the salad was very bland.  I had the tuna burger which was way under seasoned and over cooked.  There better places to eat with less wait.  Won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Great place for a family dinner or a date...fairly casual, average wine selection, great selection of foods.torn between the tacos and Burgers I went with the Howie burger...a little messy but GREAT taste...seasoned fries are good and a little cookie on the way out to settle the stomach...I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Beautiful venue and the food and drinks match!"}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen was such a pleasant find. Me and my friend came here after hiking camelback and were very happy with the choice. 
When we walked in they said there was a 25 min wait for inside seating so we headed to the bar to wait as the inside is very spacious. We got the white sangria pitcher which was a great deal compared to a single glass of it. It ended up only being 10 min and the place is very busy.
We ordered the small plate of deviled eggs (eggcelent) and the chips with guac and salsa (both were amazing). My friend ordered coffee and it ended up being an organic French press which was a nice surprise.
For lunch my friend got the Chelsea Cheeseburger which was cooked to perfection and I got the Ahi burger which was just ok but the waitress had advised me ahead of time it wasn't her recommendation. I substituted the fries for the vegetables which were AMAZING. For dessert we got the red velvet cake which was seriously to die for but I wish it was served with more gelato. 
Overall the atmosphere was amazing and the service was impeccable. Would 100% come back again."}
{"text":"Continued fail at the Chelsea's Kitchen at the airport.  Once again \"out of the Del Mar Salad.\"  How can one of the staple items on the menu be out? I'll keep going to the 40th street location, but have given up here.  The GM reached out to me last time when they had a breakfast fail.   Stop pretending to be the real Chelsea's  when this is just more of the same airport food..."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp ceviche, Dixie fried chicken and a kale salad.
Honestly it reminds me of an OLD Country Kitchen that turned the lights down, added some funky music, trained the staff, fluffed the menu with some buzz food items that lack flavor and added alcohol.  
Busy place overrated & priced
I think it is a place to gather verses a place to eat.  
The staff are well trained but the food needs help."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise Chelsea's was. I have eaten at a lot of airports, so finding a place that served fresh, homecooked meals at a fair price was a treat. I had the kale and quinoa salad then added rotisserie chicken breast. It was delicious and healthy! I will definitely back."}
{"text":"Best patio in town.  Order the sangria pitcher and take a load off.  I won't bore you with a long review other than recommending those two items.  

Recap...

Step one, get a table on the patio.
Step two, order the sangria pitcher (by the glass is a rip)
Step three, \"take a load off\".  YES that's a step!

OK fine...  One more thing if you insist.  Order something to nibble on also.  Their food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, which was our third visit. We have been for brunch twice before and had great meals sitting out on the patio during nice weather. We ate inside due to rainy weather and the first thing you are greeted with when you walk in is the mouth watering, smoky aroma from the rotisserie. It has a very comforting and pleasant environment. I ordered the short rib tacos, which are outstanding and can feed 3 people. They hand make the corn tortillas on premise. My husband had the rotisserie chicken, which was equally amazing. Super juicy and flavorful. Also love that you can order wine by the 6 oz glass or 10 oz carafe. Alissa, our server, was so attentive and friendly and made the visit complete. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood joint! The great ambiance and open kitchen is great. The service and food is always on point. They really give you what you pay for and more :)"}
{"text":"I was in town on business for a couple of days and was treated to dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen and really enjoyed it. The design inside is cool and hip, without being pretentious. It all feels very intimate - the lighting accentuates a lounge-like vibe. I was a little shocked to see valet parking for such a small establishment but I think that's purely for function with such a tiny parking area. 

The bar area was very cool. Great, fast service with good drink and wine selection. The food was awesome. We started with the nachos that were loaded with yummy toppings and not soggy at all (which a lot of nachos suffer with). We decided to share a few platters of tacos so we could taste everything - the swordfish, pork and rib tacos were dynamite! Everything was really fresh and flavorful. We also opted to share a few desserts. Both the Red Velvet Cake and Key Lime Pie were to die for. I can't say I was disappointed by a darn thing. Above all, great service by the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and people watch..

The fish tacos are awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a dinner date. Good atmosphere and food.  The deviled eggs are a must!   Make sure to get there early, parking is tight.   The portions are average sized but the flavor is on point!"}
{"text":"I said the same thing about Chelsea's Kitchen as I did about its sister restaurant, La Grand Orange, which is located behind security in Terminal D: don't judge this airport establishment by its management. Being in an airport, it's just about guaranteed that HMS will be running the joint. While I don't think they're normally known for their service, the standards for this place have been raised more than a few notches. The restaurant makes a decent place to dine and linger with friends and family before you (or they or all of you) go behind security. The food is high quality and they have a full bar. Top off the experience with free, fresh baked cookies they offer as you depart."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley for both lunch and dinner. They also own La Grande pizza, which is also really close to this restaurant that has great pizza and market there.  I really love the atmosphere here. The only negative that I find of this place is the parking, which I wish you could park yourself more often than not but I guess it's not a terrible thing with all the bad drivers in this city. They also don't take reservations and unless you get there right when they open for lunch unless you're really lucky you will be waiting for 10-15min. Anyway if you haven't tried this place, you should and you most likely won't regret it. They have awesome short rib tacos and guac and chips. Beer and wine selection is so-so and cocktails I still have to try but food and atmosphere are B+, this place is a home run in my book"}
{"text":"The patio is a great place to sit back and enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather for about 7 months of the year.  Right now, is not one of those months though.  Chelsea's doesn't like to disappoint so there are misters cooling it off.

We went last week and sat inside after the lunch rush was over.  It does get busy due to it's great location, food and service.  Ordered the Chicken Nachitos and a Salad.  The nacho dish is HUGE, you have been warned.  
This is one of the reasons that I love the Arcadia 'hood, so much within walking distance!  We drove though, still too hot.

Chelsea, I'll be seeing you soon for another sweet rendezvous..."}
{"text":"Wow what can we say. We're visiting from Atlanta and Baltimore. This place was recommend by another restaurant. Food was out of this world, I had the ahi  tuna tacos and my friend had the steak tacos. Food is to die for, the Kale slaw was the bomb. Oh don't forget the great fries, taste like bbq chips The service is a 15 out of 10 ask for Amy. What a great gem."}
{"text":"This place started following me on Instagram so I decided to stop in for lunch and check them out.  I grabbed a seat at the bar where I was greeted with a smile and hello. There isn't a bad seat in the place. If ambiance is what you seek this place has it. The menu has something for everyone. I started with the deviled eggs which were piled high and topped with bacon.  They were full of flavor and seasoned perfectly.  Next were the short rib tacos.  They come deconstructed with house made to order corn tortillas, guacamole, pico, and an amazing kale and grape salad. The short ribs were tender, tortillas amazing.  This plate probably could be split and serve two but I managed to take down the entire plate of food.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"right off the bat i could smell the food from the parking lot. it smelled DELICIOUS. the environment at Chelsea's Kitchen is unique, it had a special classy feel to it. 


the outside patio is perfect depending on the weather, so if you get a chance, sit outside! our waitress was very prompt and gave very good suggestions on what was good and what wasn't. the presentation of the food was phenomenal and it tasted just as good. i order the Cesar with chicken along with one of their craft beers. i would definitely recommend the chips and guacamole as an appetizer.  the cleanliness from the parking lot to the bathrooms were great. 

a downfall for some people maybe the price. i felt some entrees were overpriced but to each is their own."}
{"text":"Good food and outstanding service!
At first I thought the menu was to random but everything we got was really good!
Kelly our server was really nice and made our \"date\" night perfect!"}
{"text":"On a Connecting flight back home stopped here for lunch and o how I wish there was one in NYC because this place was simply amazing. They got us out of there quickly since we needed to catch a flight. When you order 3 things and all of them blow you away they earn a hard 5 stars.
  
First we had the poached eggs from all the pics posted on Yelp we had to try and they were the best ive ever had cool to the touch!

I had the Short Rib Tacos came with Kale Salad and wow I'm not even a fan Kale but they threw sum grapes and quinoa and it was delicious. The Short Ribs were very tender and not very greesy which is usually the problem with that meat in tacos, the guac was top notch as well 

My lady had the Rib Eye steak and it brought the same sides as mine and the meat was perfectly cooked medium as she asked and was seasoned to perfection. The Rib Eye was so good they didn't do it justice having it in a taco as it can be an order by itself!

All in all its the best Airport food I've ever had hands down And They gave us a free cookie on our way out the door  COME TO NYC CHELSEA KITCHEN WE LOVE GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"This restaurant straddles the line between upscale and casual. The patio faces the canal and with plant covered lattice all over the patio, you feel transported out of the city.

Intimate dinner setting (see photos.) Quality food from Chef Tim Fields. We started with the Tuna Tartare and Guacamole with chips and a pitcher of White Sangria.

Rotisserie Chicken is a House Specialty. I had the Wedge Salad, chopped and the Rib-eye.

Competent/confident wait staff."}
{"text":"Update - 

Chelsea's Kitchen has staff that are really on top of their online presence, which is impressive to me. After I wrote my last review giving some constructive criticism on their timeliness of service, I received a message from CK and was offered a gift card to come back and try their service/food again. That's never happened to me before, and I really appreciated the gesture. I did go back with my husband and we tried steak tacos (YUM!), ribs, and kale salad, all of which were FABULOUS once again. I am happy to report that the service, despite it being a Friday night, was significantly better this time around. We were barely seated when we had someone taking our drink order, and the drinks arrived within 5 minutes (we ordered from the bar which always takes a little longer than, say, soda). I'm giving this place two thumbs up now!"}
{"text":"We stopped here during a long layover.  WOW!  I'm a pretty seasoned traveler and I literally would go here if I lived in Phoenix...even if I wasn't traveling.

What I like:
-The atmosphere is comfortable and not too loud.  It's a comfortable place to rest while traveling
-The food is incredible!  They offer a variety of items and you can even get gluten free and other healthy substitutions
-I had the Short Rib taco plate.  AMAZING.  TRY IT.
-The service is friendly and they don't bother you if you hand out a while in between flights

What I'd do differently: 
-Nothing.  It's great.  I will be going back the next time I fly through Phoenix!

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is always one of our favorite places to go out to eat when I'm in Phoenix. The service has always been friendly, efficient and professional. The food is great! We personally love the nachos and the tacos. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm still stuffed while I write this review from the dinner I just enjoyed. 

Never been here before... we were able to make a reservation since we were 5 people, but we also ate at 6 and it didn't get busy till 7. 

I started with a lemonade drink that was supposed to have vodka in it. I think it was missing. The Cesar salad I had I enjoyed very much. And for my main belly stuffing entree I had the short rib tacos. There was plenty of food to feed 2 people. I loved the homemade soft tortillas and gauc. 

Would I return, yes. I'd just get a different cocktail to start with."}
{"text":"I've been to Chelsea's several times.  In the past I've gone with my husband and some friends.  I wasn't impressed with the seating and the service.  That was about two years ago. My sister and I decided to try it again.  I'm so thankful I tried it again.  This time we sat over to the right when we went in.  It's funny because we were sitting at the bar (our favorite place of all areas of a restaurant).  We thought we were looking at a mirror and then we realized we were looking at the other side of the bar that was outside.  We had to laugh.  I guess because I've always been seated at a table I didn't care for the place.  Now that I was at my prime spot it felt different.  We ended up ordering the \"Brussel sprout\" salad that was so amazing that I have worked in my kitchen to reproduce the salad.  I now have it down pat, but I'm now a huge fan of Chelsea's Kitchen that I will be back again, but nobody puts baby in a corner and I will be sitting at that bar where I should have been all along. It's a wonderful place to take your friends and especially out of town guests."}
{"text":"I normally don't take the time to post negative reviews because enough people out there do that, but I feel that I was robbed when I came here with a friend for her birthday. The atmosphere was nice, and the place was packed. I figured the food had to be great. Reading the menu, I couldn't decide what to order because honestly, nothing looked good. I finally settled for the supposedly popular Santa Fe style eggs. I paid $19 for a mysterious meat drenched in a bland, oily sauce, with a runny egg and guacamole on top. I paid $24 for a \"famous\" white sangria pitcher that tasted like boxed wine mixed with club soda. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I would give Chelsea's kitchen zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"I went to Chelsea's a while ago and I cannot wait to return. Fantastic! We started with the tuna tartar and guacamole (umm... heaven!) My friend had the filet and I had the special which was lobster tacos. Simply delicious. The filet was SUPER tender and SUPER tasty. The tacos were delicious! The lobster was moist and tender and the tortillas were delicious and handmade! Yes it is a little pricey but you get what you pay for and it was well worth the few extra dollars. Great food and great atomosphere!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's simply delicious. Sit on the patio in spring or fall and it's an added bonus. You can't go wrong with whatever you choose."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful spot. Beautifully decorated with outdoor seating available. The menu was interesting a had a great variety. And the food and drinks were delicious. Valet parking available. A wonderful choice for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Dined with friends. Food and service consistently very good. Upbeat atmosphere whether your dining inside or on one of the patios. Casual dining at its best."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp and was satisfied! Had the Eggs Benedict with avocado on the side which the meat was somewhat salty but I like salt so I didn't mind.  I also ordered the bottomless mimosas for $12.00 which is very reasonable in price and the ceviche which was also pretty good.  The mimosas came premixed with OJ so other juices did not seem to be an option. The parking is mainly valet, free of charge but I'm sure tips are welcomed :) If you are looking for a more upscale eatery with a pretty view and a nice relaxed environment, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"It's a really cute restaurant.  We came here while on vacation with our two toddlers, and we opted to sit outside.  I was surprised at all of the debris, pollen, and flies hanging out on the patio.  The food was good, but very overpriced for what you get.  They do let kids eat for free (not sure if it's every night or just the night we were there), and that was nice.  My kids loved the macaroni and cheese, french fries, and fruit that came out for them.  My husband's ahi tuna sandwich was \"decent\", according to him.  I had a caesar salad - nothing out of this world, but it wasn't awful, either.  There were a lot of people there drinking at the bar, so it's probably not the most kid friendly place. Our waitress was great, though."}
{"text":"Just had the worst $14 breakfast of my life.  Coffee, two eggs, bacon, English muffin, fried potatoes, the \"Chelsea Classic\".  The coffee tasted like it had been on the burner all night.  The potatoes were overcooked and tough as shoe leather from being under a heat lamp for too long.  The bacon was the thinnest sliced pork I've ever seen.  The eggs were OK, but how do you screw up an egg?  They may have a decent rep for dining, but have your breakfast somewhere that won't charge Ritz prices for buffet food!"}
{"text":"This place is a Phoenix staple and every dish is amazing. The brussel sprout salad, short rib tacos, and prime rib are my favorites. Don't forget to grab a delicious cookie on your way out! I'm a big fan of weekend brunch too."}
{"text":"Well the device was good.   The cups of water we ordered were so nasty I can t believe they served it!  My brothers Diet Coke was syrupy.  We ordered Chelsea's burgers.   I liked mine and the fries had a nice seasoning.  My brother barely touched his and didn't like the seasoning on the fries.   We should've went to smash burger across the way    We could've made everyone happy."}
{"text":"Like the outdoor patio and taco plates. Fun place to take guests. One of my favorite spots in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Really good food! The burger was delectable, the short ribs were tasty in just the right way. I seriously recommend you get something that includes their house made tortillas.

About the service: they must be reading the reviews here, because Thursday night (day before yesterday) service was tremendous. Did not ever have to wait for anything, and they were proactive but not overbearing about checking up on us."}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE go to restaurants. Everything about it is GREAT!!! The food, the atmosphere and the service. The cornbread is to die for and the french fries are AMAZING!!!! My husband loves them so much he asked our waitress if she could find out how they season them and before we left my husband had the recipe. So FRIENDLY and FUN!!!!! Everything on the menu is WONDERFUL!!! I haven't had a meal I didn't care for yet. Sit outside if you can...it's so pretty and when the fireplace is lit so romantic. LOVE this place. Oh forgot to mention the GREAT BAR and drinks. Happy Hour too from 3pm to 6pm!!!! Weekend Brunch too.....this place is just the BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved my meal here! I especially loved their large outdoor seating patio area in the back, which was complete with heating lamps and a crackling fireplace to keep everyone warm on a crisp winter day. The food is awesome. Everything on the menu sounded delicious, and I decided to get he veggie burger which was super scrumptious and flavorful. The fries were also seasoned really well. I also had the gelato for dessert, and thought that it was pretty good as well. The service for me was spot on, super fast, and everyone was very kind and attentive. I would definitely love to come back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have always enjoyed going to Chelsea's kitchen... Their food is always amazing and consistent. 
When we found out our 16 month old son had severe food allergies we were worried about taking him out to eat. 
 Last month, we went to Chelsea's kitchen and mentioned our sons allergies to our waitress to see of there was possibly anything he could eat.  Although, I always carry back-up, it's nice a change for him to be able to eat out with his mom and dad.  
Within a few minutes, Chef Paul came out to introduce himself.  He wanted to double check about our sons allergies as he doesn't want things to get lost in translation.  He went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable along with making our son a delicious meal.
We went back again today, and once again Chef Paul went above and beyond.  Not only did he come out again, but he remembered us and our son and made us feel just as comfortable as he did the first time.
Chef Paul should go around and teach other chefs to be as professional and thorough as he is.  We can't say enough about him ... He is beyond phenomenal!"}
{"text":"The number of 5 star reviews this place has just baffles me. I have tried... really really tried....to love Chelsea's. The location makes it a popular spot for work lunches and happy hours so I get dragged in here at least once every couple months. With the exception of maybe the short ribs, I have never had anything but mediocre food and mediocre service. I am starting to think that the people who think this place is 5-star worthy just don't venture outside big restaurant chains that often. Chelsea's must seem like nirvana to someone who is used to Applebees, but there are SO many better places in town!

This last visit finally caused me to put the place on my shun list and prompted this review.

We went during the lunch rush - not their fault - which meant we had to valet (\"free\"...sure). But the hostess was nowhere to be found when I walked in and they clearly needed more than one person working the front for a little while during the big rush (hello? manager?) She eventually took my name but did not write down the number in my party. My friend got there and walked in to inquire as to the wait time. No big deal, 10 more minutes. Twenty minutes later, as we were melting away waiting on the patio, she went back inside to inquire again. The hostess was surprised to see her. She had forgotten we were out there. She sat us at one of the 7 tables that had come available while we waited.

Then the servers couldn't figure out whose table it was, so two people came to take our drink order. Again, not deadly, but still annoying after the hostess experience. Once they figured it out the service smoothly enough. I was a little annoyed that my club soda came in individually priced little bottles. had I remembered that I would have just ordered water. Right around the time our drinks came and the server went to take our order I realized how loud the place was. She was literally shouting so that we could hear her describe the specials.

This whole visit could have probably been saved with awesome food. But once again the food was just, meh. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Spinach Salad. The chicken was flabby and greasy, but not crispy. Most of the fried part actually fell off in peels of fat when they sliced the chicken. I tried to save a couple pieces, but the coating was so tough that I ended up just stripping off what hadn't fallen off on its own. The rest of the salad was pretty good, maybe a little overdressed.

My friend ordered the Howie Burger which she pronounced \"Good, but you can't screw up a burger.\" I beg to differ, considering the Vig manages to do it every time, but she seemed happy enough to eat the whole thing so that's something. The fries were seasoned with what tasted like the seasoning on BBQ chips and were a little tough. I don't like sweet seasonings on fries and this spice blend tasted like it had quite a bit of sugar in it. Maybe that's a personal preference, I thought it was weird.

Previous recent failures included:
Fish tacos - good fish but way too much of the melon salad on top and soggy tortillas
Brussel sprout salad - again, could have been great, but overdressed and soggy and skimpy on the other ingredients
Green Chile Burger - ordered medium...came out dry, heavy, and grey

Monica is still one of the loveliest bartenders in town, so I may get suckered into happy hour once in a while, but will stick to drinks for the remainder of the visits to this place."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and sat on the patio.  The weather was perfect that day so we enjoyed being our doors.  Parking was a bit of a pain but the food made up for it.  The swordfish tacos were very good.  I want to go back and try other things on the menu, but a perfect spot for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast meal came quick and was very tasty, recommend the fresh orange juice."}
{"text":"We were checked into our hotel and awaiting our departing flight the next morning to get back to reality. A friend mentioned Chelsea's and their awesome patio. We went early around 4:45PM for some cocktails and stayed on for dinner. It was so delicious. The Short Rib tacos were amazing as was the Shrimp Ceviche as a starter. The service was also outstanding. What a fantastic way to wrap up our vacation!"}
{"text":"This wasn't our first time visiting Chelsea's Kitchen, but I think the restaurant is deserving of a positive review!  Below are my thoughts:

- Food quality/taste 5/5!  We had the Tuna Sashimi ($18) and Kale & Quinoa ($14) salads.  Both were good!  The key lime pie ($8) is to die for and this wasn't the first time we've had this \"must have\" dessert!  A small gelato ($4) was a decent dessert option for a very reasonable price.  Nice wine and draft beer selections available!  Our server was very helpful in assisted us with a wine choice.
- Service 5/5 - server Stephanie P. was attentive, made recommendation as requested and she was pleasant!  A manager and another service assisted with our table and ensured a service experience that was \"top notch!\"
- Valet 5/5 - I dislike having to valet my vehicle, but the valet was friendly and even ran out to my vehicle when I forgot my reading glasses! 
- Hostess - 5/5 - friendly and we were seated in about 10 minutes.  
- The establishment - 4/5 - it is a bit noisy in the restaurant, but it was a Saturday night.  If you are looking for a semi-quiet date night then this might not be the place for you.  Also, with 100+ degree days in Phoenix the open concept in the bar area made the rest of the restaurant a bit warm.

Bottom Line: A restaurant worthy of your patronage!  Overall, high marks for Chelsea's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Love this place and atmosphere... The menu covers all the bases too. Deviled eggs are amazing and so are the short ribs."}
{"text":"my bro been bugging me to try this place for some time got in to day had the ahi burger it was good but it wasn't hot nor cold more room temp there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but it was my first time trying that type of burger I normally would get salmon won't vet in again the Cesar salad dressing was the best I ever had full of flavor you just want to but that all over my burger for some extra flavor didn't care for the lettuce to big of pieces the bar tender was not very friendly never filled my drink never ask how the food was just took order brought order gave check not even a smile maybe be back to try something else not to sure"}
{"text":"We like it.  It's a bit pretentious but everything in this area is.  Always had a decent meal here though.  We have both tried a few different things on the menu and have not been disappointed.  Only thing keeping it from a five is that it seems to be more important to be seen at Chelsea's kitchen than it does to really push the flavor profiles of the food.  It's good food, but it's not so something you walk away from astounded by."}
{"text":"Way too bland.  For an airport it might be a good place but if it wasn't for the captive audience this place is pretty weak.  Expensive, probably because of the location but it's just not that good. The regular Chelsea's kitchen is fine but the airport just seems to be phoning it in.  By not being a fast food chain it stands out, but I don't think anyone would come to the airport just to have lunch here."}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth goodness. I have never had fish tacos that were SO delicious! 

After a long wait and a really friendly and helpful staff who tried to speed up the process we were finally seated on the back patio. CK's patio is enchanting and to be honest, it's worth the ridiculous wait to sit back there. 

After a quick glance at the menu, me and my 3 other friends all ordered... Tacos! One of us ordered the pork, another the ribs, third the steak and me the swordfish. 

I'm sure that the swordfish was the best of the bunch though my friends would probably argue that. It was cooked so perfectly, the flavor was amazing and it really did melt in my mouth. The swordfish tacos came with gauc, picco de gallo and a small melon salad.

All of us were in complete heaven. Our meal was amazing, Nicole, our waitress was fun and attentive and the ambiance was perfect. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had their short-rib tacos and they were outstanding. Their deviled eggs are also really good. They remind of J. Alexander's on the Midwest. Always will I be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"This place is great! My first time was this past Friday. I would highly recommend this place during the nicer months. Has a great patio. What to like? If you are an old fashion fan, they make great ones. And they are on the happy hour menu, also. The food is good, close to great. I will definitely go back again, soon. AND If its just as good as last time, I will for sure write another review giving them 5 stars. Good Job, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Definitely order medium rare. We ordered coffee from the coffee press and that was great as well. Good service and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"What a great Sunday brunch spot. Right away we knew we wanted to sit outside on the patio. We put our name into the hostess and she told us it was 45 minutes for first available. Sat down outside and got a Bloody Mary and sangria at the bar. The time didn't go by too slow and before we knew it we got a text letting us know the table was ready. To start we had the chips and guac. FIRE stuff right there. We also asked for lemons with our waters 3 different times and they never came. Food was great and came out the kitchen quickly. Had the eggs Benedict and hotcakes. WOW. Delicious."}
{"text":"When in town I hit this place up many times during my stay. I always order a shredded kale salad with a side of ahi tuna, its my absolute addiction. I also love Brussels sprout salad, also with a side of ahi tuna. Its a great place for an adult gathering with the excellent bar menu and environment. As your walking out don't forget to grab some sea salt chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"I kind of loved it! Drinks were pricey (it's the airport), but service was great. I had the carnitas with fries and snow peas, and ate up the whole dish. Carnitas were moist, flavorful and freaking delicious. Maybe I had very low expectations for airport food, but this was great!"}
{"text":"Great, vibrant atmosphere when I arrived for lunch on a Saturday. Ordered the green chile burger with the kale salad, which were both great great! If the patio had just a little bit more shading that would be great! Though the prices per dish are on the higher end, portions are large and they use quality ingredients--so it feels worth it!"}
{"text":"When I review, it's very dish based, and if a favored dish disappears off the menu, I feel restaurant betrayal... for a long time, that was the case for me and my love for Chelsea's Kitchen. But I have returned, up for trying something new, equipped with yelped suggestions and an awesome dining buddy, I made a reservation and headed over.

Being a transplanted Phoenician, I hate valet parking... even if complimentary, I just prefer self parking... LUCKILY, I got the last parking space:) I have to say, watching the Valet was like watching a well oiled machine... very quick and they always asked each group waiting for their cars how their dining experience was. Service done right!

That is something I can also say about the service once I walked INSIDE Chelsea's. They seated us right down on our reservation rights and our waitress for the night was attentive, but not too attentive, chatty, but not too chatty. Water glasses were always filled and questions always answered and half orders even offered up. LOVE the service there! And that's coming from a person who usually doesn't care for service--Food trumps service for me, but when service is outstanding, it's plain as day and greatly appreciated!

So the dish I LOVED when Chelsea's first opened with their Chicken dinner complete with mashed potatoes, I think corn was on the plate as well and a cinnamon roll... YES, cinnamon roll. I believe they still have the chicken, but the roll has rolled off the plate:( I know to most it may have looked strange, but it was like having a free dessert and I MISS it so! And I wonder if the chicken is the same... crispy skin with juicy meat inside and generous portions? I hope so, though I spied a few \"chicken was dry\" reports on yelp that make me veer away from ordering it again.

The menu has always been difficult for me because I'm not one to order tacos or burgers, for which Chelsea's is well known. And other things on the menu sound tasty but then there's the \"except for.\" Case in point: Attempting to share the Wedge Salad was difficult because of the Blue cheese involved... I'm particular about cheese, preferring milder flavors like Mozzarella. In asking my fellow foodies at work what they loved they screamed Seafood tacos... swordfish, scallops, Lobster. And I was ready to do it to take that Chelsea's taco plunge, but my buddy had a better idea: Sharing the Chefs Short Ribs and Mash... Crisp but not burnt on the outside and soft on the inside. It was like the perfect dinner roll, Beef-style! It came with 4 portions so perfect to split in two.

For an appetizer, I do love their Nachitos. It was warm and refreshing at the same time and definitely could make a meal all on it's own.

For dessert, can't say I remember anything being to die for... or rather, having ROOM for dessert outside of the Cinnamon Roll, BUT I can say great things about the Dessert Martinis... My partner in crime had to try the Espresso or Chocolate Martini... she couldn't decide and asked if she could blend the Godiva Chocolate Liquor with a hit of Espresso... Our waitress gladly asked the bartender and we got it + overage. We toasted to a good meal she, with her Martini Glass and I with the extra 'tini in the cap of the shaker. That drink is DANGEROUS. Tastes harmless but could get you pretty tipsy.

Lastly, ambiance... I love it... with it's fire places and warm wood and brick accents It makes me feel like I'm somewhere else in the US, somewhere colder where you want to stay inside and sit by the fire. Definitely a nice place to bring your folks when they visit or for a lovely date or dinner with a good friend.

Next up for me, is a brunch visit! I wonder if I can order off the kids menu... Lil monkey pancakes and PB&J sushi? I'm Kid menu jealous!

P.S. Kids eat FREE everyday 3pm to 6pm and Happy Hour 3pm to 6pm - 7 Days a Week... now that's a plus!"}
{"text":"I love any place that has warm salted chocolate cookies at the front entrance - perfect for a small nibble while I wait for my table or as a small dessert on my way out. I have been here twice now and have really enjoyed my meals both times. Their tacos are amazing, the burger I had was delicious and their breakfast hash was so yummy. This place seems to have a lot of customers, many seem to be regulars, which is a good sign. I'm sure that the hubs and I will be back. Me likey!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything they serve is great! The atmosphere is nice a casual, just the way we Phoenicians like it!"}
{"text":"Bar and Patio a solid 4 stars.  Food and restaurant 2 stars. (4+2)/2 = 3 stars.  The cocktails are good, but the food completely uninspired."}
{"text":"This is another place thst I adore...the crispy chicken spinach salad is the greatest salad on the menu and the tacos...lobster r my favorite...r like no others...the restaurant is impressive on the inside just the only drawback is that the bar area is small...the drinks r fabulous tho...i love the sundae cuz u get to put on all ur own toppings...dont forget to get a mini salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen was on my \"Places to Try for Brunch\" list for a while.  Months ago, I ran across an article on azcentral.com that listed Chelsea Kitchen a must try place for brunch because they were offering unlimited mimosas for $12 on Saturdays.  Unfortunately, I never made it.  Sunday, 5 of us went to Chelsea's kitchen for brunch.  2 of my friends were there when I arrived, waiting patiently with mimosas.  They immediately told me ... bad news ... No more unlimited mimosas.  I wasn't too bummed out because I thought the unlimited mimosas deal was Saturdays only.  Once our server came over to take my drink order, I ordered a mimosa anyway.  She also told me immediately ... we no longer do unlimited mimosas.  Obviously, this was a big deal for patrons of Chelsea's Kitchen!  After all of us ordered one mimosa, one of my friends ordered a pitcher of Sangria.  The Sangria pitchers are made with white wine only.  There was a bit too much fruit in it for our liking.  It made the sangria VERY bitter, way too much lemon and orange. Another friend ordered a Bellini.  About 20 -30 minutes later the server came to bring us out food and we asked about the Bellini.  She informed us that the bar was a little backed up because it's prime brunch time. ... Understood!  She then also informed us that they do not serve Bellinis and she thought he ordered a Bloody Mary.  Huh?!  Bellini and Bloody Mary doesn't sound alike at all so we're not sure why she thought he said Bloody Mary but hey ....

On to the good part.  The food was out of this world good.  I ordered the short rib hash - Delicious!  Scrumptious from the first bite, however it was cold ...not cold as if the plate was in the refrigerator, but cold as in it sat back there in the kitchen for a while. Another friend ordered the chicken tacos.  He loved them.  Another friend ordered the Mexican chicken meal (I can't remember the name) but that dish was cold!  She let us try it, I stuck my fork into the very middle of her dish and for sure .. it was cold.  Another friend ordered his meal a la carte.  He ordered 3 eggs and 1 order of bacon.  What he received was 1 egg and 3 orders of bacon.  He has about 8 -10 pieces of bacon on his plate and 1 scrawny cold egg.  We mentioned this to the server and she said nope .. this is correct.  My short rib hash came with 2 eggs on top, the 2 eggs on top of my Short Rib Hash was more than the \"supposedly\" 2 eggs on his plate so we all knew this was wrong.  The server's defense \"Well if I were to cook 3 or 4 eggs at home it wouldn't look like this either\".  We all just looked at each other in confusion.  She offered to put in another order for 1 more egg but who in the heck is paying for another cold, very small egg.  Lastly, another friend ordered the prime rib with kale salad.  That was the only warm dish!  Honestly, the only warm one. 

Although the flavors were really good, we still ate our food in disappointment because everything was cold and the service was bad.  I was the only one that's never been to Chelsea Kitchen so I didn't know what to expect but my friends have and they were super disappointed.  When we asked for our bill we noticed that my friend's receipt said \"2 eggs and 1 side of bacon\".  We knew damn well he didn't receive 3 eggs in the first place and instead of the server saying \"If I were to cook 3-4 eggs at home\" it wouldn't look like this\", she should have said \"Wow, you're right.  Let me check on this\".  That would have been greatly appreciated.  
I'm giving Chelsea's Kitchen a 4 star review anyway because the food was so damn tasty ... everything was.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day. I'd like to try them again ... maybe for happy hour."}
{"text":"First time to eat here.   Greeted and seated quickly  After 18 hours of airport hell I was hungry. 
Great server. I ordered the French dip with fries. The fries were perfect! Hot and crispy and nicely seasoned. The sandwich was huge and had a great sized portion of meat. I wanted horseradish and came to find out on my bill I was charged $1.50 extra for it. That was somewhat disappointing considering the price of the sandwich 
$ 19. The Au jus was too greasy for my taste and rather bland and under seasoned 
For a change of pace at PHX it is worth eating here before you go through security or if you have time to spare leave the gate area 
Pricy but I had meal vouchers (thanks AA) 
Sandwich and ice tea $24 
I fly through PHX regularly and get tired of the same limited choices in the gate areas."}
{"text":"Update: After posting this review, the restaurant got in contact with me to make it right. Their response was quick and shows that they really value their customers. I would definitely give this place another shot and I'm confident that it was just an off night. I would like to change my stars to 5 stars now. 

With it being noted that we had eaten some appetizers elsewhere first and that we went right before it closed, the food wasn't that great. I think our friends who ordered tacos were a lot happier with their food. (I guess generally people who order tacos instead of a kale salad are probably happier with their food.) We ordered salmon with our salad and for some reason it didn't print right on the ticket to the kitchen and we had to wait extra after all our food came out. When we ordered dessert apparently the freezer wasn't working and the gelato was melted and limited as to which we could order. (They said the freezer wasn't working right.) Our desserts were comped on the whole table because of the freezer situation but I would have liked to have been given more as we had to wait until our friends were almost done eating to enjoy the salmon that went with our salad."}
{"text":"I typically love Chelsea's Kitchen and tend to always order the same thing, fish tacos.  This time, I wanted to try something different. I asked the waitress about the veggie tacos and what kind of veggies it came with. She told me portobello mushrooms, peppers, onions, and a little bit of radish. My meal arrived and to my surprise, it looked like I ordered onion tacos. $18 for onion tacos? Gross. There were a few slivers of red pepper and ONE sliver of mushroom.  I asked the waitress if it was supposed to look like that and she said she would bring out more mushrooms.. which she did.. 5 more small slivers of mushroom. Let's just say I won't be ordering that again and will stick to the usual. Giving this 3 stars because my waitress was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love the food, the atmosphere, and the service. Been a couple times and plan to go again very soon. No complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my mom's birthday for brunch. We thought we'd try something new and we were very impressed. As soon as we sat down the service was impeccable all the waiters and waitresses were happy and smiling and quick to refill my sister and I's mimosas ($12 for endless). We sat out on the patio, the trees produced just enough shade and the chirping birds made put us all in a great mood. Their breakfast menu is small but what we ordered was fantastic! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was teetering between five and four stars and two things pushed me to the five... best white sangria and best red velvet cake which I have tried a lot of both.  Love it for lunch, dinner, or drinking on the patio.  I have been here several times but this is my first review.  Service is always fantastic, it is a great place for kids (better without did I mention white sangria).  When it comes to what I like to eat, there are so many choices.  The nachos are my first favorite but you need a friend to share them with you or get as an appetizer for a group.  I suggest ordering them the \"old way\" which means with black beans on them.  I encourage you to find your favorite.  Ohhhhhhh, I almost forgot this place make fantastic soup, this day it was vegan squash.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I went here on a date with the GF last weekend, and was not disappointed.  We knew we were going to have to wait on a Friday night, but the wait doesn't feel so bad there.  The bar area was a great place to have a drink, and it is fairly lively.  If you can, sit on the outside part.  They have an amazing patio area.  Plus, they have one of my all time favorite beers (from when I lived in Oregon) on tap - Mirror Pond.

The service & food were great.  I had the Ahi Tuna Burger, and she had the veggie tacos.  Being a gentleman, I didn't eat her food, but she assured me via text message while writing this that the food was really good.  She also wanted to let you all know that they put sweet potato in the tacos, which was amazing.  (Now, I really wish I would have snuck a taco)  Anyway...

Prices were reasonable, and the whole restaurant has a great energy and vibe as well.  It is nice to see all sorts of different groups of people enjoying a night out.  Sometimes I feel all the people in a restaurant can look the exact same.

Go here & you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The short rib hash topped with two eggs over easy served in a savory demiglaze was perhaps one of the best things I've ever had out for breakfast.  I asked them to add fresh jalapeños to kick it up a notch and it was absolutely superb!"}
{"text":"This is probably the least interesting review I've ever written but this place doesn't give me much to go on. The patio is beautiful and romantic and I liked the open concept of the inside. I have to agree with the other yelpers that the deviled eggs and red velvet cake are to die for but the main dishes we had were bland and not really worth mentioning. They weren't bad just not WOW. Service was also fair. I will say that if you are going on a first date this would be a good place to go."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen came highly recommended to me by one of my friends in Phoenix. I had a good three hours to kill at the airport so I decided to come here and sit at the bar so I could catch up on reading and hang out. The pretty man bartender I had was rude, lacked any personality and I think was a mute......other than that......this place is great! The other bartender who helped me towards the end was wonderful, hostesses lived up to the name and food was amazing. I got the Brussels salad and it filled all of my cruciferous desires (is there such a thing??) It was huge so I took some to go along with their salted chocolate chip cookies, again, the cookies came recommended by my friend. You can grab a few small ones in their glass case by the hostess stand or buy a huge one at their grab and go spot for $3. Really, if it wasn't for my crappy bartender this place would be a five so it's definitely a legit spot for food when at Sky Harbor!"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this place was surprisingly good. Nice selection of beers, and several items on the menu that immediately caught my attention. 

I finally settled and the tuna tartare with avocado. It was fresh, well-balanced, and came with enough chips (which, for some reason, is a rarity with this dish at other restaurants). It did have more onions than I would have preferred, but when eaten with everything else, I didn't even notice. 

Maybe the best part is that at the front they have a plate or chocolate chip cookies with fat salt crystals. The cookies were free and had no strings attached, which is rare (especially in an airport) and a very nice surprise. 

The only reason this place gets 4 stars is the price. I get that it's in the airport, but it was absurdly overpriced."}
{"text":"If we can get in this place is one of our favorite.  Steak tacos are the best around.  Patio is the way to go very cool environment"}
{"text":"This was a very enjoyable dinner with eight guests. Very good service once we were seated. We had reservations @ 7p which we were late for by 25 minutes.. So we had to wait for a table even after we called prior to 7p to inform them of our delay.
Would absolutely return here for green chile corn bread, fried Dixie chicken and spit roasted prime rib !"}
{"text":"Great food great service and the friendliest chef Keith around. And Kelly my waiter was awesome!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry at the Phoenix Airport, just take one piece of advice. Eat something on the \"freedom\" side of the security checkpoint. Once you get past security, every food source is packed and seats at which to enjoy your marked up food are far and few between. 

Having learned this the hard way in the past, I grabbed a sandwich at the \"To Go\" part of Chelsea's Kitchen. Had \"The Commuter,\" which consists of eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo on an English muffin. It also includes a tasty side of fresh fruit. 

A kind woman took my order with a smile and forewarned me it would be about a 10 minute wait because the kitchen was backed up. Okay so it was a bit longer than 10 minutes. It happens. 

Sandwich was good. Fruit was good. All perfect before boarding a flight...where you get to eat whatever you can find on the floor. 

I've read good things about the sit-down part of the restaurant so I plan to try that on the next trip."}
{"text":"It was dark when I came to Chelseas Kitchen's patio. Very cozy, and very relaxing. I get the feeling that I didnt get to witness this place when it is in its prime, but what I experienced was good, very good. 

I never really left the patio, because the ambiance out there was amazing and induced mingle - which was the purpose of my evening. The option to sit down and have a more personal conversation was always there, but never used. Instead I browsed through the crowd silently, staying out of the conversations unless I was called out on being the smirking observer. 

The service was not super attentive, but very friendly and knowledgable. I felt very at home at this place, and never that I had to become indescreet to obtain service. I also had some awesome porter, which name was forgotten by the first sip. 

The sortiment of beers and drinks is way sufficient. I will be coming back here, it is just in a part of town I dont frequent all that often. Kinda sad, I wish I did. 

Chitty chitty .. der kritiker"}
{"text":"We began visiting Chelsea's Kitchen for Mother's Day five years ago.  Now it's a tradition.  The fried chicken is something amazing and the ambient is very welcoming, even with four kids we don't feel a bit out of place.  We love the patio which is shaded by mesquite trees and the brick fireplace."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen is decent. The food is pricey for what it is and it isn't totally outstanding. For some reason when I search- kid friendly restaurants- CK pops up. I definitely wouldn't consider CK \"kid friendly.\" Other than that it's your run of the mill Arcadia restaurant that offers unnecessary valet and cliche cocktails."}
{"text":"I just had one of the best meals of my life at this joint!  I ate everything on my plate which is something my small stomach never can seem to accomplish.  

I ordered a veggie nut burger - which is hands down the best I have ever had!  I have been a vegetarian for 6 years and have had veggie burgers all over the world, this one tops it!  I think it might have something to do with it being a \"nut\" burger which is not like the usual black bean or mashed veggie burger.  I also liked how it was chard a little, which gave it that comforting BBQ-like texture.  I chose the steamed vegetables as a side dish which came out as perfectly seasoned and cooked green beans.

For desert I ordered the red velvet cake (its not on the menu - so ask!), and it was the second best red cake I have ever had - the first is my mama's recipe.  I consider myself a bit of a red cake snob, but this one gets two thumbs up! 

The parking lot a bit too small, which is the downside."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for the first time a couple weeks ago. We had an appetizer, two entrees, and two desserts and everything was great. The patio looked like it would be great to sit at when the weather is cooler. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere at both their main and airport locations are always great...lunch and dinner especially.  Of course the cookies at exit are something we always look forward to ending our meals with.  Panic ensues if they ever look like they are going out of them!!!  My complaint (and I will be in the minority here according to reviews), is Chelsea Kitchen's coffee.  The presentation is great with the French press, but the coffee is always weak and we find the flavor not good at all (this is over the past few years we have been going).  Sadly, this is a deterrent for us when we think of breakfast or brunch places because of our consistently bad experience with their coffee.  So many other great places in town that serve amazing coffee. : ("}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and had to give this a try, even thought it meant exiting the security-cleared area and having to go BACK through security.

I had a 2 hour layover between flights and had been traveling for 12 hours, so I stopped in here for breakfast on the run. The servers were kind of aggressive, but I ordered a white sangria (ok), and an omelet (EXCELLENTE!). Based on the omelet, if they do everything else on the menu as well, this place really does live up to expectations!

Only reason I didn't grade 5 stars, was because the breakfast menu was limited, and the servers (although helpful), seemed a little pushy (but efficient)."}
{"text":"Outstanding service but the music was blaring to the point you couldn't talk and the grilled trout was dry. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant at the airport.  Every single restaurant past the security checkpoints is always packed.  The only place that can handle all the chaos is LGO.  But instead of hiking to those gates, we just sit down to a nice dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen.

It is wonderful to have the many Phoenix based restaurants in Terminal 4.  It makes me feel like even if you just come through the airport you can see something that truly represents Phoenix while you're there.

Even when there is a wait at this restaurant the service is always fantastic.  If they mess up your order they do everything they can to make it right (it gets busy, and I become extra understanding, esp if they try to rectify).  We've done breakfast, lunch and dinner, all yummy and a great start to our trips.  I'm generally not a fan of airport food, but I always look forward to dining at Chelsea's Kitchen if we're headed to the airport. :)"}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar.  Kim or Pam, not sure about name, she's so great.  Good recommendations.  Love the short rib taco platter.  Comes with corn tortilla, guacamole, salsa.  The ahi taco is good too. But my soul food go to is the short rib.  So glad they opened a branch at the airport. Food comes out fast!"}
{"text":"What can I say??  This place is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix!   The outdoor patio is really cool and the service has always been spot on.  They even have coca-cola in the bottle!  I have never had a bad meal here and the rib eye steak tacos are awesome with the homemade pancake style tortillas!  You can not go wrong at Chelsea's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Still GREAT food!  Service , yet again is solid.   I'd almost come here without a reason to travel!"}
{"text":"I went here late on a Wednesday night and we had almost the whole restaurant to ourselves. The service was phenomenal and our waiter was so sweet and attentive. She really made our experience great! As an appetizer we got the deviled eggs which were phenomenal! I got the black bean burger and it was different than ones I am used to but the unique twists put on it were delicious, like nut cheese! It came with more than enough french fries that were uniquely seasoned as well! So delicious! I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I decided to head out to dinner last night and decided on Chelsea's Kitchen. We've always been super fans of LGO so this just made sense to us. The menu is a bit all over the place, which I don't mind but my wife didn't find much she was interested in.  I had the short ribs with roasted veggies and a fried egg on top. Awesome dish, I could eat that again and again! The short ribs were cooked to perfection, the sauce velvety and delicious and the veggies perfect! The addition of the over easy egg on top was sublime! My wife ended up just getting a caesar salad and the ceviche, which are staples from LGO. Overall great service, ambiance and most importantly good food."}
{"text":"Come here just for the Brussels sprout salad, the rest is gravy. 

Far far far far far away from airport food."}
{"text":"Excellent veggie burger and kale slaw. A great treat for an airport eatery."}
{"text":"I had a lovely lunch on the patio at Chelsea's.  The service was friendly and timely and the short rib street tacos were absolutely fabulous.  The tacos come deconstructed so you build them to taste with meltingly tender short ribs, guacamole, salsa fresca and salsa on hand made corn tortillas.  My girlfriend had the seared ahi tacos and they were just as good.  They have a nice wine list and the patio was wonderful."}
{"text":"Went to Chelsea's Saturday for brunch and bottomless mimosas.Pleased with the food it is always very consistent, however, it does take a while to refill the bottomless."}
{"text":"I'm slightly biased because this is one of my neighborhood hubs (and I live across the street), but Chelsea's Kitchen has yet to disappoint. I've tried almost everything on the menu (with my favorites being the short rib tacos, green chile burger, and veggie tacos), and love the complimentary salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out.

I'd say my ONLY gripe is that I do think it is mildly overpriced--HOWEVER I always, always get my money's worth. This spot is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation. With their strong menu and friendly, accommodating staff, I definitely recommend Chelsea's."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Bottomless mimosas on Saturdays, small but delicious brunch menu, and a wonderful patio. I'd come here every Saturday if I could. You won't regret trying this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Chicken Nachitos and Swordfish Tacos are a favorite."}
{"text":"So we just went to celebrate a friend's birthday here. Everyone so excited and eager about the menu, wide variety. HOWEVER, 2 of the guests at our table found hair in their food. The soup had a very long hair and the salad had a short curly hair. Upon investigation NO ONE in the kitchen was wearing a hair net. Can you say GROSS!!! Not much reconciliation from management."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place!! What the heck???? Walked in and was never greeted. After a few minutes I walked up and asked if we could be seated. She looked at us like we were another burden in her night. Never greeted. Just put the menus down and walked away. 10 min later a waitress walked up and asked us what we wanted. No greeting, no smile. \"What do you want ladies\"? Drinks took another 15 minutes to get. Had to flag her down 20 min later to take our food order. Our food was put down on the table and our waitress never said a word, just walked away. Food was delish!!! But the crappy service took the pleasure out of eating. Felt very unwelcome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and not just for an airport! I was seated quickly and my order was taken immediately. The food came fast and I loved the kale and quinoa salad along with the added chicken; it was light, fresh and tasty. The only knock was they were slow to get the check and I had even gotten my credit card out already. Not a deal breaker but then once they took my card, it seemed to take them a long time to bring back my final receipt. Those two stumbles were why I put 4 stars instead of 5"}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with a friend and boy was I blown away! I ordered the Sea Bass Fish Special with the most divine chicken pisole soup that I have ever had. My girlfriend had the Del Mar salad and can I just say we will absolutely be coming back. Not only did the food knock your socks off but the service was great. It's nice to feel good about spending your money in a restaurant knowing that the service and food was completely worth it. If you're looking for somewhere to go that will leave you feeling warm and cozy inside, Chelsea's is the place!"}
{"text":"Oh, Chelsea's Kitchen, how I love thee. I don't usually wax on about restaurants, but I love everything about this place. It isn't fine dining, but the food is good and I'm always in a good mood as I walk up to the front door of this establishment. The service is always friendly, from the host at the door to every server or bartender I have ever dealt with there. 

I love the bar, whether I'm sitting on the inside or outside sections. If the weather is good, the patio tables are SO worth the wait. Last weekend, after a long morning run, Chelsea's Kitchen was our reward. As we sat, drinking our beers, we planned a future backyard filled with mesquite trees that provided a natural canopy of shade. Seriously, I could have sat there and drank all day. Come to think of it, I don't know why we didn't. 

Food-wise, I am a huge fan of the rib-eye tacos. Their burgers are are excellent, as well. You're not going to see a James Beard award associated with Chelsea's Kitchen. It's not that kind of place. The food is good and simple. The ambiance is casual and fun; nice enough for a business dinner, and casual enough for lunch with friends. I've never walked out of there anything but happy and will return again and again."}
{"text":"I love the cozy home feeling I get when I walk in to Chelsea's, SO NICE AND WELCOMING!! 
However, I am a patio lover, so I prefer sitting outside, at the caved in by trees and umbrellas patio, with a mighty fine fireplace!! 
Our food was just okay, I had their Green Chile Burger and It was good, It could have been better, I'm sure. It was just missing a kick, maybe complementing veggies or sauce?? I'm not sure, but something!! Honestly, I don't really eat burgers all that much, but when I crave a fatty burger I expect it to be amazing and nothing less, come on now!!! :) 
We also had the ceviche as our appetizer and that was delicious, super small portion though, that is the reasoning for my 4 stars this time, such a small portion on one of my favorite dishes, CEVICHE!!! OH WELL :) Other than that we enjoyed the bottomless Mimosas and a fine pitcher of the oh soo delisiosa Sangria!! YUM!! 
 No dessert, or tummies were full of Sangria and Mimosas!!!  What a heartbreak  :)  

Parking is impossible during peak hours, so be early!! :)"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite spots for brunch ever! I
always try to come here whenever I'm visiting AZ. My favorites are the lemon hot cakes and the prime rib hash. So delicious! I've also been here for lunch and dinner and it's been just as amazing. They're chocolate chip sea salt cookies are so good too!"}
{"text":"The Hubs and I went here before a show this Wednesday.  I must say, the valet attendants were extremely nice and friendly as well as efficient.  I don't think the staff inside was as warm and friendly, but overall the service was A-OK.  I really liked the atmostphere inside, in fact, we sat right by the wood fireplace and it was very cozy and delightful.

So, my overall thoughts on the food were that it was tasty, but really the only thing that blew me away was the guacamole.  It was fabulous!  It came with a very splendid roasted tomato salsa and crispy corn tortilla chips.  We also shared the soup of the day, which in my opinion wasn't too good.  It was a modified tortilla soup, but it was oddly sweet, which isn't what I was looking for at all.  For our entree, we shared the rotissere chicken, which was quite good.  I especially liked the side dishes (spatzle and garlic spinach).

Overall, I would go back and try some other items on the menu that have been reviewed on yelp, but I wasn't blown away by any means."}
{"text":"Love the greyhounds and they have wonderful food. Always consistently on point with a wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best airport meals I've ever eaten. Delicious   From the posole to the short-rib tacos it was excellent."}
{"text":"I wanted to call in a to go order for myself and my kids but the management of Chelsea's Kitchen, in all of their wisdom, decided that I can't do that after 5. I need to order in person and sit in the restaurant and wait. Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this pretty gem on the canal. The chicken nachos were enormous. Fed 5 of us. Definitely get that. Had rib eye tacos. Super scrumptious and tender. Can eat this as a regular steak plate. Didn't really eat the tortillas. But they're homemade and cute."}
{"text":"For airport food, this is about as nice as you can get...or at least as nice as I've ever found!

We sat down and our server came and greeted us, took a drink order and came back.  We had plenty of time before our flight so we weren't in a big rush.

My wife ordered the Swordfish Tacos and I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken.  She said the tacos were delicious!  

My chicken came with mashed potatoes and huge carrots.  The chicken and potatoes were great.  Would have liked a little better variety in vegetables, but that didnt effect my star-rating. 

Our bill was $65.00 with tax for 2 meals and 1 cocktail."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome food and atmosphere, try the short rib tacos! Only complaint, they discontinued their happy hour menu for food. But other than that, great place to eat!"}
{"text":"It's outside the terminal so the food quality is a little better.  They ran out of the prime rib, so we were offered the ribeye in a platter form as opposed to tacos.  The ribeye was fairly thin and heavily seasoned (salty).  If it were in taco I guess this could be masked with the additional veggies and tortilla.  However, by itself it was too salty.  

Could have been my fault I guess, I could have ordered something else, like the taco version."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch on St. Patty's Day, celebrating our anniversary. It was very busy, but the service was excellent. For the soup of the day they had an Irish potato soup with soda bread. We asked for more bread because it was so good, and had only given one piece, but had no problem coming out with 2 more pieces.  Love the patio, the food was amazing, and had a great experience."}
{"text":"This place nails it every time! I always anticipate a wait no matter what time I go as this place is THAT popular. Their sangria is delicious, tuna sashimi salad with ginger lime dressing is just WOW and the red velvet cake is simply scrumptious. The only problem I have had here was asking for no cilantro in my salad - it seemed to cause a problem. But everything else is so great that something like that is far too minor to affect my rating. They have a great patio and a lot of seating space. The service is always great as well."}
{"text":"First time here. Took my BFF for her birthday at the recommendation of a few friends. And I informed our waiter of that.

When you get there no choice but valet b/c they take up the bulk of the pkg spots. It's free but don't forget to tip!

We got a table inside right away.

Our waiter was tied up so another server came & took our drink order. We both ordered ice tea. I asked if it came sweetened or unsweetened. She said unsweetened. Got the ice tea & not happy w/ taste b/c she neglected to tell us it was Passionfruit (& sweet) flavored. Think that is important to let the customer know. Sent it back. And asked for a Sprite. So it took a while to get that & was surprised to get a CAN of Sprite? So for the cost of a can (outrageous) it took that long to get one?!

We ordered an appetizer & then our meals. Our waiter checked on us & said the appetizer would be out in a few minutes. Imagine our surprise when our entrees came out and no appetizer. The girl who delivered them had no clue. Our waiter came over & apologized that it happened. The mgr brought the appetizer & they both informed us it would be comped.

Then since it was the BFF's bday we ordered a dessert to share. Imagine our surprise when the dessert was delivered by someone else with a lit candle saying Happy Birthday!!! And it was the wrong dessert.... So we politely said thank you & blew out the candle and set it aside. Waiter came over a few minutes later and immediately saw it was wrong one, apologized profusely, took it away & brought back the right one. He also comped that as well. So service-wise it was ok. And they really did their best to make up for it. I attributed it to it being a beautiful Sunday brunch rush. And that is why I only gave 4 stars. 

Now that was the service.... The food was another story..... 5 stars for sure!!! Deviled eggs w/ bacon/truffle - ahhhhmazing! Prime rib - perfect! The veggie was asparagus & I abhor asparagus so the chef made me some fabulous sautéed spinach & I adore spinach. BFF ordered the short rib tacos - mouth watering! Guacamole was fabulous! So we totally picked off each other's plate. The red velvet cake was yummy & vanilla bean gelato even yummier!!

We decided even with the lapses in service, our waiter was great, he made up for the lapses, food was fabulous, we would go back & also recommend it to others. Everyone can have an \"off\" day and if we go back and get a repeat in the service area.... then we will reconsider coming back or recommending to others."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I love the casual, at-home ambiance and the DELICIOUS food.  This place is a great bang for the buck!  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. St. Bernardus on tap and the food was outstanding. I had the surf n turf tacos. It came with kale salad which was a delicious blend of sweet and sour, but seemed out of place with the entree... I will make sure to change my side next time. Overall this place is amazing. Great, intimate atmosphere and a nice, relaxed, naturally shaded patio next to a canal. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chelsea's Kitchen with my family  since it opened, and have always had a great experience. This time I went with a group of six to Chelsea's, was greeted by a very kind host, and sat on the patio. Our drinks took a while to get to us, but no big deal. While our food was pretty good, the waitress Stephanie made the experience miserable. I had to ask multiple times for silverware and a napkin, got a napkin, never received silverware. Ended up eating with my hands. When asked to split the check, she acted extremely put out, and frustrated. A friend picked up the tip for my tab, and when she saw she didn't receive a tip on one of the bills, she said \"wow, great tip\" and scoffed. Very disappointed, sad this place is no longer a go to."}
{"text":"Mouth watering, delicious food. The guacamole is unbelievable. Plus their deviled eggs appetizer tastes homemade. Then their tacos are to die for. I left full, satisfied and happy. I will definitely go there again and again! The atmosphere is awesome as well."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place and the atmosphere is top notch.  If I had to eat at the same place every day it would have to be Chelsea's Kitchen.  Amazing food, every time and the staff are friendly and awesome!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, had the chili corn bread and eggs Benedict.  The food was spot on and let me tell you about the corn bread- a must have! Moist and baked to perfect.  Valet parking is a nice touch, the overall service was amazing.  Sitting inside allowed for nice conversation but on a nice day get there early to sit outside it looked very enjoyable with trees shading things."}
{"text":"I was just there for dinner and the food, as always, was amazing. My 3 star review is based on our waitress. She was very awkward and seemed offended every time we asked for more time. I get you want to turn tables but please do not make me feel uncomfortable with your disingenuous forced smile."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the Airport and Karen the bartender is the best , very attentive , customer orientated without being entrusive  . try the chicken , its Fab . Well be back"}
{"text":"Best Sunday Brunch Place in town!!!

Visited Chelsea's Kitchen for Brunch for the first time on Sunday and we couldn't have been happier with the service or the food.

The managers Chris and Matt, and our server Lilly, made our visit the most pleasant and memorable we have had for a long time. We felt very welcome and special from the start, when we were seated at a wonderful table, to the finish, when Chris packaged some of those wonderful sea salt chocolate cookies to take home with us.We  seemed to never be without someone refilling our water or wine glasses, or suggesting something new try.   

The service aside, I was impressed by the prices of everything, very reasonable, nothing over $20 on the brunch menu except for a few specialty beef items, most everything mid $10s. I was equally impressed by the wine selection and prices, it being Sunday Brunch we settled on a Bottle of Prosecca which they had for only $28, what a steal, and it was fabulous. I even wrote it down so I could buy it myself later.


The food equaled the service, it was all absolutely marvelous.

We had the Deviled Eggs for an appetizer, we order the small serving which was our mistake because they were so good we ended up ordering another. 

Then for Brunch amongst us,  we ordered the French Omelet, the Day Break Omelet and the Brussel Sprout Salad. They all went perfectly well with the Prosecca. I had the French Omelet and  it was the best Omelet I have had in a long time. First it was huge, second it was perfectly cooked, the eggs were light and fluffy, third, it was filled with this incredible melted Guyere Cheese and fresh spinach. I tried the Day Break Omelet as well and it was equally as good, and health conscious to boot. I also tried the Brussel Sprout Salad, I had never had anything like it before in my life. The sprouts weren't wilted and soggy like you normally expect, these were green, crisp, perfectly cooked. The crisp srouts coupled with the saltiness of the bacon and the sharpness of the long shavings of Manchego cheese made it a perfectly balanced salad with tons of flavor and textures. I will definately order it again the next time we visit. 

For desert, we had the French Press coffee which is always a favorite of ours when its available, and it was wonderful here. We tried to pass on desert, in an attempt at being good, but then Chris convinced us to try the seasonal Pumpkin Pie, evidently it is only available this month, THANKS CHRIS!!!!, it was the best Pumpkin Pie I had ever had, truly, you should go this month and try it before it is gone. I can tell you we will go back for it, and all the rest of the increadible food and service at  Chelsea's Kitchen, you can't go wrong there, we highly recommend it, its a new favorite place to go."}
{"text":"Great place for a close group of friends to meet up, share a pitcher of delicious white sangria, and exchange witty banter.

The wait staff was attentive and friendly.  The drinks were phenomenal.  However, the only person's dish that blew us out of the water was mine (the short rib taco platter).  The other two dishes (the rotisserie pork taco platter the ahi tuna burger, and the del mar salad) were underwhelming .  My fiancée didn't even finish his burger.  The corn tortillas masked a lot of the flavoring and I wish they could provide alternatives.

I would return here with a group of friends but only to have some drinks and order very specific menu items."}
{"text":"Airports just don't get it !  The usual is fast food and that's it. Here's a spot in terminal 4 that has great ambience and service to boot.  Matt has treated me very well !
The menu is gourmet and the bar is very relaxing. 
This goes on my list of great airport restaurants. However it's before you go thru the security, so don't get hooked on the fried food inside. Come  enjoy and unwind."}
{"text":"As good as they say.

Went tonight for Arizona Restaurant Week for the awesome $30 specials.  I ordered the pasole appetizer, short rib main course, and the peanut butter chocolate chunk gelato for desert. All three were amazing and the portion sizes were great. The price fixe made it a good deal, otherwise I would have probably stuck with just the ribs.

Awesome service on the patio, much quieter than inside, and our waitress was perfectly attentive.

Next trip will be to try brunch, looking forward to another great meal."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most over priced under taste place in the airport.  15 dollars for a salad that is maybe worth 5?  Seriously?  Keep walking and save your wallet.  Wendy's is better."}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service, and delicious food! After I posted a negative review from a previous experience there many months ago, Brad, CK's manager, contacted me to learn more so that they could improve the customer experience. The level of attention to customer satisfaction is among the highest I've ever experienced anywhere.  I returned last night to give them another try. Food and service were both outstanding. I had the surf and turf taco platter, which included perfectly cooked lobster and filet - delicious! My companions had the mole tacos and veggie burger, and they loved them both. We all swooned over the kale salad that came with 2 of our meals - we agreed that we could eat that everyday!"}
{"text":"ORDER THE SHORT RIB TACOS!!!! All of the food here is amazing but you can't beat the short rib. The atmosphere is so cute here. Especially outside with the outdoor bar, lights and fireplace. I would recommend this place for any type of situation. It is pricey but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance! Ordered the nachos and substituted short ribs for the chicken - so tasty! The ribeye tacos were delicious as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant/bar.  Saturdays $12 all you can drink mimosas!  You can't beat that!  Plus the happy hour is great, the service is wonderful, and the food/drinks are great.  I got the short rib hash for brunch and loved it.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yessssss. I ate at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier this week and have been thinking about it ever since. Let me start by saying that I walk past this restaurant nearly every day, and the smell and pleasant din coming from the patio, along with the reviews from fellow Yelpers, had built up quite high expectations for my dinner there.
And I wasn't let down! Yes it's pricey, but you know that walking in. Otherwise, we were greeted by a very pleasant hostess and shown right to our table (though it was early for dinner and definitely got busier as the night went on). The waiter recommended vegetarian options for me when I mentioned I don't eat meat. There is the house-made veggie burger and (seasonal) veggie tacos, but he also suggested the brussels sprouts salad sans bacon... so it's good to know they have no problem with exceptions on menu items. 
I opted for the delicious burger with side of amazing fries! Who's ever had fries with sugar! and salt and a bit of spice? I never did til this dinner, but I now I vow to have them again! My date really enjoyed the halibut he ordered, which was healthy enough to allow him to go for dessert... Tammie Coe's red velvet cake. I don't get the red velvet fad, personally, but I tried this cake and it is so moist and the frosting so rich and creamy. For my dessert, I tried the warm chocolate cake, served with pistachio gelato. So. Good. The cake was like an airy fudgey brownie, with melted bits of chocolate oozing out.  
The food was delicious, no doubt, but it tasted even better surrounded by warm, cheerful fires and the rich deep hues of the dining room."}
{"text":"Fine Dining - NO
Slow Service - YES
Kale - Definitely NO

tried the short rib tacos not impressed it was more like a plate with some pot roast, kale coleslaw, salsa and a couple of corn tortillas.  very unimaginative and not worth the $$$

you can sit down in a restaurant atmosphere but the service is TOO slow and the food is not on par with the prices that are being charged."}
{"text":"Another wonderful time here.  We stopped by after having dinner  somewhere  else.
My other half kept dreaming of Chelsea's Kitchen and gazing over here as we ate our meal so I suggested a drink or two and maybe dessert here and we stopped by.So glad we did.
We sat at the bar on the patio ( which is sooooo relaxing) and the bartender helped us.She was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu.
Too bad I was somewhat full ,but I still ordered  the red velvet cake with Gelato and it was yummy. We shared the cake. And between me eating the cake and my other half enjoying the frosting we finished it.
Come for dessert...a nightcap or the full meal here and you won't be disappointed.
I'm a fan of this patio!"}
{"text":"Fresh options for me with a nice  greasy cheeseburger/fries for him. Friendly staff rapid serve time perfectly paced prior to catching a flight."}
{"text":"I would rate it much higher if it wasn't so pricey.  It seems like it would be a fairly casual restaurant, but the prices are more in line with almost fine dining, so I was surprised to spend that much, which disappointed.

The food was good though, with reasonable portions, but I was expecting more.  

Service was also not very good at all. We told our server we were in a hurry and she still took forever to get us our check and get us checked out. 

Overall, the food is good and if you feel like 21 dollars for tacos is reasonable, then go for it because they are tasty, but I thought it was a little bit of a jip."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food, and service were all excellent.  But the place is smokey.  I always need a shower afterwards to remove the BBQ smoke smell.  And I recommend you skip the free chocolate chip cookie they offer by the door on your way out.  That's not coconut on top of it.  It's chunks of salt.  It left a bad aftertaste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I got say the food is great. There fries are really good love it !!!

EA"}
{"text":"For this review I'm leaving you with only the most important things to try at Chelsea's:

The short ribs are some of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten. 

Their pancakes are heavenly with a hint of lemon zest.

And finally, the most important thing for you to remember, summed up in 3 short words...

Sea Salt Cookie."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. This place has consistently good food with professional service. Sometimes people can come off as snooty here, but the dining experience makes this place somewhere that I frequent. The burgers are good. The filet mignon tacos are better. I always grab a few of the free chocolate chip cookies here too. So good!"}
{"text":"We took a group of 8 here for a birthday dinner and had a wonderful meal. Best prime rib I've had in a long time, and the pan fried chicken was outstanding. Deviled eggs with bacon? Fantastic. Great service, ice atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Service was appropriate for an airport. Had the prime rib taco, excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best airport food! What a nice place to relax, enjoy great food and drink before a flight. I really liked their Prickly Pear Margarita, very tasty. I had the Dixie Chicken which is pan fried chicken with a cinnamon roll on the side. Yup - sounds wierd, tasted awesome!  Friendly wait staff and good service. I would go back even if it wasn't in an airport."}
{"text":"I picked Chelsea's Kitchen for my birthday dinner, and it was a delightful experience from start to finish. We tried the short rib tacos, roasted jidori chicken, deviled eggs, trout dip, prickly pear margarita, white sangria, key lime pie and red velvet cake. Everything that we ordered was delicious! We came here on a weeknight around 5:30pm and were seated right away at the patio. Food arrived fairly quick for us, which we appreciated. The atmosphere was warm and lively. The service was so friendly, prompt and top notch even while it got more busy during our dinner. Thank you, Chelsea's Kitchen, for giving this first time visitor to Phoenix a wonderful dinner experience for her birthday! We will return next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Our whole family loved brunch here last Satuday! I had the Chilaquiles! DELICIOUS! Great vibe, great service and yummy food! They have misters outside on the patio if you can stand the heat."}
{"text":"This has been our \"go to\" lunch spot for years. Recently, their outdoor patio, which we have always loved, has had the tables and chairs replaced. Yuck! The chair legs are now bare metal on patio stone...no chair feet or stoppers of any kind to damper the teeth-gritting, \"nails on chalkboard\" noise, which continually accompanies the wonderful food and party-like atmosphere of this beautiful patio in the center of the Phoenix Arcadia District. What a disappointment! Needless to say, we will not return until this is remedied! Farewell Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"The chef said he forgot to put the apples on my already delicious salad.... so he created this little plate (pic with green apple slices)! Loved their service and their twist on dishes!
Tip: if you eat outside make sure there is No wind otherwise tree/leaf buds fall into your food"}
{"text":"Have had breakfast 3 times here in the past year, each time the bacon was a greasy undercooked mess. Once the over-easy eggs were nearly raw. The rest of the breakfast was just ok. The french press coffee is pretty nasty, don't use the last half of the pot or you will need to chew the coffee. Nearly $30 for two people at breakfast."}
{"text":"Came back here again on another trip. The chicken tortilla soup is amazing - must have. Lots of flavor. I tried the Brussels sprouts salad - not as good as the kale salad (a bit bland.) ask for lemon to add a bit more structure to the flavor. 

Have a glass of Ken Wright Pinot Noir from Williamette valley. Good structure and acidity and depth of taste/notes. Actually goes quite well with the cheese in the Brussels sprout salad. 

Looking forward to the next trip flying through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times and always receive impeccable service. The food is fine an drinks are as well.  Came for Sunday brunch and had the chiliquilles, tuna tar tar, and mimosas.  Had other items on the menu, but those are my favorite along with the salty cookies at the door."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last weekend. There were 6 of us. Everyone loved their food. I had the vegetarian tacos. Awesome! Love the atmosphere, can't wait to go back and sit out on the patio by the fireplace."}
{"text":"I think the brisket dishes are the best on the menu as well as the fries. Great seasoning on both! The other items are ok, but nothing to dream about. The pancakes may be good to some or weird to others. They remind me of lemon pound cake with a corn flour taste. The eggs Benedict was good, but not great. The food comes out pretty fast if you do Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Green Chili burger is the best, sorry Islands. Service was great and professional, ticket times were where they needed to be. Parking is limited however I will add them to our list of date night dining choices. Good job to the entire Chelsea's team"}
{"text":"***Chelsea's Kitchen is an upscale and surprisingly good contemporary restaurant located before security at the Phoenix International Airport***

Chelsea's Kitchen is a Phoenix restaurant that has expanded to the Phoenix International Airport.  Dining at Chelsea's Kitchen feels like dining at an actual standalone restaurant and not an airport sit-down eatery serving mediocre food at outrageously high prices.  Chelsea's Kitchen at Phoenix International Airport has an attractive contemporary look--lots of dark lacquered wood.

The menu features a variety of options including several courses that can be made very quickly if you are in a hurry.  You will find several restaurant style starters, a few burgers, upscale taco plates, and hearty entrees like seared fish, prime rib and ribeye steaks.

I started with the tuna tartare and guacamole.  It came with a tower of tuna tartare at the base with radish and soy-lemon vinaigrette and a topping of creamy guacamole.  The tuna tartare and guacamole tower was served with a large portion of tortilla chips.  Overall, the starter had a good flavor.  The tuna was fresh and moist while the guacamole was very creamy.  There was nothing particularly special about it though and the tuna tartare could have used more heat.  The chips were okay and had a good crunch; they were a tad salty.

I also had their braised beef short rib tacos, which came with a very generous portion of beef short rib and then several accompaniments to make a taco including corn tortillas, lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  The substantial entree also came with a side salad of kale, which featured interesting garnishes including roasted garlic and strong cheese.

Like the tuna tartare, the ingredients with this entree were very high quality and the overall flavor was good but nothing special.  I wish the braised beef short rib had more heat and seasoning, but there was no doubt the beef was very nicely braised; the fat was rendered down and the meat was very tender and juicy (very unlike a lot of airport eateries where you get dry proteins).  All of the garnishes were very fresh.

For dessert, Chelsea's Kitchen offers a signature key lime pie as well as several gelato flavors from a local gelato shop (Grateful Spoon).  I had the pistachio gelato and it was good and creamy though it tasted more like ice cream than gelato.

Service was good--quick and friendly.

Prices at Chelsea's Kitchen are high like other airport restaurants, but the quality of ingredients was significantly better than most airport restaurants I have been to and the portions were very generous.

Chelsea's Kitchen is a nice airport restaurant.  I wish it was located past security though so it could be enjoyed by more people (travelers on layovers as well as people departing Phoenix who want to get through security and settle down before dining).  If you arrive at Phoenix International Airport and have time to kill though, Chelsea's Kitchen is a good option and more satisfying than most airport restaurants.

I am not sure what the parking situation is at Phoenix International Airport, but I imagine parking here is expensive like other airports."}
{"text":"Despite poor service over priced semi par food and a terrible experience the hostess and manager were great about comping our meal. I'm never out for free food and was willing to pay but happily took the money back."}
{"text":"I ate a shrimp cocktail - perfect, but expensive at $15 - but its the airport....

Entree was the rib eye tacos, 4.5/5 ( only because the tortilla, while good, was not perfect. $23 bucks - ok for airport - big plate with guacamole and salad...)

Service good. Make sure you have at least 30 minutes before crossing security.

Place is beautiful, with an open kitchen and a Grand bar, without being over the top!

What a pleasure it is to be able to eat this delicious in an airport.

MR. FOX YOU ROCK!

Btw, the kale salad that accompanies the entree was PERFECT 6/5, better than True Foods' Kale which can be a bit too garlicky!"}
{"text":"First time coming here I drove into the parking lot with what looks like more than half of the parking lot filled with cones for valet parking. The parking lot doesn't look like it would be difficult to get to the front door - so in a sense seemed a little pointless. I found a shaded parking luckily. 

Patio seating was available. Walked in and was immediately greeted. First couple impressions was that it smells good and that the ambience was trendy and fun! The place looked pretty packed and I can tell I already want to come back for a second visit.  I was deciding on their huevos rancheros, the chiliquiles, or their brunch special: baked egg and green chilies. The server suggested the chiliquiles for $14, and boy am I glad I got that!! It's chicken and hard fried egg topped with pico de gallo and a red and green sauce. OMG!! Delicious!! Ate every single bite. And then enjoyed a couple mugs full of French press for $3. Maybe more than one is not suggested because I became jittery. 

The whole time I was a bit hot. At first I thought it was the tiny spiciness of the food but I guess the ac wasn't turned down enough or something. The women's bathroom has 3 stalls and the first one was doorless!!! How?!?! Kinda weird for a place that has valet parking. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience there and would come back for the food and ambience!!"}
{"text":"Other than the location, I can't fathom the reason for this restaurant's popularity.  The food was fair...nothing extraordinary.  Service was poor all the way around...food service, drink orders, refills.  If you want to try this place I wouldn't bother waiting for a seat.  If you can walk in and be seated right away (which is more often than most would think) then go for it."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of complaints about this place, but I've never had a bad experience here myself.  It has good atmosphere both outdoors and in and the food's not half bad either."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to go. It never gets old. The atmosphere is luring and enjoyable. The patio is stunning! The waitstaff is always friendly and knowledgeable, the sangria is to die for and to top it off I have never had food I didn't absolute love and over indulge on. I would give it five stars for the 80+ visits I have had to this establishment."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. Nice decor and a fancy menu don't help this low quality food taste good.

Two stars for great service but food is not what you would expect from the menu. 

Definitely won't eat here again, at least you know what to expect when you grab fast food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. The menu really has something for everyone and it is all delicious. Favorite dishes include their tacos, tuna burger and nachos. Their margaritas ain't bad either and the red velvet cake is epic."}
{"text":"It's one of the best causal dinning places in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time on the patio!  Sangrias were first on deck and were wonderful and refreshing.  We ordered nachos which were to die for, ceviche that was outstanding,  and against my better judgment the deviled eggs...and OMG they were FANTASTIC!   I will definitely return and will definitely order those again!  Excellent spot to do happy hour or lunch!"}
{"text":"We were on a bike ride and decided to stop in.  After being seated we discovered we only had $25 cash.  The waitress was ready nice and worked with us so we could enjoy a lunch together."}
{"text":"Our first server was not confient..making our first experience very akward. My first lemonade had something brown floating in it. While the second one was much better... the seeds in the bottom reassured me that it was made in house. Our second server was more confident, but less attentive. About five staff members circled our table before clearing our plates and bringing the check. The check came to $40 for one appetizer, one salad, and two non-alcoholic drinks. As i was leaving there was a tray of Maldon chocolate chip cookies, my girlfriend grabbed one and split it for us. She put the cookie in her mouth upside down and ran to the trash, nearly 50 percent of the cookie was salt. I wouldnt mind spending 40 dollars on lunch if the quality was there to back it. My experience does not reflect those that I have heard from LGO. Unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is, hands down, the best sit-down restaurant at T4. I love them for brunch or dinner. Service tends to be 4/5* but food is always good. Drinks are good too. My favorite is Dr Losen Riesling and they always have it. Have I had sub-par experience? Yes? Have I had great experience? Yes and yes. All in all they deserve a five-star rating for their salads alone."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you Gabi K for taking us here! Excellent choice, and I will definitely request Chelsea's next time I come visit.

We arrived just after 11 and told the hostess we had a reservation, but she turned up her nose and said 1) they normally don't seat incomplete parties; and 2) they don't usually take reservations. Something must have quickly changed her mind, because she led us to a table in back. As noon came closer and closer, I soon understood her reasons...this place must be THE place to have lunch.

We were still stuffed from breakfast, but after taking a peek at the menu I forgot all about the egg sandwiches we sharing earlier. Appetizers, anyone? Why of course...let's have the ceviche! It was fresh, with a perfect balance of seafood and fresh avocado, lime and spices.

For an entree, I chose the grilled ahi tuna taco platter. It was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I felt a little bad for my table guests, because I rarely spoke as my mouth was full every time I looked up. The tuna couldn't have been cooked more perfect...and that chipotle aoili was UH-MAZING.

I tried my hardest to finish and managed to somehow fit almost everything in my stomach. When the dessert menu came around, I reluctantly declined a sweet I think for the first time in my life. I'm still kicking my own arse for not sucking it up and sinking my fork into the shared red velvet cake (made fresh daily).

Thank gawd I was wearing a loose sundress that day is all I can say."}
{"text":"We eat at Chelsea's Kitchen all the time and love it. Wish I could say the same for their location here at Sky Harbor. After a dozen or so meals here I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect. 

The location is great, terminal 4 outside of security between the A & B concourse. Very nice design and comfortable. 

Unfortunately that is about where things go south. The service is abysmal, it takes forever to get your food and more often than not the food is cold. This morning I ordered a hot breakfast sandwich which came out room temp and the turkey was refrigerator cold. The one bright side is our waiter was very attentive today. 

So let's talk about the caliber of service. Who trains these people? The hostess practically ignored us indicating that when the other lady returned she would seat us. Hello, the place was dead, show some initiative and seat a customer. First impressions really do matter. After waiting a minute the lady who did seat us didn't say a word or make eye contact. Hello again, customer service rule, make guests feel like you want them in your establishment. 

Whoever trains the people at the airport gets an F as the experience in no way resembles what you get at the 40th street location. 

If I were Chelsea's I would be concerned that the additional revenue would not be worth a tarnished reputation."}
{"text":"Short Rib Tacos = AMAZING. I am literally drooling over them as I eat the leftovers for lunch. Our team from work had a great dinner the other night!"}
{"text":"We LOVED chelsea's kitchen. We had been there for breakfast once before, but never dinner. We went on a Saturday night, around 7:00PM and had to wait about 20 minutes, but got a table indoors, which is key in this mid-100 degree summer weather. The food was seriously incredible. I got the burger with a side of french fries (that come in their special BBQ seasoning!!) and they were easily able to accommodate for my gluten and dairy allergies. For those who are gluten intolerant, their fries are gluten-free! My boyfriend got the fried chicken and mashed potatoes, which came with collard greens and garlic biscuit that he said was truly delicious. He got a grapefruit cocktail and raved about that as well.

We would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful restaurant that sources local and fresh. I mean, where else can you get a local,grass-fed burger with a huge side dish for $15, without making it yourself? We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience dining for lunch today.

We were greeted and seated quickly by Jessica, she was pleasant and made sure the high chair we requested was cleaned off. Going out with little ones isn't always so welcomed so we were grateful!

Our server, Aly, was knowledgeable about the vegan options on the menu and I let her choose between the veggie burger and the vegetarian tacos--she chose tacos which were wonderful and a good size serving! My sister had the brussel sprout salad with the optional bacon (pictured) and loved the simplicity of the ingredients paired together.

The patio was perfect for our temperature/shade preference and the bathrooms were clean :)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I love this place so much. Always a great time. Every time I've been here it's been nothing but great food and good service. There's usually a wait on the weekends so make sure your not too hungry cause sometimes you'll be waiting awhile. I've been here many time and every single time I leave with a big smile on my face because it's just so great. I can never leave here before I have the sangria pitcher and nachos. Try them you won't regret it. My mouth is watering just thinking about the nachos and sangria. Ok that's it I'm off to Chelsea's kitchen this weekend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's worth the drive for me! The chopped salad is amazing.  Service is always on point and the atmosphere is very inciting.  Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Consistently high quality food and drink, and a perfect place to bring the entire crew - from the little ones to grandparents.  A pitcher of their famous sangria and chicken nachitos (nothing \"ito\" about the plate, either) is a great way to start.  Tacos are solid, love the kale salad + a protein (rotisserie chicken or salmon), and burgers rock.  Staff is polite, attentive - and the salted chocolate cookie on the way out the door can never be passed up by the kiddos.  The patio is beautiful - definitely love sitting out there, year round."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Chelsea's. For me, it's one of the original Arcadia restaurants before we had so many to choose from. I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience... Or a bad dish or drink, for that matter. 

Food: everything on the menu here is GREAT. My personal favorites are:
Starters - Deviled Eggs & Shrimp Ceviche (even though it's hard to narrow it down to these two)
Dinner- Short Rib AND Surf & Turf Tacos (great that these are gluten free), also the Del Mar Salad (but, like I said, everything is great... I just had to pick a few here)

Service: Always top-notch. There's nothing to complain about.

Drinks: They have some unique, yummy drinks... the servers are all very knowledgable about what is in each drink and can make great suggestions, as well.

Parking: Valet is complimentary... there are very few spots that aren't valet and just trust me, you'll want to valet because it's a small lot with mostly valet... so just do it.

....and don't forget to sneak a few of the salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out... so worth it!"}
{"text":"Healthy, vegan options, deviled eggs, kale quinoa salad and roasted chicken are to die for-so good. Amazingly friendly staff, well run operation all around and great ambience.  Had only enjoyed airport location, glad I tried their stand alone location. This is how you run a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"So, I've always liked Chelsea's Kitchen...I like all the LGO places. The decor is beautiful, the food is always good. And it was the same last night except for the one thing I can't get around - the horrible service. I usually feel that food trumps service, and as long as the place is nice and the food is good, I can deal. But the service last night prompted this review. We walked in and clearly there were tables, but we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Fine..they text you when your table is ready. But once seated, we had one waitress come to our table, we weren't ready to order drinks, so she put a folded piece of paper on the table mysteriously and walked away. Then a whole new waitress came over, no explanation. She seemed disappointed we decided not to have drinks. Appetizer came out with bacon on it, when we asked for it without. Then was somewhat rude when answering specific questions about entrees. Took away the plates without asking if we were done with our food, and then dropped the bill on the table without asking if we wanted dessert. Asked for some condiments - took forever getting to us. It seemed like she had made up her mind about us and then decided to not care about our table. Reaaaaallly disappointing. The food was good as always (entrees - 2 taco platters, one Del Mar salad and a Ahi tuna burger) and if we didn't have cocktails for that one time is that a reason to be rude and disappear? Not cool."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Amazing patio and ambiance with a clean open kitchen. The host and serving staff is professional. Great date night place. 

The complimentary choc. chip cookies as you leave is a nice touch that impressed me. 

Valet outside full time."}
{"text":"Our first time  and we had an absolutely amazing experience. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere sitting on the patio with the lights in the trees, the misters going, and the light chatter and glasses clinking in the background.  Alissa was an outstanding server. She kept us laughing and was one her game.  Thanks Alissa for making a special night that much more for us."}
{"text":"One * for the decor and the other * for the layout.
The service, food and prices left a lot to be desired.  The food options were limited.  Mainly burger and seafood.  I found the food priced $3-$5 more than they should be for the quality and quantity.  For example, a burger was $13 and the bun was so thin that it was falling apart as I picked it up.  The Guacamole appetizer was $10.  Pretty pricey for guac.  
When we sat down there was a used napkin left on the side of the seat that they failed to remove when they cleaned up (totally understandable, but unpleasant nonetheless).  I picked up my clean napkin and it had a hole in it. My lunch date's chicken was undercooked which they graciously took back and grilled a little longer, but not long enough.  The server brought us the check as soon as the plates were cleared and she never asked us if we wanted desert or anything else before the check came.  
When we paid for lunch the server brought just 1 pen so I waited for my friend to sign and give me the pen, but the waitress came by too fast and grabbed the one signed receipt before I had a chance to sign mine.  I still left a good tip, but will likely not be back for a long long time. 

pretty place, not worth the price and service, cookies upon exit were great though."}
{"text":"I've been to Chelsea's a couple of times
And both times were great. As a vegan I only had one option, the vegetarian (can be made vegan) tacos, which are packed with flavor!  Anyone can enjoy these whether carnivore or herbivore. I would recommend substituting the kale salad with cannelloni beans but the salad is also great. The kale could have been massaged a tad more but it was still enjoyable. Service is good and ambiance is too, however, the lights are dimmed--a little too much--sometime around 7.  The prices are pretty high if you eat meat but the portions are big to huge!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and attentive service.  Have enjoyed many meals on the patio with the misters.  A nice combination of locals and tourists.  Service is well coordinated and someone is always around to help with whatever you may need.  On our last visit we enjoyed the green chili soup and the locally sourced grilled vegetables.  Chelsea's does a great job of using local sources and highlighting them on the menu.  Also well priced entrees for brunch.  Located right on the canal so very nice please to walk or bike to as well.  Highlight local breweries as well.  Good for families as well especially on the large patio area!  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had. Brussels sprouts salad, cornbread, and the surf and turf tacos. Everything was gluten-free and delicious. The food was great to share, and we both left satisfied. I'll definitely return the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, service, food, location, great happy hour menu and the regular nenu is something to deaire. Brussel Sprout Salad w/bacon was great. Really love this place and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The restaurant was pretty packed but we got seated very quickly. 

We ordered the tuna tartare & guacamole...SO GOOD. The tortilla chips were very crunchy, fresh and almost the best part!

My friend and I split the Chelsea's hamburger and asked for it to be cut in half. They plated it on two different plates for us without us even asking, we thought that was really nice. The burger comes with fries which was seasoned with what tasted like sweet mesquite bbq flavoring...like what you found on kettle chips...sweet & salty = YUM. 

My absolute favoritest part of Chelsea's Kitchen was the free chocolate chip cookie sprinkled with sea salt that was offered as you walk out the door. I made sure to take the biggest cookie in the pile!"}
{"text":"Rellay good food, great service. Grab a cookie on the way out! Can't wait to go back again and explore the menu."}
{"text":"I am writing a quick update to my review.  After reading about my less than stellar experience, Chelsea's promptly wrote and apologized. They expressed an interested genuine concern and if I were to come back to AZ, I would definitely make a 2nd trip in there.  I do think considering the other reviewers here, that I had a \"one off\" experience.  It's a bummer for sure but all restaurants have their off nights.  I appreciate Chelsea's response and if I am ever back in the Phoenix area indulging in an off my diet food tour, I will check it out and try something else."}
{"text":"Love the food! great for gluten allergy. Grass feed burgers were great. my friend said best lobster and steak he has had in AZ. The drink are great! They will not take reservations for small groups so expect to wait."}
{"text":"Great spot, a bit pricy, but they make it up in excellent service and an outstanding atmosphere. Good memories here."}
{"text":"I live in NYC, and was visiting family in Phoenix. They suggested this place, and it was delicious. Get their short rib tacos.  They are insane. And they come with freshly made corn tortillas that are incredible.  Top it with some guacamole, salsa, and kale cabbage...and it was one of the best tacos I have had.  They also cater towards those who are gluten free, which also makes it easier for me.  I only wish they had gluten free versions of the salted chocolate chip cookies they give out when you leave!"}
{"text":"As return devotees to Chelsea's after moving back to the Valley, we were happy to come experience all that is the Chelsea's experience.
The Kale Salad and fish tacos can be to \"live for\".
The servers are off the charts as are the hostesses. So an \"A'\" for the above and a credit to Management for their skills in attracting and hiring A List Talents.
Yet the rest is a flat out \"F\" !!!
Chelsea's (on both our visits) has a serious issue with flies.  Serious!!
As a refresher, flies  breed bacteria. Anything they hang around long enough is going to become infected. As they land on your food, they are leaving behind bacteria and who knows what else.
And with Chelsea's Open kitchen, they are just as present and endemic on your food before it is served.
Have you ever gone to throw your trash in the outside bins and  open the cover and there are what seems like hundreds of flies. They breed around garbage. The problem with that is when they are done with the garbage they can end up  infesting your food.
Again, we really like the people here and the next day reached out to their GM Steve Whittaker and received no reply.
Go figure....."}
{"text":"My family had some friends come in from out of town, Seattle, and they suggested this place to us.  Hey...I am open for anything at least one time.  So I Yelped the place to gather some information.  The photos big this place justice.  

So we get to Chelsea's Kitchen, we a prompting greeted and sat, and ordered the deviled egg's.  WOW.  Slap me and call me Susan.  lol.  We place our order which arrives quite fast, and precedes to exceed all of my expectations.  I was blown away.  I had the short ribs tacos, highly recommend, and the wife order the crab cakes.  I know crab cakes in the desert, BUT the were quite delicious.  Overall, we were very satisfied with the experience, and plan on going back."}
{"text":"We had an unfortunate experience the last time we were here. We decided to give this place another try and it was a success! Great cocktails, great prime rib! Maybe just don't come for brunch.... We will be back again!"}
{"text":"outside patio is very nice but trees should be \"shaken\" or something so you don't get leaves and pollen pods falling on top of you and in your food. Inside got very smoke filled (from kitchen or BBQ) near the end of our meal causing eye and throat irritation. Food was tasty and staff very friendly. Ambience nice.
Excellent customer service. Allison (customer experience manager) reached out. Just to be clear we enjoyed our dinner that night and actually were reseated indoors when we asked. No drama. Great place."}
{"text":"Got to the airport a bit early, decided to find something to eat. This place looked like most other airport restaurants. Menu was varied enough that we found something to order that is keto-friendly. I wasn't too hungry so just ordered deviled eggs. My friend ordered a shrimp and crab salad. We weren't expecting much, but were very pleasantly surprised! The food was GOOD. Good even for non-airport standards. And it was plentiful for the price. Service was great, no problems at all. In short, I will always eat here when flying through or staying in Phoenix, and hope they open a place in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Had no idea it would be this good! Fantastic burgers, delicious tuna tartare starter plate, and some excellent gelato to finish the meal off. The patio is cozy and beautiful too!"}
{"text":"Trendy and excellent food, get there early or be prepared to wait. Still worth it. The Kale Salad and just about any meat on the menu is worth trying"}
{"text":"Chelsea's has been a real find and we have enjoyed it for several years now.  I have entertained family, co-workers, bosses and customers here and all have enjoyed it.  Weather and space permitting the patio is a great place.  Favorites of mine are the deviled eggs and the short rib tacos.  The only negative is they do not take reservations for less thanpeople....."}
{"text":"The food was very good but a little overpriced for what you get. The wait staff was very attentive and polite. The only thing is when I arrived there were plenty of takes but they wouldn't seat me until my entire party arrived. I understand that if they are busy but if they are empty they should not make you wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Tasty neighborhood staple. The inside is warm and cozy and the back patio is a lovely place to hang out. The guacamole is tasty. I don't think I've been disappointed by any dish here. Personally love the tacos. The sauce that comes on the side is delicious. And I am borderline obsessed with the mini cookies you can grab on your way out the door!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at the Phoenix airport. Don't eat here if you're in a rush, takes a while to get your order.  Had the Brussels sprout salad; the sprouts are brined, so they were tasty and crunchy, lemon whole grain mustard vinaigrette, topped with cranberries, toasted almonds, currants and Manchego cheese - very tasty.  The butternut squash soup was tasty as well, roasted with some sweet spices and thick and hearty.  Their tortilla Chips are light and crunchy, great guac and a roasted tomato salsa.  Other salads looked good, such as the baby kale.  Hubby had the Caesar salad, dressing was very yellow, perhaps too much mustard, chicken was moist as seasoned well (smokey and grilled nicely).  Good friendly service."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic!! My husband and friends and I sat on the patio last weekend and enjoyed a late lunch while taking a break from a leisurely bike ride. The back patio was beautiful with flowering trees. I was surprised there weren't misters on the patio which would have made it much more comfortable, but we did find tables in the shade so it was okay. We started with the deviled eggs and the tuna tartare & guacamole. I wouldn't normally order deviled eggs at a restaurant but our friend recommended them. They were no-kidding the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten!! The tuna was awesome too! My husband and I split the Howie Burger (havarti, carmelized red onion, and dijon sauce) and the Del Mar Salad. Oh my goodness!... Both were outstanding!! Our server (a young lady) was super nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. The bathrooms were clean (although stall #1 splashed my friend when flushed... yuck!)."}
{"text":"We have been back a few more times since my original review, and each time I discover a new dish to love.  When stopping by for lunch, the Husband and I ordered the nachitos - mistakenly thinking that the appetizer would be relatively small... we were SO wrong!  It was so incredibly gigantic that the two of had absolutely no hope in finishing it... even though we were sharing.  Our server was really fantastic and immediately noticed that our speed was slowing down.  He offered to go ahead and box up our carne asada tacos for us to enjoy when we weren't quite as stuffed.  Good call!  The tacos were delectable - even when reheated later that night. 

Last night, my sister and I stopped by for dessert.  I am in love with the key lime pie!  The small scoop of strawberry gelato in the perfect foil to the sweet-tart lime.  We also had the chocolate brownie/cake, which my sister devoured.  It wasn't my favorite, but I think I just wasn't in the mood for chocolate (strange, but true).  I also sampled the French Press coffee.  It was really tasty, and I'll definitely order it the next time I'm in for brunch.  Strangely, our waitress forgot to bring out sugar - despite me asking for it after she brought out the carafe of coffee.  Luckily, my dessert was sweet enough to compensate, and I managed to drink my sugar-less coffee anyways.  

Chelsea's Kitchen puts out a consistently strong product, has a gorgeous interior and patio - and usually has friendly and attentive service (excusing a few minor glitches... no big deal!).  It is becoming one of our go-to places for a great meal - brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert - Chelsea's has it all!

PS- the free chocolate-chip sea salt cookies were super yummy too!"}
{"text":"Solid comfort food. This is what Houston's and all those crummy joints should be. I had the pan fried chicken.  I got it served with very good fries and sugar snap peas.  It was tender, delicious etc. Give them a try. You won't regret it.  Oh, and our waitress was fantastic. Very knowledgeable, attentive, not intrusive. She even knew some arcane things about the ingredients in some dishes.  Impressive girl!  They've got a very nice outdoor dining area too.  Go there.  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"We went again after three years and felt the same about Chelsea's. Its a beautiful restaurant with really good service. I am just not a fan of the food. There is a lot of sugar on the French Fries. I prefer savory over sweet, but today's society is so hungry for sugar - maybe I am out of the mainstream. The meat in the burgers is really good, but they struggled with the temp on this visit. They still serve the Howie Burger with sweetened pickled onions instead of caramelized onions as advertised on the menu. Its strange that they would not have remedied this in three years. Either change the menu or make it per the menu - either one. The service is great even when they are slammed."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant 5 stars but didn't like the sweet spice on the french fries.  Other than that, the food was so mouth watering, homemade and excellent complex flavors.

Service - outstanding!
Atmosphere - awesome.  I love the smell of a wood fired oven when you walk in.

Food:

Tuna tartare w/guacomole on chips - orgasmic.  I make good guac but this stuff was over the top.

Short rib tacos.  First of all, street sized homemade corn tortillas that were deliciously moist.  the short ribs were absolutely incredible and you can separate the meat by barely touching with a fork.  It comes with black beans which are so well seasoned over white rice.  Fresh salsa, more guacamole.  It was so friggin tasty.  

On the way out, they have freshly baked chocolate chips cookies with sea salt, which are complimentary.

I love this place and will definitely be back.  They have such a great menu and so many things to try.  

I would have never stopped at this place unless I hadn't read the Yelp reviews.  it also came highly recommended by the Concierge at Intercontinental Montelucia in Paradise Valley."}
{"text":"Holy shit! Do you even like food? Why aren't you here, right now? Do you not want a fantastic Manhattan before dinner? Do you hate amazing ceviche? Are you afraid of the best goddamn prime rib you'll ever have? Get here now and enjoy the fast and friendly service, or we're never speaking again."}
{"text":"Rolled in around noonish on a Sunday. Were seated immediately inside. Had to wipe crumbs off the table and chair.

Coffee was delicious but only got one cup each with the French press split between 2 people. My coffee cup was so chipped at the top I could hardly find a safe place to sip at.

Deviled eggs were delicious and would highly recommend. But, only 3 halfs for 2 people? One whole egg each going to break the bank? What do they do with that left over half? 

Short rib tacos were good. Not amazing but tasty. Plentiful portions. Good guac and pico. The little dipping salsa/sauce was great. 

Waitress never checked in once after we got our food. Sure, I was in basketball shorts and a hoodie but how about some service.

Not a bad little joint to grab some brunch. I wouldn't make a drive for it but if I'm around I'd hit it."}
{"text":"A gluten free friendly gem...especially offseason! 

Received such a warm welcome as we entered into the restaurant through their front misted patio with lush greenery. This is a beautiful oasis in the desert city. 

Our server, Emily, was a friendly and attentive problem solver as we asked a battalion of questions about gluten free options and cocktail recommendations. On a warm night, her sparking rosé was a perfect recommendation. The slight sweeetness and bubbles worked well with their gluten free cornbread. The yummy green chile cornbread was moist and served warm in a cast iron dish. It is soft and crumbly on the inside with a crunchy sweet crust. 

For dinner our table ordered rotisserie chicken, caesar salad with grilled salmon, and the special (halibut). All our dishes were served at the perfect temperatures. The portion sizes were enough to make us not want dessert. The food tasted as previous reviewers touted. Nothing over spiced...food perfectly balanced. Emily was super informative on their gluten free options and there are many to choose from. 

With regards to their gluten friendliness, they have the ability to mark all food allergies on your food order to alert the chef and kitchen of your specific needs. Emily was a great partner to make sure my food was as good as it was safe. I really appreciate the additional measures they take.

Their serving system makes use of various people to assist you in your dining experience which, at first, seems a bit chaotic. However, their communication system (handheld devices) made sure nothing was duplicated or missed. Surely something to see! Dining in the 21st Century! We will be back...and next time we cannot wait to check out their beautifully lit fireplace patio. It looked so romantic!"}
{"text":"It has been a solid ten years since I've been back, and it hasn't changed ONE BIT! 

I mean, it's just as gorgeous and amazing as I remembered it. Such a fabulous place with NICE servers! I live in California and WISH they could clone this joint and plop it right next to my house!

The place was packed on Friday night, but the hostesses were sweet and not overwhelmed by the crowd. People were waiting and didn't mind because they knew it'd be worth it!

I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. The food, the drinks, atmosphere, and ambiance! You are missing out if you don't come for dinner!

10/10 would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Food and service is great, but three stars because you're forced to valet- really hate when restaurants do that!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the service and food fell short. I am giving 2 stars for effort and atmosphere. Upon arriving there was a wait so we went to the bar for a drink. It took at least 15 minutes to get a drink. The bar wasn't that busy unless the count the 2 year old and 4 year old occupying 2 bar stools with their parents. Since when are toddlers allowed at a bar?!? After finally getting a drink and being seated we ordered an appetizer and a bottle of wine. About 5 minutes later the server took our dinner order and in the meantime the appetizer came out.  At this point we still didn't have the bottle of wine we ordered. We then got our entrees but still no wine. I ordered the halibut which was cooked to a crisp so I had to send it back. Finally the wine arrives!  My entree was then brought back out about 8 min later by the chef. He apologized and acknowledged the first one was over cooked. If I dine here again it will likely only be for a few drinks and an appetizer with low expectations."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the BEST experience at Chelsea's Kitchen! We were vacationing in Scottsdale as part of our \"baby moon\" and came across this gem! The parking lot was full so we thought we would wait forever for a table.. Wrong we got right in!! I had the Brussel Sprout salad and can't stop craving it now that we are home.  The best part of our whole experience was ordering some Red Velvet cake and giving Christina our waitress our gender reveal envelope to tell us the sex of our soon to be baby!!  When it was time for the \"reveal\" most of the staff was gathered around our table to check out our reaction! It was so amazing to be surrounded by the nicest staff ever!!! The chef came over and said it was a first for him, I'm so glad my husband and I could be trend setters and have this amazing memory from vacation.  If we ever get back to AZ Chelsea's Kitchen will be a must stop with our baby girl! :)"}
{"text":"Cosmo was sour. Service slow for airport & food soso. I love Chelsea's in Phoenix. Less than happy here."}
{"text":"I went to Chelsea's Kitchen last night.  I had heard a lot of buzz about this place and how amazing it is.  The ambience was very nice.  I really liked the back outdoor area.  Service was great and very attentive.  I always have \"modifications\" so I am always happy when things come out the way I ordered it- which is actually pretty rare.  We both had burgers that were really good.  I think they ruined the fries with that BBQ-ish seasoning- I couldn't eat them.  I usually don't complain about this because I usually know what to expect before I go to the restuarant, but I must say I was a little shocked at how expensive this place was.  There were other things I wanted to try but I didn't really wanna pay $26 for tacos.  I'm the farthest thing from a cheap-ass and I really liked this place but I'm not sure if its the place I'd want to go to drop $100+ on dinner and drinks for 2."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've had the luxury of dining at in decades. I couldn't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic.  The signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you daintifully sip your way into alcoholic bliss. 
The oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' situation.  
The cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure. They soothe the restless 'fat kid' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving Cheslea's Kitchen a bit more bearable"}
{"text":"I hear Chelsea's! 

The food is fantastic, healthy and unique. My fave entree is the brussel sprout salad. I know, sounds raunchy, but it's unbelievable. Trust me.

Plus - who doesn't enjoy getting free cookies as a parting gift? 

This is in a fun location right off the canal that always has a good energy. I've also had great servers both times I was there. I think this place does a great job of representing the non chain side of Phx."}
{"text":"We'd already gone to the right on Camelback from Twenty-fourth Street to encounter Arriba Mexican Grill, the worst Mexican-style restaurant in our experience, so we went to the left and found Chelsea's Kitchen.

It's a pleasant place to be. Our server was competent and professional 'though not as available as we would have liked even though the place wasn't busy.

Our meals were just fine, not good enough to praise nor poor enough to criticize. The portions were a bit smaller than we would have liked but almost enough.

The prices were in line for what we received.

I can neither recommend it nor advise against visiting it."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and it was very good. We started with the tuna tartare with guacamole on top. It was very tasty and enjoyable. We also split the brussel sprout salad which was also very good. I had the special, a halibut but unfortunately it was overcooked despite ordering it medium rare. My wife had the short rib tacos and it was decent, but could have had more flavor. We finished out meal with pumpkin pie and red velvet cake. They were both fairly good. The red velvet cake was comprised of several small layers separated with frosting. I would have preferred one large moist red velvet cake with only the frosting on the outside, but that's my personal preference."}
{"text":"Travel the country eating every where from dive bars to Michelin star restaraunts  and by far our waitress here is the best in the country. The cocktails and food were also one of the best anywhere"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I had Chelsea's Benedict and my co-worker had the special of the day (I forget the name but it was essentially baked eggs with pulled pork). The white sangria was also delicious.

Warning: patio has a lot of birds and you risk getting pooped on. Co-worker and I were both pooped on."}
{"text":"So, we wanted a yummy salad and a glass of wine after a long day of work.  And we definitely scored!  

We shared two different salads: kale & quinoa w/ salmon & Brussel sprouts with rotisserie chicken. Best salads ever! Seriously!

I ordered a glass of wine and they ask if you prefer 6 or 10 ounces and as I mentioned earlier it had been a long day and ordered the 10.  WOW!  Be prepared to pay up!

Service was nice and it's a great dinner spot.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While waiting for a table near the hostess stand the noise from the wait staff slamming dishes was deafening.

While seated the noise level is so high it's hard to hear people at your table.

It was a very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience.  Their menu has nothing but fresh food options. Their pairing of food is nothing but outstanding.  I had their kale and quinoa salad with salmon. Absolutely wonderful!  I'm officially in love with this place and will now come early to the airport in order to dine here."}
{"text":"dined here for a quick lunch before my sister left for her flight!

service is good and good is good as well.
price is a little much, but that's what you get for dining at the airport.

would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Success!!! Finally a good place to grab something to eat at the airport! 

My flight was slightly delayed so I decided to go outside the terminal and check this place out. I was greeted and seated promptly. I got my drink right away and off to the menu I looked. 

Decided on the soup and salad--- Chicken tortilla soup and Brussels sprouts salad. I waited about 8 minutes and got my food. First impression? It looked so delish! The salad was bright green and the soup was very fragrant. Time to dig in!! 

The verdict??? The chicken tortilla soup was good thick, rich, chucks of chicken and some avocado. It reminded me of the chicken tortilla soup at La Grande inside the terminal. It was good--- solid! I would order it again. 

The salad-- the Brussels sprouts were blanched then leafed. Topped with crumbled bacon, cheese (I think its Manchego) currants, cranberries and peanuts. I took my first bite--- lemony but a little sweet. The Brussels sprouts were  so crunchy, the bacon was yummy. The dressing paired very well with everything. I had also ordered a side of chicken. Ok let me tell yah, that was the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had!!! Moist, flavorful and almost melt in your mouth! 

I finished everything! The waiter was very quick so I was in an out in 35 minutes. Got back in the terminal and Phoenix was left behind the fumes of the jet plane while I was left thinking about my lunch."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!! Food is great, atmosphere is also great.  I've ate here a few times.  I live in Tempe, so it is a little drive, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Rotisserie chicken and chicken sandwich were very delicious and quick to the table. Unfortunately the service was slow towards the end of the meal when we needed to jet. All in all this is great food to fill you up before or after a flight!"}
{"text":"My family and I agreed that we received the best service that we have had in a long time! Cameron, in particular, made the experience most memorable. What an excellent man-- very genuine, relatable and personable. As we were about to eat dinner, my dad received a phone call that his father was about to pass on. He wasn't going to be able to sit and enjoy his meal. Cameron took it upon himself to package the food to-go for my dad and then comp'd his meal. We were not expecting this at all! This act of kindness will never be forgotten and left a long-lasting impression, especially, when it was our first time dining at Chelsea's Kitchen. The food was superb, but service is just, if not MORE important. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Their season specials are next level. Order whatever the chef recommends. Fresh and unique! I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"It's affordable....while in the USA,...later I'll be in Edmonton, Alberta which is pricey!"}
{"text":"Part of LGO Hospitality Group, Chelsea's Kitchen has such a cool atmosphere! I love the indoor/outdoor vibe. I dined for lunch for the first time recently and had the Curry Chicken Salad. Its served very uniquely as chicken salad over mixed greens w/ a side of wonderful whole grain bread to make a sandwich if you choose. 

They're rather famous for their soft tacos and new on the list are short rib tacos. Maaaan! They are scrumptious!!!  The dinner portion of short ribs served over mashed potatoes are melt in your mouth perfection! Cut them w/ a fork. Be warned, they serve this dish w/ an (optional) over easy egg on top. 

The wine selection is pretty good and the deserts are sinful. Chelsea's is crowded almost every night of the week especially during tourist season.  That's definitely a good sign don't ya think?!

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"I've now gone here twice and have some mixed feelings about my experience.  Overall, this place definitely has some good factors, but they're missing some consistency.  For example, both waitresses I had recommended the short ribs.  I had them in their tacos during my 1st visit and have to admit they weren't my favorite.  If anything, they should be recommending their Colcannon Potatoes to everyone.  Some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  If these don't come with your food, order a side of them!

The Chelsea's Cheeseburger was decent.  Be aware that the french fries have a strong BBQ seasoning on it.  Picture the flavor of BBQ Lays.

The patio is really nice as long as it's not too hot.  Get there early if you want to sit outside.

Don't forget to grab a cookie on your way out.  Beware of the little crystals on them...they're salt, not sugar.  If you like salty sweet, these will be right up your alley.  Plus, they're free!

You need to try their red velvet cake.  I hate frosting, but I eat every ounce of this cream cheese frosting.  So well balanced and a good density!"}
{"text":"Located in terminal 4 this is one of the best airport restaurants I have been to. They truly have locally sourced organic foods, great food combining and the flavor is spot on. I had the chips and guac and a kale and quinoa salad and loved both. If you're traveling through Phoenix, check it out."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood with the hubby and we spied Chelsea's. I have wanted to try it for some time so we were hoping to get a table at the height of the lunch hour. It was packed. Thank goodness for the bar area 'cuz it  was way too hot outside (although it is charming). 
Our lovely bartender, Monica, was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Short Rib Tacos and my hubby, the Green Chile Burger. His burger was a hair more done than his request of med. rare. Did not matter because it was super juicy.  It was a good size, tasty and just enough heat. The Fries were uber good. Not being a fries guy, I was surprised he ate half of them (I stole the other half - ha). 
I really enjoyed my tacos. The short ribs were super tender and flavorful, but the portion was too large for me and I took the balance home. Lucky me. The homemade tortillas were warm and smokey. The ribs were so rich I needed to offset it with the homemade salsas, guac. and lettuce. So, good. Even the black beans over rice were creamy awesome. Any place that can get me to eat my beans is okay in my book. 
I still made room for dessert. I had to keep it to a minimum and settled on the Grateful Spoon Pistachio Gelato. Delectable cold creamy goodness in 3 scoops. I have not heard of this brand, but I looked them up and they are located down the street from Chelsea's. I'll be paying them a visit another time. 
A hair pricey, but well worth it. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner after a recommendation from a past local. The outside patio and ambience was great. It was a perfect blend of misters, lights and good weather! The only complaint is that the seats were a bit uncomfortable but the environment was great, trendy, yet easy- going.

Our waitress Emily was so accommodating, there was a request for a burger, sub chicken, this was not on the menu but she did ask the chef and was able to make the special order and I was told the chicken burger was a 10! 

The fries- seriously a 10 star plate of fries! The seasoning was salty and sweet, the waitress said t was a mix of brown sugar, paprika, garlic salt, pepper, SO SO GOOD!! 

I had the veggie Burger. It was ok. 
I would def go back. They have an overwhelming, in a good way, menu that makes you want to go back and try more!!

also had the peanut butter chunk gelato= amazing!!!!!! All peanut butter lovers should try it"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Chelsea's Kitchen, at first glance you'd never know what a gorgeous gem of a restaurant lies in wait for those who wander in. Dimly lit, an inviting bar with cumbersome but comfortable chairs, and if your lucky enough to have a gentleman stranger assist (yes there are still a few out there) then they are worth the effort to get into. We were lucky enough that the weather was perfect to enjoy eating an early evening dinner on the veranda. The atmosphere and friendly staff makes Chelsea's kitchen warm and inviting. I ordered the Ahi-tuna burger with a side of cooked kale that included butternut squash and red pepper pieces blended in. The kale's flavor was the loveliest blend of sweet and savory , so good that I at it first. The burger however was not the most pink or eye appealing , but still was a melt in your mouth tasty experience. I can't wait to return to soak up more of the ambiance, enjoy more of their menu, and taste those LGO cookie samples by the entrance.
Chelsea's Kitchen you know how to make a girl swoon..."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, rating four stars only because they don't take reservations. Everything is almost always perfect. Came early for lunch with a friend. I ordered the ceviche,I could tell it was made it the day before. Besides that the short rib tacos are out of this world. The Keylime pie is amazing. And during the cooler months the patio is stunning."}
{"text":"First of we eat out a lot - love the henry , cowboy ciao, eddie v  etc-not my first time at CK but def will be my last. My family took me there for Mothers Day I had called before to ,make sure they also had their regular menu, they did not once we got there. Decided to stay anyway how bad could it be it's CK!!!!!! It was awful to say the least actually the deviled eggs were good. We orderd 2 different hamburgers, way beyond greasy and gross. we took it home but ended up tossing it. Also had seafood salad likewise , terrible . This is my first time writing a review but I was soon disappointed in the whole dining experience I felt I had too. Its too bad cute place."}
{"text":"The food here is soooooooo good!!! Seriously, every single thing I put in my mouth here was amazing. The ambiance is awesome as well, with a really cool outdoor patio/open wall bar set up. For dinner I had a Caesar salad followed by a delicious rotisserie chicken. The potato side had kale mixed in and it was so buttery goodnessy I almost licked my plate. Vegetable of the day was broccoli with a spicy ragu which I thought sounded gross til I had it - also incredibly tasty. Seriously this was the best food I had on my trip to Phoenix! Make sure you grab a free cookie by the entrance. Nothing makes me smile like a salty cookie. This place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to post this sooner but it's been a busy week but because of our horrible experience I had to make sure I document it. 

My friends and i came here after the movies on Sunday. We decided to sit at the bar. Right away we we're asked what we wanted for drinks. Considering we literally just sat down we all replied water. As we decided on our drinks it took the bartender another 15 mind to ask if We decided on drinks. We ordered drinks and then waited another 15mins. My friend literally had to wave his hand (though she was right in front of us) to get her attention. We ordered appetizers. Ceviche and the guacamole. We got the ceviche quick but it literally had two pieces of shrimp. Then we had to wait another 20mins (also had to remind them about it) for the guacamole and when it came out it looked like fake, processed filled with preservatives, like the store kind that are in tubs. Absolutely disgusting. We all decided to leave and go somewhere else. Never again will we be visiting this establishment. Such a shame as their patio is great but man they need to work on customer service AND make quality food."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen has really good food but be prepared to pay for it.  Lunch is always good there but the cheeseburger I had was $15.  Dinner is awesome and with a great atmosphere .  The servers are great and the valet takes good care of you.  Notice the almost always there Bentley in the front of the restaurant! I am guessing this is the owners. A little pricey but great food, people and atmosphere!  I go about once a month. I would definetly go and check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Tuna tartare appetizer was very good. Brussels sprout salad was good. But the sprouts were steamed, not sautéed like typical. It made the salad lose a little flavor.  

Service was dour like someone rained on their parade. 

Cocktails were terrible. Avoid the vodka/cucumber cocktail and the gin/grapefruit cocktail."}
{"text":"Been here more than one for dinner breakfast and lunch. Nothing here will disappoint you. Food is on the spot. Best nachos in the valley..good beer selection...great tuna burger and salads. I have kinda tried the whole menu. Oh and great burgers!! Awesome patio and service. They do make their own ranch which I can just drink with some fries :). Must try!!"}
{"text":"Short rib tacos were incredible. Large serving- I could of made 6+ tacos. Corn tortillas were hot and fresh and perfect for making tacos. My wife had the Chelsea burger and it was delish as well. We tried the chocolate nouveau cake (described as an underdone brownie) which was great but served cold?! Not sure if this was a mistake but next time I am ordering it  \"warm\". Came with pistachio gelato. The food around us looked great. I want to try the rotisserie chicken sometime and the fried chicken. Nachos looked good but huge portion."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to enjoy a late lunch since we were apartment hunting in the neighborhood. Yelp you did not disappoint me! Absolutely delicious food. We had the posole (highly recommended) and the howie burger (ahhh cooked a perfect medium) and the white sangria. Top notch food and service. Although we did have a lady next to us who repeatedly complained about her food (steak missing a glaze she wanted) but of course she packed her leftovers to take it home. Odd. The management seem to handle the situation very professionally. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband had what her said was the best prime rib he has ever eaten.  I had the crab cakes, which were delish!  We would have given 5 stars, however, it can be very noisy."}
{"text":"How have I not yet written a review for one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix?!?  Ok, I think it's because I've had one bad experience here out of about 10 but overall I love Chelsea.  I love the atmosphere of this place and how you can have a romantic dinner inside, sit at the bar area for something more casual, or sit outside and enjoy the weather with some nice lighting in the trees.  The bar is half on the inside and half on the outside so you really do have several seating options.  The service staff is consistently phenomenal (with the one exception but the manager actually did a nice job handling that situation).  One time we were outside and it started sprinkling.  As soon as I asked to switch tables, they quickly accommodated us even though there was a wait and we were still on appetizers.  Now that is service!

The food- I LOVE the menu.  I always want to order everything off the menu and everything I've had has been exceptional.  The deviled eggs are my guilty pleasure along with the tartare.  I usually end up going with the short ribs for dinner but the fish is great as well.  The short ribs have always been melt in your mouth tender and I've never heard a complaint about anything amongst all the company I've brought here.  Plus, it helps that I moved out of. Phoenix, came back to visit, and saw a \"goodnight Emily\" drink special on the menu.  Who doesn't love to see a special named after them??  The drink was pretty darn good too, not that I'm biased or anything.  Don't believe me?  Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for brunch, lunch, or dinner. I love sitting outside at the bar, it's beautiful. The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the price. This place is a little expensive and while the food and drinks are good, it's still a bit too much. Now for super positive stuff:

The food is delicious! If you get the Chicken Nachitos make sure you share. This is a huge appetizer. My favorite app is by far the tune tartar with guacamole. Oh, yum! So fresh and delicious. For lunch or dinner, I love the swordfish tacos. I skip the tortillas and just have the swordfish and fixins on the kale salad...soooo good!!!

The drinks are also delicious! I always get the greyhound which is vodka with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. My husband orders the old fashion or bourbon with ginger ale.

I just noticed that they now have happy hour from 3-6 pm with $5 cocktails. This seems like a winning deal.

Oh, don't forget to take a fresh cookie on your way out."}
{"text":"A cut above your average airport restaurant - fantastic salads and colorful menu! I'd love to try their other locations."}
{"text":"I loved this place! 

Great location, food, and service! 

We started with the chicken nachos and they were HUGE! Loaded with cheese, chicken, sour cream, guacamole, and jalapeños.. so good! 
 
I guess I decided to stick with the Mexican theme and got the short rib tacos. They were AMAZING. I really liked these tacos because they gave you the meat, a kale and quinoa salad with grapes (yum), pico, and guacamole all on a plate and the tortillas separately so you could build your taco. The tortillas were pretty small but it didn't matter cause the flavor was there and they were so so good. 

We ended with the pecan pie and red velvet cake and they were just as good. The red velvet was surrounded with cream cheese frosting and it was heaven. 

I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"super mediocre short ribs.  unsure what kind of \"award winning\" ribs are winning anything with a measly 5 ounces of crock pot beef.  Also unsure of why it's more expensive than the NY strip steak.  The good news is my friends huevos rancheros were much better at half the price and a decent portion to boot"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I'll most likely visit again when I return to Phoenix for business. 

Atmosphere: I ate dinner on the patio. The sun was already down. All tables had candles and lights were strung above. Full sized trees provided a canopy. It appears it would be beautiful during the daytime as well. 

Food: healthy choices on the menu. A good amount of fish and meats.  I had the ahi tuna tacos. The tuna was cooked rare, and was delicious. No fishy smell or taste. 

Drink: 4 drafts, craft/import, all out of the ordinary, which is good. Several wines. Full bar for mixed drinks.

Service: excellent. The server was quick, attentive, knowledgeable, accurate, and talkative enough to make the experience enjoyable. 

Price: slightly pricey, but you get what you pay for. 

Additional note: one guest had 2 golden labs with them on the patio. They were well behaved. I assume the staff saw them and were cool with it. This is a plus if you are a dog owner."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the Phoenix airport. We had a tough trip with a big group. Kimmy was very gracious and made us feel completely  at home. Mathew handled us with care and proficiency. The prime rib was great and the drinks were even better."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is a nice place for brunch or dinner. Nice indoor and outdoor seating with the fireplace during the cooler months.  The nachitos ( nachos with chicken) are amazing and even if you don't see them on the menu ask for them and they can make them.  The green chili cheeseburger and the vegetarian burger are also delicious.  Tried The lemon ricotta pancakes today and were really tasty.  The drinks are rather pricey but for brunch you can get bottomless Mamosa's for only $12. The green chili cornbread never disappoints.  Parking can be difficult but they have the \"complimentary \" valet which I do not care for, but they have ample bicycle parking along the canal."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Had lunch with my dad there and we were both satisfied with our choices. Dad got the sashimi salad and I got the ahi-tuna burger with kale slaw. The menu is interesting and gives plenty of fun healthy options. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato, the texture was good but it was a bit to creamy for me. Overall great place for lunch"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times for after work gatherings, but have never eaten.  I went for lunch/brunch this past Sunday and YUMMY!  I have the short rib taco's and they were excellent, the meat was super tender and tasty.  The service was OK, our appetizer didn't come out until after our entree, and my taco shells were late as well.  But overall, I think this place was excellent.  The food was good, I can live with mediocre service once in a while!  They have a great patio and the food smells when you arrive make your mouth water.  I look forward to going again and again!"}
{"text":"I came here based upon the yelp reviews and it's even better than the 4 stars. Im going with five stars. 

I had the sword fish taco platter and everything was amazing especially the fish taste the hardwood grill smoky flavor , fish was juicy, not dry and good service too. 

Next time I'm at the Phoenix airport I'm coming back !"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is a great spot for breakfast and lunch.  I love the variety of soups at lunch.  I especially like their Tuscan bean soup and butternut squash soup.  All menu items are made to order and the service is very good.  I never feel rushed when I eat here.  Its a great place to take clients for lunch or meet a friend for a long weekend breakfast.  The restaurant is beautiful to look at and the outdoor patio is great when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"So happy we live so close to Chelsea's Kitchen! This place is great. Fresh food, reasonable prices and a nice ambiance. Don't miss the white sangria, it is refreshing and wonderful to share. The service is usually good although the last time we visited, the hostess seemed quite bothered to help us. The only real complaint I have is that they only take reservations for parties of 18 or more. 18?! Really? Excessive. Without a reservation on a Saturday night, you will easily wait for over an hour. The patio is fabulous and this is a great brunch/lunch/dinner spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food, great location. Some of the brunch items are a little too experimental for me (like lemon ricotta pancakes... can we make regular old pancakes that aren't ordered from the kids menu?). It would also be nice to have a bit more selection of breakfast foods during brunch. Their dinner is excellent, though. We love coming here."}
{"text":"I complained about coming to this restaurant before I even stepped foot in it.  Mostly because it's called: \"Chelsea's Kitchen\".  Much like the title of a generic romantic comedy, this place was designed for women. They dim the lights, put on the KY Jelly Pandora, throw some candles out and then hand you a menu of WTF? You serve tacos, burgers and salads.

YOU FUCKIN SERVE TACOS, BURGERS, AND SALADS (and a few random meat, potatoes, veggie dishes?)  

The place is nice. It's a nice fucking place. Nice, the place fucking is. Unfortunately, I didn't bring virgo Mary and the Baby J, and we aren't planning on spending the night. I'm not looking for real estate, and having a nice place doesn't automatically justify ripping off your customers. I came here for fucking eats player, and this place isn't nice enough to justify this shit:

1 - Why did I just pay you $2.25 for a can of soda. Go fuck yourself, I'm thirstier than 12 god damn ounces.

2 - Why did I just pay you $15 for a salad, and then receive a bullshit sized salad? Here's what's on the Caesar: Lettuce, Cheese, croutons and ¼ the dressing normally required to satisfy a grown ass man. Pull your shit together. STACK THIS FUCKER. If I'm giving you $15 and not receiving a protein, something isn't right. Do you know who has a 9.95 Caesar Salad? Fucking Mastro's. Some people actually order this as their main course? This place is for anorexics. This is the god damn dinner menu people. DINNER.

3 - Alright fine, the burger & fries were good, and in the same range of taste and price with other places in the area. But, the fact that I was basically cornered into ordering it is a real dick in the mouth. If I was looking for burgers, I sure as shit wouldn't come here.  Furthermore, I'm not giving you $20+ for 3 tacos and a side of beans or whatever the fuck you have. You have to be out of your mind.  Everything on the \"Very Special\" menu is not appetizing in the slightest.  I guess if you're not looking for flavor and want a Plain Jane meat and potatoes dish. THIS IS YOUR PLACE.

Lessons from Chelsea's Kitchen:

- First impressions count, and they can glaze over the eyes of someone who's already skeptical of your shit.  The second I saw a can of soda land on my table. I immediately hit eject. YOU HAVE A NICE PLACE, it's not that fucking nice though.  If you're going to fuck me on this, what else are you going to fuck me on? Wallet CLOSED for the remainder of my time here.  Any thought of ordering one of your overpriced appetizers just got flushed down the toilet. At least put some fucking bread on the table and look presentable. And, I'm the same guy who will give Macayos $100 for 2, simply because I got free chips out of the deal. Do you know how hard it is to spend $100 at Macayos? I've done it.

- WHAT the fuck is your theme? Pick an identity.  If I wanted a gourmet burger I'd go to Zinburger, Grind or Delux.  If I wanted upscale tacos I'd go to 20 other places before coming here, most likely Gallo Blanco. Now I'm left with $30 entrees, and it's safe to say I'm not coming to Chelsea's Kitchen for a $30+ entrée, given the plethora of places that have their shit together in that price range.  Don't get me restarted on salads.

- I almost burned your building to the ground when I saw that you had valet, then I realized you didn't FORCE it upon me like some asshole I'm not going to mention. Kudos to you, I'll give you 2 stars instead of 1 for that reason. That, and the service was good, and everyone was friendly. Also, go back in time and give your mother an abortion: You have the biggest parking lot of any restaurant in the area, and you still have valet. I'm glad you're concerned with pleasing the \"I CAN'T WALK 10 YARDS\" crowd, as well as those who won't eat gluten and must have all things organic. See: Venn Diagrams for details.

- Your restaurant is the same quality as North or Central Bistro, but you're charging 50% more, and have 50% less items to choose from. Take the dildo out of your lungs.

- People on yelp mention your \"happy hour\"? No sign of it advertised anywhere, including your website.

Holler at me.

Actually don't."}
{"text":"Always a reliable, quality restaurant which in my experiences has maintained beautiful aTmosphere, delicious food, great service and an overall great dining experience.  Noise level can rise during peak times but love the outdoor patio when weather permits"}
{"text":"I am surprised at their services and dishes actually. They served very good dishes even in the airport, in addition servers are very kind and polite for all services. I am very happy to spend my time here even I am waiting for the delayed flight. I can recommend to spend your time here before boarding the aircraft on Phoenix."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Chelsea's Kitchen! My husband took me there for my birthday and I am so glad he did! This place is perfect for special occasions...but don't let that stop you from going there just for fun! Their cornbread and deviled egg appetizers were amazing as were there entrees. I got the chicken and my husband got the tacos--yum! 

The ambiance was also perfect.  They have a super cute patio with lights and a beautiful outdoor fireplace.  In addition, their staff was extremely friendly and helpful. If I could eat at Chelsea's Kitchen everyday, I would! I am still dreaming about our dinner there.  I can't wait to go there again! Until next time, Chelsea's Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time at Chelsea's, if I'm meeting friends for an appetizer and a glass of wine. The fries are great, and the guacamole is fresh.  
Every time I have dinner there, though, I am underwhelmed.  In my opinion, the food is often mediocre.  We've had steak ordered medium rare show up well done, the Del Mar salad is hit and miss, sometimes fresh and wonderful, but sometimes chewy. Our last visit, the crab cakes (for $33,00) seemed like they came frozen, salmon (ordered medium well) was very over cooked, with \"sauteed\" vegetables that were mushy and indescernable.  
Two entrees and two drinks at $92.00, before tip? There are too many restaurants around serving really good food.  
By the way, our food came out 4 minutes after we ordered it, which really made me curious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. We went for an 8pm dinner mid-week. It was a cold night so we sat inside. The place was cozy with lots of candlelight. It was busy but the service was good.  Enjoyable time! We plan to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was Good and was fresh and tasty but the prices are horrendous for what u get    I know it was airport food but don't need to charge that for what I got.   The service was slow, I know they are slammed but don't ignore me after the waiter saw me wave him down.   All in all, if your on the company budget go.  Paying for yourself? Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a pitcher of Sangria and French Dip. Great atmosphere and definitely completely full after eating. Roast beef was excellent quality and dip had good flavor. Bread could be improved though."}
{"text":"Cheeseburgers are epic! Whenever I'm craving chips and salsa and a cheeseburger this is my go-to place. Plus it's a fox concept restaurant and I'm a sucker for those."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The only down side is that in the vast land, they are extremely limited in parking! They do complimentary valet, but it just seems unnecessary.

The entrance seems quiet with a small water pond and serene statue. Once you cross the threshold into the restaurant there is a festive hustle and bustle in the restaurant that makes you want to partake.

The decor is welcoming and warm with an open concept. Plenty of windows and open patio draws you in. We opted to sit on the patio for our Sunday brunch at 10:30 am with beautiful weather. We were quickly seated and once outside, greeted with a heated patio, blazing fireplace and a million singing parakeets. If you don't like birds, this isn't for you. 

Service is exemplary. Food is amazing. Coffee is fantastic. We ordered:
Crab Cake Benedict - Great portion and abundant crab. Most places skimp, but not CKs.
Mac N Cheese - Baked in a Le Creuset dish, it's amazing
Kale Salad - Fresh, light, and feels just right.
Chilequidas - Meh. Nothing to rave or brag about, if I came back, I would try something else.
Coffee - French press
Diet Coke - Canned. 

All in all it was a great way to say farewell to Phoenix and simply the best meal of the trip. I'm glad we found CK. I'd recommend it to anyone dining in the Phoenix area. Good food. Great ambiance. Fabulous service. There isn't a reason not to dine here."}
{"text":"Day 1 of our Arizona adventure. After 5 1/2 hour drive and settling in at our hotel it was time for dinner. So my wife looked on Yelp and found Chelsea's Kitchen. Since I was tried of driving, it was nice that Chelsea's was so close to our hotel. 3.8 miles to be exact. 

We arrived a little after 7. Chelsea's was busy, but we were able to get seated right away. We wanted to sit outside, but the back patio didn't have misters and I wasn't too thrilled about sweating in my food. lol Our server, Stephanie, promptly greeted us and took our drink order. Since I was thirsty after a long drive, I ordered a Manhattan. My wife ordered a Martini and kiddo ordered pineapple juice. 

The menu is short and simple. For starters, I ordered the Deviled Eggs. You have the option of ordering them with bacon. The menu says, \"don't resist\" in reference to bacon on the deviled eggs. Needless to say, I gave in after no arm twisting and ordered bacon with my deviled eggs. The eggs were so flavorful and rich. I believe the were dusted with Paprika which added to their smokey flavor. My daughter ordered the Guacamole and Chips. Yes, very pedestrian, but the best part was the charred tomatillo salsa that accompanied the chips. It had a nice smokey flavor. My wife ordered the Shrimp Ceviche. She said it was just ok. It has more tomato in it than shrimp.

For my main, I ordered the LGO Reserve Short Rib Tacos. This is a dish that Chelsea's is known for. The tacos fixings and the tortillas come separately. You get the short ribs, which I think were cooked in the roasted tomatillo salsa, guacamole, pico de Gallo, and kale slaw. When you combine all those things with homemade tortillas, you get a very beautiful and flavorful taco. To be honest, I think I ate 9 of them. Not kidding. The tortillas are the small street taco size. My wife and daughter shred the Chelsea's Cheeseburger. They said it was good. The fries had a sweetness to them and they weren't sweet potato fries.

The decor of Chelsea's is warm and welcoming. It reminds me a lot of Houston's. The clientele was a good mix of people. Young and old. To be honest, I felt like I was eating at a restaurant in the O.C. lol There is valet parking that is complimentary or you can self park. The parking lot isn't that big so I can only imagine how crazy it gets on w Friday night or on a weekend. No issues with service or staff. The bartender makes Avery smooth Manhattan."}
{"text":"Maybe the best airport food you'll ever have.  Is this really an airport?  I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked with fresh mashed potatoes and crispy green beans."}
{"text":"The food as incredible.  We had the prime rib , rib-eye tacos and short rib tacos.  The ambiance was beautiful and the energy in the place was exhilarating.  Don't forget to get the key-lime pie!"}
{"text":"Be cautious before you order the kale salad. It's all kale and oil and cheese and less anything else. Very disappointed 

Also, they brought out store bought cold bread with the salad and chunks of butter that was not spreadable and unacceptable for a restaurant so well rated."}
{"text":"Yep, 5 stars at an airport bar/restaurant. It was an unexpected find in our hunt for a Bloody Mary. The place was inviting in its decor and the bartender was pleasant and attentive. When she put down the menus I thought I would take a look though I wasn't hungry. The menu featured fun and interesting house cocktails including white sangria.  I was torn but stuck with the plan for a bloody and I wasn't disappointed. The food options were also a welcomed surprise compared to the usual turkey sandwiches you would expect at an airport. We decided on the shrimp ceviche and it was awesome -fresh fish, crispy chips, avocado. This is a huge step above the norm and think it's a must when traveling through the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Chelsea's has really wonderful food in a nice upbeat atmosphere. The patio is really nice and so is the inside. Right upon walking in the place has an amazing smoky smell that is really pleasant and (at least for me) throws me into a relaxed/hanging out with my friends at a campfire sort of mood. The menu has a lot of options for everyone, including vegetarians. I had the vegetarian tacos and they were amazing! The portions are huge, and everything on the plate is perfectly flavored and tastes so good by itself and even better together. The guacamole is spot on fresh, the pico de gallo is bright & citrusy that perfectly balances out the garlic veggies, and the kale slaw is just awesome. Hard to describe the flavor other than hearty greens with sweet tomatoes and wonderfully nutty quinoa - it's totally healthy and good tasting. The tortillas that come with the dish are soft and fresh, though tiny. The whole plate is fantastic and I would happily eat many many meals of it. It is a little pricey at $15 but I do think it's worth every penny, and I had a little bit of leftovers to take for an afternoon snack.

This is a perfect go-to spot for workday lunches or lounging weekend meals. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a lunch date here...I had the Grilled Swordfish Tacos and I forgot what he had...I think the Grilled Ahi Tuna.  Portions were on the smaller size for the price (yes even for lunch).  I kind of felt bad, because I picked the place and he paid...and I just felt it was waaaay to expensive for a lunch.  We did have cocktails so our bill was definitely more than $60.  We did enjoy the patio...even in January when the weather is perfect here!  Not so sure I'd do lunch again for the price!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp did it again..........................very good nachos, happy hour drink specials and loved the atmosphere. Defiantly would go back again, great job Chelsea's Kitchen"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely divine! When you step into the restaurant, the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The staff is extremely cheerful and pleasant. Everyone whether it be servers, hostesses, and even the valet staff said hello or welcome with a wonderful smile. The food was just as amazing as the service. Everything tastes fresh and perfectly cooked. My party got an appetizer, several entrees, and dessert. Nothing was less than extravagant. They have many different types of dishes that I'm sure would please even the pickiest of eaters (like myself). On top of all of the food being delicious, I ordered a drink that I didn't particularly care for because it had a certain liquor in it that I wasn't aware of and the server kindly exchanged it for me at no additional charge. Chelsea's Kitchen is fabulous and I highly recommended it to everyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is before security, so get to the airport a little early if you can to eat here. My server Rachel was great. I had the short rib tacos...delish."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest to find the best French dip for several months now and Chelsea's is the winner. OMG it's amazing. Great restaurant especially given its in the airport."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat in this airport.  The green chilli burger was very spicy and perfectly flavorful.  Also as messy as can be."}
{"text":"First experience was great.  Food was amazing.  Loved the braised beef tacos.  The deviled eggs appetizer was the best deviled egg I have ever had!  I purpose to have a healthy lifestyle and they honored my requests easily.  Matt was an excellent waiter.  Place was jamming but the environment was calm and relaxing.  Beautiful restaurant and love the valet parking. Will come again for date night."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I love Chelsea's Kitchen. 

It's sparse and loud, but the service is always good, and the food is excellent. Specifically, I think they may have the best veggie burger I've ever had. The tuna tacos are almost as good, when they're on the menu.

Speaking of things that aren't on the menu, they sometimes have a summer melon salad with almonds and avocado...holy sh*t, it's refreshing and delicious. But again, it's never on the menu and only available seasonally, so make sure you ask for it.

I go with Jenn H. all the time, and her favorite is the short ribs with the fried egg on top. Far from kosher, but extraordinary nonetheless. And for what it's worth, Chelsea's was featuring short ribs far before it became the standard of every hip eatery across the nation.

Overall this restaurant is a strong, consistent star. Plus it's open late...and you know I like that."}
{"text":"Sexy atmosphere. Yummy food. Great date spot...save room for the red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"We had the Filet Mignon and the Swordfish Tacos and they both were fantastic.  Highly recommended!  This is no ordinary airport restaurant.  And I'd almost give Five stars but felt that our server was too aggressive in trying to oversell everything (i.e. \"want a double\" \"sure you don't want a double\", \"chips and guacamole\").  and the bathroom is a quite a walk away..and our hot sauce lid was broken in half, which to me mean it found itself on the floor, and our server touched my tortillas up against the condiment tray which i thought was a little gross.....but all that aside, this was a A+ experience."}
{"text":"I was very close to five stars. Everything was really delicious. We had Prosecco, French press coffee, deviled eggs, Chilequiles, and brussels sprouts salad. They were all delicious. My only complaint was that the special, Santa Fe baked eggs, was more pork than anything else. I wish it would have been described that way because I would have ordered differently."}
{"text":"Everything that I have had from Chelsea's Kitchen has been superb. I love the brussel sprout salad with chicken"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite patio in Phoenix. It is large with wonderful shade trees, a fireplace, and furnished nicely. Since moving here from that \"coastal state next door\" Phoenicians probably do not want to hear [from me] that they are not invested in the great weather here and as outdoor-oriented as they should be. It also does'nthurt that both the food and the clientele here is just the best! ....a great place to meet friends for happy hour or take a client. Everything I have had here is first-rate. The mac-and -cheese appetizer is comfort food nirvana, the lobster bisque is the best I have had, bruch is relaxed with a choice of everything from pancakes, chiliquiles, to burgers....something for everyone. My husband had the short rib tacos and was unable to finish everything.....lean meat, home made tortillas. They were excellent. I had the huevos rancheros, and the red chili sauce had just the right amount of spice and smokiness. Have I mentioned their wait staff is attentive and friendly? If it gets any better at Chelsea's, I will happily come back and give them a 5th star!"}
{"text":"Our family came to have dinner and visit with relatives during their layover at Chelsea's in Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor. It looked like a nice place to relax & visit without using up limited time driving to a restaurant.

The meals were EXCELLENT, especially for airport, and even worth the price! Taste, portions, temperature, presentation & variety, all fantastic!

Service was pretty good, except we were there toward the end of the evening, which felt like we were slightly secondary to the staff getting their closing activities done.

Little things like getting condiments out to the table right away or bussing glasses still being used... I get it, but when sweeping involves pushing chairs into yours then wet mopping the room STARTS in the walkway behind your chairs, it got a little ridiculous!

Somehow the overpowering smell of floor cleaner just negated what had been a wonderful culinary experience! Perfectly seared ahi, melt in your mouth burgers, layered pastrami, nice wine, craft beer... now a big cloud of Mr. Clean to run us out of there!

We had happily closed out our bill when asked and told we were welcome to stay and visit as long as we liked by our server. I had even called earlier for closing hours and was told they stay open until last flights.

Here's what could have happened  BEFORE dragging chairs around to sweep or slopping wet mops around the ONLY table with a family visiting at it: Just say kindly that the staff doesn't want to interrupt your group, but we're going to begin cleaning floors at the other end and you may be more comfortable moving to other seating in the airport terminal.

How nice would that have been?!!

There are many aspects to a dining experience, and the meal was so good that we had already planned to dine at the restaurant sometime soon. Just have to wait to get the taste of Mr. Clean out of my mouth!"}
{"text":"Patio was beautiful on this perfect evening.  Service was great!  Food - not so much.
My son got the short rib tacos and they were delish.  My Dixie chicken dinner was tasty, but defiantly needed some sauce and my broccoli was way too dry.  My husband got the roitissorie chicken dinner and the best thing on the plate was the beans. Over priced?  I think so."}
{"text":"The Chilaquiles were a perfectly executed fantastic and fresh take on the Mexican classic. However the beer selection is overt limited and in my opinion the $11 Bloody Marys were underwhelming and over priced."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the greeter was so friendly. It also was amazing that we walked in at 7pm and were immediately seated.   We were shocked that his happened as we were mentally preparing for at least a long minute wait.   Bonus 

Tasted the salted caramel cookies. Give those a big miss. Way to much salt on top. It was if I just gnawed on a salt lick. Can't warn you enough to avoid these cookies ........ yuck. So much potential so sad   

 Salt seems to be an issue here. Ordered the Dixie style chicken which is so moist   The potatoes on the first couple of bites were absolutely delicious as I ate more the clawing taste of to much salt was there   Chefs please east up in the salt.  Distracts from the meal.  My companion agreed with the to much salt in the spuds 

The broccoli pastry thing that came wii the meal was so greasy   I had to ask the server \"what is this ?\"  Mystery pastry

The broccolini with fresh mandarin on it was a hit. 

The short rib tacos were pretty good. Larger chunks of meat than expected to go on a very small taco. The kale and quinoa salad was better than it sounded 

The noise level was extreme.  No sweet romantic conversation here   Al conversations were a yell

Overall pretty good meal. The enthusiasm with the salt detracted from the overall taste experience"}
{"text":"We don't live in the area or the state but the few times we have tried to come this place is packed.  Tonight we found out why... it was delicious!  I never have seen deviled eggs on an appetizer menu.  But they had them here and they were tasty.  We also enjoyed swordfish tacos and braised short rib tacos.  It was a lot and thought I would finish them.  But surprise the two of us who ordered them are it all.  Everything was delicious and service was great!"}
{"text":"Way to loud to enjoy my Sunday brunch company. Food was good, but a bit pricey for what we were ordering. Hamburger just under 20.00 bucks and tacos were 22.00 dollars( small corn tortilla) ect. Ect. If your gonna charge those prices than I expect the food to be out of this world considering it is lunch time food, not dinner. Not sure I would take the trip and visit w them again oh and Bloody Mary had one olive and some salt. 10.00 dollars jeez, at least decorate it w some celery or something creative."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant has 4 stars and it is super busy.  However, my experience was nothing better than 2 star.  Basically it was the lack of service.  The server took our drink order at the bar and gave us a menu.  We received our drinks and she disappeared before we could place an order.  About one hour later she brought us our check.  Amazing.  We really wanted more cocktails and food.  We tried to flag her, but she ignored us or didn't see us.  We paid the bill and went down the street to a restaurant that was interested in our business."}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere and fantastic food. As an exec chef of another local restaurant I'm extremely critical on other restaurants. This far exceeds my expectations. Only one teeny tiny little thing bothered us...electricity orders at the table it's awkward!!!! But everything else made up for those few uncomfortable seconds!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw a Chelseas at the airport. Finally! Food and service you can count on at a terminal! Eh, not so much...while I realize its silly to think it could be consistent with the 40th St location when its at the airport, I was hopeful. Swordfish tacos were so well done we had to cut the char off. Burger was ordered medium rare, came out well. We were hoping to have another round of drinks when our food came out but the bartender never came back to ask. Stupid us, as we were finishing up we realized we were cutting it close to board time and when we were done we just wanted to pay but noone would even look our way. We finally flagged down a different bartender to get our check (why wouldn't the tab be in front of you at the bar at an airport??). We immediately took our credit card out to pay and again noone stopped to take it. Furthermore another bartender looked right at the bill with the card on top 3 times as he walked by and didn't pick it up! After 15 mins of waiting we had to go or we were in danger of missing our flight so I pulled out what cash I had (which I was saving for cab fare at our final destination) and didn't have enough for more than a 15% tip but at that point I didn't care. 
Nothing is worse than being held hostage and having to wait to pay at the end of your dining experience. Securing payment is the easiest part of the job for service workers. And at the airport of all places, where everyone has somewhere to be, you would think they could close people out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  The atmosphere is beautiful and they have fabulous food!

Their Kale salad with chicken is the best meal they have. They also have an amazing cheeseburger.

Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"WAS once my go to place for breakfast in the airport, but sadly will have to pass going forward as they have drastically cut their breakfast menu. Gone are the benedict's, the Huevos Rancheros, and just about anything that took more than rudimentary culinary skills. They've gone streamlined, neglecting the travelers from the area who would gladly arrive early for a good meal as opposed to the frantic grab and dash diner... Can't wait for Matts Big Breakfast to open now... But unfortunately, I bet they'll be packed with Chelsea's disappointed customers."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen has become my favorite dinner spot. The food is excellent, but it's the attitude of the place that really makes it sing. A great place for a nice, but un-stuffy, dinner. Try the steak tacos ~ you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"When you think of airport food, usually it's fast junk with a lot of grease. Not this place. Everything seemed very fresh. Oatmeal was delicious and was a nice large serving. I'll definitely be back to try more menu items"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went back here on a Friday night and it was FANTASTIC. It is the first time I've been there at night. It was so beautiful. The perfect place for someone to propose (hint, hint....just kidding!)

The wait was about 30 minutes so we decided to get a drink at the bar. My boyfriend got an IPA and I got an old fashioned. It was perfectly balanced. 

For an appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs. Holy cow. I feel bad saying this because my grandmother, may she rest in peace, made the best deviled eggs....

until I had these. 

For my entrée I got the crab cakes. They were so fresh with a great lemon-cream sauce drizzled on top. They weren't laden with mayo or hidden in breadcrumbs. They were mounds of delicious crab meat. The sauce complemented every aspect of the meal. The server was so nice, made great recommendations, and entertained us as well. 

Overall, we will be making this a staple date night restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner and we were very impressed! Janelle served us and had the best recommendations! Very attentive, and was very accommodating. She went out of her way to take a photo of us because we mentioned it was a special night forThings like this make service memorable. 10/10 

Stephanie is wonderful!!! We will come back just because of her!!!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i ate at chelsea's kitchen with his family and had a great experience. his local aunt and uncle recommended it and previously had positive experiences. we started with chips and guac which were super fresh and homemade. my boyfriend got the short-rib tacos and i got the chicken tacos. both were absolutely delicious! the service was quick and always available. the gals were dressed well and acted professionally. the atmosphere inside was urban with natural woods and raw metals mixed with high end, good food. loved the mixture of both the decor and the food quality. we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip and I'm so glad we made the drive from downtown Phoenix to Scottsdale. 

The wait for 6 of us was about 10 minutes. We were seated in doors around 1 PM in a corner table. The waitresses all seemed very friendly (and pretty). I ordered the swordfish without the taco bit and a side of veggies. Their guac is good but nothing special. The swordfish had a lot of flavor from the grill which was as promised! 

The only annoying thing eating was the amount of flies, I know we're sitting with  a breeze because the doors are open, but geez those things got annoying! 

The french sea salt chocolate chip cookies are worth stashing away in a doggie bag---- or simply buy a bag for $3.00 which we all did!! 

Free valet always a plus!! Unheard of in DC. Drinks looked amazing.

Highly recommend for a great ambiance and good dining experience."}
{"text":"I went for a business lunch and had the crispy chicken tacos - not crispy, but they were OK.  I just thought that $14 for lunch tacos was a bit much.  Maybe that's just me.  I am willing to try again as I imagine dinner, especially sitting outside on the deck would be really nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The roasted chicken is outstanding. Our waiter Matt was awesome. He alone should get 6 stars! Great restaurant and definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Short Version: 5/5 on service and 4/5 on food. Great consistent service and food. Get the Surf and Turf Tacos or the Salmon or The Fish of The Day. Best Arnold Palmer I've ever had! BRING BACK THE LOBSTER SLIDERS!!! 

Long Version: I come here a couple times a week at least because it's very close to where I work. It can get spendy coming here so frequently, but you know exactly what you're getting and the type of service you'll receive. This restaurant seems to have their process locked down. There can be a wait some times during peak hours, so try coming 30 minutes before or after 12. 

I typically get 1 of 3 things which are all great: Salmon, Fish of the Day or The Surf and Turf Tacos. 

The salmon is baked perfectly so it's not too dry and not undercooked. It comes on a bed of the vegetables of the moment so it changes a bit from week to week. 

Their Fish of the Day obviously changes, but I've never had a bad one. Yesterday I had the Striped Sea Bass and it was awesome. It was fried so the skin was perfectly crisp, but the fish meat was moist and juicy. It came on top of artichoke hearts, which were also perfectly tender. 

The Surf and Turf Tacos come with tortillas, a side of Kale Salad, Filet Mignon and Seasoned Shrimp. Pretty self explanatory, but part of what makes this one so tasty is the chipotle sauce that comes with your tacos. You make your own tacos so I'm usually liberal with the chipotle sauce. I never end up with enough tortillas though so I always have to ask for more. The tortillas are on the thicker side, but very soft.

Last but not least, my absolute favorite thing at Chelsea's Kitchen that would've given them a full 5 out of 5 stars but they got rid of it, THE LOBSTER SLIDERS. It was a perfectly crisp lightly battered (perfect, not heavy at all) fried lobster with bacon inside two soft slider buns. Everyone at our office was pretty upset that they got rid of this. Total bummer.

The Arnold Palmer is so perfect. Fresh made lemonade and they do a funky thing with egg whites to create a fun foam in it. You don't taste any eggs in it, don't worry. Get it!"}
{"text":"Not your typical airport food. They. Get. It. We had the Deviled eggs and ahi tuna tacos. Delish! Our server Kristopher Strachann is the man. He worked the whole room with his great personality. Took care of our table and never seemed too busy (even though they were). Request him as your server next time around. You will not be disappointed with his customer service. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday before Valentine's Day completely forgetting that it was Valentine's Day. The wait was 45 minutes, but we were able to grab two seats at the bar.

We had our drinks and food within 20 minutes. We shared the shrimp tacos and short rib tacos which were both phenomenal.

You must valet park, but they were on it and it was not a long wait for the car afterward."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went a little too far yesterday. After a very late night, we decided to treat ourselves to brunch. We started off the only way you can: with a pitcher of sangria. That thing was large. Ridiculously large for two people. I swear, we each had four or five glasses and still hadn't reached the bottom. It was an endless supply. 

Which leads me to this: ordering brunch buzzed is always a bad idea. I am not responsible for the amount of food ordered after drinking.

After my third glass of sangria, I ended up getting the brunch special, which was some kind of baked egg, pulled pork hash with homemade tortillas. That wasn't enough for me, though. Oh, no. I also had to get myself an $8 side of mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the prime rib and tried to finagle himself another mac & cheese, but luckily the waitress talked him out of it ... we don't need to die of a heart attack before noon. 

When the food came it was like a little smorgasbord of heaven. Words were not spoken, only cooing and mmmm sounds for rest of the meal. When I finally paused to take a look around, the damage had been done. I ate myself sick. It was one of those: milk was a bad choice moments. It was hot and I had just eaten a ridiculous amount of melted cheese. By this time, I was sinking low in my seat while the boyfriend encouraged me to help him finish off that damn pitcher. I just couldn't do it. I gave up. Threw in the towel. The meal had won and I felt like that guy on Man vs. Food. I actually had to get a to-go box despite all the eating I'd done. 

When I got home, I took a three hour nap. 

That was some good eatin'."}
{"text":"Grilled swordfish tacos were superb. Service was good, not outstanding-- therefore four stars. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I agree with Lindsey on her review. It is hard to remember that you are in the Airport at this place. I have been to the Chelsea's on 40th street in Phoenx. So I was hoping the food would be good. Yes, it was~!
I had flown in the other morning. There was no food served on the flight. So since I was through flying I thought I would come here for a relaxing meal.
I was seated right away. 
Rachel was my server. She was a really nice young lady, that kept calling me Sir.
She was so fast, I watched her zip all around the restaurant. All of the servers were quick on their feet here.
It is decorated in a relaxing way, even a fire place going, which I liked.
I was not sure what to get.  Rachel (the server) had a few suggustions, that she thought I might like. So I went with the Breakfast.
It was really good. I had never had Cottage Cheese with pepper and Olive Oil. I have to tell you that it is well worth the try.
Great service, Great Food. Well worth a visit here. The coffee was also really good , nice and rich with cream. You can even have a free cookie on your way out. Those were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Best Airport food. Better than many restaurants I have been to. The Short rib tacos are great and enough for 2. Loved the Brussels sprouts salad."}
{"text":"We came for the pan fried chicken. Which was the only entree we didn't end up loving. Go figure!

We started with a cocktail on the patio side of the bar, and moved to a table inside when it was ready.

Appearing on our table (we all shared) was the kale and quinoa salad, the cheeseburger on leaf instead of bun, ribeye, pan fried chicken, grilled salmon and the baked mac n' cheese.
 
Each dish was well presented, good portions and solid flavor. The kale salad and cheeseburger were AMAZING. The ribeye, salmon and mac n' cheese were all very good, and the pan fried chicken was OK. Given the way the four of us felt about all the other items, the chicken was just not up to par.

We finished with really good coffee and a shared dessert of key lime pie with pecan graham cracker crust and the most amazing strawberry gelato any of us have ever tasted. As an added bonus, it's vegan! (A bonus for me, as I have some dairy issues - knowing it was vegan I didn't have to worry about the risk!)

Service was flawless, the room was welcoming and comfortable, and I look forward to many more meals here!"}
{"text":"Get the Huevos Rancheros...BOMB!

Not typical, I'm usually not a fan of Huev-Ranchs but these were delish! Our server was great (red-headed gentleman) but some of the servers seemed agg, so don't make eye contact with them lol. They were a little on edge. Really cute decor and ambience as well."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that you can NEVER go wrong with Chelsea's Kitchen. Their menu variety suits everyone's taste buds, the ambiance can't be beat, and their cocktails are fresh and fab. The prices are definitely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get! 

This past visit, we ordered the shrimp ceviche to start and it was so fresh. The perfect starter because it doesn't fill you up too much! Next, my fiance and I split the Brussels sprout salad. YOU GUYS, this salad is a must. I can't get enough of it! Even if you're not a big fan of Brussels, you'll like this salad, I promise! For my entree, I got the rotisserie prime rib and it was cooked to perfection. I love the horseradish sauce that they serve on the side! Another entree winner is their short rib tacos! Last but not least, don't forget to grab one of their homemade salted chocolate chip cookies on the way out! TO. Die. For.

I know that we'll be back soon! Thanks for always being so amazing, Chelsea's!"}
{"text":"Perfect experience...wait shorter than they predicted, exemplary service and the food was great. I had the rib eye steak which was outstanding. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I went to Chelsea's for lunch. I had a friend in town from Canada (where it is still snowing). We wanted to go somewhere with a great patio where we could enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring weather, and also have a nice lunch.

We were not disappointed! The patio is perfect! It is surrounded by pretty trees and flowers. It has just the right amount of shade, you can enjoy the sunshine, but you don't feel like you are baking. 

We had the taco platters. I had the Ahi and it was great. My friend had the swordfish which was also great. We enjoyed our yummy tacos with a couple of Prickly Pear Margaritas, which tasted as nice as they looked.

I will definitely make the drive to Phoenix to visit Chelsea's again."}
{"text":"40 minutes, 125 dollars later. Pathetic. 

I love to eat out. I am a total foodie and because of that, I've eaten at a lot of places in the valley. Good, bad, everywhere in between. I came here with my mom for Mother's Day dinner. Seemed odd that I had never been. Highly rated on yelp, great patio, and I love LGO so this seemed like a perfect choice. Boy was I wrong. 

We felt rushed the entire time. From the minute we sat down at our table with the waitress repeatedly asking if we were ready, until the moment we paid our check took 40 minutes. How is that even possible? Forty minutes for three courses on Mother's Day. It's not like I wanted to spend time with my mom or anything. Our appetizer came out with our soup and our entrees. For entrees priced at over twenty dollars I would rather not be rushed through my meal. I felt like I was at Applebee's. 

The food was mediocre, especially for the price. We got a variety of things off the menu including the short rib tacos and pan fried chicken. Both lacked seasoning and I felt like I could have made them at home. 

Great ambience especially on a nice day, but if I'm going to pay 20+ an entree I expect better service (or any service at all) and better food. Highly disappointed. The only reason this place got two stars instead of one was the free chocolate chip cookies at the front on your way out."}
{"text":"Best deviled eggs ever! The bacon on them is genius! Love the food and atmosphere! Perfect date place! Love the sea salt choc chip cookies as you walk out!"}
{"text":"Picking up my Enterprise rental car at Sky Harbor, gave me a good excuse to try the  Chelsea Kitchen once again. 

My sunnyside eggs were PERFECT, bacon was crispy with a nice salty flavor, my breakfast potatoes were done to perfection, freshly baked toast was SUPERB, my bottomless coffee...TASTY. 

Service by Matt was FUN with interesting conversation.

Was I at an airport? The Chelsea Kitchen, Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor gets the job done. EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday evening about 630 and the place was full. Was fortunate to get a table in bar. Friendly staff immediately greeted us and offered drinks. The Chelsea Burger was delicious I ordered mine with a salad(could have used a tad more dressing), but my daughter ordered hers with fries and they were possibly the best fries I have ever tasted. (Maybe I am was just really hungry but they were fantastic). All told we were in and out in 45 minutes and it was very busy. Highly recommend and love the little treats they offered on the way out."}
{"text":"I love the new trend with airport dining!

I've been to Chelsea's Kitchen twice now and am thankful for the healthy and innovative dining option. The wine choices (by the glass) are great too!

In fact, yesterday I dined here upon my arrival as I figured it was just as good as any dining in the area (based on my experience from my first visit last year).

I was not disappointed when I enjoyed the ahi tacos. The service is also attentive and speedy (for those needing to catch flights).

I look forward to my visit to Phoenix airport as this dining experience is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Every time e come to PHX we plan enough time to eat at Chelsea's.  The service is fast and the food is excellent.  I like the many healthy options.  The Brussel sprout salad is amazing.  I first thought yuck until I tried it!"}
{"text":"We're picky eaters, and this place is awesome! Chicken nachitos and a pitcher of Sangria- every time. They usually have to walk us out because we can't feel our face, but wouldn't have it any other way - lol! Best restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The ambiance certainly deserves 5 stars!!  This place is very charming and there were enough heat lamps on the patio with the outdoor fireplace that makes the night time temp comfortable in January.  

The deviled eggs were excellent. The chicken nachitos were pretty good with fresh jalapeños. The fried chicken was good but the mashed potatoes were average.   We have had the green chili burger and Frys which were both excellent.

Huge wine list but only 4 beers on draft. The free salted carmel cookies were excellent!!  The valet parking was free with tips.  Bring a good dose of patience because there was a wait for a table and a wait for food."}
{"text":"I ordered the wrong thing. I got one of the burgers. it was smelly, kinda dry and burntish on the edges. but i ordered the wrong thing. in fact, they should remove it from the menu. gross.


anywho- i LOVED this patio, and the price was fair. The service was decent and I will definitely be back just for the patio. it is so calm back there. 

perfect iced tea."}
{"text":"So this place was pretty neat.  We met my folks there for lunch on Saturday.   I am a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, so when they suggested it, I was pretty stoked to try it.   The restaurant itself has a modern yet organic feel.  The outside patio is just beautiful.  I would love to go there on a date with my Hottie and have a glass of wine by the fire place!  But I'll wait until fall =).  

About the food, it was very good, no complaints. I had a homemade veggie burger and fries with Gruyere cheese.   The boys both ordered burgers and devoured them, so I assume they were good.  My Mom had the Short rib tacos and she raved about them, the server said that was there specialty and her favorite.   She also tried their white sangria which was pretty tasty too.   

For dessert we had a chocolate flourless cake served with pistachio gelato and whip cream.... Um, can I say... YUM!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants to frequent.. often calling in for take out orders on those tired evenings home from work. I called in recently and was told they no longer accept \"to go\" orders and that I should come in, stand at the bar, and wait for 25 minutes for my food to be cooked. The attitude of the bartender who relayed this message was rude and sarcastic, trying to act as if this was standard policy. Too bad. Customer service is important in the industry.. and perhaps some of the staff at Chelseas kitchen would benefit from understanding that!!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Chelsea's Kitchen. It's been on my bucket list to dine here for some time now. First of all, I love the atmosphere and overall feel of this place as you walk in. It's designed to look like a one-story ranch house, with a peaked roof, a huge porch, and a large patio area out back with a brick fireplace. Chelsea's Kitchen is part of LGO hospitality (a group of restaurants that puts a modern twist on American comfort food operated by founder Bob Lynn) and is located in the beautiful Arcadia district. They specialize in big, flavorful portions and create their dishes fresh daily. There are several locations throughout California and Arizona (I'm a frequent visitor to La Grande Orange). We started our night out with some of their fancy cocktails. I've been on whiskey kick and got their Old Fashioned (the drunken cherries were a nice add) and my date got the Diego Rivera. I heard so much about their awards winning Short Rib Tacos and couldn't pass them up. The braised meat was delicious and tender and there was plenty to eat. My date is from Mexico City and she had their Seafood & Jidori Chicken Paella. It was a nice blend of chicken, shrimp and clams and she loved very bite. The service was excellent and the experience was definitely was worth the wait. They have complimentary valet parking and reduced prices on their happy menu. They also have $12 endless mimosas on Saturday afternoons."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE peanut allergies. STAY AWAY.  We called prior to going and were told that we were pretty much safe except for the fried chicken.  We were seated and told our server about the allergy and she assured us everything on the table was fine....until I started reacting to the chicken nachos.....come to find out they had peanut oil and I was eating quite a bit.  The night ended with an epipen injection....YIKES.  The manager ran out to talk to us but I was too concerned about my throat closing to care.....Won't be back."}
{"text":"We met our dear friends here for an afternoon Sunday lunch.  Upon arrival we had the option of using valet parking  (which was interesting because the parking lot has plentiful spaces very close to the door).
We opted to dine outside where the ambiance is mellow and relaxing.  The trees cast pleasant shade and felt like a break from reality. We felt unhurried and pampered.
We ordered cocktails which were tasty and the bloody Mary had just enough vegetables and spice.
We selected  the nachos that were MEGA large and MEGA delicious.  We all shared it and an order of shrimp ceviche.  It was so satisfying that the only other items were another round of drinks and a hamburger to share, with oodles of fries. 
Unfortunately, a downside to sitting outside are the birds who hang out in the trees.  One made a poop deposit on my hair and on my sweater. You can't blame the restaurant for that!!
On the way out, a tray of cookies was available to take a little dessert home for free. The cookies made me forget about the bird souvenir in my hair.  
We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!!  I wanted to try this place because I saw reviews for the short rib tacos.  Short ribs are one of my favorite dishes so I had to try them. I went with my husband, my mother and two daughters (3 and 5) this past Sunday night. I had read some mixed reviews about the dishes not being worth the price and the short ribs being too expensive.  PEOPLE THEY SERVE GRASS FED BEEF!!!  Grass fed is always more expensive (not to mention healthier for you).  Short ribs in general are always expensive.  If you want GMO corn fed beef filled with steroids and antibiotics then go somewhere else. You will probably still pay the same price for short ribs and only save a couple dollars on the burger. 

My husband and I both got the short rib tacos and neither one of us could finish our meal.  The kale slaw was amazing and I'm not a slaw fan or a raw kale fan.  This kale slaw had quinoa, shredded parmesan and a delicious light dressing on it. Even my three year old enjoyed it. My mom thought her burger was delicious and so were the seasoned fries. My kids loved the homemade mac n cheese.  My kids and I are gluten intolerant and our server was very sensitive to our needs. The kids received gluten free pasta and the server assured me my ribs were also gluten free, served with warm, corn tortillas. I really enjoyed my leftover tacos the next day for lunch with fries.  I will definitely be coming back here again and it was definitely worth the price!!!!  

I read some reviews about bad service but we did not experience that.  The place was packed when we walked in and our server was very attentive to us. The only thing that took a while was getting some ketchup but other than that the service was great! The servers have iPads to take orders so that your order is immediately sent to the kitchen before the server leaves the table.  The food came quick for how packed this place was.  I also liked that wicky sticks were given to my kids when we sat down. They love playing with those and I usually keep them in my purse for restaurant visits. It was nice that I didn't have to pull out my own stash. Overall this was a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try out the patio seating."}
{"text":"Fun semi casual environment for a Friday dinner, couple of cars in line for valet parking but only took a minute or so and gave an opportunity to take a look at some of the finer automobiles available to those that have the means.  Put our name in for a table and found a spot at the bar,  before we finished the first round the hostess found us and we were seated much quicker than expected given that this was a popular spot.  I had the special which was Arctic Char on a medley of vegetables accompanied with a light cream horseradish sauce...excellent pairing.  Friend had the filet mignon served with mashed potatoes and  a spaghetti squash side, not a scrap of food was left on either plate.   A few other friends stopped in and ordered the chicken Nachos..also excellent.  Great restaurant and comfortable patio with a large fireplace and plenty of space heaters to keep you warm."}
{"text":"This place has always been good to my family. The food is of good quality and comes in pretty decent portions. The atmosphere has never felt too hectic. Their service has always been fast. Last time I went there, I was out of the place in less than an hour. I can rarely say that about a non-fast food restaurant. The staff have always been nice and accommodating. Maybe they are of a different quality in the afternoon since I only visit them for breakfast or brunch but they definitely nail the beginning part of the day."}
{"text":"During a connecting flight, the boyfriend and I stopped here to grab a bite to eat. I'm glad we didn't wait to go to NY to eat because this place was great all around. After lending in Phoenix from Los Cabos you would think that we were done with tacos, but that was not the case we got more tacos and they did not disappoint. 

My boyfriend got the short rib tacos and I got the Rib-eye tacos. Both plates came with a kale salad that included quinoa, feta cheese and grapes, never had this combination but since then I make it myself at home because it was that good and who would've thought that kale was even that good. The devil eggs were one of the best I've ever had.

Restaurants at the jetBlue terminal in JFK has one of the best airport food all around, until I tried Chelsea's Kitchen that changed. With great service and great food you can't go wrong, wish this was the experience everyone gets when they eat at an airport."}
{"text":"Sometimes I bookmark places because it has a dish I want, and sometimes I just bookmark a whole bunch and decide on the day of. And I went with Chelsea's Kitchen since it has good reviews. But somehow it didn't meet up to my expectation. Or it could be I had a wrong dish from Chelsea. 

We arrived before noon and it was amazingly packed already. You know it's a fancy place when they do valet during that hour. That, or the place is just really packed that they run out of parking fast. Great valet service though. Very nice people.

Indoor was all taken so we chose the outdoor and didn't have to wait long. The outdoor patio is great for a nice sunny day like that day we went. My only complaint is the flowers from above frequently fall down a lot so it got into my water. 

Short Rib Taco ($19): I usually ask the waiter's recommendation when I don't have a dish in mind to order. She told me their short rib tacos is a popular dish so that's what I chose. Being the Asian that I am, I was expecting the actual Korean short ribs hence it costs so much. But it turns out more like shredded beef or almost like pulled pork when I had in Hawaii. The dish came with tortilla chips of course, salsa and cole slaw.  Hmm not just I was disappointed but the dish itself was not that great either. The meat was sooo chewy and nothing special about the flavor worth mentioning. 

Fries ($4): I'm so glad I had fries as my appetizer. Sadly, I think that's the best thing I ate at Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, dinner or brunch. Plan ahead - this place is very popular (for many good reasons) but they do not take reservations for groups smaller than twelve"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here to Chelsea's for awhile.  I didn't realize it had become such a meeting place with the weather so nice and their huge patio.  Their service was better than good and can't complain about the food and there was plenty of it.  For some reason wasn't thrilled with the place today.  Maybe just my attitude.  I will go back."}
{"text":"After waiting 45 minutes for a table at dinnertime on a Thursday, I realized why..the food was wonderful.

I had the prime rib which was cooked in their outdoor fireplace. I got it medium, as ordered,  and couldn't finish the huge portion. I had a Caesar's salad because I didn't know I'd get veggies with my meat.  The meal came with mashed potatoes and sauted kohlrabies with the green tops.  I didn't really like the kohlrabies since they were still so hard I couldn't safely stab a fork into them.  

The children's menu was quite boring so my youngest had tacos from the regular menu.  The tortillas come separately so you put it together yourself.  They bring more tortillas if you want.

The hostesses seemed frazzled but the wait staff was still smiling and worked hard.

Free fresh baked salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door leaves a good last impression."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale on business and this is our go to place for food for lunch.  The service is always good and the food is amazing.  We had the smoked trout appetizer, the tuna burger, black bean soup and salad.  All the food is prepared with care, looks and taste wonderful. They also have a nice wine & beer list.  They have seating inside and outside.  We prefer sitting outside among the trees near the canal."}
{"text":"I am writing this review because I am alive. I had a near death experience while visiting Chelsea's Kitchen. I happened right about dessert time while I was halfway through my red velvet cake slice. It was that good, I almost died. But I didn't, I lived to tell about it. 

Red. Velvet. Cake. (Flashbacks...)

As for the rest of the dining experience:
-Valet parking (saves me time and effort!)
-Beautiful inside decor (comfy Sedona-ish feel.)
-Lively menu items
-Lovely and sweet staff

I have no negative comments about Chelsea's. The wait for the food was a bit long and the food is a bit on the mild side. The dessert items however, are to die for (as mentioned above.) Other than that I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was very nice. it has a very eloquent  feel to it. I took my family. if I did it over again, I probably would have made it a date night out. However the food was very good and the service was fair as well. The restaurant does have valet as well."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix for work often and this is one of my top places.. Everything is executed perfectly and prepared fresh. Good mix of Southwestern Cuisine combined with some original touches. Prices a little on the high side but you get what you pay for and this place is definitely worth it. Dining room is very nice and cozy as well. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I just loved the ambience specially the outside one after the bar. Food was great though we had burgers and egg something as appetizer. I loved the potato dish on the side, I forgot the name but it is on the menu and the server can tell you. Drinks I would say wine would be a better option, although we had bourbon based cocktails which I think could have been better. But overall place is great."}
{"text":"We were a table of 5 to celebrate a birthday and it turned out great .. The 9 year old on our table also gave her seal of approval ! The place was packed (Wednesday) and the service was a tad bit slow but the server more than made up for it with his attitude and attention to the table .. Most definitely a good night out .. Recommend the short rib taco"}
{"text":"I have dined in here a few times, and taken an order to go. While the service is average, the food isn't that great and it is incredibly overpriced. I have tried various things in the menu and I wasn't crazy about the food. I think the only thing that is good on there would be the chips,salsa, and guacamole."}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish. Had the Howie burger and the short ribs. DELICIOUS!!!  Great service and wonderful atmosphere. Cannot recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"Love this place.  One of my favorite restaurants in all of Phoenix.  Prime Rib is the best I've ever had.  Love the cookies on the way out too.  Gotta go"}
{"text":"Decide to this place, ordinarily I would have gone to the chicken and waffles place across the hall, but my Doctor says I have to eat healthier and the other place serves no alcohol.  The datk meat chicken caesar was awesome!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. I think the burgers and fries are to die for. Also the Brussels Sprout salad is amazing. It's a great place to go sit outside in the courtyard. It's a great place for big groups and has a cool ambience and atmosphere. I haven't had anything that I didn't like which tells me the place is great. I would recommend to come try this place out."}
{"text":"I had brunch here last Sunday. Huevos Rancheros. Incredible. And the Sunday morning atmosphere was such a treat .... attractive singles, cheerful families, young, old, etc.... Well worth the trip to arcadia."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here when we had  a layover in phx and it was a really good choice!  I had a white sangria which had fresh apples, oranges, and other fruit and we got salsa, guac, and chips for an appetizer.  Chris ordered the short rib tacos which I tried which were deelish and I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich.  I Love crispy chicken sandwiches and this is the best one I've had!  I was cooked perfectly and wasn't too heavy- which is hard to nail with a chicken breast.  The fries it came with were deelish too- a hint of sweet and salty- we devoured them!  Service was great and I really felt like I was at a nice restaurant, not just at the airport!  Keep up the good work and food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance but food mediocre.  Would give it another try."}
{"text":"Parking is not good and they have a process in place that makes it very hard to park yourself.  The food was ok but not inspiring.  Service was ok but not great and we went during happy hour.  Overall it was ok but for over a hundred bucks I think it should be more than that.  May go back but not likely"}
{"text":"Good food but not very good service. I don't know if it's because we was in tennis shoes and shorts. (We just got back from a hike in Echo Park ), but the waitress never seem to pay much attention to us since we were surrounded by well dressed group of people. 
I had the shrimp ceviche which was very good. Short rib taco had only 2 tortilla, what was I supposed to eat the rest of the meat with? 

Highlights of the meal: a handful free chocolate chips cookie with sea salt at the door, which the bf didn't even share."}
{"text":"During my layover, I enjoyed a delicious seared tuna salad.The staff was extremely accommodating to my dining needs, and without asking provided water for my darling Ella. The bar tender made me an incredibly refreshing Hendricks gin cocktail, with muddled cucumber. Overall this restaurant makes travel, dare I say, enjoyable."}
{"text":"I absolutley LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen! I can't believe I lived across the street from them for 8 months before eating their delicious-ness!

My fiance's brother and sister-in-law came over to our apartment and we were deciding on a place to eat and drink that wasn't too far so someone could still drive us home (we like to eat, drink and be merry). My future brother-in-law suggested Chelsea's Kitchen since it's literally across the street, obviously within walking distance, that way no one has to drive. So we trekked across the street and into a gorgeous restaurant. 
It was a Friday night, but for some reason it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our server was a tall, strawberry-blonde type that made the whole experience even better. I think at one point we even invited him to sit and have a drink with us.
We started with a pitcher of the white sangria, which is made fresh daily (along with all their food), and soon found ourselves ordering another....and another. It was so refreshing on a hot summers night, we just couldn't resist.
I ordered the Short Rib taco platter, which was absolutely to-die-for! The ribs were so tender, and the fresh homemade corn tortillas were perfect! The plate also comes with black beans and rice, guacamole, salsa fresca and sour creme. I couldn't even finish it all.
We all ordered something different so that we could all try each others, but I honestly can't remember what my fiance, or my future brother and sister-in-law ordered. That probably has something to do with the large amounts of sangria I was drinking.

Anyway, we went back again just a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of sitting out on their back patio. I definitely suggest waiting for a seat out there. The ambiance they create with the trees and lighting is perfect for a date, or double-date night. We again started with a pitcher of the sangria at the bar while we waited for a table to open on this busier saturday evening. We were seated within the 20 minutes they promised and got the Brussels Sprout Salad to start off our eating pleasures.
I'd never really like Brussels Sprouts and was hesitant at first to try it, but when it arrived at the table I was amazed at how green and fresh it looked that I couldn't help myself. That salad has raised the bar on my Brussels sprouts eating for sure!

We LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen and I definitely recommend you eat and drink and be merry here!"}
{"text":"For airport food this place was top notch I had the steak tacos which were excellent my coworker had the filet which he said was one of the best steaks he has had in a while. If you are stuck at the PHX airport I would check this place out."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen was hopping Thursday night!  After a 15 minute wait for a patio table we found ourselves joyfully greeted by several waiters. Three of us ordered different tacos: surf and turf, short ribs and swordfish. If you don't ask for jalapenos you will not have any spicy heat to accentuate the dish. Chelsea's patio ambiance is fantastic, yet their beer selection is audacious. Even the most sophisticated palate sometimes enjoys a light beer on a \"school night\"."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen has NEVER disappointed me.  I come by myself, or I bring out of town visitors with me.  It is always good, everytime. If you want to go there for a date or a family dinner, you won't be disappointed.  The Ahi Tuna Burger is my fave!!!!  They have a pretty substantial  wine list as well"}
{"text":"Me and a couple of colleagues stopped in to grab some food before the flight. We got there about 3pm and it wasn't busy at all. 

Waiter was super cool. Older guy with glasses.

I got the crispy chicken sandwich and tore that thing up with a side of their thousand island dressing. 

So good I was contemplating ordering another one. The next time I am in Phoenix will have to stop by again."}
{"text":"I've never been done wrong at Chelsea's. But I've never been utterly wowed either. The food is consistently good, the service and atmosphere are top notch and it's in a great location, but I can't seem to give them five stars.  I have always gotten their tacos and most recently tried the seared ahi ones that our server said were only on the lunch menu but I could get for dinner. The ahi was perfectly done and tasted great but didn't really jive with the soft taco fixins. Still it was tasty and I ate and liked it. JD had a cheeseburger that he described as \"meh, not as good as Delux (his gold standard)\". 

Maybe my only thing against  Chelsea's is that it has yet to serve me anything so special to make me YEARN to go back again. If someone suggests it for dinner I'm all in, but would I ever be the suggestee? Nope probably not. Perhaps I should try something new the next time I go and I just might fall for Chelsea's a little harder, but for now she's just an acquaintance that I don't talk bad about but neither do I praise."}
{"text":"After a long and stressful work week, I wanted to enjoy a delectable Sunday brunch with The Lady. Being fairly new to Phoenix, I had to search Yelp for brunch spots in the valley, and read rave reviews about Chelsea's Kitchen. I called to make a reservation on the patio, but unfortunately CK doesn't take them. Hmm, ok. 

Having worked as a valet for many years, I understand the importance of the first impression. Kudos to the valets for their engagement and sense of humor.   

Much to my chagrin, a patio table was a 20 minute wait. If only CK accepted reservations...We opted to be seated right away. We weren't disappointed with our table in the least bit. It was a perfect spot to look across the entire restaurant with our backs to the morning sun shining through the windows behind us. 

The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. The Lady described it as being very 'homey, intimate and quaint.\" The background noise was very minimal, due in large part to the openness of the restaurant and the nice table spacing, even despite the open kitchen being smack-dab at the main doors. To be honest, I did have a beautiful woman sitting next to me, so it was hard for me to focus on anything else. 

Our server was great. Very friendly, always smiling, and expedient. She was there when we needed her, and gone when we did not. The French press pot she left on the table added a nice upscale feel to the coffee, and the mimosas were a perfect blend.

The Lady ordered the Eggs Benedict, which I was going to order, so I had to make an audible at the line of scrimmage. Chilaquiles it is. The atmosphere set the bar high for the food, but sadly the food left a little to be desired. Maybe add a little more seasoning to the chicken in the Chilaquiles. The Lady's poached eggs were actually medium boiled eggs. That poor LGO English muffin didn't get any yolk! Simmer water and crack an egg into it and you're 90% on your way to poaching an egg.

All in all, a great overall experience. I am curious to taste what else CK has to offer for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"food was good...got the short rib tacos which was very tender! tortillas were warm and soft!
brussel sprouts salad was yummy! loved the manchego on top but there was only 3 shavings of it..wouldve liked more.

service was ok, food was better
ambiance was nice..."}
{"text":"Who knew such amazing food could come from a kitchen at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport? I certainly didn't.

So my flight was supposed to leave back to Vegas at 6pm. Then the text came in that my flight was delayed to 9pm. Game Over. My battleship had been sunk. I was stuck. What else do you do when you have 3+ hours to kill at an airport? Eat dinner of course!

I really liked how Sky Harbor has a ton of non-chain restaurants in their main food court area. A quick glance at Yelp and Chelsea's Kitchen with it's great dining room was an easy pick. The menu isn't huge, but definitely has enough options to appease a variety of diners. My selection on this flight-delayed evening was the short rib tacos. It was an easy decision to make once our dynamite waitress gave the suggestion saying it was what they were known for. We also decided to start off with chips & guacomole. I don't know if I was just famished or if it was that good, but the guac was absolutely off the charts good. My tacos were equally as tasty. The short rib was super tender, great flavor, and the homemade corn tortillas made this a 5 star meal. I wasn't crazy about the kale slaw that accompanied it, but I'm also not a big fan of kale. The person I was traveling with landed on the Green Chili burger and it looked really, really good. He housed that, I housed mine, and we were able to kill a good 90 minutes in the restaurant.

The service was incredible, the ambiance was very nice (especially for an airport), and most importantly the food was great. Next time it won't be a mandated delay, I'll get to the airport early enough to partake in another Chelsea's Kitchen meal."}
{"text":"Did someone say Deviled eggs with bacon?!?!?  

We came to CK based on the feedback from our fellow Yelpers.  We visited the restaurant on a Saturday morning around 11:30 am. While the place was busy, there was no wait and we were seated immediately.  Our server was quick and friendly and we had multiple folks helping us throughout the morning.  We had:  

- 6 Deviled eggs with bacon - sooooooooo yummy!!!!! ($7)
- Bottomless Mimosas ($12)
- Arnold Palmer (can someone tell me where all of that foam comes from?) - ($3)
- French Omelet (Gruyere cheese & spinach served w/spinach and English muffin... why not a croissant?) - ($12)
- Lobster sliders with green beans ($16)
- Side of sauteed spinach (no charge since they gave us green beans in error)
- Red Velvet cake ($8)

Total = $63.39 with tax no tip

The food for the most part was good.  The French Omelet while touted to be a local favorite was just okay.  The Lobster sliders while small actually had more flavor.  I enjoyed the bottomless mimosas and appreciated that my glass was never empty.

We asked for the red velvet to go just because we were stuffed from everything else.  On the way out we grabbed a couple of the salted chocolate chip cookies as well and they were equally delicious.

I liked the vibe and decor of this place and the service was just fine.  If in the area again, I'll certainly like to come back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Every time I have come to enjoy a nice morning meal I am surprised with something on the menu I never thought to order. Stinging here this morning it was the norm: huevos rancheros YUM!

A recommendation from the exceptional waiter (cute by the way) and I am now finishing my mouth watering taste bud pampering order of Chelsea's Hot Cakes!!! Plus Plus Plus

P.S. don't ask for the Bellini... They are out. Sad Face. But Saturdays the endless Mimosa sounds like a good deal."}
{"text":"My first time at Chelsea's Kitchen.  Went for brunch with a small group of ladies. We sat on the patio and it was wonderful. We had ordered the deviled eggs with bacon. Oh my yummy. I could have had 5 orders of that myself. I'm still craving it now.  Also had a mimosa, the hot cakes with a side of bacon.  I personally didn't like the hotcakes but a couple gals at our table tried it and they enjoyed it.  
My only one tiny complaint is the shedding of the trees above all the patio tables. They do give tons of shade so I cant complain too much. Just make sure to watch when you take a bite or drink that you don't take in twigs or leaves.  The server even had twigs in the water jug she used to fill our waters so one of us had the surprise twig added to her water.  Oh and have a friend check your hair before you leave to get all the leaves out of your hair. Yeah, you'll look like a couple of monkeys searching for bugs in their fur, but everyone else would be doing it too. 
Looking forward to going back for lunch and dinner and having more deviled eggs!"}
{"text":"Undercooked salmon (server said it would be medium), but more sadly, the vegetable of the day was fresh English Peas with crimini mushrooms, a favorite of mine and these too were undercooked, overly coated with butter/oil and worse yet, the delicate flavor masked with red hot peppers.   The fingerling potatoes were lukewarm when brought to the table.  I know this place is highly rated by many but it will take a lot to persuade me to come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic servive !! I had one of the best experiences  there monday afternoon . I was GREETED by Kimberly who made my entire experience the best . Kimberly's energy and communication was flawless .Everyone who has been there knows the scene on the patio  is ideal for people watching . The rotisserie chicken i ordered had flavor  burst in every bite .I just want everyone to go and have the pleasure to have Kimberly show her contagious smile .I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Ahi tacos, rib tacos and ribs are all good but a little overpriced. Service staff is always top-notch. Both the beer and wine lists are good, mixed and specialty drinks are nicely done."}
{"text":"Only had 30 minutes to eat so the waitress suggested the kale salad or the green chile burger.  My friend got the burger and I had the salad.  It was incredible.  We split them and man were they good.  The hostess and waitress were incredible and the atmosphere was awesome for an airport.  We are going back to Phoenix in November and we have already decided to go the Airport early to eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites. The food is great, service is prompt and friendly. The wait usually goes by quickly as you are able to get a drink at the bar and then next thing you know, they are summoning you to your table. The last time we were there was for my husband's birthday. There were 5 adults and the total bill was about $250, before the tip. 
One of our favorites is the short rib, yummy, yummy. It is so juicy and delicious. We have never taken any home as there are never any leftovers.
It does get \"loud\", but I like to call it \"lively\". 
We will be back again soon, I hope."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spaces for brunch, lunch or dinner. They have a wonderful outdoor patio area. A wide variety of menu options and delicious food. Get a pitcher of sangria! Really fresh and fruity!"}
{"text":"First time here. Beautiful atmosphere  crowded but we did get an inside table right away. It would have been nice to sit outside but the wait was already 40 minutes and we were starving. Our waiter was Zack and he was at the table offering drinks almost as soon as we sat down.  The food was magnificent.  I really didn't like the coffee very  much. Zack was very attentive  and checked on us often.   The manager also checked on us to make sure our meal was perfect.   Very relaxing,  very enjoyable  meal."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is possibly the worst airport restaurant ever! My chicken was undercooked and it took them an hour to get the food out! This place is a ripoff. Don't go here! Stick with some place normal, like Starbucks or McDonalds."}
{"text":"I guess I never made it to Chelsea's until yesterday because the location is slightly off the beaten path and tucked away on 40th St. Being such a big fan of LaGrande L'Orange (LGO), it was great to find some of the same food at Chelsea's. If you want a quieter, more intimate experience than LGO, this is a great choice.

The patio is completely tree-covered and the birds were chirping and squawking as loudly as they could around lunchtime. It was like a real-life version of the Tiki Room at Disneyland. Arcadia is probably one of the only places in the valley where you'd find a patio like Chelsea's with as many trees. Just beautiful!

We ordered Pumpkin Soup and Vegetables. Both were delicious...brussel sprouts and broccoli.

The brussel spouts were served slightly chilled and were blanched. They were a nice alternative to the usual grilled brussel sprout option which has been \"a thing\" since 2012.

I was very impressed with the broccoli preparation. In addition to the top of the broccoli, they cut uniform rectangles from the stalk and used that too with some shavings from the stalk. This gave the dish several different textures. When I cook at home I cook the broccoli stalks.* I genuinely appreciated the use of the whole vegetable in the dish at Chelsea's. 

I remember watching an episode of Chopped once where all they got to cook with was the pieces of food and vegetables that are usually discarded (celery tops, the ends of the onion, etc.). I thought of my grandparents (Italian immigrants) and how they valued food and used every last little bit of it for soup or even for compost. 

At any rate, I will most definitely go back to Chelsea's and try more menu items. I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because I think the portions could be larger for the prices. However, since this is the more upscale version of LGO, I'm sure their overhead is bigger and they have chef instead of cooks. The service was very good.

I wouldn't exactly call this a \"family restaurant\" but having kids on the patio would be fine. I did notice stacks of booster seats off to the side of the patio, so they might actually have a lof of kids there from time to time. There was a small family sitting across from us. The children were about 4 and 6. The little boy was learning how to use a fork and jabbed his chicken in one whole piece. It was very charming to watch his little cave man attempt to be civilized.

*If you want to try cooking broccoli stalks at home, cut them and put them in a steamer or pressure cooker (InstaPot) to make them more tender. Then, if you grill them, they'll be much easier to eat. The same is true for Chard stalks, although they are more bitter than broccoli stalks. You can add some reduced balsamic vinegar to tone done the bitterness."}
{"text":"Curious who Chelsea's namesake came from??  Whoever is the inspiration:  THANK YOU for the fresh ingredients (local markets), Jidori (free range) Chicken is used:  \"It's like Kobe beef but for chicken\", some organic ingredients & gluten free dishes available or can be modified to your needs.

They have a kids menu which is free 3-6pm daily.  And a great $5 happy hour drinks from 3-6 as well. Hmmmmm I personally think that's good timing haha!!  

Also, must try their Weekend Brunch with their unlimited mimosas for $12 pp. Thank goodness it's walking distance & they have a bike rack for us locals!!

Now our food was amazingly delicious:  

SEAFOOD PAELLA (mussels, shrimp, chorizo, jidori chicken, green chile, rice) is a definite must have again!  The jidori chicken placed on top of dish was moist & the skin easily peeled off. My niece loved the mussels!

REAL Corn Bread w/ Green Chile made at Chelsea's gluten free and in limited quantities cause it's fresh & yummy!

Market fresh vegetable was sautéed Broccoli di Cicco (Calabrian chile vinegar, Parmesan Reggiano, house-made breadcrumbs)
FRENCH PRESS Coffee- Organic Coffee (MR. ESPRESSO oakwood-roasted organic coffee from Oakland, California) woke me up very nicely.

And it's a very open feeling with great decor inside or out with local Plants abounding & next to canal. Quite beautiful AZ landscaping.  The staff & Steve W. was very friendly & professional.  Steve gave me great recommendations for next time at Chelsea's & other LGO's locations. Yummmmm can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"From drinks, to appetizers, main course, and dessert... We had a great experience and my review moves from one star to three stars all the way up to five stars. Before posting this I checked with our group of five people and we all agree five stars for Chelsea's! Our highest recommendations go to the trout appetizer, the brussels sprouts salad, the fish of the day, and key lime pie. The service was impeccable. I am really happy that our experience was turned around so beautifully. MOVED MY REVIEW FROM 1 TO 3 STARS TODAY BECAUSE CHELSEA'S HANDLED THE BELOW COMPLAINT QUICKLY AND PROFESSIONALLY BACK IN SEPTEMBER.  TONIGHT OUR GROUP RETURNS AND I WILL REVISE AGAIN AFTER DINNER.  WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO FINE DINING TONIGHT!  I just returned from dinner at Chelsea's kitchen. I was entertaining a group of five people and wanted to show them a great experience. We started out with appetizers and wine and everything was going well. We loved our corner table. All of the sudden a staff member named Natasha sweeps up to our table and asks if we would be willing to move in order to accommodate a gentleman's 80th birthday who is set on having our corner table. I was reluctant. It didn't feel right but everyone at the table wanted to accommodate this 80-year-old gentleman so we gladly moved to a smaller table.

We watched that corner table all night and an 80-year-old never appeared. The oldest person at that table was about 30. There were lots of exercise buffs and one young pregnant woman. No 80-year-old in sight

While the service at our new table was good, the waiter was cheery, and the food was good: This did not offset the fact that we felt duped by Natasha. Apparently someone slipped her enough money to make it worthwhile to uproot us. So that free first round of drinks and dessert did not offset the sour taste in our mouth from being duped. If Chelsea's would accept reservations so seating could be done in an orderly fashion it would be different. Instead someone like Natasha it is in a position to take advantage of us. Not appreciated."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas for $12, can't be beat!  I also got the green chili burger. TBH the chiles were pretty horrific looking (not what I expected to see) so I took them off. But the meat was seasoned so well. I didn't have the coffee, but my friend did and said it was some of best coffee she's had!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I rarely encounter a French fry that I do not like.  At Chelsea's Kitchen, the way-too-heavy sprinkling of spices actually helped me to eat much fewer fries than I normally would have consumed relying on self-restraint alone.  Sometimes this would be kind of a plus, but I was planning on indulging and was disappointed that Chelsea's managed to ruin my favorite guilty pleasure.

The rest of the food I tasted was good.  The Crispy Chicken Salad made with grilled chicken was perfect.  Fresh spinach, sugared pecans, and a delicious dressing - yum!  The veggie burger was excellent too.  It had grains, beans, veggies, and a nice sauce.  

The service was a bit irksome.  The waitress disappeared for a while after bringing our drinks.  Once we finally got to order our food, there was another long wait, during which the manager came over, acknowledged that our food was taking a while, and asked if we were \"okay.\"  We responded with a half-hearted, \"yeah we're great...just waiting for our food.....\"  Wouldn't this type of visit from a manager normally include an offer of a free something or other?  But no - he said the food should be out shortly and left the table.  Afterwards we looked at each other like 'What WAS that?'  

When the food came out (not right away), we needed a couple of things (another plate, ketchup - perfectly reasonable items) and the waitress took her time bringing them.

The atmosphere both inside and on the patio was warm and cozy with several fireplaces and a smokey-barbequey-campfirey smell wafting throughout.  Most of the food was good.  The fresh baked cookies waiting by the door are a nice touch.  Just don't expect great service."}
{"text":"One of the best patios in Phoenix. The Brussels Sprouts salad is delicious and The Howie Burger is a fan favorite. Make a reservation for large parties! Cheers"}
{"text":"I met up with my friend from college in Phoenix and she took me to Chelsea's Kitchen.  We got right in even though the restaurant was relatively crowded.  We ordered salads to start and they were really big portions.  The salads were nice though, not heavily dressed and had a nice balance of lettuce and other things in the salad.  I had the halibut special with vegetables.  It was really nice.  I thought the halibut was flaky and nicely cooked.  The flavors were also well done, nothing too intense, soft subtle flavors but helped bring out the veggies and the white flaky fish.  It was really yummy.  My friend had the Tuna Tacos and wow were they awesome!  The guacamole and the rare tuna were awesome - I had a few bites.  Great place!  Great friends, couldn't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from Utah and visited this restaurant based off a recommendation from a friend. We were very pleased! Valet service. Great staff. Seated quickly. Attended to quickly. Drinks brought within minutes after ordering. Appetizer brought within 5 minutes of ordering. As soon as we finished our appetizer the main meal was ready. From arrival time to finish time we were here for a total of 30 minutes and were very satisfied! Great atmosphere and amazing food. A MUST try!"}
{"text":"Burger with 1000 island on English muffin is fab.  Get the deviled eggs.   Great app plate and something you don't see everyday.  Cozy warm restaurant with friendly staff, great layout, cool indoor/outdoor patio bar.  The cake with liquor for dessert was the best sweet I've had in a long time.  A must try.  I am a fan, went 2 times on a recent visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the portions are like child servings. The prices are ridiculously high. The service was mediocre. The cocktails were an insult. One ounce drinks for $12 and up. You'll go once and never go back."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had. Brussel sprout salad is awesome."}
{"text":"Purchased two bowls of delicious red pasole yesterday, two cookies. Takeout.

Later discovered both soup bowl half empty.
Total $27
What a rip off..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - Awesome!  
Staff - Awesome!
Food - Awesome! 

A fantastic night out.  Our server was great and pointed us in all the right directions.  We started off with drinks Goodnight Emilie was fantastic!  The perfect amount of mint to balance the grapefruit flavor.  My boyfriend had the Mageuy Mule.  If that is your kind of drink then you will love it.  He thought it was great but it's not my favorite. 

Starter: We tried the plain chips and guac.  The guac was good but nothing to write home about.  The salsa however!  We practically were licking the bowl. 

Main Meal: I had the Paella and he had the Surf and Turf Tacos.  Both were awesome.  Mine actually had so much leftover we ate it the following day for dinner!  The blend of flavors in the Paella is well worth the trip.  The chorizo they mixed in topped it off.  The surf and turf (again more my boyfriend's thing) was beautifully presented.  He is very picky when it comes to his steak.  The steak for the tacos was according to him \"Perfect\" and he even said to get it to taste that way takes time and care.  

We did go for a date night on this one and the atmosphere was romantic but not too stuffy.  The staff was friendly but what was even more fun was most of the other people there were friendly, fun and out for a good time too.  Families, couples, all ages."}
{"text":"We were in town for a long girls weekend and - wow - this place is a must. After having a fantastic brunch (we made reservations) we even went back again to try to place a to go order of their corn bread (note: only available in person and after 5). My mom and sister are gluten free and the corn bread was absolute heaven - even for someone without an allergy. We also had the sangria (yum!) which was a great price for a pitcher to share - the Brussel sprout salad and the kale and quinoa salad. The special of the day was also delicious. You have to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Service excellent
Ambience excellent
Complimentary valet
Chilaquiles are my favorite brunch item and let me tell you, they were the best I've ever had!! Warning: they've got a spice kick! 
I'm not a deviled eggs fan but they were delicious!
White sangria had fruit, yay!!! 
Absolute must try spot!"}
{"text":"We came here for our 10th Anniversary. We sat outside by the fireplace with twinkle lights overhead. The ambiance was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The food was tasty, the service was prompt and the night was perfect!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The concierge at our hotel recommended it & it did NOT disappoint! Drinks were great, service was great (our server Kara was adorable & awesome!), burger was delicious & be sure to get the ice cream sundae for dessert!"}
{"text":"Short rib tacos (what, what?!) with 
kale and beautiful corn tortillas...legendary!

Couple that with the fact it is airport food...yep, you heard me. Get your butt on a plane to Phoenix, eat here and go home! You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Excellent!  If I lived in Phoenix, I would consider driving here for dinner.   The sauce bin the carnitas had great flavor and texture."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the better airport restaurants in any airport. The only bad thing is that it is outside of security and is not the fastest place. But the food is really good and they have a decent wine list."}
{"text":"The in-laws are in town so that means a visit to Chelsea's.  Our party of 7 rolled in at about 8ish and there was a bit of a wait but not as bad as it has been before.  The parking lot wasn't too full either which meant no forced valet.

This time I tried the Chelsea's Cheeseburger and it was very good.  Still no LGO burger though and the fries are still weird and eh'.  I also ordered the chopped wedge and it was still excellent and still the best around.

I still haven't ordered their tacos yet but I did try my wife's.  She ordered the ribeye steak ones.  They were excellent and I think I want them next time.

As always the service was pretty fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the best greyhound of my life here. It's great to have the option of eating in style and having a quality meal in the airport if you so choose. I just don't know when I will ever be early enough before a flight to enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is a real treat for anyone who wants to get some faith back in great restaurant food that is not overpriced, especially considering the quality of food they serve: organic meats, never-frozen fish, and generous portions."}
{"text":"Incredible! 

Perfect flavors, delicious variety, five star service, and perfectly comfortable & inviting interior & patio! 

I especially loved the fireplace for a perfect AZ winters day! 

The kale salad was perfection!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant..love the food, atmosphere, service and especially their cocktails!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Chelseas Kitchen!! We got the Guacamole (awesome!), Brussels Sprout Salad (still craving it!) and the Short Rib Tacos!  Everything was incredible. We also sampled bites off our friends' plates and it was all amazing.  Can't wait to come back again, next time to try the Brunch menu!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. We love the vibe, the atmosphere, the service and the food. Parking is very limited so it is likely you'll have to use their complimentary valet service."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Everything about this place is outstanding, it touches all 5 senses. Sight--beautiful little building with manicured landscaping, tucked into a desert oasis so soothing to your eyes. The inside is well appointed with wooden tables nicely spaced without crowding. Touch--the weight of the tables,  the comfortable chairs and booths,  made for relaxing.  Hearing-- nice background music softly plays,  allowing the patrons pleasant speaking volume without having to raise voices to talk over the sounds. Smell--the aromas of the kitchen just ignite the palate which brings us to Taste--fresh ingredients,  combines into amazing selections, that reward the palate with every bite. I am smitten...

I have to address some of the negative comments,  as I just can not see a basis for them.  Portions were ample, infact,  we could not finish any of your plates. Prices were spot on for quality,  presentation,  portion.  And the staff-- could not be any friendlier,  attentive to our needs and so very, very pleasant.  We were never rushed, the timing of courses was perfect, refills exactly when needed.

It was an outstanding experience!!!"}
{"text":"While waiting for family to arrive, hubby and I stopped here for lunch.  OMG, am I ever glad we did!!! It's hard to find a good burger that has flavor, juicy goodness just oozing to be partaken,  BUT Chelsea's knocked it out of the ballpark.  Had the green chili burger with Tillamook Cheddar. First Bite I was smitten, second bite put me over the moon. 
First of all, they kinda had me at Tillamook Cheddar -- my all time fave cheese. Hubby and I did a cheese tasting while vacationing in Bandon,  Oregon, one year where we discovered this gem. Have sought it out ever since and Valley stores are starting to carry it. This simple fact told me Chelsea's cares about quality. 
We also had the deviled eggs. Now, I am pretty fussy about deviled eggs. They have to be fresh,  nicely combined with mayo, but not overly so,  seasoned to bring out the flavor but subtle. So when these little treasures showed up on that perfect wood board, I/we were overjoyed,  these were perfect!!
Next up is going to the Camelback location. .."}
{"text":"very good and reliable food. there is often a wait and the service is so-so. very pretty patio. it's a kid and family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the waitress was incredibly rude. The food was average, but for the price, it should have been much better. The $15 burgers my family ordered were undercooked. It took over a half hour to get our food and half the food wasn't even warm when we got it. And $20 for tacos? Give me a break. Don't bother going here.

**Just to follow up, someone who works for the company that owns Chelsea's Kitchen responded almost immediately to this review and addressed my concerns so she could address it with the restaurant managers. Thumbs up on back-end customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda amazed that I was served a decent meal at an airport. The rampant stench of mediocrity is at every international airport, and I mean EVERY international airport (list: http://bit.ly/2c4CL6X), but for some reason, Phoenix Sky Harbor has some good eateries should your Uber get you there earlier than you expected or maybe you wanted. With an hour to kill, I decided to enter this expansive restaurant in Terminal 4. I was lured in by the $14 Shredded Kale & Quinoa Salad, which turned out to be a deliciously healthy choice with sunflower seeds, grapes, chopped tomato, and shaved Parmesan, all of it drizzled with lemon juice (photo: http://bit.ly/2npmbl0). It was just the right amount to digest before the obligatory bag of Southwest peanuts on the plane. Good food at the airport before security. Who da thunk?

FOOD - 4 stars...surprisingly flavorful salad well executed 
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...let's not get carried away, it's the airport after all
SERVICE - 4 stars...like a classy restaurant in a real gourmet ghetto
TOTAL - 4 stars...there's hope for airport dining and it's in Phoenix of all places"}
{"text":"Love it!  Love that they have a seasonal menu based on local suppliers/farmers AND it is one of the best patios around.  Down side - they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"The place smelled great even before entering, but the food didn't really meet up to the promise.  Solid three stars, no oomph factor in any of the brunch items I tried, and small portions.  Decor is some of the best I've seen in Phoenix,  nice and spaced out, beautiful bar and kitchen.

the price is right considering most of their products are local.  

Wait staff was not impressive.   Waitress was missing most of the time and we had to ask other staff running around for things."}
{"text":"First off we knew we were in for a wait seeing it was  a Friday night but 2 hours is a little excess. The one waitress was throwing up in the bathroom Without washing her hands. To top it off our service at the table
Was horrible.  Took 25 minutes to get an ice tea Refill. Also overheard the waitstaff talking poorly about our table
From the kitchen. Food
Wasn't even that great

{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place when I'm traveling.....I usually get a single seat right up at the bar. My mimosas are always tasty and service is prompt. Five minutes after I ordered my food...it showed up....very fast service! One thing I love is they have the best breakfast potatoes around....delicious! Highly recommend stopping by this place.....arena I won't miss my flight ir get stressed about getting through the gate....I have TSA PreCheck. ;-)"}
{"text":"Good place... the patio is huge and awesome... i went there on a winter night and the amount of heaters that they had made it so warm that i did not need a jacket... the food was very good... i only had soup and dessert, but the other people i was with loved the chicken and the special salad... i did not try the key lime pie but loved the turtle sunday... i look forward to going back and trying more things on the menu... and for the area the prices were not too bad...."}
{"text":"Chelsea.. tonight your gonna rate a 2.. heres why.. I rave and rave about your sangrias and apps to my BFF, so we head there on his bday weekend.. no wait for the uber cool patio.. order a pitcher of sangria.. and nachitos.. Well, first off.. the sangria pitcher was half fruit.. Ive never had that in the past.. and I swear there wasnt hardly any wine in the thing.. because Im a super lightweight and didnt feel a thing.. Not that thats the reason I go to get sangrias, but cmon! And the taste was just off.. The nachos didnt have alot of 'stuff' on them.. havent had that in the past either.. and the waitress messed up the order.. the girl who delivered the nachos quickly remedied it.. but nonetheless.. maybe next time.."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Chelsea's Kitchen is in the place I practically live! I am happy to see good eats come to the airport. I have been happy with every thing here ... In fact, they have the best French dip sandwich in the valley, in my opinion. It's cut thin and yet still a little rare .. Perfect. It reminds me of the perfect French dips in Nor Cali that I grew up with. I generally always get that with the kale salad as a side. I've had the tacos too.. Yum. The service can go either way; I try to keep in mind it's an airport so knowing how irritated passengers can be at airports with all they are put thru to fly, I try and keep that in mind for the staff that has to deal with ... Well, often rude, stressed passengers. I have not been to the bar area, as I am generally here in uniform and wings and that is a no no. But my boyfriend has met me here and loves the sangria. If it's like the sangria at the main Chelsea's Kitchen then I would guess it's pretty great. Cool ambience and a lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"We started with some wine at the bar and then guacamole apps at the table.  Nice.  We sat in front in the quietest patio spot.  There was a window next to our table where we could watch the incredibly hot cooks prepare plates.  They are as yummy as the food they make.
I ordered something I'd never had before; Arctic Char.  I This, I learned, tastes like a hybrid of salmon and trout.  It's a more mild salmon flavor with the texture of trout.  It's grilled and served over some really fabulous mashed potatoes.  I ate it all.  I tried to eat just half but could not help myself.  
For dessert I sampled the Chocolate Distruction and the Red Velvet cake. Lovely.  
The bathroom was a walk away.  A walk down a very shiny and very slippery floor. No, I didn't fall, but the potential of a fall on some too high heels is great.  The bathroom is nice and clean, nothing fabulous.  The highlight here is the food, for sure."}
{"text":"This was a pretty nice place to stop for lunch. Nice environment, friendly and attentive service, and pretty good food.

It's a small menu, but there are a few things that look to be worth trying. This time I went with a French dip with fries. The sandwich was good - quality meat and bread with a nice flavored dip. The plate was piled high with fries - easily twice as much as there should have been. But they were very tasty - nicely seasoned, with a little sugar and maybe a hint of cinnamon.

For a nice place with all organic food, the prices were definitely reasonable."}
{"text":"Went in for the restaurant week menu.  Such a beautiful and comfortable location.  Food was phenomenal from top to bottom and service was outstanding.  Pozole soup was incredible and I always get this style soup everywhere I go so I have a tongue to compare.  The mint chocolate gelato was also amazing, not a sugary mint but an actual mint leaf taste.  Very impressed"}
{"text":"Normally I would give this place 5 stars but they stopped making the lobster sliders????  Why I ask?  My hubby loved them... this is why we went there... we even introduced other friends and family to the lobster sliders... and now you take them off the menu???  The short rib taco's, yes they are good... I like them for brunch in the short rib hash as well... but why would you take something off the menu that nobody else has around this area?  You are the only place?  Please bring them back!  We haven't been there since the last time when we found out they were taken off the menu.  I miss you Chelsea's Kitchen! FYI Arnold Palmers here are delish!  Deviled eggs are scrumptious too!  Get the big order... you'll eat them all!  Oh and one other thing that I have had is the Chicken.... Roasted or rotissere... its very tastey too.  Beautiful patio if you like to sit outside... very loud inside.  Free salted chocolate chip cookie on your way out... right by the door.  Its strange... I don't think I like them but a lot of other people do."}
{"text":"We love Chelsea's Kitchen on Camelback but we were sure disappointed in this great airport location.. we stopped here October 5, 2017 prior to a flight, we arrived 2 hours before our flight, so we had plenty of time. We ordered an appetizer, two ribeye tacos and a kids meal.. With the ribeye tacos being $26 each, I expected to be able to consume them.. There was an exorbitant amount of gristle and fat in the meat making it difficult to cut let alone eat.. I would have brought it to the attention of our server but he never checked back in on us and I ended up following him to another table to get our check!   I immediately sent an email to Chelsea's Kitchen directly to their website  and supplied photos and the receipt for $90.00 but to date no one has reached out to contact us. 
This is not the quality of food nor service that has given Chelsea's Kitchen the good reputation they have enjoyed"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been back to Chelsea's Kitchen since it first opened.  I met a friend here today for lunch and had a great experience.  The restaurant has a laid back, comfortable vibe to it...definitely a place you feel relaxed and can enjoy your meal.  The service was fantastic and the food was amazing.  I enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich with the fresh vegetables on the side...the swiss chard and cauliflower with a lemon zest were absolutely perfect.  My friend enjoyed the tuna tartare and a small side kale salad - she was very pleased with her meal as well.  This is definitely a restaurant to add to the regular rotation!"}
{"text":"We visited for lunch on a weekend and the place was moderately busy. I tried the huevos rancheros, which were done up in a deconstructed \"gourmet\" style that did not remotely resemble the true dish. Unfortunately, it did not have much flavor. However, I also tried the chilaquiles. Again, it did not resemble the traditional dish and it was more like a block of layered Mexican lasagna. Yet, the flavors were excellent and I kept wanting more. Based on this experience, I would be careful not to expect what you order to resemble what you think it should. Also, I'd ask around about what the good dishes are, since it appears they are hit or miss. Lastly, there was some noticeable dust buildup in the dining area and some flies buzzing around. The prices were also a bit high. I would not make a special trip to go here, but I wouldn't be against trying it again."}
{"text":"Um... fantastic. Seriously, amazing burger. I also tried my sister's food - very good, but the burger! I also love the atmosphere. It's nice, but still laid back and friendly. This is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch. The patio is a nice place to sit for a business lunch or even a casual chat with a friend. The ahi tuna tacos were excellent. The tacos come with all of the ingredients separate so you can put as much or as little of everything as you would like on the tacos. The only thing i didnt like was the soda in a can because I just don't like being served cans of soda at a restaurant. Especially when they charge 2.00 for the can."}
{"text":"First visit could have been a wonderful fluke so I didn't write a review.  Second visit tonight - they didn't miss a mark.  Nice valets (thanks for not making me park my long bed in that cramped lot!).  Pleasant efficient host, great bartender, reservation on the patio was honored on time.  Server knew his stuff, funny without being over the top.  Interesting menu choices that have a few surprises without getting silly or pretentious.  No pressure to flip the table, good dessert recommendation and no \"attitude\" when we wanted to share.  The patio makes the top of my list of Phoenix patios for ambiance and decoration.  Love it.  Going back.  Recommending to my friends.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Chelseas Kitchen? Very very friendly wait staff. Love the open kitchen concept and wide open space. I have been here several times for meetings and my experience has always been consistent and enjoyable. 

I have recently had the green chile cornbread, the green chile burger, and deviled eggs. All were fantastic and cooked wonderfully. The food is awesome. The vibe is awesome. Sitting out on the patio, very enjoyable and relaxing environment. 

The staff is so kind, attentive, on their game and take care of their guests very well. My last visit the manager came and asked how everything was and I like that service. It's important for the customer experience and vital to keeping a business thriving. I appreciate that greatly and can't tell you how long that goes with me. 

Two personal pet peeves but doesn't bother my review. Texas Pete hot sauce because I lived in Winston Salem, I dislike the hot sauce very much. Also, parking with the valet is annoying but so be it, it's complementary when you go there so I'm sure the restaurant pays for that service. 

No negative things I love coming here and I've had great experiences every time."}
{"text":"I ate at Chelsea's Kitchen once before some years ago. I had lunch there recently as well. Parking is a mess but complimentary valet parking erases the task of finding a pace to park. I was shown a small table in the indoor section of the bar and greeted by friendly wait staff. I ordered the green chili burger with kale slaw which was unique and excellent. The burger was more than I could eat and as juicy as any burger could be. The service is excellent and the prices are moderate but fair. I think an outdoor patio seat at the louvered window bar on a nice day must be one of the best places in all of Phoenix to have lunch. The ambience is elegant but not stuffy, prideful of the establishment but not stuffy. I think this is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix and a can't miss for the long run."}
{"text":"Stellar.  Food was great and service was better than expected. Thanks Roxanne for giving me a great first time experience.  I shall return."}
{"text":"Deviled eggs were awesome!  Great flavor but could have used a tad more bacon chunks."}
{"text":"What a find in the Phoenix airport! I was introduced to LGO earlier in the week and had a craving for a couple of the things I'd missed. I was served promptly by a waitress with a great attitude (unexpected for an airport restaurant). I had the Brussels sprout salad that was unbelievably good! The rich toasty flavor of the Brussels sprouts was enhanced by large shavings of Parmesan cheese, and a perfect crunch of blanched almonds. Whatever vinaigrette they use is light enough to let the other tastes star. So good! Next time, I'm going for the ceviche and hope it can compare.
*Forgot to note that they have a small refrigerated area where you can pick up a few things (like salads) to eat on the go, or after security. Totally worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place.. It has a really awesome vibe inside and a beautiful patio area outside.  It does get really busy on weekend so be prepared to wait a bit for a table but I think the food is worth it.

We had really great service which seems to be a rarity in the valley anymore.  I had the short rib tacos which were excellent.  The flavor was amazing and the homemade tortillas were delicious.  We also had the shrimp cheviche which looked great. (I am not a shrimp lover so I did not have any.)"}
{"text":"I have no idea what people are talking about with their reviews. I thought the food was a C- at best. The soup tasted like it was from a can and the Cesar salad tasted stale. The tuna burger was bland. You are better off trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Modern and swanky yet accommodates kids very well. Cute kids menu written on a chalk board and kids bendy rope game to play with at the table. If you're kidless, the patio is a great place for date night. For Apps, guacamole and deviled eggs are great. For entrees the short rib tacos are my favorite by far and my friends always rave about the ahi tuna tacos. My husband also get the lobster tacos every time! The service is also pretty good. They're attentive and quick once you get sat. They don't take small party reservation so expect to wait. I've always had to wait no matter what day I go. It's also a bit pricey so prepare for a $100+ check if you tend to order all the bells and whistles and/or have 4+ people."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great service. Cute atmosphere. We brought out of town guests and they fell in love with the prickly pear margaritas."}
{"text":"A good place to eat if you have time to kill before a flight or are waiting for someone to fly in. You don't have to have a boarding pass as it is before the check in area. Pricey for what you get but our flight was delayed 2 hours so it was worth the money if you don't have airline lounge memberships. Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 7 girls on a Saturday. We waited only 15 minutes to get seated. Since it was my first time here  I wanted to try a couple things, so I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict while my sister ordered the Rotisserie Prime Rib (medium rare) and perfecto we had surf n' turf for brunch! The crab cake Benedict was perfect.  You get 2 crab cakes with huge lumps of real crab meat perfectly fried to a slight crisp. Their prime rib was also VERY good. It was a thick cut with just the right amount of fat to keep it nice and juicy. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come to for a Saturday or Sunday brunch but be prepared to wait. I came around noon on a Sunday with not many people waiting in front of me, the hostess said 15 minutes and we did not end up getting seated for 45 minutes. That was definitely not cool. Service is okay.

The first time I was here, I ordered the hot cakes which were not my favorite. Second time around I went with the short rib hash and it is to DIE FOR. If you can't decide what to choose on the menu, go with this one - it is bursting with flavors! Make sure to also try the coffee, the server will freshly press it right in front of you. 

This menu is a little more pricey than the average so be prepared to spend more than expected. But there are many options so everyone can pick to their liking."}
{"text":"So we didn't check the time and showed up 30 min before close. They still sat us thankfully! 
I ordered the rotisserie rib eye and husband ordered the filet - both came with mash potatoes and veggies. Husband loved his dish! And well, I Loved my sides! The rib eye was very tender and juicy, but a tad bit bland. The filet def had more flavor/seasoning than my rib eye. Maybe it was because we showed up so close to close of business? Idk - I didn't finish my plate - it was a huge serving! :) I just took it home and will most likely doctor it up and eat it up! I'm really looking forward to the veggie though. If I remember correctly the waitress said it was asparagus, bok Choy, and a whole leek. It was just delish. :) our waitress was great! Very personable and made the night that much more pleasant."}
{"text":"Loooove this trendy brunch spot. I'm a huge fan of LGO, so I had pretty high expectations for this place - and they were met! 

While I waited for my table I enjoyed a prickly pear margarita and a bite (or two!) of their salty chocolate chip cookies (a favorite of mine at LGO). The flavors were fantastic! I went with my family and they also ordered mimosas and iced tea. 

We sat outside once we got our table. It was SUPER busy, but the service was still great and our waters never got below half empty. I ordered the short ribs - and all I have to say is WOW! I enjoyed every bite. It was cooked just right and I loved the guacamole it was served with. 

Only disappointment was a lack of gluten free options for my family - my aunt and my boyfriend are both celiac, and they don't have the most GF-friendly kitchen (according to our waitress). However, they make all their tacos with corn tortillas, so that's definitely a doable option!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food.
Reasonable prices.
Great environment.
Indoor as well as outdoor dining area.
Friendly staff.
Free cookies as exiting the establishment :)
Recommend ordering the ceviche for starters , you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! To start off, the exterior and interior are beautiful. There's a great patio as well. Very fun music with an incredible sound system.  The staff was very friendly and was able to help us decide on some dishes. We had amazing deviled eggs and shrimp ceviche to start. For the entrees we all had tacos (short rib, swordfish, and ahi tuna) which everyone loved. The drinks were great and there was an astounding after dinner coffee and dessert. Overall an awesome experience and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is a great restaurant to visit! The service was truly great. Our waitress was absolutely professional, helpful, and delightful! The outdoor seating area is very nice and peaceful...very green and well decorated! The food is very tasty for the most part...except when it comes to vegetarian options. The been patty burger was disappointing; I had never before tasted such a bland and sad bean patty. That was the only down side, though. Everything else we ordered, particularly the deviled eggs, was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wanted to start out Vacation with a few drinks at 9am (who wouldnt!) and went to Chelsea's Kitchen. We saw they had hand squeezed orange juice which is a big thing for me so I was sold on trying their sangria. So we get to the bar where two people were working and made some great small talk, the gentleman's name was Winfield and the ladie with a huge smile on her face ready to pour our drinks was Kimberly. BTW, the chairs were super comfy as I'm a big boy and sometimes the seats just scream, \"I hate fat people!\" but not here thankfully! Our group of 4 had a round of the sangria, and then half of us ordered the fancy drink of Goose pear, some other liquor and muddled cucumbers which made for the more light and refreshing drink I've ever had! The perfect mix of alcohol and I believe soda water to make our flight to New Orleans that much easier :-) Had some great convorsation with Kim getting laughs and sharing stories about vacations. Such a friendly staff that makes the hell of traveling a little more fun. I did not try any of the food so I cannot comment on that. Will be going there for drinks anytime we are going to the airport!"}
{"text":"I don't travel very often so I am a little late in noticing that many airports have foodie-friendly sit-down restaurants. Chelsea's Kitchen, which features fresh, local fare, is one of them. The service was great - my waiter was charming ad funny - and the food far exceeded my expectations of airport food. I also had a fresh and creative cocktail. I only wish I had time before my flight to try a dessert. 

Chelsea's kitchen is a very good reason to get to the airport extra early."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and food. Pleasant little oasis in this Arizona sun! Try their Shrimp Ceviche and Rib Hash."}
{"text":"Took out of town guests there for dinner and drinks. Service was adequate but certainly not fantastic. I thought the restaurant was loud and there were quite a few tables that were open.

On to the food: 
1. Appetizers: Deviled Eggs with bacon were excellent so were the nachos. My suggestion would be to layer the cheese because once you get below the toppings you are simply eating chip.
2. We all shared the Brussels sprout salad and it is unique and very tasty.
3. Main course: I had the prime rib, below average at best. Very dry and lacking flavor. My girlfriend had the chicken, again very dry and no flavor. The others in our group had the short rib tacos, very good, the ahi tuna with guacamole, again very good. I was disappointed with the prime rib and even mentioned it to the waitress...no manager came to the table and I certainly didn't feel it is her responsibility to apologize for the chef but I think a table call would have been nice.

We will go back but I will only order what I know they make well. Nice ambiance if you are looking for a less than intimate environment."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chelsea's kitchen every time I go there. 

The waitstaff is always nice and helpful, and the food is always good, despite the fact that every time I go there I order the same thing (so that doesn't allow for much variation in my review). 

Anyhow, what I usually get, the Ahi Tuna Tacos are ALWAYS great. The tuna is perfectly cooked, and melts in your mouth every time you get it. With the taco plate comes some of their shredded kale salad, which compared to other kale salads ive had, is the best, and somespicy aioli, tortillas and hot sauce. The aioli is the part that completes the whole meal! 

Also, their chicken nachitos are the best nachos I've had at any place in Arizona that doesn't serve predominantly Mexican food. Very cheesy and crunchy, with a good assortment of other toppings. Sometimes, the chicken is scarce. 

They also offer free sea salt chocolate chip cookies at the end of your meal which really do put a cherry on top of the whole experience! The perfect ratio between sea salt and cookie! 

the two cons to Chelsea's 
Parking: They only offer valet. Even though it's free, it's somewhat of a bother. 
Drinks: If you order a soft drink, like Diet Coke, or whatever, they only give you one can, which you pour yourself, and if you finish before your meal is over, they don't give you a second one without you having to ask (and an extra price added to your bill). 
Despite these two things, Chelsea's still deserves five stars."}
{"text":"Brought in a large group last night, our Server April did an amazing job and made sure we had everything we needed.  Food was perfect, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best waitress, but I've forgotten her name. I had the ahi tuna tacos, and they were AMAZING. Ambiance of the whole restaurant is fun, busy, and upbeat. My boyfriend could not get over how good the traditional tortillas were.We had dessert as well. I believe something with pecans and ice cream. My family is in town, and we will be attending again tonight! I was told no reservations, so that's the only reason I gave 4 stars. It can get extremely busy."}
{"text":"We wound up going here for dinner on a random Sat night by chance when we walked out of Vincent's down the road.  We were very happy we did.  The service was pretty good even though the place was packed...we opted to sit on the patio to avoid the wait for a table.  The food was excellent and our only complaint is they brought our appetizer out with our main dishes...otherwise it would have been a 5 star experience.

Try the beef short rib tacos...they were delicious..."}
{"text":"A little more noisy than I would prefer.  The gazpacho/watermelon soup was wonderful, the brussel sprout salad was sub par.  Good service.  They seem to be flourishing."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen went above and beyond my expectations. My daughter had been telling about how awesome this place was, well she didn't over exaggerate. From the moment you walk up to the front door you are greeted with the most out of this world smell of smoked  meats, foods, it pulls, you in . Once inside you think you are at a quaint cabin in Colorado . We sat outside on this adorable patio... Service was fast, efficient wait staff with great personalities. Our bar order was made to perfection... Appetizer: Smoked Trout spread, was an explosion to the taste buds... Awesome! Then came the Brussel Sprout salad we chose to add chicken... OMGosh, there are no words to describe how delicious it was, the chicken was smoked to perfection, then came dessert, real homemade pumpkin pie with Kalua whipped cream, no words to describe, add French press coffee to top it all off and you have the ending of a totally unforgettable lunch.... Can only imagine what dinner must be like!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer while biking on the AZ Canal. They have a wonderful patio and the rest of the restaurant looks nice too. We arrived during happy hour. Good drink specials, but no food deals. They only have 3 beers on tap, and we both had a Bells Two Hearted Ale. $5 during happy hour, but $8 normally. The whole menu seemed a bit overpriced, but that's without tasting any of it. Cornbread appetizer $10. A couple deviled eggs $5. The least expensive hamburger is $14. Minus a star for week beer selection, and could get a additional star if the food is  spectacular enough to warrant the prices."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is an upscale neighborhood place and The food is good and it's one of my regular places.  They offer standard southwest American style fare like burgers, tacos, and they do a pretty good brunch.  My go-tos are:

- chicken nachos for the table to share 
- burgers w/ the grilled poblano
- fish or steak tacos
- chilaquiles
- Brussel sprout salad
- keylime pie
- sangria, mimosas & bloody Mary's

Other pluses- they have patio seating when the weather is mild.  

Negatives include: limited parking but they have valet. Also It's loud so it's better for groups."}
{"text":"Sit outside in the evening.  Great lights, cool misters. Don is an excellent server - hospitable, informed, and engaging. Visited from Atlanta - great time. Paella did not disappoint. House Cab works too."}
{"text":"Short rib tacos!!!

Absolutely amazing experience.

Polite and courteous waitstaff.  

Best short rib tacos I've ever experienced.  My wife had the surf and turf platter - also fantastic.

Amazing guacamole.

The other couple we were with were also suitably impressed.  I was so fixated on my dinner that I don't even remember what they had.  

Incredible abbey ale tap.

Red velvet cake w/ gelato -- wow!!!

Sea salt chocolate chip cookies on the way out ... perfect end to the evening."}
{"text":"Came here for the bottomless mimosas, left with a happy stomach.
The ceviche was excellent and filling."}
{"text":"went here for lunch today, love the atmosphere, I ordered Kale chicken salad with dark meat when it came, I saw two small pieces of dark meat chicken and one was a leg. I looked down on my plate and the amount of chicken wouldn't have been enough for a small child. If you are going to charge me $20 a plate for rabbit food I think I should have enough chicken."}
{"text":"At first I sat in bar area and waited for 5 minutes with no service before I moved to main dining room. Service was awesome. Great menu options and delicious food. I had the prime rib taco platter! Good wine choices. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Some things are just better when done outside, this includes dining on the great patio at Chelsea's Kitchen

During my visit I did not see Chelsea, if she is even real,  however I did see the kitchen and most importantly, I sat on the vine covered patio complete with a fireplace.

Our meal started  out with the seasonal specialty, a yellow tomato with 12 year old balsamic, goat cheese and sea salt ($10) This dish was decent, the tomato was firm however I would have liked to have had a bit more goat cheese. I always thought yellow tomatoes were not ripe yet, however this proved otherwise.

The ahi taco platter was too alluring to resist, keeping it somewhat healthy I opted for the veggies in lieu of the rice and beans. The high grade fish was seared perfectly, the guacamole was good as was the pico. The Veracruz veggies were just so so, as were the small handmade rough corn tortillas I was excited for.

Come in, enjoy the patio and the food."}
{"text":"Every time I come, I'm never disappointed. This time, I got an amazing Bloody Mary (they create a special mix) and a brussel sprout salad with nuts, cranberries and a champaign vinaigrette. The waiter asked me if I wanted to add salmon, steak or chicken to it, I told him to surprise me. He did with salmon. Unbelievable. The waiter and both managers on duty made an effort to stop and ask me how much lunch was. Service is great, food matches service!  Always allow extra time at the airport to stop here. Great, great place!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I visited with my friends for my second time at Chelsea's kitchen. It was our first double date and we all agreed on how good our previous experiences at Chelsea's kitchen had been. 
We were seated in less than 20 minutes as first available to a table outside, but when we realized how chilly it was, decided to ask for an inside table and wait at the bar longer. We had a couple drinks at the bar, the old fashioned was good but some drink with China China in a martini glass was not so good. We were finally seated at a booth inside and although the lighting was very poor in our area, we were glad to be seated. Waters were brought to us but then it took more than 10 minutes to get a waitress to come greet us and be a part of our table. It felt as if our waitress was not so happy to be working or was more in tuned in technology than looking at us and acknowledging us. Even when she talked her head was down at the tablet and it just didn't feel as friendly as a waitress would be or atleast portray to be. The food was really good, steak on the surf and turf tacos was more medium rare than medium well like asked but nevertheless had good flavor. I love the short rib tacos at Chelsea's kitchen and one of the reasons me and my boyfriend continue to eat there periodically. But I felt as if it wasn't one of our best service experiences and waitress could've been more involved considering a 86$ tab for two people dinner. 

Recommend short rib tacos anytime, they haven't disappointed ever!"}
{"text":"Really good good service strong drinks what else do you want!!!!! Good place for date night"}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  We live all the way across town yet making the 35 mile drive (one way) is totally worth it.  

The service is outstanding and everyone is really friendly.  Our favorite person though is Bobby.  Bobby used to be our server at another area restaurant and we were pleased as punch when we ran into him one day here.  It's kind of like visiting a friend when you go there!  

My only problem is I can never decide if I should get the short rib tacos or the ribeye steak tacos.  Start off with their sangria that I could go swimming in or the shaken lemondae then finished by the red velvet cake and you can't go wrong.

Love this place and I'll be back.  Often."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best part about this place is the patio. It's cozy with a large brick fireplace, overhanging trees, and strands of white bulb lights! The restaurant actually opens out to the patio. This place is high end and the prices show it. I had the sangria which was tasty. I also had the pork belly tacos. This dish was HUGE. Way too much food for a normal person to eat. The service is very friendly as well. The demographic seems to be the uber wealthy and snobby types, but it's a nice place to go otherwise once in a while. Oh yeah, the free cookies on your way out is a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Chelsea's Kitchen yesterday.  I ordered the Huevo Rancheros and my friend got a hamburger and fries.  The menu selection was reasonable and the food was overall good.  The preparation was first rate.  My only misgivings was the drink service.   I had been biking and needed a refill to my ice tea.  It took a while for it.  The red velvet cake was simple delicious.

The atmosphere was airy and comfortable.  The decor is simply, yet inviting.  The bathroom decor was minimalist and modern.  However, there was a mild sulfur smell (maybe sewage) eminating from the bathroom.  It was not the last thing I cared to remember before leaving.  I hope that this issue has been addressed.

Overall I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent as was the food.  They quickly accommodated our group of 7 with prompt, attentive, friendly service.  The menu had several items that appealed to the group.  I selected the prime rib - and was pleased with the flavor, presentation, and quality!  Great place to take folks to dinner!"}
{"text":"My lovely wife asked me to meet her here today for lunch. It was wed about 2:30 and it was nearly empty. The place is very inviting and comfortable. Lots of leather and deep booths.

We had the cornbread which was AMAZING! The green chilli was so good in the cornbread.

The short rib tacos looked amazing, but were a bit one dimensional. 

The French fries were AMAZING! They were seasoned and thin and crispy. Really outstanding!

The the service was 5/5. The food was 4/5. We will be back for sure. The menu seems to have so many things we want to try."}
{"text":"Super solid place - service was incredible,  and the food was delicious.  Though it is in a neighborhood, so a little off the beaten path (for someone staying downtown in from NY for work) the ambiance was incredible. I am only taking away a star because my meat was a little more well done that I asked for."}
{"text":"This place is addicting. First, the service is really, really good. But, more importantly, I love the food. This trip I passed on my favorite Kale salad and went for the build your own Taco's. This is serious work and I gave my server grief that at LGO's sister restaurant in Santa Monica, (Misfit), they always assemble my food. 

As far as I remember, the taco's are unique to this location. 

Upon finishing the meal, I dutifully dragged my guest to the cookie plate which was EMPTY. OH NOOOO! It can't be! 

Quickly, we alerted the Hostess who came back smiling with fresher cookies than the person got who wiped out all of the cookies. Ha! 

One note: Apparently the space next to LGO (across the street) is going to be a new LGO Concept. Hopefully, I get an invitation to try this as I'll go back for food!

Great ambiance
Great service
Always great food!"}
{"text":"For the first time, I tried Chelsea's Kitchen in Sky Harbor. Having tried every other spot in the LGO family, I was really impressed with Chelsea's in Terminal 4.  read in the paper this restaurant was evacuated due to a fire which occurred about 2 weeks earlier, however no signs of damage. Unfortunately, I rarely fly Southwest but the inter terminal bus comes every 5 minutes. 

This restaurant is very large for an airport and actually makes you feel as though you aren't in an airport. This is wonderful unless you miss your flight. The service was up to the LGO stand, though not Misfit which is by far the best run in their family of restaurants, from a customer perspective. 

We had the kale salad with salmon, crudo and ahi tartare along with some good red wines as it was post-large lunch and not quite dinner. Everything was of the quality I'm extremely used to at LGO, meaning excellent ingredients, prepared perfectly with \"special\" presentation.

Great job and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Great ambience outdoors. French like set up with trees and white Christmas lights surrounding you. Food was yumalish. Ahi tuna tartare, smoked trout dip, guacamole, shrimp ceviche, deviled eggs etc. The dessert is incredible too. They have TVs so you can watch the games too. Parking is super easy. Not sure why they have a valet as the lot is literally 20 yards LOL! And the valet guys are not friendly at all, a bit rude and disrespectful to be honest. So I gladly parked my own car and walked right on past them. A little home training goes a long way. Aside form that I adore this place."}
{"text":"best ceviche and red velvet cake in az!!"}
{"text":"Who knew you could get great food at the airport???? 

Wanted a bite and a beer before our flight n this was the first place we walked up to.  The manager stood with the hostess and convinced up to come in and try it out. 

He told us that this was the second best airport restaurant in the country outside of one in Atlanta.  Not sure where they rank but it was pretty darn good!!!  And not just for airport food but food in general! 

He brought us guac salsa n chips. 
It was really good!!!  
I had the veggie taco with an amazing kale n quinoa salad!!  If I could have sat longer I would have finished my whole plate n them some!   

Whenever you fly in or out of AZ make sure you give yourself extra time to dine here before your flight!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Well kept, clean, and cozy interior. Great patio for outdoor dining. Make sure to sneak a couple chocolate chip cookies dusted with sea salt on the way out (they keep them up by the hostess stand).  Their short rib tacos are scrum-diddly-umptious. Their french dip is massive and super juicy and tender. Great place for a family meal."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Ahi tacos were good and presentation was on point.  Lemonade made with egg whites is sour, yet delicious.  Service was great despite running out of the two different dishes I ordered.  The smokehouse looks/smells great as you enter... looking forward to trying an entree of that variety next."}
{"text":"Oh what a perfect little spot to grab some breakfast/ brunch or a drink! This place not only has great inside seating, it also has a pretty bitchin' outside patio. There are trees all around it, in the middle of it...everywhere. 

Now onto the food! I got the veggie black bean burger which also comes with a side of tortilla, so you can basically eat a burger and a taco if you are creative. My friend ordered the crab cake eggs Florentine and she loved it! Our server was so attentive and once we disclosed our love for spicy food, he brought us the spicy aioli, which complemented our fries! 

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We waited 4 years to get back to Chelsea's Kitchen and found it to be as good as we had remembered. Friday lunch and was led to a comfortable booth where we were greeted and drink order taken. To start we ordered the large deviled eggs with bacon on top. The eggs are large, six in total, all bursting with flavor, creamy, smokey, salty goodness. For my entrée I opted for the Chelsea cheeseburger without bun, spicy mayo and kale slaw. The burger came out with a heaping order of fries, waitress noticed and told us to enjoy the fries and proceeded to bring out a heaping order of kale slaw. The burger was large, juicy and one can tell it was made to order with quality ground beef. The kale slaw was a wonderful marriage of kale and quinoa with sunflower seeds and some Parmesan cheese. The fries were a bonus and were very flavorful but perhaps lacked crunch. Service was fantastic and everyone is treated to chocolate chip cookies with sea salt as they leave the restaurant. Parking is never a problem as they offer complimentary valet parking. Brunch, lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong at Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Lunch with the girls?  Want to impress your Mother-in-Law? Show that snobby co-worker what's up? Chelsea's is it!

Yumyumyum!  The food is unbeatable.  Fresh and hip, with traditional roots.  We had brunch fare: Perfectly cooked eggs, potatoes that melted like butter, sausage heaven. 

Your order will be served up with class by the fabulous wait staff.  Oh and the location!  Natural beauty abounds.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! I love to sit outside on the patio and just enjoy the morning. On the canal, never had any issues with he staff, and their crab eggs Benedict is delicious. It was over cooked a little the last time I was there, but I'm sure they'll make it perfect next time :)"}
{"text":"I love Chelseas kitchen! Their guac is amazing, and you can never go wrong with the Ahi. I was a little disappointed on my last visit today, however. I took a bite of my salad, and felt something sharp in my mouth. I pulled out a very sharp and hard plastic object out of my mouth. Concerned, I showed our waitress. All they did was take off $6 off from my meal."}
{"text":"Omg.  The short rib tacos are so delicious. I usually am not impressed by any airport food but I had to bite my tongue this time. The service was quick and efficient. The food was delicious. Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked. No salt or pepper needed.  They did everything right with this dish. The kale salad is bright with just a hint of lemon is a perfect companion with the short rib perfectly braised. You don't need a knife cause the meat is butter soft and tender.  Get this dish! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately every \"good\" restaurant has their bad days too, and my last visit to Chelsea's was wretched. From start to finish. 

My date put our name in and we were told 20-25 mins. Well ONE HOUR later after we continually asked we were finally seated (should have just walked out). I brought my date there for his first time and this was already not a good start. 

We were seated and I ordered my usual vegetarian taco platter. The waitresses' description of it sounded so good this time around. However, when it arrived there was only ONE vegetable dish on it next to the taco fixings of salsa and guacamole! Half of the plate was empty! On other visits its been overflowing with so much goodness. MAJOR disappointment. 

After that I just wanted to get out of there, so we did not stay to get dessert or linger. Not a good first impression for someone at all : /"}
{"text":"amazing. food is amazing. atmosphere is perfect. staff is friendly. great for all ages. YOU HAVE TO GO THERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went back again and surprisingly they recognized us, how awesome is that!?. We ordered the Howie Burger with fries and let me tell you...any Midwesterner will reminisce of a BBQ flavored Jay's potato chip when they eat the fries which when dipped in ketchup becomes this Cajun spiced goodness that took me by surprise. We also ordered the Rib eye taco platter, the kale salad had a medley of flavors and was very good and the meals once again were surprisingly great."}
{"text":"Perfect for shots before your flight. This place is outside of security but Phoenix's airport has such short lines it shouldn't ever be a problem. Service is a little slow though, so if you're in a hurry, you have to raise your hand and gesture that you need help. Gets busy at the bar."}
{"text":"Not a cheap restaurant but their beautiful patio and short ribs make everything worthy. I haven't tried a lot other than their short rib hash, deconstructed tacos and chilaquile, which were all amazing. If brunch, white sangria will most definitely quench your thirst."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and excellent White Sangria. My wife and I enjoy an amazing lunch."}
{"text":"First off the food was great. I had the smoked turkey sandwich and my sister had the green chili burger.  Food was awesome!!!

The SERVICE WAS LESS THEN AVERAGE AT BEST. It was our first time trying this restaurant and I'll say it myself we could have been more dressed up. The waitress Danielle H never once made eye contact from the moment we sat down to the time we got our check. She made us feel unwelcome and only when she dropped off the bill did she give us a smile."}
{"text":"So not impressed..I hope  that  this is only a result from going on Mother's Day.  We had reservations but got  there early .. thought maybe they could seat us ...nope in fact they seated us late and  appeared to seat other  foursomes sooner ...weird ..when I finally went to \"check \"  they suddenly were seating us.. hmm. 

Our waitress seemed to keep disappearing and we had to wrangle up other servers for refills, sauces, questions ,water  , she never seem to be there... chips and salsa took forever to arrive .   I am really surprised that there wasn't a busboy type just refilling glasses. For  a special day it seems to be a good investment.

For the cost and the reputation I thought we'd have an outstanding meal .  Wrong ..the best thing at the table was my daughters french fries    and the guacamole..  My short rib tacos tasted bland , no spice , with blackened bland tortillas  nothing special... 

Mom's salad wasn't rinsed properly and by  the end of the meal it  had a lake swishing around the bottom of her plate..  Yuk. 

For the hassle of valet only parking , late reservations , and okay food it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  The atmosphere is awesome, the food is amazing.  One of the best cuts of prime rib I've ever had (and I'm picky about steaks!). The staff has always been super nice but could be a little more engaged, I've had moments where I've felt like they were a bit disinterested or irritated.  There was a bartender though that asked fun trivia questions when my friend and I were waiting for a table and he was just awesome.  Definitely a great personality to have behind the bar.  The pricing for what you're getting is also a wonderful value and really good quality food."}
{"text":"Three friends and I went to Chelsea's Kitchen for a Saturday night dinner. The food and atmosphere were both great. So, I recently took three out of town guests for brunch. Again, they hit another home run. 

We ate on the patio, which filled up by 10:30 a.m. on this particular Sunday. There were all sorts of people, mostly Arcadia types with their Lululemon, Ray Bans and their small dogs. The patio had trees but the sun was out in full force. It was great.

The brunch menu was filled with all kinds of food - salads, pancakes, short rib hash. I opted for a bit of decadence with the crab cake benedict. It was wonderful, full of flavor and not over cooked. 

The service was very good. Our glasses were never empty and we didn't feel that we were neglected at any time. Our server took the time to answer all of our questions (two of my guests have some \"food issues\") with a pleasant demeanor and high level of service. 

Make sure to review their menu before you go, to see if it's something you'd like, but I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were told that this is the best place to eat in Phoenix.  That is quite a high expectation.  We were able to sit in the courtyard, which was set up beautifully.  The menu contained variety and the food was certainly delicious.  The margaritas were also amazing and service was excellent. Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Airport prices. Check.
Airport quality-HELL NO.
Great guacamole, in house made chips served warm with a nicely balanced salsa. Easily one of the best ribeye steak taco platter I have ever had and the hot off the homemade press corn tortillas and interesting quinoa/kale salad made for a fabulous texture, flavor mix. 

If I would have had more time, I would have indulged in an adult beverage and possibly had more room for the one bite of dessert I could shovel in before having to run through security. 

Yes, good enough to visit the real deal somewhere in town but great enough to make a little extra airport time to indulge."}
{"text":"After a very long and difficult day I was craving a French Dip so naturally I came to Chelsea's Kitchen for their awesome sandwich. Unfortunately I came at dinner and they only serve it at lunch. Thanks to Chef Dom for going above and beyond and serving me the best French Dip I have ever had. Big thanks to the team at Chelsea's Kitchen for the silver lining of my otherwise cloudy day!"}
{"text":"Ya ya I know... There aren't any options when your in the airport. And the food here is definitely better than the fast food alternatives. But OMG the service is bad.  I've eaten here twice out of necessity and had wine atvthe bar while waiting on people three or so times. It's all bad but the bar is mind boggling. They have three bartenders and they'll stand and talk to each other or customers, clean glasses, walk by you over and over, not make eye contact. It's bizarre."}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory dinner for my friend. There were about 15 in our group and we were seated outside on the well heated patio. We had five heaters around us!
We had two servers who were super efficient. They got drink orders in and out with each guest/s that arrived at all the various times. 

The group started with 2 orders of the chicken nachitos loaded with yummy guacamole that were quickly devoured. For my main entree I ordered the surf and turf tacos which consists of lobster and filet mignon. I like the fact that Chelsea's Kitchen offers gluten free options without extra charge, but I still went with the corn tortillas that come standard with any taco entree option. Holy delicious! I can't even accurately describe the party that went on in my mouth! The dish came with a kale salad, guacamole, and pico de gallo. There were two dipping sauces, aioli and a salsa type, the aioli came out on top and landed on every bite that went into my mouth. I really wanted to lick the little container it came it, but I had to pretend to be a lady. The filet was cooked medium, but looking back I should have gotten it prepared at the medium rare temperature because the outside was pretty cooked. 

For dessert I split the sundae with a friend and I love that you get to put your own toppings on. When you order the sundae you get two sauces: carmel and chocolate and three toppings: rainbow sprinkles (or jimmies for my East Coasters), Oreo crumbles, and chocolate and peanut butter chips! So fun to create your own dessert!
The service and food were spectacular (especially for a large group) and I can't wait to come back for another meal!"}
{"text":"Living next to my favorite restaurant puts a real dent into my wallet, but it's worth it. 

I first tried Chelsea's Kitchen three years ago and I still can't stop myself from going back. They have the best shoe string french fries a girl could ask for with some BBQ rub seasoning that leaves you licking your fingers to the very last fry. 

When I first started going there I had to try their cheeseburger and I couldn't put the juicy burger down. Now, my obsession is the Brussels Sprout Salad....with maybe a starter of french fries...sorry, it's just too hard! The salad has a great, fresh dressing while still tasting the delicious bite of the Brussels sprout.

The wait staff in the first two years were patient and attentive. Lately, it hasn't been at it's best, but hopefully it will get better in the new year.

My family and friends haunt this place regularly and we have tried everything. I also recommend trying Dr. B.'s Vegetarian Tacos...well because they're good first off and second off it's my best friend's dad. And he definitely deserves to have this meal dedicated to him.  

The decor is perfect for us Arcadia kids and parents and disguises the canal well. 

Love you Cheslea's Kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch favorite...Taco's, seafood, Stella.."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The staff is cool and relaxed but still very catering. I really enjoy the food because all of the flavors seem to have been marinated with love. No matter what I order they never disappoint. FYI don't forget the cookies!"}
{"text":"No STARS! MY husband & I were waiting in line to be seated when I saw a waiter putting Natcho chips on a plate, he dropped a few on counter & put them on the plate, ONE CHIP was dropped on the FLOOR & the waiter PICKED IT UP & PUT IT ON THE PLATE! At that point I told my husband were NOT eating here! We walked away they got none of our business! Beware!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day. Had some friends tell me the food was great and had to try the red velvet. Needless to say I left disappointed with both. First they offered a special M-day menu but when I ordered off it they no longer had any left so I was left with ordering tacos. The meat was overcooked and the lobster was chewy. The posole barely had any meat or hominy, so we were left with improperly strained red thick soup with tortilla strips. Then we got excited for dessert. We ordered the imfamous red velvet and some coffee. Five minutes later they come back and say they are out. Seriously, how do you not make sure to keep enough in stock on such a busy day. They still brought the coffee which we no longer wanted as it was supposed to pair with the dessert. Now I will give them this, they did attempt to make it better. They found a slice of red velvet left at the sister market which they gave us free, plus a gift card to come back another day. Although they certainly tried to rectify the issue,  the night as a whole was disappointing. My husband does business in the area so he will probably stop to use the card, but you wont be dragging me there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find a place where everything just works, perfectly. Chelsea's is such a place. Relaxing and inviting atmosphere, delicious food - love the Brussels sprout salad, deviled eggs and red velvet cake - and friendly service. Patio is great for easy weekend mornings and the sea salt chocolate chip cookies on the way out are a perfect finish. Wish they'd open a Chelsea's North in Kierland or Quarter!"}
{"text":"An absolute treat in phoenix.  Everything made with care. I recommend going out of your way to experience this spot.  
 Had the striped sea bass special... Roasted in their Italian hard wood oven...delicious.

Excellent wines by the glass ...and wonderful beers"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the green chile burger, white sangria, and guacamole with ahi tuna!
But my favorite part of all.... those little chocolate chip cookies topped with sea salt.... mmmmOMG so good!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there on 1/17 with my friend. She ordered the brusslesprout salad and I had the green chili burger. Her salad was beautiful and tasty, but over priced for it's size. My burger was cooked well done, too well for my liking, the toasted bun crumbled when I bit into it and all the toppings, cheddar cheese, roasted green chili and aioli made it very messy to eat. I ended up using a knife and fork. The fries were perfect! Very skinny and crispy, I could have ate a basket of those. 
Our server was pleasant. We told her we didn't have a lot of time and luckily they weren't busy at that time, so our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, we had to ask for tea refills. 
The atmosphere was nice and roomy and I was nicely greeted when I walked up to the hostess stand. 
One last negative, I really wanted to order the ahi tacos, but they had just ran out and it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Unusually non-airporty. Great atmosphere. Attentive and time-conscious staff. Just say yes."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the bar multiple times now and every time the service is terrible.  The bar tenders basically ignore you.  Chelsea's kitchen in Arcadia is always awesome with great service.  I keep going back to the airport location hoping I just caught the bar on a bad night, but that's not the case."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast as I was waiting for a flight. I was a little disappointed that lunch wasn't offered---even if it was only 10:30am, as most of the reviews are about the lunch/dinner items. Nonetheless, I ordered the oatmeal with brown sugar, flax, and bananas. Not too bad, but I would recommend ordering the flax on the side, as it can be somewhat overpowering.
Service was \"okay.\" Took quite a while to get greeted after we sat down, other than that the server was fairly decent.
My advice: come for lunch or dinner, as the breakfast definitely doesn't seem to be what the hype is all about here."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite place in Phoenix.  It is a great place for lunch or dinner.  The outdoor patio is awesome, especially at night.  Everything I order is perfect.  My favorite is a Seafood Salad that I have them serve with mixed greens.  It is perfect.  I also like the roasted half-chicken and the fish tacos.  The nacho plate is also insanely delicious. 

This is my favorite place for business meetings, out of town guests, and family meals.  I encourage you to go and go often until you have tried several different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is among my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  The food is always good and I love the atmosphere on the patio.  The brussel sprout salad is a winner.  However, I am in love with the red velvet cake."}
{"text":"WOW! Absolutely love this place. Incredible service, great food, and the short rib tacos are the best - large portions and great flavor. This is my favorite place right now."}
{"text":"Okay so don't go to any place else but here anywhere near Scottsdale or Phoenix. Hands down the best food around, came in for lunch before a baseball game and had to come back to try more items off the menu for dinner. 

For lunch the kale salad is amazing and served on several dishes. Order the tacos, you can't go wrong. 

For dinner the prime rib is by far the best prime rib my wife and I have ever had. Would have gladly paid 50 for the 33 dollar plate. 

AND DONT FORGET TO GRAB A COOKIE ON THE WAY OUT!!! 

McCall was awesome!"}
{"text":"I keep saying this when I go, but eating at the patio of Chelseas Kitchen is like being on vacation. It's such a great space. The food is good, waiters very professional and small but great detail is the cookies as you leave. There's a reason these owners keep growing their portfolio. They know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Had a ridiculous amount of time to kill before our flight. We had recently had lunch so not particularly hungry but the seating was far more appealing than the chairs in the gate area. We went in and were seated in Edwards station. We advised we just wanted some water as we had over indulged the past few days and were interested in dessert. Their dessert menu consisted only of gelato. We both ordered some. Edward suggested maybe we would like to try the key lime pie. One of my favorites and very happy to try! Easily the best key lime pie I've ever had!!! Even though our bill was only slightly over ten dollars, Edward could not have been nicer. If you visit this restaurant, be sure to ask if Edward is working buoy won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Flying out of Phoenix, we made time to eat dinner here before our flight.  From the moment we sat down, the server was upbeat and attentive, which made the meal very enjoyable.  We ordered deviled eggs and couldn't figure out how many eggs for them to put bacon on, when she wisely suggested she would bring it on the side.  The eggs were good - a little too much sweetness (sweet pickles? pimentos?) for our taste, but entirely satisfying.  Also ordered the tuna tartare/guacamole appetizer.  It was good.  I had the ahi tuna tacos and the fish was seared just right and had good flavor - along with the sides of guacamole, salsa and cabbage (I think), there were a couple of sauces to add to the make-your-own-tacos dish - and they were yummy too.  Hubby had the short ribs taco dish and thought it was delicious.  Daugher ordered the special soup, which was a canteloupe/honeydew gazpacho-type concoction.  She wasn't fond of it (even though she loves those melons) and the server was great in recognizing that and with no hesitation offered to substitute the chicken tortilla (I think) soup instead.  That bowl disappeared so fast it would make your head spin, so it was a good choice.

The drink menu was very nice, with a Tito's vodka rounding out an adult lemonade beverage.  And, of course, the nice little salted chocolate chip cookies as you leave are delicious.

I would definitely return. PS-3 stars because the food is A-OK; extra star for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night with out of town guests. I heard it was good and I was not disappointed. From the moment you walk in the door the meat smells so good!!

I got a Sangria and very much enjoyed it.

For food I got the brussel salad and loved every bite. The meats there taste so fresh! Some of the best in Phoenix for sure!

We all loved the food and the environment. Would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen has been one of my favorites spots in the valley for has as I can remember, consistent with their food ( I love the chicken nachos for an appetizer, it's great for sharing!!) fantastic drinks like the \"Diego Rivera\"! The burger is simply among the best I've had!!, I can go on,.. You simply Just can't go wrong.. A gem of a spot, try the patio it has a huge fireplace with a fantastic ambience setting!"}
{"text":"After driving past numerous times because it looked too crowded, we finally stepped foot into Chelsea's Kitchen last night.

It didn't start off too great, I found myself frustrated with the host chatting up some guy who seemed to be already seated with another  party or something like that.  I was hungry and got more annoyed than needed, but it's not that hard to stop your conversation and get us seated!

That said, as soon as she did acknowledge us, we were seated immediately.

Our waitress, can't recall her name, was extremely friendly.
I'm not much of a wine drinker, so I can't comment on that, but I was impressed by the small but delicious beers on tap.

From the typical four peaks, to a Deschutes Mirror Pond and an O'dell's 90 schilling, I was a happy man.

In additon to the menu, they also offered some daily specials, from starters, to mains, to sides.

We had an appetizer on special that day, a \"new style\" sashimi. Slices of tuna and yellowfin, with a ponzu sauce, picked wasabi, slices of hit green chiles.

It was delicious, my only complaint was that I wanted much more.

The menu is comprised of varieties of tacos, burgers, and salads. A few fresh fish mains and other seasonal mains made the menu varied but not too big.  It was still hard to make a choice.  We had decided to get the howie burger, but didn't know what else. Our waitress recommended first timers to Chelsea's to partake of one of the taco meals.  She called it a good introduction to Chelsea's.

In the end, we went with the Howie burger and the short rib tacos.

The tacos, which are presented in a \"make your own\" style were delicious, the braised short ribs extremely flavorful and tender.  salsa fresca, guacamole, rice, beans and salsa complemented the very fresh tortillas.

The Howie burger, made up of a hand ground patty, came with gruyere and freaking delicious carmelized onions that still managed to be tangy as well. I need to figure out how to do that at home.  I got it with a bun, although you can get it sans bun or with lettuce.  I opted for some fries, but could have gotten other sides.

Being a former vegetarian, it's nice to see a few options for our meatless friends/fiends.

The whole floor team is very efficient, water was always full, food was put out quickly.  If you get up from your chair, someone will refold your napkin.  A nice old school touch.

We had some good organic coffee and a pretty amazing key lime pie.
The pie was also great because they DON\"T USE FOOD COLORING!
That is one of my biggest pet peeves, real key lime pie comes out yellow, don't color it green my friends.

For a starter, multiple beers, two meals, coffee and dessert, when you added a generous tip, we still came up around $100.  When you consider the wonderful food, great atmosphere, and amazing service, I think it may possibly be one of the best deals in Phoenix!

It was also great to see many different generations of diners.  From little ones to the older folks, all seemed to have a wonderful time.

It's safe to say that we'll be back. I'll just make sure to make a reservation.  This place is always crowded!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Portland and was recommended to go here. Honestly the best chicken I have ever had. Moist with a kick of spice. Service was perfect and the meal was delivered promptly. Couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"As promised, thirty-five minutes after entering, at seven on a Tuesday night, with no reservation, in the summer, we were finally seated. 
To say this place is crowded would be an understatement. Nowhere to sit at the bar, no place to loiter while waiting on a table. It was nuts to butts in there. 
I did what anyone would do.

I went outside, plopped down on a concrete bench hoodged-up next to one of the high-tops where a typical American family was having dinner,mom, dad, teen daughter and son. 
Mom was a typical forty-something, can't let go of her youth mom, bedazzled, tummy showing with overflow skinny jeans. She was bitching out her daughter.

Daughter was all; \"You don't even know Gretchen, how can you say she's a bad influence just because her tongue and nipples are pierced, you're so old fashioned! I want a tattoo.\"

Fat son spoke to no-one, he was busy playing video games on his phone. Totally disconnected. I look for him in a bell tower with an assault rifle in a few years.

Then there was forty-something dad:
Mindlessly staring away from it all, furtively eyeballing the seemingly endless procession of tang arriving at the valet station... as if he was still a twenty-something poonslayer. Lustfully watching, drooling as they filed inside, their black mini's and f me pumps prominently on display. I'll bet he was probably thinking about how fucked his life is with these three winners.

Me?
I just sat there drinking my Green Flash IPA, taking it all in, until the text came that our table was ready. 

My salmon was 18 bucks and good, it came with kaleslaw, weird, but good too. 
People of all ages here, mostly families. 
Mostly dysfunctional families from what I witnessed.

Snagged about a dozen of the free cookies on the way out the door. 
Forgot change for the valet.
Paid him in chocolate chip cookies. Better than stiffing him."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, good service and great atmosphere. Go during the very long nice season in Phoenix and sit on the patio. Always opt for the food and drink specials.
A fine place for kids, if you can keep them under control."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  Have been a couple times and have always had at least adequate service and amazing food.  Lobster tacos (surf & turf, no steak- I don't eat red meat) are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Loved just about everything here.  First.  The happy hour is great. $5 drinks and their rail drinks are of high quality, not nasty cheap liquor. We had 4 entrees and 2 salads plus some deviled eggs.  The eggs were good, which is a huge compliment from an non egg eating guy.  Loved, loved the Kale salad with grapes.  The combined bite hit all of the sweet bitter notes. The Brussel Sprouts with bacon and peanuts as a great version of what could be a normal salad.  I had the short ribs, and loved them and the accompanying mashed taters and roasted root veggies. The prime rib was perfect, with a nice horseradish side great potatoes and a really good spaghetti squash.  The only problem for this and the rotisserie chicken (which was amazing) was that there were two fairly large servings of a beigish veggie.  The salmon was good but not amazing.  Overall I would come back in a second.  A few minor tweaks would be great but a solid place for a very good meal."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch setting with a sweet patio. Tuna tartar and the Brussel sprout salad with salmon are amazing and the service was great! Cant wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"The menu focuses on Arizona desert/Southwestern inspired flavors. Guacamole, salsa, & chips are made in-house and the quality shows. I also ordered The Del Mar Salad with fresh crab and shrimp on a bed of lettuce topped with sliced avocado and diced tomatoes. The remoulade sauce was a nice addition on the side. With all this components coming together on the plate, what could go wrong? The watery lake in the bottom of the bowl almost killed the dish. The lettuce was swimming in this pool of liquid that came from both the tomatoes and the wet lettuce itself. Unfortunately, the damage had been done.

Note to Chelsea's Kitchen: DRAIN AND DRY THE LETTUCE!! Also, pre-mixing the tomatoes and shrimp contributed to the disaster. 

Bright spot: my waiter was awesome!! Attentive without being overbearing, yet tuned into my needs with an almost preternatural ability. I tipped him well despite the lettuce... not his fault."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the following thoughts come to mind...

- What is up with the Valet?  There is a huge parking lot and this is Arizona not Manhattan.  Why do I pay someone to pick up my car when it is literally 25 feet away from me?

-This food is good but does it justify the mark up?  Let''s take the chicken for example.  It is great, but at $20 is it really twice as good as the bigger $9 plate at Lolo's?  Doubtful.

-Let's tone down the whole LA vibe.  The attitude of the staff and the atmosphere it perpetuates is pretty off putting.

The bottom line is that the whole LGO empire is nice and all but there are so many great alternatives in Phoenix these days that it no longer merits the ubber devoted following that myopically overlook the many other equally great spots in town."}
{"text":"Some tasty food here, we come here a lot and just love the food, The deviled eggs are the most delicious things ever, The best thing here is the hamburgers, They use kobe beef (the best kind you kind eat) and it's high quality and fresh, also juicy. YUM.  friendly and inviting atmosphere to this place as well."}
{"text":"I had a great dining experience here.  Wonderful food.  Prices were a little high since it is in the airport but I managed to get the soup & salad and deviled eggs for $20.  So that's not bad for a sit down dinner in the airport.  Comfortable atmosphere and the Sunday night NFL game was on the TVs in the bar area.  The servers are very nice and personable.  Food was very tasty.  If this place was near home I would come here often.  :)"}
{"text":"How many times a week must I go here before I get a bad meal or bad service. Favorite meal is the kale salad with steak on top. Service is always good, great for kids. It's always crowded but the outside seating surprisingly isn't as hot as you'd think being 110 degrees outside. The prices aren't the cheapest but as I am a hungry man who eats a lot i always go home with a doggie bag. Also please take 3 chocolate chip cookies when you leave because I do and I feel bad, but they are so good. I'll probably be back in two days for lunch"}
{"text":"Good food, but give your staff the ability to turn this awful music off when a big football or sports game is on. #Playoffs. No one really cares to watch the NFL and hear this jazz/oldies music."}
{"text":"STAFF AWESOME - 
These guys have mastered hiring practices - Charlotte, Kim...all the managers...just awesome.
Been about 10 x now...
Food ...excellent. Love the Del Mar Salad...etc.. etc..
ALL Good!"}
{"text":"I can't remember a better key lime pie I've tried, and the portion seems like 2 slices served... also can't remember a better \"airport\" restaurant I've tried. Prime rib (ordered medium rare) & sides were cooked perfectly. Great service and super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy brunch here. It's a casual and relaxed atmosphere. The service has always been good. The food is good. The patio is really nice."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen probably has the best french dip sandwich in the world.  I can't seem to get it out of my mind!  The decor, the food, and the service is a welcome addition for Phoenix.  The indoor/outdoor patio is charming, and when I was there, the place was packed!  The parking lots fills up quickly, so if you go, be one of the first in line, or prepare to settle down for a wait."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is awesome. It's hard to find anything bad to say about it, so here are the good things: they have plenty of great beers on tap, as well as a ton of great wines. The food is amazing. I got the short-rib taco platter this time, and it is awesome. It's cool that the menu has a little airplane icon next to the dishes that are fast to make so you can make it to your flight quickly. And they have several tvs is the bar section so you can catch the end of the PGA Championship, if it happens to be that day for you (go Rory!). 

Overall great place. Friendly wait staff, food that arrives quickly, and great drinks. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This review is on the weekend brunch only--

Great medium sized (heavy-ish traffic) spot to hang out with friends and enjoy brunch.  The food selections is good, and their outdoor seating can't be beat.  They have the best huevos rancheros I've ever had in my life. The best eggs bennie too (with homemage english muffins)... but after tasting huevos rancheros, it's hard to bother with anything else.  The prices aren't  exactly budget friendly - but worth the occasional splurge.   Word to the wise: Mimosa's are bottomless only on Saturday - we mixed the days once and ended up spending 40 bucks on breakfast booze while the food was 20 :/"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good for airport food.

I had the Howie Burger which had cheese and caramelized onions- roasted cauliflower for my side. When the dish came out, I had low expectations because the cauliflower was cold and the top bun was also cold already. I cut the burger in half and the patty was well done throughout, so I was already disappointed before I even took a bite.

The cauliflower (although cold) was very delicious. It was roasted with thyme and parmesan cheese and tasted perfect-- not too soft, cooked just right.

The burger was also really good. The carmelized onions had a citrus-y tang to it that made the burger mouth-watering. The patty was just a tad overcooked, but didn't bother me at all when I was eating it.

I also finished with a scoop of pistachio gelato because I LOVE my ice cream!! I was pretty disappointed with the ice cream though.. it was very dense and not as smooth as gelato is supposed to be. Definitely lacked pistachio flavor (minus 1 star). 

FREE BOMB COOKIES on each side of the hostess stand. And when I say BOMB, I mean they're really friggin good. I should've grabbed 2 to make up for the mediocre pistachio gelato.

I'll definitely come back if I'm ever at PHX. I want to try the short rib tacos everyone's talking about!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere.  Our group loved all of our entrees! We sat on the back patio, would recommend that location instead of front patio.  Very busy would highly recommend reservations for large group and call ahead. Service was prompt and wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"3 1/2
Popular with air passengers
Fantastic kale & quinoa salad w/optional white chicken breast; a little dry, but good
Great veggie soup with beet, but only a tiny serving
House bread just okay
Efficient food service
Have gelato desserts"}
{"text":"Such a great place! The service was fantastic and the food was great. Perfect place to grab a bite after Camelback.

We caught the Sunday brunch crowd that the hostess handled with little to no stress. Every single employee helped to make our experience great. Also, they have complimentary valet which is a nice touch! A little pricey for the area, but excellent overall. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I frequent Chelsea's Kitchen and would have never given them anything less than a 5 star rating. This past time I went I was extremely disappointed. I've been taking my two children in about once a week. When we sat down and ordered on Saturday I realized that they changed their \"kids eat free\" policy. Now children no longer eat free from the hours of 3-6pm, it will cost you $4.00 per child. That was not even my biggest issue. My biggest issue is that I had a very inattentive waitress. My glass was always empty, responses were very short and to me it felt as if she was faking it throughout the whole time I was there. I know that children are not the easiest to handle, but I keep mine very under control. For the lack of service I received and having to pay for my two picky children's meals I will be frequenting Chelsea's Kitchen a whole lot less."}
{"text":"The short rib tacos were AMAZING. Enough said. The nacho appetizer was also delicious. The only downfall is they don't accept reservations unless its a large party.  We had a party of four and knew this so we arrived early but still ended up waiting about an hour which we expected but there wasn't many spots to gather and hang out to wait with a cocktail. But regardless I'd say totally worth the wait once you sit down, just be prepared on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite places, for a special night or just any night.  

Disclaimer:  There is often a wait, and the parking lot is small, so you might be stuck using the free valet - but it's totally worth it!  

Beautifully cozy inside - big booths and tables, soft lighting, open floorplan.  Gorgeous patio outside, with big trees covered in little white lights.  Very romantic, but also fun for a group and a great, crowded bar for girls night.  The service has been pleasant every single time - no mean feat for so many visits.

I love this food!  The tuna tartare, served over guacamole, is amazing - I used to drive 25 minutes each way just to get this to go.  I highly recommend the ground ahi burger (so delicious!), the fish tacos, the fried chicken (\"amazing!!\" from multiple friends), the veggie tacos, the veggie burger...I'll stop before I've listed every item on the menu, but really, you can't go wrong.  The baked mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes are also to die for.  And don't even get me started on the desserts - keylime pie, red velvet cake, the list goes on.

Over the last ten years, I've probably been here with almost everyone I know.  It's a big favorite with visitors from the East Coast, and even my picky eaters can find something to love (Grandma requested plan chicken and mashed potatoes and had only nice things to say)."}
{"text":"We had the best service tonight from our waiter Matt S and the chef Scott.  We asked for a milder soup for my dad.  Scott went out of his way to make sure everything was just right.


Matt was right on with his recommendations and time at the table.  This is one of those places that care about what they do.  

We voted tonight to make this out weekly go to spot.

We love Chelsea's so much we always hit it when we are flying in or out of sky harbor."}
{"text":"This was my third or fourth time eating at Chelsea's Kitchen. Never a bad experience and always come away feeling satisfied with my dining experience.

I met a friend here for dinner on a week night. When I arrived, not crowded. Fifteen minutes later, CROWDED!  Get there a bit early to avoid the wait.  

I had the ahi tuna tacos and my friend had the brussel sprout salad. The ahi tuna tacos came with small corn tortillas and a very fresh kale and quinoa salad. The tacos were very, very good. The salad had a very light vinaigrette dressing which was very tasty. I'm no brussel sprout girl, but her salad looked might good and healthy too!

As for the parking -- there is a parking lot, but it gets filled fast. Park in valet and tip the guys generously then you won't have to worry about finding a spot. Trust me.  It's easy and they are FAST! 

I plan on going back to try a brunch someday. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times.  These have been our observations:

Pros:
Great Service
Great deserts
Great Tacos
Cons:
Average Burger
A little on the pricey side

We went on Easter for Brunch and had a five star experince.  3 of us shared a pitcher of Sangria, Tuna Tartar (AMAZING) and 3 breakfast plates.  The chilaqilies are to die for!!!!  All the for $75 before tip."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but it's Paradise Valley! Love the ambience, the service is fantastic, and the food is very good. We go for any special occasion, or if they're running a special (like they did on 4th of July - BOGO entrees: woohoo!). The surf and turf tacos are my absolute favorite. My daughter recommends the kids mac and cheese."}
{"text":"You Can't Judge a Book By it's Cover

If looks were everything this place gets all the stars. But, just like people, it's what's on the inside that counts. I was given a few gift cards to Chelsea's Kitchen, so we have ordered several times from the menu; the food we had was sub-par every time. 

Top 3 reasons we did NOT like Chelsea's kitchen

 ~ The entrees were not very good. Nothing was worth going back for.
 ~ The food sometimes arrived cold
 ~ Pricepoint. We eat out a-lot, so price matters to us.
 
Top 3 things we liked about the joint
 ~ The place is gorgeous; architecture and  design is wonderful
 ~ Service. These people don't skip a beat. Service is snappy with a smile
 ~ Fabulous location at 40th & Camelback."}
{"text":"We had a great experience yesterday at Chelsea's 
Kitchen, busy day though we were seated quick.
Portions are big so be aware, everything was very
good and service was smooth as well. Server was
just above average, lacked follow up and it was
pretty ordinary, though food quality, presentation,
was fine. Food  B+  service C.
Beautiful property, nicely designed, only negative
is it is so loud when busy, can't hear conversation."}
{"text":"ambiance is wonderful and the best roasted chicken."}
{"text":"We went to Chelsea's because the menu sounded interesting and our daughter's name is Chelsea ... and it was great!

I had the tuna taco's and they were wonderful.  Chelsea had the Rotisserie Chicken and loved it.  I'd definately go again next time we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Always yummy!  Sit on the patio!!!  Don't miss the spicy fries or the salted chocolate chip cookies on the way out!!!"}
{"text":"The patio area is just beautiful anytime of the day! I would recommend sitting outside if possible. 

The menu is fantastic! My favorite items are the french fries and the mac and cheese. I know those are pretty juvenile dishes, but they are to die for!"}
{"text":"By far the worst managed location ever. Does not come close to the outside the airport location . Came for a snack nothing told us breakfast over at 10:30am. Basic very poor management. Was provided a breakfast menu and then not allowed to order from it. Then the lack of professional attitude."}
{"text":"Was 5 Star before killed Mac'n Cheese- bring back the O'Mac."}
{"text":"I ate here while waiting for my flight back home. This place looked promising...nice bar, chic atmosphere. I was alone but preferred to dine at the table versus the bar. The place was not packed at all, but after declining to be seated at the bar, I was told the wait for the table would be ten mins. Didn't mind, so I waited. When I was seated, the waitress quickly greeted me and brought me water. I briefly glanced at the menu, when my radar honed in on \"prime rib.\" The waitress asked, \"it comes with mashed potatoes and Swiss chard w/bacon, is that ok?\" Hecks to the yeah! I ordered the meat medium rare and when it came out, it looked beautiful. I proceeded to try the chard and that was yummy. The mashed potatoes. hmm. I know that this is personal preference, but I prefer my mashed potatoes thick not that thin almost watery type consistency, and that's how these were. :-( The meat itself was pretty and had good flavor, but was waay too tough. So that was a big bummer. Service was great, food was ok- so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"I know. 5 stars for an airport restaurant is rare. But once you step in and are surrounded by dim lights and swanky lounge/jazz music, if you didn't look up and see a plane headed to a gate you'd be hard-pressed to remember that you are at the airport.

We had time to linger because we had dropped off the car about 2 hours early [pro tip: if you drop off at least 90 minutes ahead you can check your bags at the rental car facility] and took time to relax. My wife enjoyed the kale salad and I had an excellent green chile burger. Some items are flagged as ready in 8 minutes or less (presumably those are pre-made) and others can take some more time. But we had the time and also enjoyed some gelato for dessert.

This restaurant is a great place to decompress before you face the security line. The food is much better than anything you'll find in an airport. The only thing that reminds you that this is an airport concession is the price. Our server was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little find here! I'm so jealous of people who live near Camelback Mountain, because that means this kitchen is only a small walk or drive away. 
I started off my Sunday morning with one of their prickly pear infused tequila margaritas. I polished that off so quickly that they already had a 2nd one on its way to me only after being 15 minutes there. 

From the name, chicken nachitos, you would expect a little appetizer on a saucer with little bites of chicken and a spoonful of guac and chips, but instead you get a huge platter filled with slow roasted shredded chicken, gallops of cheese, heaps of guac and some slices of jalepeno peppers. 
Bryan and I shared plates of the swordfish tacos and of course, the short rib tacos - we had to try them since they're award winning, right? Both did not disappoint. They were great tasting and not overfilling since you could pace yourself easily with the small homemade corn tortillas they created. The tortillas were actually white, not yellow, in color and slightly browned and were a little smaller than a CD/DVD in size. It would probably take you about 3-4 little tortillas to finish all the meat on the taco plate. Each taco plate came with a mound of guacamole, a little saucer of salsa, and another mount of kale-quinoa mix that was delicious! 

Eating kale and quinoa mixed together definitely was healthier than my usual rice obsession. I know there was dressing on the quinoa mix, but since quinoa tends to have protein in it and not just carbs, it just made me a little less guilt ridden fulfilling my need to eat my way into a Sunday morning food coma. I guess you could throw all that gibberish about healthy eating anyway because I forgot to mention that I also ordered the mac and cheese side... If you look up the word, \"Indulgence,\" in the dictionary, I am pretty sure there is a picture of this mac and cheese next to that word. 

The service was okay. I think our waiter's mind was somewhere else, because he didn't check in on us enough. Bryan and his dad ordered coffee and our waiter said that he would refill those coffees and kept forgetting. We finally had to ask someone else to bring us another coffee pot. We said that we needed 2 boxes for separate left overs and he brought 1 box. These are just a few small things, but after reading all the other reviews, I thought the service would be great, so we were all a little disappointed about that. I'm sure he was just having an off day, because otherwise, the atmosphere was really nice. We sat indoors today, but on a late afternoon, it'd be nice to grab a few drinks and sit outside on the patio. It's too bad this place is so far away from me!"}
{"text":"I know corporate is in charge of how much soup to ladle out, but I think it's a little ridiculous to be served literally a puddle of soup instead of a bowl of soup.
C'mon Chelsea! We can do better than that when it comes to portioning out boiled water. 

Per usual, the customer service was above par. Of course, there's never a complaint about the free salted chocolate chip cookies.    They are so addicting I could eat a whole plateful......they use real butter 

Overall I think a solid four stars fits the bill due to today's lack of value for the money.

Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the vibe of the restaurant and have never had a bad meal so if you subscribe more to the thought of quality over quantity than be sure to stop in for a bite. I just wish there was a little more quantity of their quality food served."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful. The food is good quality, but a little boring. This is a great place for clients/business dinners. the service is usually spot on as well."}
{"text":"Here's the scene: A near-empty airport food court with chairs everywhere. Over on the side you see a restaurant with comfortable chairs, filled with people. Wait, there's a wait to sit down?

Chelsea, whoever you are, thank you.

As some other reviewers have said, this is a restaurant you would go to in NY/SF and just enjoy the food. Although I only had one thing there (the prime rib dip + au jux), it was extremely tasty and came in large portions. The waitstaff was very nice and at the end of the meal you can grab a sea salted chocolate chip cookie (not too big of a fan, honestly) and be on your way to your destination.

Sure, you'll dip a little bit deeper into your wallet, but not by much. If you're in the PHX airport and need some food, this is the place to grab a meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I wish I could move into Chelsea's Kitchen and never leave.  First of all the service is outstanding.  Things usually go perfect, but if they don't you really get a sense of how a restaurant should be run.  I take all out of town guest here and always end up getting a ton of praise for my dinner recommendations.

I have people beg me to overnight them the Red Velvet Cake.  The Nachitos are so simple, but done to perfection.  If all of the \"Best Things I've Ever Tasted\" menu isn't enough, they out do themselves with those delicious little cookies they offer you when you leave.

Try it, you'll like it.  There's a party in my tummy, so yummy!"}
{"text":"This review was started months ago... Finally completed it!
On a rainy sunday back in March the bf decided we would go to Chelsea's for breakfast. It was my first time at Chelsea's and it didn't disappoint. I had Chilaquiles and ordered the egg scrambled instead of over-easy.  This was one of the most delicious breakfasts i've had in some time! Eggs cooked perfectly, the red and green sauces were excellent... I gave the bf a bite or two, but i ate pretty much every morsel on the plate. I had a bloody mary, which was good, but i prefer a little spicier. He had some kind of pancake breakfast. I had a bite and it was good, but mine was waayyy better.  =)
I look forward to trying some of their lunch or dinner options!!"}
{"text":"Customer service?  Hospitality? What's that?

I arrive for a late lunch at 3:20pm with about 40 minutes to kill before my flight home.  The restaurant is about 30% occupied.  The hostess leads me into the seating area and attempts to seat me at a small table for two.  Again the place is quite empty.  I request a larger table, perhaps one of other ten or more open 4 top available.  She says they are getting ready for the lunch rush and doesn't want to give up the tables for a party of one.  

I remind her it's a little past three.  She says, \"Oh, the dinner rush\". I mention again it's just after 3pm.  She lets me know the rush starts early. She offers another table tucked in the corner.  I think great, it's a less desirable table but with more space.  She leads me to another 2 top.  I tell don't bother I'll take my business elsewhere.  Which I gladly did.

It's my guess this is the way this restaurant operates from a management level.  Time to reevaluate your procedures."}
{"text":"I'm underwhelmed by Chelsea's food and annoyed by their shutting down at 10 pm on a Friday night. The atmosphere is nice enough, although the space is so massive that it has that subtle, distinct overpriced-cafeteria flavor that LGO seems to have mastered. 

I ordered a 12 dollar \"Santa Fe green chile burger\", which the menu describes as having the following ingredients: \"wood-fired poblano chile, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheddar cheese & chipotle aoli.\" Sounds glorious, doesn't it? Unfortunately, all that glory basically amounts to what looked and tasted to me like a plain hamburger with a slice of Velveeta slopped on top in between two buns. Nowhere did I detect a hint of the famed \"wood-fired poblano chile\". I confess that I don't actually know what \"chipotle aoli\" is, so I can't tell you if there was any on the burger. Maybe \"chipotle aoli\" is like carbon monoxide: you can't smell, taste, see or otherwise detect it?"}
{"text":"This PHX airport terminal restaurant is worthy of five stars. I am totally impressed with the Caesar topped with ribeye - probably the best da*ned ribeye I've ever tasted. Cooked a perfect medium. 
The manager (Taad) recommended the key lime pie with French press coffee and I caved (need to run a marathon or something like it to burn it off.). As a road warrior I tend to eat a lot of crappy terminal fare. Chelsea's is the exception."}
{"text":"It's taken me forever to get to Chelsea's Kitchen, a restaurant I've been wanting to try for years! I went there this past weekend and was so happy to finally head to this beautiful eatery that has a breezy island vibe with sprawling patios both at the front of the house and back.

It's no wonder the spot was bustling when I went for dinner at 9 p.m. on a Friday night -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy booths and striking printed curtains that make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd. The bar contained a few televisions with sporting events on, so you could dine in any type of atmosphere you wanted -- cozy dining room, spacious patio or at the bar.

Our servers were professional and attentive, and the meal was fantastic and hugely portioned -- I took half of mine home. I loved the Lucy's \"Spiked\" Lemonade ($8) cocktail I got, with vodka, lemonade and fresh rosemary. It was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross alcohol taste -- it was easy to drink and tasty.

We started with the Guacamole and Chips ($10), which is pretty much a must-try since all the ingredients, including the chips and salsa, are all made in-house. The salsa had the perfect amount of spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the guacamole would have been great to eat on its own.

For my meal, I tried the Shangri-La Vegetarian Burger ($12), which consisted of grains, nuts and seeds. I usually don't get French fries, but I did this time, and they had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of oil. The burger was tasty, but the consistency made it difficult to hold together. Not that it matters -- it was a great veggie burger that was really filling.

Chelsea's biggest impression on me was the service of the staff, who made you feel welcome and valued from start to finish. It's no wonder people remain so loyal to the eatery -- it seems like a wonderful place for anyone to have a great meal."}
{"text":"We love it here.  If you have food allergies this is the place to go.  They are amazingly attentive to your needs and make sure you have nothing to worry about.   You can't go wrong eating at Chealsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Now here's a little story I'd like to tell about a one Chelsea's Kitchen who we know so well. All I can say is that I wish this was my kitchen. The eatery on 40th and Camelback is yet another fun creation by the La Grande Orange family. 

I can't believe it's taken me this long to review a top notch spot like Chelsea's. I don't know if it's just me, but every time I visit, if I closed my eyes I can almost pretend that there is a lake just past the comfy outdoor patio. Then I open my eyes and realize that's the canal...dam. But, let's focus on the awesome and not the inevitable here. I like Chelsea's. I do. I've been for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every time I visit, I'm happily satisfied and pleased. 

Have you had the Chelsea's burger? No? Go right now. Go... order one. It's burgerlicious. It has the special sauce aka thousand island dressing. It has a crispy buttery bun and freshly cooked meat. And the french fries. OMG, the french fries. So french fries might be my weakness and I try to avoid ordering them at all costs, but at Chelsea's I lose all control of my willpower. 

Have you tried the fish tacos? Expensive you say? Why yes, yes they are astronomically high in price. But once you save your pocket change and make the big plunge into your wallet, it'll be worth it. I assure you my friend, it will be worth it. Check out the swordfish tacos or if you're really in a Daddy Warbucks mood, try the Lobster ones. The fresh guacamole, the taco sauce, the fresh pico de gallo and the fish...yum. 

And the last item to be highlighted during my sonnet aux Chelsea's will be the Chicken Nachitos. Yes, I know. Nachos? Boring! But, these are a pile of heaping, crunchy and massive chips, cheese, meat, salsa, avocado, beans and who knows what else. It's a great way to start your 5,000 calorie meal. You won't be sorry. Your diet might make you sorry, but during the very moment you consume them...you will not be sorry. 

For the healthier options, my suggestions include the shrimp ceviche and the Del Mar Salad. I heart avocados as if you can't tell already...and both of these dishes have their fair share of the good green stuff itself. 

The end."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance afternoon or evening. Food was good, fresh, light. Their cocktails were tasty as well! Seems to get crowded."}
{"text":"It's pretty easy to forget you're in the airport while eating here...but then you see the departure screens and you're quickly reminded! The food at Chelsea's Kitchen is pretty much on par with their food at their 40th street location. The decor isn't quite as charming as the decor at their main location, but then again, it is in the airport! Prices are about the same as the main Chelsea's. Some of the items are reasonably priced and others are a little pricier, but their food is worth it! I love their cheeseburgers, french fries, salads and fish tacos. If you must eat at the airport, do yourself a favor and visit this local favorite to enjoy some quality food before boarding your plane!"}
{"text":"Well I was hoping and expecting better. Went for lunch with a few people from work. It was pretty busy chock full of middle aged businessmen. We were seated quickly and drinks came fast. We ordered. I had the French dip. More on that later. After ordering I also asked for a bowl of soup. It also came quickly. The soup was French onion, really bland, no baked cheese on top, and not much of it. Then came the sandwich. Cold. Fries were cold too. I didn't send it back because the place is a favorite of a colleague asking with us. So I sat there eating cold fries and a cold sandwich dipping into the jus, also bland. Oh well, maybe they serve warm salads."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, family type atmosphere for customers as well as employees. Everyone has a big smile even when they don't know we are watching.  

I would come back.  

Only thing I didn't exactly like, the spiked lemonade -_- I have tasted straight shots of vodka that aren't that strong haha."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great! The menu didn't have as many options as I would have liked. In Southern California Brunch is usually offered Sunday with bottomless mimosa's or champagne, omelette station and buffet style, but Chelsea's Kitchen is a brunch menu style restaurant strictly menu and on Saturday's they offer bottomless Mimosa's. I will have to try it again."}
{"text":"At Sunday brunch here a few weeks ago w an in town colleague and the pork was great along with the deviled eggs. Great atmosphere and top food and service."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinner place and brunch is amazing. We have done company group lunches here and the environment lends itself well to groups. The menu has something for everyone and the quality of the food is good. 

Decent for kids at brunch, but have not tried lunch or dinner with the kid yet"}
{"text":"We recently when here for dinner with another couple and was very impressed by the service. I usually go into quite a bit of detail but since Erik S. did it for me I will not rehash it but A+++ to the staff and management for taking care of a meal that wasn't prepared as we ordered it originally but they corrected it and apologized for the error. 

Cannot wait to go back for dinner again soon."}
{"text":"There really isn't much I can add to the Yelps on this place. Average everything except the space. I really love the scale and volume of the space. While a bit loud it really lends itself to being a very comfortable atmosphere. 

Be sure to snack before coming here because the portions are on the smallish side."}
{"text":"Great service and ambience. Love their kale salad and Brussel sprouts salad with a side of ribeye. Short rib tacos are great too. Nice outdoor patio area to relax and dine."}
{"text":"Chelsea's on 40th and Camelback is one of our favorite restaurants.  That CAN'T be said about the experience at the Chelsea's at the airport.  Let it be said that the onsite manager, Diane, does not understand the concept of hospitality or exceeding customers expectations.  We asked for some more almonds or toppings on our sparse Brussel sprout salad, ( usually plenty of whole almonds on a normal order but got just small quantity of chopped up almonds and slivers of bacon) you know to kick it up a notch!  Rather then eating a big plate of sprouts with dressing. After spending $50.00 bucks on lunch, she promptly charged me .50 for more almonds, REALLY!  She would not comp them and demanded I pay my bill.  Elementary fast food training is needed for Diane....."}
{"text":"I loved the food here!!! It's sort of a bummer that they don't make reservations, every time I have gone here it's 40 min to an hour wait. Either way I will be back."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday morning for breakfast. Loved loved loved! We sat in the back patio. So perfect! They really made it feel like you were no longer in aZ. Trees and flowers surrounded you. The staff was very nice and attentive. My young children enjoyed the hot cakes and fruit! Perfect breakfast! I had the chilaquiles. So yummy, but could definitely have shared it with the husband. Huge portion. My husband had the short rib hash. That was ok. Probably won't order that again. He regrets not ordering the egg Benedict after seeing 8 tables order it. We also had to try the red velvet cake because of you yelpers:). It was very delicious and rich, hah maybe not for breakfast, but had to try it. If you are on a diet this is not for you. Lots of in between cream cheese goodness. ;). Great restaurant! Will come back!! Oh and kids loved the wiki sticks! It really entertained them!"}
{"text":"Man, what a find for the airport.  I wouldn't even classify this as \"airport food\".  Came in with low expectations and left completely satisfied!!  We started off with the \"homemade\" guacamole and chips, which were excellent - VERY fresh and authentic tasting.  Had to try a half-order of the Deviled Eggs and they were well worth the indulgence.  For entrees, my wife had the Green Chili Tillamook burger, while I had the Ahi Tuni Taco platter.  The burger was cooked to perfection, as was the seared tuna.  My son tried the fried chicken \"kids meal\" and ate every bite.  Equally, they had a nice selection of draft and bottled beer and spirits to choose from.  Great service from our server, Will, too!!!  All in all would \"mosdef\" will come back to this place when traveling thru PHX and would love to get down to their main restaurant in DT Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go here for dinner tonight because she seen a friend post a good review on FB. So glad we made the drive.

We sat outside on the patio. Was a little chilly but the waiter turned the propane heater on and all was good. He even changed the tank 5 min later when it ran out of gas... Lol. No problem.

I had a bowl of the tomato basil soup with cornbread croutons and olive oil to start. As tomato soup goes, one of the best I've had. 

My wife got the ribeye steak dinner. On the plate was all the ingredients to make a taco with a side of mini tortillas. I tried hers and the meat was awesome. Full of smokey flavor from the wood fired grill.

I had a similar dinner with the exception of spare rib off the bone to place in the taco. We both loved everything on the plate. Including the kale & Quinoa salad. The salad just may have been my favorite item on the plate. Not sure it was all great. 

For desert we shared three scoops of Gelato. Chocolate, mint & pistachio. Surprisingly the pistachio was My favorite. It came with pieces of dark chocolate as a garnish. Which I have come to enjoy as an adult... the chocolate was good and the mint was made with real mint leaf. I would recommend cutting back just a bit on the amount of mint used in that one. When using real mint it's a little different. 

Oh and you can't end a meal w/o coffee. It was French press and hit the spot."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. I liked the service, the pan fried chicken and red velvet cake. However the vegetable was awful. It was suppose to be zucchini, eggplant and onion. What we were served was overpowering red onion with a small couple of pieces of zucchini that tasted of onion. Mashed potatoes were cold. What I hate the most is \"free valet\" at restaurants. No valet when we arrived but they were setting up when we left. The attendants had cones so close to existing cars that they were being caught on cars when patrons tried to leave which was followed by an attendant kicking the cones around. I guess he wanted to let everyone know either his dissatisfaction or show his laziness. Either way it was a poor representation for the establishment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! Every single time I have been here -the service has been just great the food excellent and a great atmosphere.

They don't take reservations for small groups, so that's a serious con of this place there's almost always a wait. Inside is very very loud. However the outside patio is great for conversation and has a great atmosphere. Good wine list!

My only suggestion for this place would be if they could add some vegan options to their brunch."}
{"text":"chelsea's kitchen has been on our \"to do\" list for ages, yet because of their prices, we neglect to go there....however, we were meeting 2 newly found friends (yeah, we just pick random people on the street to be our friends), and they suggested we meet them there for dinner. 

parking lot is small. tiny. teeny. since my wife was wearing one of her fabulous pairs of heels, we had to valet since nearly the whole parking lot was reserved for valet. our dining companions had arrived and secured a \"name on the list buzzer/beeper\" thingy. we waited about 20 minutes. 

the decor is pretty neat. we ate inside but their patio looks as good or better than the Tortilla Factory. we had the tuna tartar for starters with chips and it was good. and come to think of it, i am drawing a complete blank now on what myself or my wife ordered.....holy cow. it was a salad....oh...a quinoa salad i think. i do remember eating the whole thing so it must have been good. but i do remember feeling hungry later and eating a bowl of cheerios. 

meh, anyway, not a very productive review i guess. i should check the website for what i ate, but if i can't remember it, then i'm thinking it wasn't that memorable."}
{"text":"Knowing that this restaurant was part of the LGO concepts, I had pretty high expectations. I'm a huge fan of LGO and I also enjoy buck & rider but unfortunately, Chelsea's Kitchen did not represent very well. Let me start by saying that the atmosphere and the back patio is absolutely beautiful. Probably one of the nicest patios I've ever seen at a restaurant. Now, on to the food. Appetizers for the table included deviled eggs (with bacon, of course), ceviche, and tuna tartare. Deviled eggs were good. Ceviche was bad. Literally looked like a bowl of salsa with a few pieces of diced shrimp. Tuna tartare was good, tuna was really fresh and tasty but it was overwhelmed with the huge portion of guacamole on top. I never thought I would say this but that was too much guac! 

Entrees: 

Ribeye tacos were delicious. Steak was flavored beautifully. 
Carne adovada: once again, really flavorful meat with a little kick. 
Paella: Abysmal. Flavor was way off and I was not impressed with the meat and seafood inside of it. 

Dessert: 

Red velvet cake was very good. On the other hand, flourless chocolate cake was a disappointment. 

Lastly, their coffee was fantastic! It's a French press coffee and it was so good. Overall, they did have some good dishes but not enough to impress me or make me want to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numberous times for dinner ( and have enjoyed it!) but this was my first brunch here on a Sunday. 
I was hoping that the pancakes would be light, fluffy and out of this world but they were not. They were rich and heavy. A bit greasy. Not for me. 
The Chi Tea Latte was advertised as the best ever (or something like that) but I didn't agree. 
I think I will keep Chelsea's Kitchen for dinner but I probably won't return for their hot cakes."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen is amazing, consistently great food and when the weather is nice, best patio in town. Cool and relaxing environment with great service!"}
{"text":"CK's has a great vibe and energy to it. Located close to the confluence of Phoenix, Scottsdale and PV. The parking lot is tiny but they have valet service. There are a few options of where to eat here: inside, bar or outside, which is my favorite. The servers are all very quick & friendly. We went with the Mac and cheese and tacos. Both were good and will come back again. But be warned, a little pricey."}
{"text":"Have been to Chelsea's twice and is one of my Top Picks for Phoenix area! Atmosphere , Food, Service is All on point! 
Great gathering for large groups on their outdoor patio which has been my only experience for dining. Very well  executed management placing the emphasis on customers focus on their dining experience and not to distract but to enhance. I'd give them 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Really unexpectedly good! Had the chicken mole tacos. Meal was delicious--loved the guac and the kale salad was a nice, bright surprise! If I'm ever back in Phoenix, I'll stop in!"}
{"text":"Loved,  loved,  loved this beautiful place. Delicious food!  Had the short rib hash and I literally wanted to lick the plate!   Oh yeah,  the mimosas are bottomless during the Sunday brunch!   My goodness,  can't wait to return for a second time!"}
{"text":"I really think I need to try this place again... it was 1.5 stars, I felt no tingly feels as it seems others have.

The wine by the glass was over priced... we paid $20 for each large pour of good, but not great wine. And, our server had NO CLUE about the wines. A place like this should educate their servers.

brussel sprout salad (3/5)
- dressing was seriously lacking flavor. would have been a 5/5 if the dressing was good.

prime rib (2/5)
- large cut, very little flavor, except for the crust. the cut was too lean thus was not as tender or flavorful as it should have been
... we got two of these at the table, both were the same

desert (1/5)
- pecan gelato was flavorless
- red velvet cake was flavorless and/or had too little actual cake... 3x too much cream cheese filling."}
{"text":"Another great meal and experience at Chelsea's.  Tried something new this time - seared ahi tuna tacos.  The tuna was so fresh, delish peanut sauce & the guacamole tasty.   But the star of the meal just may have been the kale salad.  Just the sound of kale salad may send some running but this was unbelievable.  Service top notch as always from the young, attractive & personable wait staff."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night at 6:30 with no reservations. We got a drink at the bar while we waited 35 minutes for our table. This place has a beautiful interior, a lovely patio with trees and heaters, and quick attentive service. 

Now that I've got the good stuff out of the way, I thought the food was bland and overpriced. I paid $18 for a tasteless serving of short rib tacos. The meat was tender and juicy but had no flavor *at all*. I did enjoy the small kale salad on the side of the plate and the fresh corn tortillas were amazing but the main part of the dish was pretty boring for how much I paid for it. My dining partner had a cheeseburger, which was pretty good in comparison, but those are pretty hard to mess up, but for $13 it could have been better also. 

Another reviewer mentioned the lack of people of color. I noticed that too about this place but I feel that way about a lot of Phoenix establishments, it's a remnant of the enforced segregation in Phoenix that ended not too long ago. All in all I was not impressed and I would not go back."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food, the service, and the energy here. It's a great place to grab dinner for one or with a small group. Not crazy expensive, but consistently good food."}
{"text":"Aaaammmaaazzzing! Everything about this restaurant is above and beyond. Kale slaw = Love."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome.  From the complimentary valet service, delicious food and drinks, great service, warm atmosphere, all topped off with a cookie on your way out the door... Chelsea's Kitchen offers top-notch quality across the board. While dinner is nothing short of a fantastic experience, I personally love coming here for brunch. 

Things don't get much sweeter than when I'm sitting on their gorgeous patio with a  mimosa in hand...  and Classic French Omelet on the way.

Love Chelsea's Kitchen, a definite Phoenix staple."}
{"text":"The ambience is great here. The back patio is very kid and dog friendly. In combination with the welcoming waitstaff, this is definitely a go to place. We had really good solid food that was generously portioned. I had the burger which was on a nice soft bun and the meat was really quality. We also had chicken nachos, so tasty! The dessert did not disappoint and don't forget to grab a chocolate sea salt cookie on you way out the door. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The service here was top notch. We were given friendly, efficient service from the minute we walked in. The food was delicious-we enjoyed the chips with salsa and homemade guacamole and the cornbread. For entrees, we had the black bean burger, vegetarian tacos and Del Mar salad; all equally delicious. The atmosphere is great; the music a bit too clubby but otherwise great seating inside or out. Great venue, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"The ambience in the back patio is reason enough to come here. We got very lucky with perfect weather last night to truly enjoy our outside dinner reservation. The service here is superb. Food was great. We loved the tuna tartare, deviled eggs and surf and turf. The kids really liked their kids meals of Mac and cheese and pb&j. Only negative was the Brussel sprouts salad which was flavorless and boring. The waiter noticed we were not eating it and removed it from our bill which was very nice. Drinks were good. Do yourself a favor and order dessert. OMG mint gelato is fantastic... they use real spear mint and red velvet cake is bomb."}
{"text":"Buy one entree get one for $4 - this was their brilliant July 4th promo. I hadn't been to Chelsea's in years - spent a nice New Years Eve there a few years back. Turns out Chelsea's is batting 1000 for holidays! 

This time, we took a Yelp tip and walked to the bat cave as pre-dinner entertainment. Checking in for our 8:15 appointment shortly after 8 p.m., I got a little nervous when the hostess suggested we would be seated in 15-25 minutes - that they \"try to seat reservations within 15 minutes of their reservation time.\" We got seated promptly at 8:15.

I had remembered loving the ceviche and it was as delicious as I recalled. 

Went with the fish special which was cooked perfectly and in a delicious simple Asian sauce. Believe it or not, I was given a list of ingredients when I asked for a recipe! How generous!

Unfortunately, they had run out of the Dixie chicken so one of my dinning companions had to settle for the rotisserie chicken which, while edible, was disappointingly dry.

I tasted a corn tortilla that was PERFECT! Had a nice stretch like a fresh flour tortilla but the hearty flavor unique to corn tortillas. While I didn't taste, I saw the lobster taco serving and was impressed with the portion. 

Dessert was a flourless chocolate cake described precisely by our server as having the taste of \"brownie batter\" with pistachio gelato. 

A single pitcher of house (white) sangria kept our table of 4 quenched. 

The ambiance is homey yet elegant. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Chelsea's kitchen!!  Fun atmosphere and ambiance, lots of wonderful out door seating, amazing food and drinks, and great service to boot.  Ideal place for everything from brunch, lunch and dinner, to happy hour for a date or fun times with friends.  Favorites include the burgers, LGO caesar salad, rotisserie chicken, short ribs, THE ROTISSERIE PRIME RIB, and ALL of the sides!  Don't miss the cocktails and sangria!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere- Its super spread out, open and very classy feel, but not overwhelming.
Amazing service- great waiters and waitresses, prompt service, very well spoken when you ask for suggestions.
and amazing food- I have never had such amazing food, just wow.

I'm so glad I went and totally plan to go back and introduce other people to this place."}
{"text":"I have lived in the valley 30 years an i would like to say everything was perfect!  Tanya was are server an gave us great service, recommendations an our drinks were never dry! I enjoyed everything o tasted,  especially my prime rib dinner!  I will be back an will tell everyone!"}
{"text":"My review is a solid 3.5, but I'll round up because, despite the mediocre service, other factors like good quality and ambience are a solid 4-5. 

The bartender named Tyler is amazing. I was feeling indecisive on what to drink, so he asked me my likes and dislikes and came up with one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. 

The shredded kale salad is spectacular and you're safe with any type of taco--they're through the roof. The Mac and cheese is a bit too greasy and cheesy for my taste but dessert is always a winner. Try the key lime pie and cornbread cake with dark chocolate icing (my personal favorite). 

Inside or outside, you're guaranteed great ambience. The patio is one of the best in Phoenix--huge with beautiful trees and fireplace. 

So, with all these wonderful factors, why is the service so consistently so-so? Last night we were greeted and then had to wait 20 minutes before asking a passing hostess to take our order. The server never apologized or even acknowledged the incident and was very aloof the entire evening. The fact that we were there for a celebration made her behavior even more disappointing. On previous occasions we've been ignored like this too, so I expect this low-grade service to be the norm. 

To be safe, sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"When I visit my hometown, this is my first choice for dinner and drinks. The menu is fantastic!!! They have an awesome patio when the weather is tolerable. Their staff is great too. Skip the Scottsdale scene and check out Chelsea's."}
{"text":"An all around winner, from the professional, helpful and friendly staff to the plethora of good offerings. Taco platters, which come with tortillas and a meat dish, or entrees like halibut, pan-roasted chicken, ribs, all organic high-quality meats. Nice outdoor patio is comfortable, and they give you chocolate chip cookies on the house on your way out the door.

I would come here as often as I could if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  Everything I've ever had on the menu is great, but the burgers are my favorite in town."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The Bloody Mary is one of the best the Valley has to offer, spicy, rich and chock full of crunchy accoutrements. I got the basil gimlet, which is also delicious. 

For lunch we shared the harvarti burger with caramelized onions which my mom claims is the best burger of her life. I had the ribeye tacos. They are build your own tacos so the plate came with a full ribeye, sliced, with all the fixings on the side. Yum.

Tori was our waitress and provided us with great suggestions, so we have her to thank for our wonderful experience. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and delightfully attentive. I wish everyone took pride in their jobs, since it always enhances one's experience."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night and will definitely return.  Service, atmosphere and food were great.  Food doesn't quite warrant a five star rating, although it was pretty yummy.  Hubby and i shared the brussell sprout salad as an appetizer, he had the BBQ chicken and I had the hong kong halibut dish.  Veggies were tasty in the dish, but the halibut was a little bland.  Red velvet cake for desert finished the evening off perfectly."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some business associates last week and will have to say that the ambience and the food were both excellent. I had the Ahi tacos which I highly recommend and don't bother getting dessert they have these wonderful cookies at the front counter when you're leaving. Our waitress was excellent great service nice atmosphere can't beat it."}
{"text":"I have been here a dozen times and have never had a bad meal here. The brunch is fantastic and I will usually have the crab eggs Benedict. Last time I had the tuna sashimi salad. This place is always pretty busy and if the weather permits, I highly recommend sitting outside on the patio. It's probably one of my favorite patios in the city of Phoenix with lots of trees and nice fireplace etc. they also have free cookies up from the delicious chocolate chip salted cookies that I grab one on the way out every time. Parking can sometimes be a challenge here but they do have valet which makes it helpful. LGO always awesome too and this is another great restaurant from the same restaurant group"}
{"text":"Disappointing. 
Go to the bar, order a diet coke, get a glass of ice and a CAN of soda - that's right, a CAN for $2.25. Another one runs you $2.25. Even when you say you don't want another one they'll bring one and charge you for it. A stupid CAN.  Brings the class of this place down several notches. 
They also brought one of our group the wrong entree - not prepared wrong, but the entire entree wrong. The rest of us were 3/4 done before the right food was brought. No apology, just \"is this better now?\" Well, duh, yes it's better, it what we ordered...
Overall, the food was ok, nothing special, most of it needed to be seasoned. We probably would have enjoyed it more if not for the service failures.
And free cookies on the way out - chocolate chip with SALT on them. Blech."}
{"text":"Interesting.  First time in  went for happy hour, it was okay.  Nothing great.  Service was cold.  Food came out lukewarm.  
Sat at the end of the bar and ended up overhearing  the servers complain to each other rather loudly throughout my whole meal.   Apparently the owner is narcissistic as they mentioned it at least 10 times. Who cares.  Perhaps my experience would have been better away from the chatty negative staff, but the food for me was subpar and the whole place felt kind of chain like.   Did like the patio tho, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Since I know this airport location comes with the reputation of the mothership, I had high expectations when I found myself with an hour to kill at the Airport. 
It's a very nice place with great atmosphere and a great place to get out of the rush  and have a nice meal. 
The food is good and very good, the service is efficient with touches of friendliness. 
When a restaurant has chicken tortilla soup on the menu I usually order it. For some reason that's a trigger for me on how well the rest of the meal will turn out. 
The version was good and i might order again. Chicken in dark meat and shredded with fresh chunks of avocado 
My all time favorites if you care come from Wolfgang Puck and Max & Erma's. To me it's as much about the garnish as it is about the soup and when you don't give me a lime I am disappointed 
Our Cheviche was very fresh and the prime rib taco where  excellent.  
Overall a good meal and I will have to try the original next time I fly through"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you are greeted by snooty hostess that seemed to be held there against their will. Correction there was no greeting just a discomforting conversation to attempt to get a seat. Once you get pass them you get a sense that this a hipsters restaurant with quinoa and kale. Who puts coarse salt on perfect cookies? Chelsea's Kitchen does! They were not edible. Fire your baker!Ordered the nachos as an appetizer....big mistake. The nachos were horrible. The quantity was generous but the quality was substandard. For my main meal I got the fish of the day; pan seared halibut. It looked presentable however when I took the first bite I realized it just looked pretty and lacked true flavor. It was so bland. It was accompanied with beans and asparagus. That was the highlight of the night. I ordered a mint chip gelato for dessert and I am not kidding when I say this it literally tasted like mouthwash. The service was okay and the patio area was very inviting. Aside from that they failed to deliver taste and consistency. This was my second and last time there."}
{"text":"Forgive me for my delay in updating my review.  
Chelsea's kitchen really values their patrons having a positive and enjoyable dining experience.  Within about 24 hours from my original post, I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing for our \"just okay\" visit.  She gave us a gift certificate to go back.  We took up the offer and returned for a full dining experience.  
We were extremely impressed.  I have to say our waitress, Jessica, probably provided the best service I have ever received, at least the best I can remember in a very long time.  She was able to read us to know whether we were there for a quick dine or relaxed long dine.  I had a red wine that was delicious. We ordered the fish tacos and a hamburger.  Keep in mind, the price is more on the high end, but they delivered on taste and presentation. The food was brought at the right time.  I get nervous when the food at a place like this is delivered too quickly...
I will definitely be returning as the food, service and ambiance is deserving of a 5 star review."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this place for dinner on a Friday night last year. The place was packed and we knew right away that we had to wait quite a bit for a table. The overall review of this place is so promising that we did not mind waiting quite a bit for a table. The ambiance was nice, casual, and has a friendly atmosphere. 
We finally got a table after waited for about half-an-hour. We were seated outside, which was even better atmosphere. I ordered Tuna Sashimi Salad for a starter and Wood-fired Rotisserie Chicken (served with homemade spaetzle and chicken jus). While my husband ordered Chelsea's Cheeseburger. 
Long story short, loved everything that we ordered EXCEPT the Wood-fired Rotisserie Chicken. It's hardly cooked, although I didn't see any blood, but it was nearly inedible. I was so put off by it that I just want to get our bill and get the heck out of there and vowed never to return. The waitress found out about the chicken when she cleaned the table and noticed that the chicken was not fully cooked. She apologized and said that we wouldn't be charged for it. 
I would have given this place 4-5 stars had it not been the lousy house specialty. It was the one that really ruined my experience. It was a total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Top of the list weekend brunch spots. Laid back, and elegant. 

Bottomless mimosas, Eggs Benedict, Sante Fe style eggs, huevos rancheros, deviled eggs, fresh guacamole, and the flourless choclate cake with the awesome pistachio ice cream are just some of the reasons why this place is one of my weekend early day favorites."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad I can say about this comfy dinning establishment.  Oh, wait.  Some of the tables are faced awkwardly towards each other so that you're forced to stare at the people in front of you and they are forced to stare right back... uncomfortable.  

I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait for lunch.  We arrived at 12:00 on a Saturday and we were sat immediately.  SCORE!  The food: my girlfriend and I started with the sashimi salad. I was a little nervous about the \"spicy ginger\" in the description but it complimented the tuna perfectly and ended up being a very refreshing starter.  We both had burgers and they were so juicy and HUGE!  Neither one of us could finish our burgers and were happy to box them up for leftovers."}
{"text":"i've figured out that eating in scottsdale/phoenix isn't cheap or else you have to compromise; however, i also figured out a little trick at chelsea's: the sides.  it's all about the sides.

the summer heat is relentless here, and it definitely affects my appetite - making it hard to eat enough during the day to keep me going.  i'm a carb-heavy eater (as the dr. prescribed) so that makes it tougher.  but at chelsea's, i can sit down and get a nice sized bowl of excellent mac & cheese, and two sides of vegetables and get out at $9 flat.  this is about as good as it gets, not to mention the quality and portions you're getting for under $10.  

this may sound cheap, and i don't really care what anyone else thinks, but try it and you won't be thinking the same.  why go pay $9 bucks for a turkey sandwich (that i've had one million times over already) when you get variety and sustenance?"}
{"text":"I love the ambience! Service was quick. I would recommend to eat either inside or away from under trees because leaves and pollen started to fall on our food and drinks. Overall, food was tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"Really nice people, but after 20 min no food no drink - so I had to leave.   I will try again - but very er annoying...

I cannot eat grains thus my choices are limited - only place in all of Phoenix sky harbor one can get JUST meat or JUST veggies with out some blasted type of grain associated with it.  This I know is stupid SH admin.... just try and get a cab in under 10 minutes and you will see what I mean..."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, it's an experience everyone needs to try a few times with groups of family or friends. Great salads, yet they stopped making my favorite salad, that happens everywhere. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie at the end is a fun way to end the experience. Sitting on the back patio in the evening is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is always and enjoyable place to meet up with friends for good food and great conversation. Amazing salads. It's nice to sit on the back patio during evening. Very beautiful atmosphere.
Nice wide range of menu items, many great suggested meals by waiter. The chocolate chip sea salt cookie keeps many coming back for more. It's a fun end to the meal experience."}
{"text":"Went with the recommendations to go for late lunch and avoided any wait (sat indoors). Thanks for the tip Yelpers!

Had the market salad and I loved that the dressing was at the *bottom* of the lettuce and not drenched on top. Very fresh. French press coffee brewed at my table was a nice touch (for those wondering - coffee goes well with any meal in my book).

Kids menu was a little deceptive - it lists just the entree and side but it also comes with fresh cut fruit and portions are perfect. 

Wait staff was soooooo nice. Ambiance was inviting. They definitely know how to maintain their stellar reputation :)"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch my husband and I enjoyed our food immensely we started out with the shrimp ceviche with fresh tomatoes & avocado.  It was very tasty!   My husband enjoyed his short rib tacos.  I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was great!

Refreshing drink menu too!  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Outdoor seating is on back patio with lots of umbrellas.

The waitstaff was awesome!!  They offer valet parking which is always nice."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you want great fish, poultry or beef.  The decor is cute and makes you feel like you are at your mom's house eating.  I have been here a couple of times and I go back because the food is delicious as I had the fish tacos, beef tacos and Ahi salad (salad was a little disappointing).  The prices are higher than your average restaurant in the area so be ready for $18 tacos.  Definitely a local favorite place in AZ!  

What they don't tell you is you can get a free cookie on your way out the door.  So don't forget to grab one!"}
{"text":"This beautiful place is everything I want a restaurant to be. Great location, high quality food, lots of high end meat and vegan options, VERY attentive service, delicious cocktails complete with all fresh ingredients, wonderful ambiance,  large comfortable patio. I am currently enjoying my experience at the bar and the bartender Iesha is taking great care of me and my high maintenance needs. Highly recommended for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with my husband. We called ahead but they would not take a reservation for a party of 2. They said to come over it wasnt too busy. We got there in about 15 minutes and it was packed. The place was lively and had a great buzz. We gave our name and also waited by the bar in case 2 seats became available, which they did. We got served right away by very friendly girls behind the bar.  Half the bar is inside and half outside. They had heaters on the outside part as well as tables and a fireplace. It wasnt too cold since as it turned out, that is where the seats we got were. Now for the food, I ordered the vegetarian tacos, which were so good, The vegetables were not your basic veggies, they gave me carrots, spaghetti squash, ear tree mushrooms, bok choy and parsnip. The tortillas were 3 inches in size so that helped with keeping the calories down. They were delicious. Served with kale salad and quinoa/bean mixture. My husband had the short rib tacos, the meat was so tender and flavorful. He had the same sides as I did. We passed on dessert only because we had eaten gelato at The Gelato Spot in Old Town Scottsdale, which by the way was amazing. However, Chelsea's desserts looked yummy. Next time perhaps,,,,definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It may have taken fifteen months for my husband and I to make it back over to Chelsea's Kitchen, but it was definitely worth the wait. We brought some friends visiting from Ohio to Chelsea's Saturday night for dinner and all four of us left full and happy. When we arrived, we were told if we wanted to sit on the patio, we could be seated immediately, but for inside there was about a 10 minute wait. We decided to wait and sure enough about ten minutes later we were sat at a table. 

We skipped appetizers to save room for dessert after reading the menu. The beer selection is small as a warning. For dinner, our friends had the salmon special and the ribeye tacos. They both enjoyed their meals, although the salmon special was just a piece of salmon and a small spinach salad. No rice or anything else with it. That was a bit disappointing. My husband had the halibut special which came with rice and a vegetable - a much more substantial plate than the salmon special. He really liked his choice. I had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes - yum! The chicken was moist and delicious, and the breading was not over powering or greasy as sometimes it can be with fried chicken. The potatoes could have been a bit more whipped, but they still were amazing. On my previous visit to Chelsea's, I had the caesar salad which was good. 

The four of us decided to split two desserts so we had the chocolate destruction (chocolate mousse cake with an oreo crust) and the ice cream sundae. For the sundae, they basically brought you a sundae bar to the table - you get a side of caramel, side of hot fudge, sprinkles, chocolate and peanut butter chips, crushed oreos, and nuts - which I think is a great idea. The chocolate mousse cake was heavenly and I'm so glad we all split it or I would have devoured it myself.

Parking at Chelsea's is complimentary valet. The food is good and when it's a reasonable temperature out, the patio is nice to sit on (we ate on the patio the first time we visited Chelsea's). Definitely a solid restaurant - I just wish we made it over to that area more."}
{"text":"Another restaurant that was hyped up so much that when the wife and I finally made it a point to visit, on our anniversary no less, the letdown seemed inevitable. 
It is a very nice looking restaurant inside, and it is kind of serene tucked inside an area dense with trees in the midst of a bunch of other businesses. 
I had no qualms with the service either. That was just fine. The reason I have a hard time rating Chelsea's anything higher than a 3-star is simply that the food was just...underwhelming. The hype + the cost had us both expecting to be blown away, but the suggested short rib tacos and green chili burger didn't live up to comparable items at other restaurants for a fraction of the price. 
I would still say it was a pleasant dining experience, but there are plenty of other places in the valley that offer more flavorful food and at far better costs.

-------------------------------UPDATE-------------------------------

I have to hand it to Chelsea's. Customer service-wise, they are a shining example to all other restaurants in the valley. Due to my original 3-star review, the management asked that we give them another chance, and invited us back, on them.
This time we tried the chicken nachos, which were tasty and filling. So filling that we were unable to finish even half of the burger we'd both ordered. 
We brought this kids this time, and they can be difficult, but Chelsea's was completely accommodating. This restaurant may appeal to the well-to-do, but the service is anything but pretentious. The servers and the management are masters in customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time a week ago.  We went on a Friday night and despite it being very busy we were able to be seated right away.  I ordered the goodnight Emily cocktail and that was great.  It was a little sweeter than I anticipated but still a fun drink to start the night with!

We started off with the tuna tar tar, and while it was delicious, it was more like guacamole with a little tar tar at the bottom.  It was great but just not what was expected.

I ordered the rotisserie chicken after asking the waiter for his suggestion.  It was great chicken, it had great flavor and a little bit of a kick to it.  My only complaint about my meal experience was the service.  Our waiter was nice enough, but nothing spectacular. I love asking waiters what their favorite meals are, I hate when they respond with \"the most popular dish is...\" I want to hear what they truly like to eat when they pick their meals because they've usually tried everything on the menu.  

Overall I had a great meal with friends and it was a fun experience. I would go back when I'm in the area but this wouldn't be a place I would specifically think to come on a regular night out."}
{"text":"Guacamole, ahi tacos, ribeye tacos, brussel sprout salad! All awesome. Wait, did I mention the drinks??? The goodnight emily (gin grapefruit and more) and the Guadalupe (herradura tequila and something yummy) were notable, and we ordered a 2nd round (rare). Bar staff, and waitress Kayla R. were really great. Also, free cookies on the way out the door! Will definitely be back the next time we're in Scottsdale/Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came back on 11-4 for dinner this time. We had Patricia as our server. She made sure we were taken care off. I had a wood fired rotisserie jidori chicken. It was real good, very light, but that was fine because I had the nachos as an appetizer..the best nachos! We finished it. Then my sister had the sea bass, she gave it a 3/5, yummy bread crumbs! And then my boyfriend had a chili burger which he said was his top 5. They have really yummy fries! Oh and you need to order their flourless chocolate cake. This restaurant was so packed but we only waited for about 20 mins, while waiting we just hungout at the bar and had beer. I was def satisfied compared to sundays brunch!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good restaurant.  The atmosphere is really nice and they have enough items on the menu to satisfy most tastes.  

I started off with a White Sangria, which was pretty good, although I wish there was more wine and less ice in that tiny glass.  We then had the Chicken Nachitos, which were good - it was a huge, heaping portion of nachos that was a perfect way to start the meal.  It was fairly spicy which was a welcomed surprise.  My entrée was the Curry Chicken Salad - they didn't overdue the curry powder and there wasn't too much mayo so it ended up being a good salad; I do have to say, however, that the portion was disappointing since it was fairly small.

The service was very good.  

It was a nice day and we decided to sit outside, which was perfect for a day like that.  Not all the outdoor seating had shade, but I still thought it worked well.   

I'd like to try their burger next time..."}
{"text":"Personally I find it sad that the best food I had in Phoenix was at their airport...let that soak in.

This was the first place we came across in Terminal 4 that had a bar, done. We ordered a couple drinks, beers were actually reasonably priced and they had good local brews. We started with chips and guac which was pretty good, could have used a tad more salt, but very good.

I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and it was absolutely delicious, I was shocked. It tasted like restaurant quality and not typical airport food. The fries were also very good. My colleague got tacos and the plate was massive she couldn't finish it, it looked very tasty. The place was pretty big and you almost forget you are in an airport. The service was very good.

This is definitely a solid choice if you're in the airport in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Met my title gal here for lunch the other day.   Glad she snagged a seat before I got there.   Otherwise, have to wait for a table, which isn't a good thing on a work day.

I had the chicken nachitos and she had the vegetarian tacos.  My nachito were under the \"starters\" portion of the menu.   I don't know about you, but it would qualify as a \"starter\" for probably about five or six meals!   Not complaining, though.

It had plenty of chicken, salsa, guac, jalapenos, sour cream, cheese, etc.  A delicious mix of ingredients.  

She said her vegetarian tacos were good.   I am not a vegetarian, but, yes, it did look good.   Sorry.   I didn't try it.   

I have been here a few times in the past.   I can't believe I had not reviewed it prior.   Yes, I would return."}
{"text":"A real restaurant, in an airport. Had the excellent short rib tacos and some very good beer. A most civilized way to wait for my delayed flight."}
{"text":"Top 4 Cheeseburgers in town!

Great outdoor patio.  Even if seated inside, the architecture flows to their private, twinkle lit patio.  A+ Margaritas.  Great tacos.  The prices are a bit high, but you get what you pay for these days."}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh, flavorful, and fun. The patio is a must -- bring your dog (but it must not get in the way of others). The wait staff will bring ice water for your pup. The menu goes from seriously healthy (black bean burger, with which I like to sub in guacamole for their special sauce) to the most crispy and trendy fried chicken with mashed potatoes. Food is consistently good. Wait staff is usually friendly and sharp. Ambiance is Valley nice casual."}
{"text":"I think we are super LGO fans. I have not dined at an LGO restaurant that I didn't like. 

The nachitos. Are huge and delicious. And the salsa is outstanding. Our first time dining here, we were ravenous, so we ordered the nachos thinking it would be a good small starter. Except it was huge. And we were SO stuffed that we ended up getting our entrees to go, hah! The short rib tacos and burger were delicious even the next day after. 

On our most recent visit, I tried the Prickly Pear Margarita - it was ok, but tasted more like a slightly spiked tart lemonade. Meh. You can't win 'em all, I guess. We also tried the deviled egg - really good, but I mean, come on. I have yet to meet a deviled egg that I didn't like. 

My cousin ordered the kale salad with grilled salmon and it was superb. LGO does a great salad - at any of their locations. The Green Chile and Howie burgers were amazing. Now that, my friends is how you do a burger. And the fries? Now THOSE are crack fries. 

Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but definitely worth it for the quality. Will definitely be back to try brunch out on the gorgeous patio before it heats up too much.

Don't forget to grab a salted chocolate chip cookie on your way out!"}
{"text":"You can add The White Wine Sangria and Del Mar Salad to the list of awesome food here. Can't wait to come here for brunch on Saturday for $12 unlimited mimosas!!!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot to take guest! So pretty inside and a great courtyard with a fireplace outside! Perfect girls night out or date spot! I got the shrimp and steak tacos and they were delish!!"}
{"text":"When the weather's nice the patio at Chelsea's is a great dining spot.  This last visit I had the green chile burger for lunch.  It was delicious and the service was fantastic. Way to go Chelsea's!"}
{"text":"Was amazing food and great atmosphere! The Del Mar Salad and Chicken Mole are soo tasty!"}
{"text":"Best airport food ever. Relaxed with the some-assembly-required short rib taco platter. I'm stuck in the airport for 9 more hours yet I'm still happy sitting here. Nice lounge area, too."}
{"text":"one of the best corn tortillas you'll ever taste. my mouth is watering just thinking about those short rib tacos. MUST HAVE. 

and don't forget to have a slice of their famous Red Velvet cake. to die for."}
{"text":"Someone told me to try this place....I wish I wouldn't of. 1. The waitress only spoke from behind me...it was just me and my son, I never knew who she was or how to flag her down when I was ready to order a soda so I went the whole meal without a drink. 2. Not a single other person stepped up to help, 10 servers and I know they saw me searching for someone to help. Even the manager tripped over my chair and acted like it was my fault, no apology, no hey how are you guys doing today, can I get you anything. Awful! Order a kids meal, she got it wrong, ordered a burger...fries were sooo burnt. I thought that's how they did their fries but as I was leaving I saw 4 other plates with fries and none were even half as dark as mine. Just really crappy treatment and food. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I went to Chelsea's Kitchen for happy hour with a group of friends - it was great! Good atmosphere and something for everyone on the menu. We waited for a table, but sat in the bar area with some waters while we waited, so it wasn't a big deal. The outdoor patio area is beautiful, although the tables are very close together and it's pretty loud. Food was fine.

Our waitress was okay, service wasn't exceptional, but we came at a busy time during happy hour. Another heads up: you need to ask specifically to split the check if you're with a group, and the staff isn't thrilled when you do. 

Complementary valet parking made navigating the Phoenix restaurant easy - speedy service, too."}
{"text":"I came here with family for a late lunch.  Chelsea's kitchen sounds like a casual kind of place but was pleasantly surprised at the fountain outside, sea salt cookies upon arrival and the cozy vibe inside, equipped with a fireplace. The wait to sit on the patio was almost 30 minutes for our party of 6 so we sat inside because we were hungry. The patio looked beautiful and it was a beautiful day so that was disappointing.  Instead, we were seated in a booth that barely fit everyone,  very squishy and uncomfortable.  I got the dreaded corner seat. We immediately order a pitcher of sangria,  which was poured for us table side. Very delicious, easy to get a few of these down. Service was nice and attentive.  We got the chicken nachitos to start and a huge plate of deliciousness arrived before us. The plate was filled with chips, rotisserie chicken,  guacamole,  salsa, sour cream and jalapeños.  Needless to say, they were a huge hit.

 As I looked over the menu to order an entree,  nothing really sounded good to eat. No sandwiches were on the menu,  which would have been a nice lunch option. Salads, tacos, burgers and an random selection of appetizers are the choices down this one page menu. Prices were outrageous, anywhere from $11-30 for a lunch entree. For an LGO concept, this was a disappointment. My sister and I settled on splitting a caesar salad with chicken. Salad came split and was delicious.  I also heard the howie burger was amazing from a family member who ordered it, but didnt try it. My aunt ended up only ordering sides because nothing appealed to her. So, the food we ate was good, absolutely no complaints.

Would I come back? Probably if I was invited. I much prefer LGO down the street though."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Would not know this was airport food.   Had the short rib tacos and it was amazing. I will be back."}
{"text":"OK, the last time I was at Chelsea's Kitchen was three years ago.I just read Ryan from Phoenix review of January 30, 2016 and I agree. How does this place get so many 5 stars? I guess they think this is an 'In\" place to go. Seriously, $15 for a burger, nothing special, same bun I could buy at the grocery store and the fries were not only stone cold but greasy. Anyway, this place can rest on their previous reputation. I will find another place to eat. Gave it a second chance and it is still the same. Keep pulling in the suckers who will pay $19 for short rib tacos and $15 burgers. Lots of other options in this city."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch at Chelsea's Kitchen. Food was great. Staff A+,. Great patio and dining room. Will definitely be going back. Dinner in the evening on the patio next to the fireplace."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place, especially if you can get a table outside.  The atmosphere on the patio was terrific.

I took my family and we had a great night.  They all got different kinds of tacos and I got a great ahi tuna sandwich.  The short rib tacos melted in your mouth and the portion sizes for all of the entrees were outstanding--surprisingly big.  I don't think any of us actually finished our whole meal.

Service was great.  Wine list was fine, not amazing.  Had a nice rose on a hot night.

Absolutely love the finishing touch of the free cookies on our way out."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere on the patio. Good salad. Don't bother with what they refer to as ceviche"}
{"text":"Yes this place has a decent patio but having a breeze blow little tree leaves in to all your drinks every minute gets old.

 I ordered the Howie burger (medium well) with fries.  The fries were floppy and under cooked, the burger was over cooked and the caramelized onions had way way to much balsamic vinegar so they were super sweet.  Which all in all was a waste of $$ and calories. We also ordered deviled eggs as an appetizer which had sweet relish in them which did not work either.

Bottom line- This place banks on there lame \"waterfront\" ( mud canal) atmosphere to serve crappy over priced food.

OOHHHH and when leaving and having my car 75% pulled out of if its spot some valet punk does not wait and whips around me knowing I am leaving.    Who has valet when you can park yourself 10 feet away?!?  stupid"}
{"text":"Delicious Times Ten!
Right when you walk in, you can see the treats being cooked up in the open kitchen - as you snack on a sea salt chocolate chip cookie.

Sooo yummy!

I got the short rib tacos and it came with the kale salad people rave about.  The kale salad was really good, but I'm not sure I could eat an entire plate of it.  Just as a side was perfect.

My tacos were great. The sauce was very interesting.  Hard to describe, but delish either way.

They had a great patio and bar area.  It seems like it would be a great spot for dinner or happy hour.  

Next time Im I Phoenix, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious.  My gf and I had the prime rib and rotisserie chicken.  Both awesome meals in the taste department.  Food arrived lightning fast.  Server Allie was awesome.  Very attentive and never overbearing.  Red velvet cake for dessert.  Everything perfect!  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  It's a winner all around."}
{"text":"I travel all around the US and this is one of the best airport restaurants. It's soooo good. The pulled pork and tortillas is amazing so fresh. I'm very picky and this place always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Have gone to Chelsea's kitchen twice-once on business and once on a little vaca to Spring Training to watch the Tribe. This place is perpetually busy, but for good reason. Excellent staff-starting with the valet guys and going right through the wait staff. Really one of the best outdoor dining venues around with an added benefit-the food is good. I'm a sucker for deviled eggs app and the ceviche. Very fresh and flavorful. Nothing too exotic for my entree-the salmon-but done to perfection. A side note-great people watching-the Scottsdale set hangs here so you get some great entertainment seeing the characters, a few with more money than good taste!"}
{"text":"We brought a client here for lunch, and it was perfect. The ambiance, the service, and the food.....it was all spot on! I would highly reccomend this place for lunch, and I have to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and the servers are friendly.  Food is so so.

They have deviled eggs and I always try to order when I see them on a menu.  These were nice with bacon but flavor was traditional.  Not bad but not worth buying again.  Had the green chile burger - those are always my favorite.  They are not my favorite when you take a burger and just toss a chile on it.   You can't be bothered to take the giant pickles off the burger?  Sure I can take them off myself but I like to eat my food the way the chef intended.  If this is it, the chef missed the mark. 

All the rave reviews I had to try the Kale salad.  Sure it's kale - woot woot - but it's a bland kale salad.  

Fun place to hang but so are a lot of places.  Maybe I needed to eat a cookie."}
{"text":"I \"did\" lunch yesterday at Chelsea's Kitchen with Nikki B from Dallas, Stephanie I from San Fran, and a new foodie friend.  I chose Chelsea's because of my previous experiences there - CK has always been a go-to place with a consistently fun atmosphere, attentive service, and delicious food.  Yesterday was no exception!

We started with an order of shrimp ceviche for the table. I've had it before and it was just as delicious yesterday as I remember... I love all of the ingredients (avocados, tomatoes, jicama and lime juice) and the lightly salted tortilla chips it comes with are the perfect compliment.  I ordered the Del Mar Salad (gulf shrimp & jumbo lump crab on 
shredded iceberg with avocado, pico de gallo and olives).  The others at the table had the short rib tacos (see Stephanie's pic above), the ahi tacos, and the brussel sprout salad... I was full after eating all of my food and tasting some of theirs.  But when the table ordered a red velvet cake for dessert (see pic above), I looked at it and I knew I need to have just one bite.  Mmmm - it was heavenly!

Our waiter, Stephen, was pretty heavenly too... :)

I am sure I will return again and again - thanks CK!"}
{"text":"If you have to be stuck at PHX Sky Harbor for an extended period of time, I hope you're stuck in Terminal 4 so that you can make your way to Chelsea's Kitchen... or I guess if you are stuck in another terminal with plenty of time to spare, you should make your way to Chelsea's Kitchen.  You'll thank me later!

CK is located outside of the actual security / gate area, so anyone can go whether you're flying or not.  Of course, I wouldn't make a special trip to the airport to eat here, but this is one of your best bets if you do have to be at the airport.  

The original Chelsea's has never steered me wrong, but I feel like you can't have expectations quite as high for second locations at airports... that is, until I came here. 

Friendly hostesses, very attentive service, and food that is *almost* as fabulous as the original.  I went with an Arnold Palmer, the Del Mar Salad and a side of asparagus on my recent visit.  I received several drink refills and many visits from staff checking-in on me to make sure I had everything I needed.  

I also set-up shop for a bit and worked while I was there, and didn't feel rushed at all.

Airport dining at it's finest right here... enjoy!"}
{"text":"For dinner, my friend JB wanted something reasonably healthy and wasn't overly anxious about the price, as long as it was casual and allowed for conversation. She also mentioned recent cravings for rare-cooked tuna. Remembering the tasty tuna tartar appetizer I once had there and the tuna burger I'd seen on their menu, I took us to Chelsea's Kitchen (CK).

Chelsea's Kitchen is one of Craig and Kris DeMarco and Bob Lynn's several brainchildren that make up the LGO Hospitality family, which includes Arcadia's trendy places to be seen, Le Grande Orange Grocery, Le Grande Orange Pizzeria, Postino Cafe, and Radio Milano (one of two branches, the second being in Pomona, California). I'm definitely not a scenester, and CK tends to cater to the slightly older, not-so-trendy-but-still-in-the-know crowd who wants a good meal and a low-key atmosphere.

My work group goes there regularly for lunch, and I've liked every meal I've had there. I'll put a warning in about the Howie Burger--after awhile, the bottom bun gets soggy. The regular burgers hold up much better. The restaurant's lightly honeyed cottage cheese side is a nice alternative to fries. 

Their menu is straightforward and to the point--no frills, no garnishes. The interior is the same. Hardwood tabletops, a few giant, yet minimalist stone pots for fake floral arrangements. Seats to lounge in. Nothing soft and flowing, but comfortable all the same. A band of windows, shaded by the roof's overhang, enwraps the dining room, bringing in comfy ambient light. That night, the comfy lighting was dim, but not so dim that you'd need a flashlight to read the menu and get a good look at your plate. Everything's clean, right down to the design lines. Even the busy open-view kitchen's stainless steel gives off a well-scrubbed look.

The hostess greeted us with a smile. I saw folks on the front patio and suggested we sit outside, too, remembering how loud the dining room's music can get and how close the quarters are. They sat us at the rear patio, along the canal, which I think was nicer than the front would've been. A very short time later, our waitress arrived to take our drink order, and we both ordered lemonade.

The service the whole night was quick and attentive, which was nice as most of the tables inside and out were seated. The servers weren't obtrusive while we had our animated conversation over our meal. We weren't waiting long before our lemonades and glasses of water arrived. The lemonade was cold and fresh, though after a few sips through a straw, some of the pithy stuff at the bottom started sending a face-puckering, bitter wash over my tongue. Unfortunately, there was no sweetener at the table, so I took only occasional sips. At the least, it was refreshing. And while I didn't love it, but they were quick and liberal with both lemonade and water refills at my table, topping us off whenever we got close to half empty.

Looking over the menu, the first thing I pointed out was the tuna tartar with guacamole and tortilla chips, and we decided to split the appetizer. The tortilla chips served with our appetizer chips were pale, fresh, crispy, and salty--all the components of a very addictive food. The only petty complaint was the one single chip that was just a bit chewy. The tuna tartar and avocado accompaniment was nicely done. It was simply seasoned, which is essential for letting the buttery tuna shine through. Avocado and tuna are a classic combination for a reason--they work well together, with the avocado buffering the fish (not fishy) taste, and the tuna polishing the avocado's taste. The crisp, thin chips gave a nice, brief crunch without overwhelming the tuna's and avocado's texture. Unfortunately, the speedy service worked against us, and it was just a few minutes between arrivals of appetizer and entree.

Sometimes, the skinny seasoned fries are limp, but the seasoning is consistently tasty. The tuna burger was beautiful, served with the top bun and all the accompanying fresh veggies to the side--lettuce, thinly sliced tomatoes, fans of avocado slices. I put the two together, sliced it in half, and had to give it the smackdown to make sure I could wrap my maw around it. The burger was perfect--moist, flavorful, scrumptious, and rare. The bun was fresh and soft. The glaze was awesome--slightly sweet and tangy, and the burger's edges were crisped, offering a nice contrast to the soft middle.

I wanted a place to tuck away and have good food. The open dining room where you can see the face of every other diner doesn't allow that, but there are plenty of patio niches that make close conversation easy, making the restaurant good for groups, despite the tight spaces between tables you sometimes have to navigate, but even better for a few friends if you sit outside. You probably won't find yourself daydreaming about the fare, but it's good and consistent enough to choose in a pinch when you don't want to blow a load of dough on a really good tuna burger."}
{"text":"Free cookie!!!!!

My wife and I decided to try Chelsea's Kitchen for our Sunday brunch date. I think we got there just in time since we didn't have to wait for a table.

I ordered a french pressed coffee soon as I got to the table. It was perfect to start my brunch. 

Since we didn't have an idea on what to order, we just asked for recommendations. The server was so knowledgable of the menu. She gave us recommendations on every part of the menu. We decided to order tuna tartare & guacamole for starters, Chilaquiles and Short ribs for our entree.

The tartare & guacamole was big enough to share. The guacamole was placed on top of the tuna tartare. I would have wanted a little more seasoning on my guacamole and maybe a little bit of a kick. Maybe some chili peppers would do. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. I just had better tuna tartare and guacamole.

The short ribs at $20+ was tender, juicy and full of flavour. It was served on top of mashed potatoes and some grilled carrots. Again, it was around $20+... I can have the same good meal for $12 and still get the same satisfaction.

The chilaquiles was a different story. I think it's appropriately priced for the size and the flavour. I enjoyed the crunch of the corn tortilla, the balance of the chicken flavour and the compliment of the spicy sauce. It was original. At least it was the first time I had a mexican lasagna made with corn tortilla, chicken and spicy sauce.

Overall, Chelsea's kitchen had its pros and cons. The pros outweighs the cons. It may be pricey, it may have an ordinary menu but if you dig in just a little bit more... you might find some good food.

I will still come back to Chelsea's. Maybe next time i'll try the short ribs taco. The next table ordered it and it looked amazing.

By the way, they give free cookies on your way out. It was really good. Maybe the best thing I ate at Chelsea's that day were the cookies. Take note, THAT DAY. Maybe it would be different the next time I visit.

{"text":"Made my first trip here last week after hearing great things about it for over a year.  We were winding down after a 3-day business meeting with lots of out of town guests from LA.  My first impression was WOW!, what a fantastic location and a cool setting.  We sat in the back patio that has really nice feel and good overhead cover for warmer days.  

I immediately ordered the Basil Gimlet and it was a great starter cocktail, light and really refreshing.  

We then ordered the Chicken Nachitos as a so called starter.  This thing came out piled high and full of chicken breast meat.  It was great and a bit much for a couple of people.  You may want to split a meal if only two people share this.  It was delicious even though they could have been a bit more generous with the salsa that came on the side.

Finally we ordered the Shredded Kale and Quinoa salad with the rotisserie Jidori chicken and the Smoked Roasted Jidori chicken with the Market Vegetables.  

The Shredded Kale and Quinoa salad and the Market Vegetables were clearly the stars of both meals.  The Market Vegetables consisted of flaked Brussels Sprouts leaves rubbed in olive oil and crisped slightly with butternut squash.  It was really really delicious with great texture.  The same for the Kale and Quinoa.  I love a good kale but throw in some healthy protein and season properly and I may just copy it... and I have already with mixed results.  
My only real issue with the meal was that the Jidori Chicken fell a little flat.  It wasn't well seasoned as I would expect with many normal rotisserie chickens but I expected this chicken with the fancy name and the word \"Smoke\" attached to it to be elevated and it didn't quite hit the mark.  I was there with several others that seemed to love their meals but I didn't have any of those.  

I will return because of the atmosphere and the great service but I will avoid the \"Jidori\" chicken.  Definitely recommend visiting if not for the locale and atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"Great for business lunch, but pretty pricey for casual dining.

Howie Burger (14) - epic and delicious.  That havarti cheese is amazing.
Green Chile Burger (15) - very disappointing.  There was no flavor, thank god for ketchup.

Service was spectacular!  The waitress was sweet, friendly, attentive and wonderful.  I was in love!"}
{"text":"Another great night at Chelsea's kitchen.  The tuna and guacamole appetizer was amazing and fresh.  My main was the halibut feature with market veggies and although the halibut itself was simple in preparation the vegetables that were on the side made the dish as a whole great!  The halibut was also not over cooked so that made my night!  My son had the prime rib which he loved; the rest of my party had fried chicken and the short rib tacos (a known favorite)!  Service was efficient and friendly by Erin who had great patience with our party.  Even the two year old gave two thumbs up!  The patio was the place to be right now and we really appreciated the fireplace! Thanks again!  We will see you again very soon!"}
{"text":"Heard the food was great so I took a party of 7 there this morning. Was told 1hr 115 wait for outdoors (had Chicago visitors). Checked in with hostess numerous times. After 1.5 hours and $200 bar bill....still no table available AND no idea of availability!! Even though other large groups were sat who arrived after us. I just wish they were up front and said\" it will be a least on hour and if other connected folks show up, you are SOL. Very unprofessional and really upsetting and embarrassing. Forced to leave after 100 minutes to go find another place to eat.

{"text":"The brussels sprout salad was divine!  Sooooo good....but the best was yet to come.   I ordered the prime rib with a side order of mashed potatoes and cauliflower with Rosemary for dinner.  The prime rib was good...wasn't the best I've ever had but it was good.  The mashed taters on the other hand was absolutely delicious! The best that I've ever had at a restaurant!  Really enjoyed the cauliflower as well.  Topped dinner off with homemade strawberry gelato for dessert!  The best airport dinner ever!"}
{"text":"My close friend had been wanting to try this place for a while now, so we came here tonight for a double date. I ordered the basil gemlit but I wanted to add blackberries to it and the bar was happy to oblige my request. The drink was really good. I love having fresh basil in my drinks because I feel like it really makes the drink extra refreshing and takes it to the next level. My boyfriend had one consistent complaint with his beers and it was that they were poured about only about 3/4 a glass with a really large head. He wasn't too happy about that. To start, the four of us shared the tuna tartar, which was a tuna tartar with guacamole on top served with fresh tortilla chips. The fish was cut to a good size and was super fresh. The guacamole was creamy and was perfectly simple that went well with the tuna. The chips seemed to be homemade. They were the perfect thickness and were salted the right amount. I highly recommmed this appetizer. For dinner, my boyfriend and I split the Ahi tuna burger and the short rib tacos. The Ahi burger was extremely, EXTREMELY salty. I was so hungry so I ate it but my boyfriend refused to eat his part. I was under the impression for some reason that this burger was going to be a seared ahi steak but it was definitely a gross ground patty. It came with a spicy mayo saucy, fresh avocado, lettuce, and a choice of side. We went with the french fries. The Ahi burger besides being really salty also seemed to all be one texture. Avoid the Ahi burger at all costs. The french fries were bomb! They were crispy with a soft center and they had a slightly sweet and slightly salty seasoning on top. It was a very nice mixture. The short rib tacos were amazing! I wish we ordered two orders of this instead. These tacos are self assemble. They come with pico de gallo, guacamole, shredded lettuce, a dressed chopped kale salad, a tangy tart salsa, and of course the short ribs and the mini homemade tortillas. I put everything on my mini tortilla and it was sooooo good!!! They initail give you 3 mini tortillas but you can and probably will request more. I definitely recommend trying the tacos here. If you don't get the short rib tacos, definitely try one of the other tacos. The atmosphere outside was really nice. The trees had cute little lights up in them that made the patio area super cute and quaint. Service came with a smile."}
{"text":"I can't explain how amazing the service was. The food was incredible, and the ambience was incredibly opulent, but the service was what made the experience more than surreal."}
{"text":"Great option if you have time - I waited 15+ minutes to get my food to-go. When it finally came out, it was delicious - just glad I wasn't in a rush to get to my flight."}
{"text":"I first went to Chelsea's Kitchen with my dad. 

As I've said many times, my dad lives for the latest and greatest in fine dining and this time he picked Chelsea's Kitchen.

CHELSEA'S KITCHEN

Chelsea's Kitchen is owned by parent company LGO Hospitality.

The name \"La Grande Orange\" (LGO) was inspired by the creators looking through historical books on Southern California.

A pictorial review of the vast citrus groves that provide the United States with much of it's fruit were always part of California. Inspired by that piece of Americana, they pay reverence to those good times, positive vibes, and winning spirit.

LGO Hospitality includes, The Misfit, LGO Grocery & Pizzeria, Chelsea's Kitchen, LGO Café, The Luggage Room, Ingo's Tasty Food, Ingo's Tasty Diner, LGO Bake Shop, Grateful Spoon Gelato, and Buck & Rider.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

My dad and I were seated at a lovely table on the patio. 

My only complaint about the patio is the amount of leaves that fall into the food and drinks, but hey, that's not really a problem, is it?

We ordered some drinks. I tried the Diego Rivera, which was Frida Kahlo Blanco Tequila, Grapefruit juice, and fresh Thyme. Nom Nom Super Yummy!

I had the paella and my dad had the daily catch. 

OMG my paella was YUMMY and HUGE! My meal included an extremely generous portion of seafood and fresh sausages.

The staff has been WELL selected, which speaks to the professionalism of the management.

The staff was not OVERLY friendly, which I appreciated, and they had their timing down; always around when we needed something, yet not hovering either.

CONCLUSION

I had an incredible meal and pleasant stay at Chelsea's Kitchen.

I will definitely be back!

5/5 RECOMMEND

OF NOTE

*Parking is a bit hectic. We used the Valet.

{"text":"Chelsea's is a welcome addition to Central Phoenix. They serve delicious takes of Comfort Food. I had been there several times and always wondered why anyone would pay so much for the tacos. Everything else seemed fair though their portions are small for most things. I didn't get that it was more like fajitas. I had the Lobster Tacos that were the nightly special (around $35.) Let me tell you it was worth it. The Lobster meat was huge chunks and very fresh. They make their tortillas in house. I have honestly liked everything I have ever had here. The only negative is the Valet Parking, otherwise it would be 5 stars. I personally can't stand Valet and especially where there is plenty of room. This place is a regular for me."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to for a casual dinner out or happy hour. The food is amazing and locally sourced, and the restaurant just has a really friendly and open atmosphere.  The Prickly Pear Margarita is always delicious, paired with the Chicken Nachitos is heaven on earth. The Howie Burger is what I usually get. All of their burger meat is ground in house for service which I love! Taco platters are another entree option, I've tried all of them and they are all amazing. You can't leave without dessert and Chelsea's Kitchen's Key Lime Pie is irresistible to me. Just the right amount of tart with a huge layer of whipped cream accompanied by strawberry sorbet that perfectly completes your meal. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Chelsea's had been highly recommended but unfortunately didn't live up to the hype. The chicken nachos were good but the two different types of tacos we had were just ok and way overpriced! The server also had a bit of an attitude. Don't think we'll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I have never had better swordfish tacos.  I am a fish taco addict, so that's huge!  The service was mediocre, but the food and the ambience is well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Chelsea's is amazing. It is like an upscale LA restaurant without the snobbery, and with much more delicious food. The veg nut burger was absolutely delightful, light but still filling. The cole slaw salad it was served with was also quite flavorful. The meat-eating bf thoroughly enjoyed the porkchops, which appeared tender and juicy. The food was amazing, the customer service was great, and the prices were modest. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, the décor an lighting set a great atmosphere for a casual, yet classy dining experience. A definite must-try!"}
{"text":"We found Chelsea's Kitchen on Yelp when looking for a place to have lunch on a Wednesday.  When we arrived, we were greeted with valet parking.  Inside, it was a busy lunch rush at noon, but we were seated in about 10 minutes.  The menu is small, but the choices are incredible.  

Mom and I started with sharing the Brussel Sprout salad (which we thought would have marinated brussel sprouts - but was actual brussels pulled apart to make the \"lettuce\".  It was dressed in a smooth dressing with nuts, dried cranberries and blueberries, parmesean cheese sliced really thin.  Dad had the Del Mar Salad which was covered big chunks of crab and cut up shrimp.  The dressing was sort of tangy, very south of the border.  He said, \"This is the best salad I have ever had in my entire life!\"  WOW!
Mom and Dad shared the French Dip.  Mom liked the seasoned fries, saying they weren't too salty/seasoned.  I had the Swordfish Tacos.  The swordfish was grilled and cut into pieces and served with pico de gallo, guacamole, small corn tortillas and a refreshing melon salad that was dressed with cilantro and lime juice ($16).
The check comes on a square white plate that has an old fashioned check printed on it.  Mom picked up one for $15.
On our way out, we were offered a soft chocolate chip cookie topped with sea salt.  I was really grossed out at the thought, but it was the best little sweet/salty treat I have ever eaten!  The salt just went really well with the sweetness of the cookie!
Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious food!  Looking forward to returning with the husband!"}
{"text":"First of all.  March right over to the hostess and put your name in for the outside patio.  The back yard setting in this Arcadia restaurant is seemingly perfect all year round, with their giant oaks (?) for shade during the sunny months, and a large, wood-burning, brick chiminea for those ten-or-so cold days of the year.  The outside is outrageously cozy.

And when you're back here, it doesn't really matter all that much how *good* the food is.  Oh, please believe, its pretty damn good and cooked very well, but in this setting, a Betty Crocker Mug-o-Lunch would taste like a Thomas Keller creation.

I've spent birthdays and NYE and Friday night, pre-festivities dinners here and each has been unique with varying menus ... something I've always appreciated; progressive restaurants who employ confident chefs willing to expand their craft without alienating their core patrons.  

I won't recommend a dish.  Its all good.  The desserts are charming too [read: the sundae].

What I am recommending to you is the setting.  You can't go awry."}
{"text":"I've been going here for lunch meetings for over 3 years. The food has always been good and so has the service. I was recently there and forgot my wallet with $200+ cash in it. After realizing I left it there several days later, I picked it up today and all of the cash was still there. Needless to say, I'll continue to eat here and support this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is the perfect Sunday brunch location.  Brunch is the best meal.  Why is that?  Because you can drink and eat breakfast at the same time.  You can't drink at breakfast . . . that is frowned upon.  You sort of can't eat breakfast food at lunch or dinner, unless you are at Denny's.    And I only go to Denny's after a night of partying . . . but back to Chelsea's Kitchen.  Chelsea's Kitchen is the best place in town to go for brunch.  It may not be the best thing since sliced bread but I can't imagine going anywhere else for brunch.

Meal:  I got the hash, a mimosa, sangria, and coffee.  The fiancé got veggie omelet and she went with a bloody mary.

Taste:  The drinks are great!  The hash was a slight disappointment as the beed was a little dry.  The fiancé's dish was great.  Hopefully next time they don't run out of the ingredients to make eggs Benny. 7 out of 10.

Value:  It is slightly on the price side.  The drink sizes are generous.  I feel that given the taste of the meal and the portion sizes, the value is above average.  4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  One of the things that I rarely see at a restaurant is waitresses helping each other at and managers who are willing to lend a helping hand when it gets busy.  That helps make things run efficiently and minimizes delays.  Chelsea's Kitchen did both of these things and the service we received was the highlight of the meal.  10 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  We sat outside.  Leaves were falling.  Fire place was going.  It was a perfect day to eat outside.  The overall decor is clean, classic,  and timeless without appearing to be stale. 5 out of 5.

Overall:  I think Chelsea's Kitchen is one of those places you can make it a weekly staple.  It can become a weekly tradition.  I recommend getting there at around 10 am or so on Sundays.  Any earlier its packed and going later just takes the fun out of having brunch. 26 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Super and Liza our server is fantastic.
Salmon was superb, don't miss out on the Deviled Egg App.
The patio is really enjoyable this time of the year.
Like the salted chocolate chip cookies as u leave the wonderful dinning establishment.
A must visit when in the area."}
{"text":"For April's Breakfast Club UYE, Chelsea's Kitchen was the place picked, it was a beautiful Saturday morning, so we sat out on the patio.

After checking out the menu I went with the Chelsea's Eggs Benedict, they were made with LGO's English muffins, if you ever been to LGO, then you already know these muffins are amazing and bigger than a normal muffin, so I asked for extra hollandaise sauce, just so every bite was covered in goodness. 

When my order came, not only was it saucy, it also came with a little extra more of hollandaise sauce, it was nice to see they were not stingy with the sauce.  When I ordered it I didn't ask or pay attend to see if the meal came with potatoes, I just assumed potatoes would come with it, because in my head, breakfast potatoes and hollandaise sauce are amazing together too. But no, it comes with a small bowl of fresh fruit. Next time I know to order a side of potatoes.

Also not on the brunch menu is the Chicken Nachitos, but you can in fact order them at brunch, if you haven't had them, you really should, and there is plenty to share.
 
Another great meal at Chelsea's Kitchen, I'm sure I'll be back around soon."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday.  This place is packed, thank goodness we got there early.  I loved the environment, food, and service.  EXCELLENT!

Eggs Benedict - Muffins, sauce, eggs, spinach, and Canadian bacon - they all blended together and melted in my mouth.  SO SO GOOD!

Roasted Potatoes - Roasted to perfection and seasoned just spot on.  

Chocolate Parva - Flourless chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  HELLO!  Melt me, I have tasted a slice of heaven!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever.  \"Chelseas Hotcakes\".  Sante Fe Eggs were a great combo of eggs, pork, kale, guacamole.  outdoor patio with fireplace is really nice too."}
{"text":"I travel through Phoenix airport frequently and although this is outside of security it's definitely my favorite spot. Salads are good. Guacamole is good. In fact I may have had the best tacos I've ever tasted right here. The only thing that doesn't make it a 5 is that it's outside of security. Bad airport design. Maybe not their fault but it means I can't use it as much as I'd like."}
{"text":"For an airport place, pretty nice to have good warm dinner and good crisp white wine!"}
{"text":"Was just cruising yelp and I came across this restaurant.  It's on a whole new level of yum! Can't wait."}
{"text":"Fantastic food-got the paella and salmon dip. So yummy. And their drinks are on point- the Diego Rivera is a tequila and grapefruit cocktail and perfect in every way. Sitting outside in the evening is a beautiful atmosphere with the heat lamps, lights and massive fireplace."}
{"text":"Birthday party for wife. Reservations for 12 @ 6pm...Nope 8 people at 7:30. Hope it gets better.... Beyond the reservations being messed up, and serve being a bit slow, food was good! It was restaurant week so maybe that was the downfall of service. The Roasted Prime Rib was awesome!

UPDATE: I was contacted a few short hours after my review and they are truly committed to service! Based on the offer they have extended to my wife and I, we will be back. 2nd review to come........

Ok, went and used the very generous offer from Chelsea's. Service was much more improved. Food was still really good. Food was never the issue, it was service. Great friendly, fast, no issues. Must have just been a fluke the last time. Will be back! Thanks Chelsea's for making this what it should have been....a great dinner to start the night!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite patio in the valley.  I absolutely love meeting friends for a great brunch, lunch, or even dinner on their patio.  Their food is always very good and the drinks never disappoint.  Try the white sangria with brunch- full of good fruit and a fabulous way to get your day going.  
No, it isn't a \"cheap\" place, but ya get what you pay for.  Sometimes when you want good food, you are going to pay a little bit extra.  

I always leave Chelsea's a happy customer!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful, very open and inviting. Not only was our food delicious and all the staff that we encountered amazing, they truly went above and beyond. My order was accidentally put in incorrectly so our dinner was a little delayed, we didn't mind at all because we were enjoying a bottle of wine and I work in hospitality so understand the demand. I would have been okay with the way things were, however now I am extremely pleased and will absolutely recommend Chelsea's Kitchen to all of my guests. The chef himself came to apologize for the delay, the server apologized again and stated he wanted our food to be just right, and also took care of the cost of our entrees, and the bartender was great in ensuring the follow through on this and that we were satisfied. My only regret is that I didn't now get everyone's name, only our bartender/waitress I believe it was Joshenay (sorry for the butchering of the name). Everyone was so friendly and accommodating, they are the reason I will be back. And not for free food because I would pay full price for that delicious filet any day. Thank you for a wonderful first experience at Chelsea's Kitchen I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. We love the ahi tuna tacos. Good atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Outlets under the bar.  Not just one, all around the bar. So helpful! Good atmosphere, music isn't too loud, seats are comfortable.  To top it off the service has been great.  The server was readily available, apparently my food came out incorrectly the first time but I didn't even notice because I got the food quickly.  Fries were great, spicy and sweet my fav. Manager and chef came by; I almost forgot I was in the airport! Thx Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Usually, airport food is something most travelers don't look forward to, but whenever I'm in town in Phoenix and I'm flying out of Sky Harbor, I look forward to eating at Chelsea's Kitchen.  The funny thing is that I didn't realize that their sister location is another restaurant in my neighborhood out in Pasadena, CA but it's a totally different name so that's my excuse of being oblivious.  The food is almost identical and the sea salt chocolate chip cookies didn't even tip me off until somebody pointed it out to me.

The short rib tacos and also the ahi tuna tacos are both awesome.  I love the kale & quinoa salad that comes as a side.  Their french fries are also really good since they season it well.  My coworkers also seemed to really enjoy the burgers and the deviled eggs.  
As previously mentioned, don't forget the chocolate chip cookies they have out on both sides of the check in counter.  

We usually come in a fairly big group at times and we haven't had an issue finding tables that can seat us."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here tonight. Service spot on as were the old fashions!  Deviled eggs with bacon were our starter, then prime rib, rib eye and short rib tacos were delicious. Serving size was large. Great experience!!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had some time to kill before my flight and stopped in for an early dinner. The menu is fairly short, but the short rib tacos sounded good, and I was not wrong. I was expecting three little tacos, so I was surprised to get a generous slab of meat with 4 homemade corn tortillas and fresh guacamole and pico de gallo on the side. The portion size and the high quality of the food explained the $26 price tag. I'm not the first reviewer to say how delicious the short ribs are here. Probably the best I've had anywhere. If I lived in Phoenix I think I would make a trip to the airport just to eat here."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last night for the first time and I was totally impressed.  After a drink at the bar I was seated and ordered a diet coke and Del Mar Salad.  Within 5 minutes I was served and everything was perfect.  My diet coke was delivered in a can with a cup of ice - a little quirky but a nice break from cheap fountain pop.  The shrimp and shredded crab meat was fresh and tasty.  I'll be back.

Complimentary valet was a nice touch.  Patio dining is an option too."}
{"text":"Best restaurant and best ambience. ... love to visit again for nice dinner. I recommend to whoever is on a business trip"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Short ribs are great and the ahi taco are yummy.  Everything we have had has been great."}
{"text":"Last year I had the most amazing Eggs Benedict I have ever encountered. Chelsea's kitchen used mouthwatering shredded pork and a lemon poppy hollandaise instead of Canadian Bacon an a standard hollandaise.  It was to die for (see pic). Recently however, I have discovered that their new menu has reverted back to the standard eggs benedict which is a horrible shame. Why would one choose to go from exceptional to run of the mill? Boo Chelsea's Kitchen.. Boo"}
{"text":"Great spot to have dinner at a full-service restaurant in the Phoenix Airport! We had great service, yummy food (southwestern crab and shrimp Louie salad, short rib tacos, and French dip sammies) and good beer. Free chocolate chip cookies on the way out too."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for the incredible food and service. 

The food was great; I got the Brussels sprout salad. So yummy. 

And definitely do not skip desert. The red velvet cake is to die for. I still dream about it. 

Love this place."}
{"text":"Great valet, great friendly employees.

Very sunny, happy place to have lunch. Even on a week day it was busy. The staff was very attentive and made the trip very quick and easy.

Great food. Great chips and guacamole, and swordfish tacos!"}
{"text":"I love it here!  We flew into Phoenix and had brunch at Chelsea's Kitchen before heading to Sedona on a Sunday.  They have free valet service and we didn't have to wait for a table at all. The service was great, our server was very attentive and helped with recommendations.  I got the white sangria which is so tasty, it has got to have cake flavored vodka in it or something.  It's heavenly! 
We ordered the short rib tacos which were so much fun to eat.  The plate had shells, short ribs, guacamole, pico, and kale slaw.  The guacamole was some of the best I had on our trip.  The slaw went well with the tacos but I preferred it as a tiny salad.  We also got he chilaquiles which were great.  We wanted to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the Food, wine, and desserts! The ambience is nice too and the chocolate chip cookies with sea salt at the end of your meal as you walk out the door is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have lunch and dinner. I have been there multiple times and the service and ambience is top notch. I love how they have the salted chocolate chip cookies after your meal as you leave to grab."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been here twice for after work drinks. They have an amazing Happy Hour drink menu but unfortunately no food on this menu. We have tried most of their appetizers and thoroughly enjoyed the deviled eggs and chicken nachos. I can't wait to come back and try their dinner menu because I am sure it is just as spectacular and well thought our as their drinks & appetizers. 
On a beautiful day, the patio is the perfect spot!"}
{"text":"This place has been added to my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Very friendly and accommodating staff. I like everything from the look, to the feel, especially the food, and of course the smell of this place. Between everyone in the party we had half the dam menu on the table so we all shared a little so we could all try everything. On the menu itself they have lots of great dishes but I will tell you its all about the short rib meat or short rib taco platter. These short ribs are unreal, and definitely there go to item on the menu. You get a huge portion of meat! So smokey and freakin yum, that's all I can say. The special of the night is what I got. Halibut with a vanilla butter sauce and potato fennel puree. The sauce was so good. I noticed myself saying yum out-loud after every bite. Totally comin back soon. This place does breakfast and I will be checking it out. Two things I did not like. First the parking lot is small and 25% is self parking and 75% of it is what they call free valet, which is bull shit. Now if you don't want to walk to the parking garage under the building next to the restaurant you now have to tip a guy that gets your car that is no more then 50 feet away. I feel insulted and taking advantage of when I have to pay to park when I have to pay for the food that brought me here. I don't have to tip these valet guys is what the host tells me. I'm not that asshole but i wanted to be. The second thing was the dessert menu was limited and nothing stands out. So we passed and went elsewhere for that. So next time I cruz by and there is a open space in the free parking area I will dip in for some good eats!!!"}
{"text":"After a five hour road trip from Los Angeles to Phoenix, Chelsea's Kitchen  was our first stop and the best stop ever!!  The ambiance was beautiful, the service was on point, the food was fresh and delicious, and the salty/sweet chocolate chip cookies were savory!!  We will definitely be back on our next visit.

Chelsea's Kitchen's restaurant reputation precedes them!  Keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"I was very surprisingly underwhelmed by Chelsea's Kitchen. 

We walked in and the restaurant smells amazing with the open kitchen and I really dig the atmosphere. Our first impression was that our server- Katie McD- seemed kind of flighty and not very attentive, so that is never a good start. She wasn't very friendly and didn't even attempt to build a rapport with the table. She kept forgetting small things that should be second nature for servers. I ordered my iced tea, and had to wait until she came back with our appetizer to get a straw. (The same happened later to my cousin after she finished her sangria and ordered another drink) I then asked for sweetener and she turned around, grabbed it from another table and then put it in front of me saying 'They weren't using it.\".. kind of awkward. 

It has been my experience that great food can really overshadow bad service. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed once our meals came out. Maybe I had too high of hopes for Chelsea's Kitchen, after all I have had an ongoing love affair with La Grande Orange for years. I had the Dixie Pan Fried Chicken and it was just okay. The first thing I sampled was my mashed potatoes.. which were very lukewarm. Same for the mixed veggies (which were otherwise quite tasty)/ We waited about 5 minutes for Katie to come back and check so I could let her know, but got bored of it, and finished eating my now even colder plate. 
They have a good portion size, not too much and the price would have been okay if my food had been served correctly (or even corrected). My meal came with a cinnamon roll which was really yummy and so was the red velvet cake we had for dessert. Definitely the best parts of my meal. (Dessert probably would have been better with coffee... if our server had been around to take our order..) 

I kind of go back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but I feel like 3 stars would be saying I'd go back and give it another go... and I doubt I will. The stars say it all: Meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Wow, very good. Nice decor and service. Surprisingly great food for an airport. Had the beef short rib tacos --crazy good. If you ever near terminal 4 on the Phoenix airport definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Good food. The staff at the airport could probably relax a little bit. I mean, come on, it's the airport. Sky Harbor airport. Just bring it down a notch and let people enjoy their moment for a second. 

The one in Phoenix is alright. You can actually feel, in your soul, everyone taking pictures on instagram though. I'm kind-of over that part of it."}
{"text":"The food was great! However, the service was not great. I was with a party of seven in for brunch. Our server had no personality. Tried walking away when we were telling her we were ready to order.... Spilled tea on one person without apologizing, mimosa into another persons plate without acknowledging it, overflowed a glass with mimosa and let it spill right between two people... I could keep going. She then dropped the check... Never asking if we wanted refills. After we paid, we never saw her again. Just because we paid did not mean we were done. We are all really good tippers usually... Some have worked or do work in the industry... so she lost out on making some good money on our table."}
{"text":"Ceviche appetizer is the bomb-
Service is phenomenal and fast
Del mar salad and surf and turf tacos are as good as anything you would find on the CA coast... 
Great place to get your grub on"}
{"text":"Stuck in Phoenix, I got a soup and salad to go. They were slammed, and the manager and hostess took care of me. They couldn't have been more helpful and nice. Kudos to the team there and the food was simple and great. Brussel sprouts salad and chicken soup. This is a must if you are in Terminal 4."}
{"text":"Oh Chelsea, I think I'm in love. 

From the impeccable service to the divine food, what a great place to have Sunday brunch! 
It started off with the complimentary sea-salt chocolate chip cookie, and continued with the fresh french press coffee and Chelsea's eggs benedict. 
They pressed the coffee right on the table, and the aroma of grounds made the visit that much more memorable. 
We also ordered a pitcher of sangria to share, and would highly recommend it. Hey, it's 5oclock somewhere. 

To top it off, our server took the extra time to split our checks individually. 
Our waters were always full and she came out of nowhere with ninja-like speed to refill our sangrias as well. 

The restaurant offers great patio seating, and plays relaxing music to accompany you on your meal. I felt like I was transported to a tropical paradise...."}
{"text":"We finally got to try Chelsea's Kitchen today. The food was delicious. I absolutely loved the patio seating. 

Unfortunately it started raining and our table was the only one not really covered by the trees. After I noticed my salad plate filling up with water we asked to move over to the bar. Our server was super sweet about it and got us moved right away. 

This is where the three star rating comes in. We overheard the two bartenders refer to us moving to their bar as \"I'm not helping..\" and other things they were clearly upset about -- eye rolls, the works. They didn't say one word to us for the next 25 minutes. 

The bar was about half way full and there were plenty of seats. Not that that would ever be appropriate, but I could understand a little more if people were fighting to sit at the bar. Now I know why they're not."}
{"text":"Great food! I am someone who would say I don't like chicken - it's boring and dry. But at Chelseas kitchen I love it! Great atmosphere and patio!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Chelsea's for many years.  It has been our special dinner spot for birthdays and special occasions.  Each time we have never been disappointed.  However, last Saturday while dining with 2 of my friends, it was chaos.
We were seated indoors and in the center of the dining room when loud shouts interrupted our conversation. At first we thought it was an emergency, but was the staff kitchen personnel who arranges the food to the servers.  He continued these outbursts through our meal and it was just disturbing to us.  When our meals arrived my favorite crab cake eggs Benedict was just the regular eggs Benedict...disappointing.
We all agreed that we did not want to wait for a correct dish to arrive and left as soon as we could.  Again, my first disappointing dining experience here, and hope this won't happen again."}
{"text":"Delicious!  This has to be one of the best airport restaurants I have eaten at.  I ordered the Tortilla soup as an appetizer and the Green Chili Cheeseburger with Fries for my entree.  The soup was flavorful and well seasoned with just the right amount of kick.  The cheeseburger was moist and tender, cooked to perfection.  The green chili is warm, but not extremely hot.  The seasoned french fries are superb - hot, crunchy, with just the right amount of seasoning.  I would highly recommend a stop at this restaurant when passing through Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Friday evenings are busy, but we found a seat at the bar, and started working on a pitcher of their tasty white sangria before being seated at a table on the awesome patio, right by the fire. Even though it's crowded,  the overall vibe is warm, friendly, fun, and the ambiance is great. The food, as always, was delicious."}
{"text":"I just love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Admittedly, I get the short ribs every time but I do sample off the other plates and they are always delicious, too.  I love waiting by the kitchen, watching them work and I love the atmosphere. The patio is perfect and always the spot I want, although when the weather doesn't permit that, the restaurant is beautiful inside and provides such a warm and welcoming feeling."}
{"text":"I got the short rib taco. It's pretty pricey, thought it would be mind blown but it's alright, I think street tacos are still the best!! The meat was tender and good, I liked the (4) tortilla but it was a bit too think, the quinoa salad was bland, sauce wasn't even spicy and overall everything it was a okay. Had it to go before my flight back home, it was good but could've been more flavorful for that price."}
{"text":"This place is DEFINITELY worth a try.  It's been recommended to us by several people over the years...we finally stopped in and were not disappointed.  We have returned several times since.  Everything seems to be good.  Service has likewise been wonderful other than on one occcassion a twenty something waiter tried to cut me off of drinking $500 a bottle cognac after two drinks...despite the fact I had a DD and own a home a mile away.  The manager was quick to act after I asked to have him \"replaced\" in not necessarily the politest of ways.  It seems they are willing to go above and beyond...when asked.  Short rib tacos (I know it sounds odd) are delicious...as are the accoutrements.  Good cognac is a rarity and Chelsea's stocked some labels I hadn't even heard of.  We are food snobs...and always find ourselves lowering our standards here in town...Chelsea's is a \"staple\" for a good reason...give it a try."}
{"text":"My group of four adults and two halvies (kiddies) we fed well and treated well. Our first table was not big enough for our kids so we changed tables without any fuss. The ambiance was pleasant with lovely music. If I could make any negative comment, the music was an a bit too loud. 

We ordered starters: Guac and deviled eggs. Both were fantastic. Maybe one drawback, not enough chips to enjoy the salsa and guac. So good! 

Our kid decided to order off her own menu. She liked feeling special. Our adult menus had a lot of choices. Everything was fantastic. The meat burger, black bean burger and both tacos. The kale slaw was so good. I would make that at home if I could. 

We of course got dessert. Both were rich and wonderful. The pistachio gelato was so good!

Out waiters were helpful. And they offered good drink choices. 

The cider was amazing. 

I would be back if I lived closer."}
{"text":"The surrounding and environment are pretty nice. Came here wanting to try the crab cake benedict but the waitress told me they only serve it on Saturday and Sundays for brunch. She gave me a few recommendations off the menu so I ordered the short ribs. The ribs were very tender but no flavoring, like they only braised it...nasty!! I also hated the veggie they used... I told the waitress and she offered to get me something else so I ordered the short ribs tacos that so many Yelp users were hyped up about. The tacos were okay, but nothing special... paid $20 for the tacos and $2.50 for the soda. 

Overall, friendly staff and decent environment but better chefs are needed especially at these prices..."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to Chelsea's Kitchen and definitely not my last! The combo of top notch service, delicious food and a fab atmosphere has made me an official fan of this place. I love that they send text messages to alert the customer when the table is ready!

We started with an order of the shrimp ceviche to share. We were hungry, so the portion was perfect for two to share. All the traditional ceviche flavors made it into this dish, but the jicama was a delicious and crisp addition to the dish. Yum!

My friend opted to order off of the Restaurant Week menu, which was 3 courses for $30.00, and of course I had to have a tasted of each item! Chris started off with the Caesar Salad, which was perfectly dressed. For this entree, he ordered the Short Ribs served with a side of delectable mashed potatoes and some sort of root vegetable. Did I mention the short ribs were topped with an egg? (I think it was over-easy). I've never had an egg with short ribs....and it was the best decision Chris ever made! Red Velvet cake came for dessert. The cream cheese frosting was nothing short of perfection. 

I ordered the grilled salmon for dinner. Some might say that was a boring choice, but I was in the mood for something simple. My choice certainly hit the spot! The salmon was grilled to perfection (medium rare), served with some fingerling potatoes and green beans. The green beans were a little to crunchy and a little charred for my taste, but still enjoyable.

Our server Alyson, who was pleasant and on-point all night deserves a shout-out. Thanks Alyson!

I will definitely return to Chelsea's Kitchen.

Thanks Gabi M. for the suggestion!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is king here, but so is the service and the food. The menu has variety and the portions are perfect! A seat on the patio during cooler weather is fabulous too!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here but after reading the menu this place is awesome. Healthy food great service and great prices. I had ordered a ahi tuna burger hand made. I ordered it special way and it came out perfectly and delicious.  I tried with avocado."}
{"text":"See my photos. They explain it all!!! Best ahi tuna I've ever had!!! The seasoning on the fries is amazing. Even the kale side salad was delicious."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Scottsdale and your flying in or out of Sky Harbor Airport and you're hungry. Try this place the food here is great! Try the Short Rib tacos you won't be sorry! The staff is friendly and their menu doesn't disappoint! The plates are large perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"Not a bad meal for an airport. Got the Caesar salad and salmon with sautéed broccolini. Salmon was cooked to order (medium) and very tasty. Lot of oil in the veggies but I guess that's better than not enough. Service was super quick and my server Edward was friendly and refreshing. The expo was real chatty too. Overall good experience and made my unexpected layover more enjoyable. Worth going through security again."}
{"text":"Place is a little pricey and you have to watch what you get but overall its a winner. 

Crispy Chicken salad is awesome and so is the filet Mignon. 

Be prepared for a wait on the weekends but its worth it."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Chelsea's kitchen I am amazed by  both the ambiance and food.  Tonight I had the pleasure of having Ryan as my server. He was prompt and knowledgable of the menu. I HIGHLY suggest getting the baked mac and cheese with chilies and jalapeños. Unreal. It is off the menu but they still will go out of their way to create this dish. The mac and cheese is also paired well with the pitcher of white sangria. It is so delicious I could drink the whole thing myself; I didn't, but I could. As a vegetarian I feel that I had plenty of options to choose from off the menu. I got the vegetarian tacos. AMAZING. Portions are generous and I have seconds for tomorrow. The only downfall is that they don't take reservations.  But the food is so good, it honestly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is super cute.  They have a big, cute patio and it is definitely nice to sit outside in the spring/fall months.  The food is always great and the complimentary  salted cookies are always a great perk.

Expect to pay a pretty penny though- $20-30 a person.  Valet parking."}
{"text":"A couple of colleagues and I dropped in one night after work for a bite to eat.  We sat outside on the patio.  It was around 6:30 pm and the place was packed.  I ordered:

Guacamole & Chips, $10
Green Chile Burger (Poblano Chili, Cheddar Cheese, Chipotle Aoli), $13

The Guacamole was very good.  Much better than I expected.  The Green Chile Burger was awesome.  The bitter taste of the Peppers went well with the juicy Burger and melted Cheese....also, the Chipotle Aoli gave it a smooth finish and nice kick.

Service here was very good.  Our server was attentive and kept our Wine glasses full.  Can't wait to come back and try more items.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Nice laid back atmosphere!  The short rib tacos were excellent!!  They were super tender with good flavor.  Mathew at the bar provided excerpt service and was very friendly.  I will definitely visit the next time I'm in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I love yelp. I'm visiting from out of town an it led me to Chelsea's kitchen. Cute little house-effect unlike most of the strip center/chain restaurants that populate Phoenix. The hostess couldnt have been nicer, service was ok. Ate on the patio- perfect evening and only a 15 minute wait. My mom and I split the swordfish tacos- AMAZING! The fish was delish, along with the guac, pico, and kale salad that came with it. My dad ordered the pork carnitas (spelling) and said it was the best pork hes ever had- that's a big statement to make! Needless to say, not a bite was left at our table. On the way out, the hostess gave us the most delicious sea salt chocolate chip cookie. Perfection. The only downside is the small parking lot and valet. We found a spot to park, but when leaving, the valet had blocked us into out spot w another car. Good thing I was still thinking about my delicious dinner to be too annoyed :)"}
{"text":"Love it here!
Great food. Great service what more could you ask for?
Not a bad thing on the menu, seriously"}
{"text":"Whether lunch, happy hour or dinner, Chelsea's is always packed. Seems like a lot of business-type lunches during the week, which means tables turn pretty quickly. I enjoy sitting out on the patio during the spring, it's so nice out. 

The Ahi is always right on. I love the French Dip. Fries. The chips. And the service seems to be always consistently on target. 

Why don't I give it more stars? I haven't ever had any one thing jump out at me. It's just an A-OK place, like the stars say."}
{"text":"Decent food : you don't expect food that is out of the park from airport. It does the job and they do have good service . 
I got the short rip taco plate - it's alright but the way that they put the tortilla on the side is kinda an indicator for u : don't expect your Mexican mama's taco on this airport. Great guacamole though."}
{"text":"Dude, seriously?... Ive only been here for lunch, which is perfect. Tonight I popped my gal's CK Dinner Cherry. Its such a great trick at night. Great buzz, great patio. I had the Chelsea's Cheeseburger, which is $12. Yea, 12 bux for a Cheeseburger and Fries, thats so money. Check out the fish tacos too. There's definitely something about this place that keeps me wanting more.... and its not the parking."}
{"text":"Got to the airport early and needed some breakfast. We wondered around a bit to see what our options were. This one seems like the best option. Sigh, why does airport food have to be so expensive? 

Here's what we ordered:
- Eggs Benedict
- Pancakes
- Steel Cut Oatmeal

Food was good. Loved the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Chelsea's is a welcome oasis in a busy airport. Good food, good service for reasonable prices served in a relaxing environment with dim lights, darker wood, tinted windows, comfortable seats, and plenty of a/c. 

I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and chicken. I replaced the iceberg lettuce with spinach. It was delicious, especially with the mild salsa they brought out with the dish. 

They made the substitution no problem. 

The bartender was tending to our table. He was great, very attentive. 

The prices weren't too bad, maybe $10-$15 per entree."}
{"text":"Quite surprised as we entered! Great atmosphere, the outdoor seating was superb and the fireplace going was great. Our server was Ryan and if you can ask for him, do it! His knowledge of the menu and the wine is amazing. He knows his \"stuff\". The ahi tacos are not to miss, the red velvet cake? Are you kidding me, outstanding! Can't believe we have waited so long to try this. Don't miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the Phx airport but outside of security. Always has St Bernardous & Green Flash beers. Great service and people watching."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is one of the best restaurants in the greater Phoenix area. And there's some pretty stiff competition.

Amazing outdoor patio is great six months out of the year. Free valet is nice, but absolutely essential when it gets busy, which is most of the time unless you stroll in at 3 in the afternoon. Every server we've ever had has been pleasant and professional, and most of them are truly warm and friendly people.

Food is incredible. Super fresh ingredients. Have never had anything on the menu that wasn't spectacular. 

Must try the short ribs, chilaquiles (brunch), and prime rib. The chicken nachos are amazing. Get an order of those to share and a pitcher of white wine sangria, and let the good times roll.

My wife and I were regulars at Chelsea's for years before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. As amazing as the restaurants are down here, I still wish that Chelsea's would open a location out here. It's one of the things we miss most about living in the Valley."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is so inviting and the staff is always so friendly and best of all the food is always delicious.  Took an out of town colleague here for dinner and luckily it was not busy so we got seated right away on the patio.  My friend is a vegan and they had some great options for her....sometimes it's hard to find the right place that have the right options.  She really loved the food here.  I had the sea bass and it did not disappoint.  It was so delicious.  At the end she did get the red velvet cake which was divine.  Chelsea's Kitchen is a great to go place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and excellent service!    The meat for the hamburger is high quality with lots of flavor.       Everyone loved the chicken nachitos.     Pricey but thats the breaks at the airport."}
{"text":"Just celebrated my wife's birthday with their wonderful Saturday Brunch. Located near the busy intersection of 40th St. and Camelback Road, this place was a happening location from the moment we walked in the door. Modern, yet chic. Wifey started with the deviled eggs and they were delicious, as she actually shared them with me. She enjoyed the \"endless mimosas\" and since I was the designated driver, I stayed with the Arnold Palmer made with Simple Syrup. Delish.

We both had the crab cakes benedict and enjoyed them thoroughly. Came with some fresh fruit that was doused with what we believe was a mint syrup. The meal ended with a complimentary chocolate torte for her birthday. Served with what we believed was a scoop of pistachio ice cream, we waddled out the door and plan to spend the rest of the afternoon daydreaming and snoring over this fine experience."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen served the worst prime rib I have ever eaten. It was a poor cut cooked badly. The fries were not even edible. The appetizers were nothing special. The service was rushed, even though it was obvious we had international guests, and rushing a meal is not the European way.  The restaurant ambience is very nice though and so we are being very generous with the 3 star rating. Do not visit for the food."}
{"text":"I come here every time I fly, it's my go to place for a meal and drink before I board the plane. Do order the Quinoa salad, Do not order chips and Guacamole (super small and not worth it). They have a great bar, it's an upscale place, love the decor. They have my favorite beer, Belgian Tripel on tap!"}
{"text":"Hard for a place like this one to live up to the hype but they do.  We sat outside, which arguably this time of year in Phoenix is amazing.  The patio is really beautiful, clean, comfortable chairs and lots of pretty flowers blooming.

Two of us arrived and the waitress immediately came over to greet us after having been promptly seated by the hostess.  We told her we were waiting for one more guest and ordered bottomless mimosa's.  The yummy drinks arrived promptly and we were refilled before our other guest arrived 10 minutes later.  We arrived at 935 and the patio was close to full.  So, if you are coming for Sunday Brunch, come when they open, 930, if you want a seat outside.  The place was very full in and out when we left. And yes, they do have free valet parking. 

We ordered the green chili corn bread as an appetizer, it was tasty, moist (hate that word) and delicious.  

We ordered our brunch meals, one order of eggs benedict and two orders of chilaquiles.  It took a long time for the food to arrive (30 minutes) but no matter, we were chatting away, enjoying the day and they were keeping our drinks full. 

The food arrived, the Chiliaquilas (that may be spelled wrong) were outstanding.  Picture a mexican style lasagna, packed with shredded chicken, cheeses, chilis and the noodles are corn tortillas.  Topped with a wonderful pico de gallo sauce and served on a plate with 1/2 red and 1/2 green sauce.  Truly a taste sensation.  We saw other food coming out of the kitchen and everything looked really yummy.  The eggs benedict was served with a generous portion of fresh fruit and was also yummy and well prepared. 

Bill came shortly after our plates were cleared but the very pleasant server advised us to sit as long as we wanted and enjoy the mimosas refills and the beautiful weather.  We were at Chelsea's more than 2 hours and had a really smashing time.
 
Don't come here if you are looking for cheap prices, it isn't outrageous but our brunch did end up costing 97$ for 3 people.  Lots of drinks and great food and an appetizer.  I can't afford to spend every weekend at Chelsea's during the beautiful spring weather but I sure wish I could!  Great place!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I leave reviews for places that surprise me for either being overrated or for offering a good bang for your buck.  

Chelsea's Kitchen is probably one of the most overrated places I've ever been.  I have no idea how so many people have given this place 5 stars.  

I mean this place seriously sucks.  A $15 burger that looks like your buddy's dad made it on his old propane gas grill?  Covered in packaged American cheese and \"house made\" Russian dressing but it has Chelsea in its name so it must be great?  Maybe they meant the Claussen burger since the best part about it was the jarred grocery store pickles that were on it.  Really?  Just give me a Zipps burger and the fries will be better too.  

Rest of the table got short rib tacos, steak tacos, paella special and another burger.  No one was impressed.  

I've been to this kitchen twice, the first and the last time.  Do yourself a huge favor and skip the valet and keep driving down Camelback to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Comfortable and easy. Solid cocktail menu but the food is what shines here.  Simple twists on old time classics like devil eggs and guacamole.

Entrees were healthy portions of excellence. Care and quality were placed in our orders and the experience was enjoyable."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars

After a meeting in town, a business associate recommended we check out Chelsea's Kitchen for dinner.  Great rec.  My colleague and I enjoyed our meals immensely.  It was the first time in as long as I could remember that I perused a menu where literally EVERY selection appealed to me.  Needless to say, I had a hard time deciding, but when I did I landed on the tuna tartare app and the short rib tacos for my main.  Had I known the size of the app, I would've reconsidered.  Both the tuna and the tacos were excellent.  Service was fine, though not exceptional.  Atmosphere inside was lively.  Not sure how I missed Chelsea's Kitchen on my dozens of previous business trips to PHX, but glad I know about it now.  I'll be back - soon."}
{"text":"Came back for the lemon pancakes. Tried the chilequilles. Eveverything was perfect.  Arrived at 1130 and surprisingly,  we were sat immediately.  We got Kimberly 's section.  What more can you ask for ."}
{"text":"I own a business in south Scottsdale and being a foodie, I am always very concerned about people's dining experiences, especially if they are from out of town. I am a self-appointed concierge! lol.. but seriously... nothing worse than getting sent to a crappy restaurant.  So, there area a # of restaurants that I just love. To me, a restaurant is good if 1/ the food is good and 2/ the food is good all the time. And I want atmosphere. Oh, and a hot server wouldn't hurt either. Ha!  Well, that last is a wish but ... anyhow, I love Chelseas.  I have never gone there and had a bad experience.  The food is consistently good.  I think too it is a good sign when you walk in a restaurant and the air is just redolent with heavenly cooking smells.  I always get the same thing n foodwise there  but it is always tasty.. the fish tacos.  They have a wide array of types of tacos you can get and there are actually two types of fish tacos.. ahi tuna and swordfish.  They are deconstructed.. meaning.. you put them together yourself.  My favorite is the swordfish.. yummy!  The only weird thing that I have seen is that lately, they have done away with the beans and rice side and replaced it with a kale salad.  I am like.. what??? How is kale Mexican?  But you can request the beans and rice.  The other thing that is funny are the small baby tacos.  I guess that is the trend but they crack me up. Literally, my wine glass was bigger. 

Other items that friends have gotten that I would recommend are the short ribs with poached egg and the roasted chicken.

One last thing:  I can never make it out of there without taking a cookie (or two!) from the dessert plate by the door.  What a nice touch!  And they are soo tasty.. soft chocolate chip with sea salt on top.  BTW.. the sea salt is inspired! 

So.. go there. And the plus is that they do have some hot waiters!"}
{"text":"The Deviled eggs and the French press coffee were amazing. The only downside is the valet only parking."}
{"text":"This is the best experience of every business trip to AZ.  Love the menu and service is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped here for lunch on a week day and while I enjoyed my food, nothing about the experience was noteworthy. Pros: quick service from a kind and attentive staff  with a decent menu selection. Cons: the entire restaurant smelled of smoke from the smokehouse area in back and the food was just average. I didn't have a bad experience but it definitely isn't a place I feel the need to eat at again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is fantastic. I recommend the tacos, any of them, or the huge salads. They also have a great drink menu with lots to try. I haven't gone wrong yet."}
{"text":"A great restaurant in the neighborhood. Quality of food is great, service is great, atmosphere is great, can't miss with this selection.

I was in town on a job and needed a place to take my boss & client for dinner, found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try, couldn't of been a better choice, great vibe all around. Food is New Mexican-American, but definitely not tex-mex.  I'm from CA so a discerning critic on any spin of Mexican but this place does a great job of creating some quality dishes.  Appetizers are upscale taco shop style, tacos are solid, drinks are ok, but we ordering old fashions when maybe we should of gotten margaritas? And don't leave without a cookie, seriously good with the sea salt. 

Either way the service was also on point and the design of the place is cool/mellow.  Scottsdale wasn't half bad & this place is the reason"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out, grab drinks, dinner or meet for lunch. Little pricey but the atmosphere is great and the food is consistently amazing with friendly staff."}
{"text":"We spent a week in Sedona and Scottsdale. Really loved Chelsea's Kitchen. We ate outside on the patio, the heaters really kept the patio warm during the evening and the fireplace was a nice added touch. The food was very good, a few of us had the tuna tacos and steak tacos... excellent. All the entrees and appetizers were great. The desserts were outstanding.. would recommend the key lime pie. Service was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food here - pretty good. What bumps this up to a 5 star for me is the AMBIANCE! (Oh and not to mention, the amazing sea salt dark chocolate chip cookies waiting on your way out!!!!)

Started with the Tuna Tartare - this was the perfect light appetizer I was in the mood for. The tuna wasn't overly dressed with soy ginger, and the guac...something about it was SO amazing! I think this was probably my favorite food we ordered. The lightness was also perfect with the white sangria - refreshing combo for the hot hot desert we live in.

Shared the Short Rib Tacos & the Brussel Sprout Salad with Jidori Chicken as entrees. I think the short ribs were really good - if short rib is something that tickles your fancy, this is something you should give a try! The brussel sprout salad was just okay for me. No complaints, but I probably wouldn't get it again.

Now ambiance - if you're going for dinner, check out the back!!!! I didn't sit out with all the hanging lights and I so regret it! Inside was so beautiful, but on my way to the bathroom, I got distracted by the set up. If I go back, I definitely want to sit out there and try so many more drinks and appetizers! Solid restaurant!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so warm and inviting.  Both the inside and the patio are large and open.  This place is always buzzing, and usually has a wait, but is always worth it.  My favorite salad from here is the brussel sprout salad, which initially sounds like a turn-off.  However, at the time I was not even sure if I liked brussel sprouts. Turns out, this is one of my all-time fav-salads and is a go-to item for lonely take-out nights!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were there last night with our niece and her boyfriend.
The drinks were brought promptly as well as the wonderful cornbread and Brussel Sprouts salad. We had ribeye steak tacos, short rib tacos, roast chicken with quinoa salad and a cheeseburger with fries.  All was fabulous. For dessert we had key lime pie with strawberry sherbet and pistachio and chocolate mint gelato.  This was a wonderful evening and even better because of our server Simone. She was delightful and added to our extremely enjoyable evening.  We look forward to going back to Chelsea's real soon."}
{"text":"Solid food, pretty fast, fairly priced for an airport. The waiter was pretty good. Had a hour to waste and was hungry so stopped in, had a beer and a green chile burger. There wasn't a place to plug in at the table I was at, usually not a big deal but at an airport I look for that. Lots of places to eat here, this place isn't a bad choice. Good but not a place I have to stop at every time I'm at this airport, warranting it a solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Chelsea kitchen was a nice surprise and the best airport restaurant I've been too.  Lax and JFK should  take note. Chelsea's kitchen is amazing and better than the usual burger and pizza joint in the airport.   

The food,the service and the ambiance were all amazing.   Our waiter was attentive and he made a great recommendation of the key lime pie. It was so good I forgot to take a picture of it. 

The place is cozy and played great classic music from frank Sinatra and Louis armstrong.  Overall the decor is very classy and upscale. 

I also had the devil eggs and fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich was a perfectly cooked and fried chicken breast like mom use to make!! It had coleslaw and a nice touch of Saracha sauce on a butter soft brioche bun.   Thanks Phoenix airport for having such a wonderful restaurant in the airport."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant when I'm at Phoenix Sky Harbor.  Service has always been good. The vegetarian tacos are delicious. The kale salad and meaty mushrooms with the thinly sliced radishes is excellent and they give you plenty of tortillas."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the waits are too long, wouldn't recommend stopping if you have a flight to catch soon. 
The problem seems to be that when we went to lunch, there was apparently 1 woman, prepping the plates. That is, the food came out of the kitchen to this one woman, who finished the plates-soup, breads, tortilla chips, whatever. Why only 1 person?? Quite a few times the servers were backed up standing there waiting for her to finish. Really a long long wait for soup and salad, and fish tacos."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is consistently delicious, professional, and a great place to dine. 

The food here is hearty and flavorful, even the cornbread is so much more than what you'd think it would be. 

Every time I come to Chelsea's I get the Kale Salad in some format- either as a meal or as a side. It's so fresh, tasty, light, and filling. 

The short rib tacos are also a favorite of mine. The tiny tortillas are always perfect and it's the perfect amount of food for the price attached to it. 

Yesterday was the first time we tried the bean burger, which completely fell apart after the first bite. Unfortunately then it was eaten with a fork, but the flavor was good and the cashew cheese spread is a nice touch. 

Service here has never been bad. There is typically a wait, but you forget about that once you get to sit, relax, and eat such flavorful food in a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Chelsea's Kitchen! Super comfy ambiance, delectable food, inventive flavors, a seasonal selection of wild seafood and natural meats, and an extremely friendly staff. What more could you ask for? Delish!"}
{"text":"We dropped in here last night when we realized we didn't realistically have two hours + to wait at Pizzeria Bianco. 

The wait here was about 40 minutes - which surprised me, for a Wednesday, but we persevered with a cocktail at the bar. 

I immediately liked the setup -- it was comfortable, for lack of a more descriptive word. The fireplace was burning and the flowers sprung fresh from the vases that separated the dining room from the bar. 

For some reason, the menu wasn't really doing it for me last night, which is abnormal, as I'm usually a big fan of comfort foods like fried chicken or spare ribs. So I went with a salad, which was good, not amazing, and it was brought out by my nicer-than-normal server. 

We split a key lime pie at the end of the night which was also good but not quite there with the KL pie at Houston's, in my estimation. 

All in all, very good."}
{"text":"White sangria was awesome. The prickly pear vodka drink is also great. Just went and got drinks with friends. No wait, just walked right in and sat at the bar... Had some chips and guac which was super fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is great, low key and chill. Music playing is fun and low in volume so you can actually talk to the people you came with. Loved it."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Chelsea's with friends on a Saturday night. First, our waitress was not very attentive at all and never introduced herself. She didn't offer suggestions or a smile, ever. She just stood at our table like an annoyed waitress from a dive diner who hates her job. We ordered two bottles of wine which turned out to be very good for the price.  My husband had the short rib tacos which were wonderful and plenty of food.  I had the Brussels sprout salad with salmon. I was disappointed with the size of the salmon filet, it seemed to be about 1\"strip of fish. Maybe a third of what you'll expect when ordering a salmon fillet at a restaurant. The salad was fresh, but way too sweet and for many that is not an issue but for me I prefer a more tangy dressing. This was a pretty bland salad. My daughter ordered the hamburger and she liked it well enough but felt it was to thick and difficult to pick up and eat. Our friends ordered the grouper and filet mignon. I didn't taste theirs but per their report everything was just  \"okay\" ,not outstanding or memorable.
The patio atmosphere was the most redeeming aspect of our dinner. Beautiful ambience.  I will probably not come back to Chelsea's. Mainly because this was our suggestion for taking our friends to for dinner and the waitress was unbelievably awful and ruined our entire experience. 
Another negative for this place is your only option for parking is to use their valet, ughh!!"}
{"text":"We love the food here. The service is always friendly and quick. Free delicious cookies on the"}
{"text":"A bit noisy for dinner but the fried chicken is awesome! Parking is a bit of a hassle on a bumpin' night but the complimentary valet is a plus! During the holidays the restaurant is decked out to suit any holiday dinner you plan on sharing with fam or a friend."}
{"text":"Amazing menu, exceptional staff, unique atmosphere....Chelsea's exceeds all expectations!  One of my top five restaurants. Ever. The restaurant reminds me of Houston's, but done MUCH better. 

It's intimate, yet spacious. Classy, but not overdone. It's ideal. 

The. food. is. PHENOMINAL. The menu is tied together with seafood and some Mexican dishes. In the spotlight are the tacos.  Two words:  shortrib tacos. HUGE portion of perfectly seasoned meat, guac, pico de gallo, rice and beans, with house-made tortillas on the side. You must try them!

Prior to this, my date and I were enjoying the shrimp ceviche when we see a picturesque plate of nachos presented to another table. Food envy. Yes, we are definitely coming back to sit on the patio and enjoy a gigantic plate!

I have never encountered such genuine, knowledgeable and charismatic waitstaff. I glanced over where food is prepared and I noticed each waiter carefully wiping off any splashes or splatters of foodage from each plate. This is food at it's full potential."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the quality of food at this airport restaurant. The service was prompt, the food was well above average an the staff was polite.  The prices are much higher, but it was worth the extra buck. Splitting checks was not an issue and itemized receipt are given. When I am in PHX again and have time, I will stop by again. They have free cookies on the way out so grab one."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Phoenix. Food is outstanding, service is impeccable, etc. they Need to bring back the baked egg dish though. Found out the other day it was discontinued!  Sad day!!"}
{"text":"This was my lunch stop today! 

I usually don't sit on the patio at restaurants (especially on a windy day)but the dining room was full and I didn't want to wait.

I was pleasantly surprised, I really enjoyed sitting outside. The building completely blocked the wind from the patio, it was perfect.
They also have purse racks at your table! COOL!

It was much quieter outside compared to in and they were playing some Spanish guitar over the speakers, I Love that music.

I decided to order the Grilled Swordfish Tacos,  they were delicious and fresh (see pics) made to order grilled corn tortillas are Amazing! $18

I was still hungry after though..........

I saw some scallops go by to another table and wondered if that was a special because I didn't see it on the menu.

I asked my waitress,and YES they were a special, I decide to order that as well.

OH WOW!!! Absolutely Delicious!!!!!!  3 HUGE pan seared scallops on a bed of sweet corn polenta topped with wild mushrooms and a light gravy/sauce!! (see pics) $17

So ya I spent $50 on lunch for my self! (that's including a $10 tip)

Good food is worth every penny to me, I'll definitely go back but only order one entree next time.

For the record I do think the tacos were a bit over priced but the scallops were totally worth it!

5 stars for my waitress not telling me I'm a Pig!"}
{"text":"I visited Chelsea's Kitchen for brunch with a large group and have to agree with most other reviews-- this place is fantastic.  Nearly everything on the menu looked scrumptious and as a vegetarian I found that there were sufficient choices for the veggie inclined. 

I toyed with the ideas of a spinach omelette with gruyere cheese and a veggie burger, but ultimately decided on Chelsea's Hotcakes.  I was absolutely delighted-- these are not your standard run-of-the-mill heavy, doughy, bland pancakes, people... these are special!  They're light and fluffy and infused with an orange essence.  Tiny bites of heaven.  Truly! They were served with a side of fruit seasoned with mint leaves.  I loved the refreshing mint-- although the fruit itself could have been slightly fresher-- the grapes had probably seen better days about a week ago!  

The decor was tasteful and relaxed and the service was fantastic.  Our server was attentive and patient with such a large group, which isn't always the case. Although I didn't partake in any of their brunch cocktails, others I was with enjoyed the pomegranate margarita and white wine sangria immensely... perhaps a bit too much in fact!  

As a nice touch, as you leave, instead of the same old overdone mint, we were offered a delicious chocolate chip cookie topped with sea salt.  The perfect salty-sweet combination.

Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm looking forward to going back and sampling more of their tempting menu selections."}
{"text":"Today was evidently an \"off\" day for this restaurant. Came in for breakfast, which was very good quality and came out quickly, but there were literally only 6 or 8 people in the entire restaurant eating. The overall demeanor of the various staff members was one of \"stress and tension\". They were not directly mean or rude to me, and my waitress was very responsive and pleasant, but I am a people watcher and was literally stressed out by the time breakfast ended as I watched the employees.

Watching the interactions, it seemed that everyone was either unhappy with management (perhaps they had a team meeting prior to opening & were scolded) or maybe their co-worker(s) were not all pulling their weight. The staff was looking over their shoulders - looking to see where their coworkers and managers were. What appeared to be a manager was walking around with a clipboard and she was watching every move of the staff and writing things down.

I asked my waitress if everything was ok, as it really appeared that it was a bad place to work. She said the computer had gone down and thus she was just a little stressed out. However, my receipt was printed from the computer (obviously was working) and there was basically no one in the entire restaurant  (I didn't buy that excuse for even a second - so I told her that I really hoped her day would get better). She said thanks and then ended up in a serious conversation with one of her co-workers. 

A restaurant experience goes beyond just the quality of the food and how fast it is served. If the staff is not in a good place - that stress can be seen and felt by the patrons who are seeking a relaxed and enjoyable meal experience. As an onlooker - it looked like working here is not fun and that management must be trying to run the business with an iron fist, rather than a respectful and pleasant workplace environment. Whatever the reason, it felt like a stressed out, cold and disengaged French restaurant experience. Hope they are able to work things out - as perhaps more people will want to come in then, as the food was very good."}
{"text":"Today I had a flight out of Phoenix and did not have time to have lunch at home. I was so excited to see one of my fav restaurants now open at the airport. I was excited to find the same great food and same great service but now at the airport. My food came out quickly, and one of the managers (Charles?) thanked me for coming in. The same great service I was used to at their original location. You can tell that everyone here is on their game!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, substantial servings, reasonable prices, nice ambience, and friendly staff. On a recent visit to Scottsdale, we tried to go there at lunch. It was packed out!  A few days later we arrived for an early dinner and we were seated right away. We started with the chicken nachos appetizer. It was like a mountain topped with guacamole and sour cream. Yum!  And we loved our entrees too! A definite do-again!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. We started out with the green chili corn bread, it was ok. The short rib tacos were so soft and perfectly cooked. They were to die for! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Really nice place. Went with three people and each had a different type of taco. All were outstanding. Fresh made corn tortillas are awesome. Outdoor patio was perfect for a late afternoon lunch.  Will definitely make Chelsea's a regular stop."}
{"text":"The service is awesome!  The food on the the other hand, not so much.  So the two stars is ONLY for the food.  

I ordered an old fashion which was quite good expect for the plastic wrap lodged under my ice cube.  The manager promptly explained and ordered a new drink (hold the plastic)

Fish of the day is typically something I'll order on a menu at a decent restaurant.  The halibut was cooked to death; literally couldn't separate the fillet with my fork.

Come here for the drink, appetizers, and outdoor patio."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in phoenix. This is my fav restaurant. Food is so delicious i highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Management reached out to me within an hour of my posting. Extremely apologetic and quite generous (freebies!)."}
{"text":"I had a French Dip that was exceptionally good.

The service was OK, not great or even all that good, but ok. My only real complaint is that the server couldn't talk about any of the beers on the menu. Other than that, she was attentive and otherwise helpful.

{"text":"Have to start with the white sangria....AMAZING!  My friend and I ordered a pitcher and couldn't finish the rest. Good and nice portions!  I ordered a burger with chiles. Soooo good.  Mac and Cheese was fantastic too.  I splurged a lot this evening and had the flourless chocolate cake with vanilla gelato.  The cake was good, but very rich so share! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Bar fun due to lots of conversation with strangers. Short wait at prime time.  Had short rib tacos. Not bad.  Generous portion. Other orders were unusual, such as, the Brussels sprout salad and kale salad."}
{"text":"SO good!  Drinks, app, dinner-prime rib and tuna burger, dessert-key lime pie, and Christina were all fabulous!  So glad we happened across this place!!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and always stop by Chelsea's Kitchen to grab their chicken caesar salad. They have always been made fresh, lots of chicken, and fabulous dressing. The last few times I have picked up a salad from there I have been very disappointed. The lettuce is yellow or white and about half the size it used to be. The chicken is fatty and this last time, there were only 4 little pieces of chicken in the entire salad. For as much as they charge, I would expect the salad to be fresh, green and a little more chicken. Very disappointing. I'll have to find a new stop in the airport!"}
{"text":"as you are walking in the parking lot to chelsea's kitchen you begin to experience chelsea's kitchen.  the smell of wood burning.  the inside of the restaurant is definitely a wow factor.  fyi, the restrooms are nice too.  lol.

the service is top notch!  i feel very welcomed while eating here.

the food is the best.  the chicken nachos starter is amazing!  the cheslea's kitchen cheeseburger and green chile burger, and howie burger are the very best!  the ribeye steak, rotisserie chicken, pork roast wake up my taste buds.

c.k. is in my top 3."}
{"text":"Really is a beautiful setting for dinner.  Met some family there and had a good time, few apps but no drinks.  The design of the restaurant really is gorgeous, light wood tables, copper and stone.  It is a bit loud, but was great as we had a baby in tow.

The food is a bit over priced, the $12 burger was delicious but wasn't a $12 portion.  I would guess rent and snootiness are expensive where they're at and the Ferrari drivers don't seem to mind.  I would like to go back and get the roasted chicken dinner.  We had Guac to start which was excellent and fresh.  You can get out of here with your wallet if you don't drink, but what fun is that?"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Mostly come here for brunch on Sundays and sit on the patio for bottomless mimosas. Reminds me alot of a few patios in N.Y. that we used to frequent. Food is phenomenal, most of the servers are wonderful. Kim is our absolute fav. I had the caesar salad with salmon last time we were there and it was probably the best salmon I've had."}
{"text":"Only good thing was the complimentary cookies. Service was slow and food was disappointing. Quick service is appreciated when traveling! Price was outrageous for what you get. Go across to Smashburger!"}
{"text":"I have been to Chelsea's probably 50 times in the past few years and it NEVER disappoints. The red velvet cake is my favorite. Their taco platters are abundant and yummy. I usually get those with ahi tuna. I'm a fish person so I love their salmon appetizer which is like a creamy spread. The kale salad is always good and you get free cookies on your way out! Great restaurant. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you have a party of 12, you can get a reservation. At first they had us outside but if you don't mind being seated in a separated table (enclosed by a booth) you can be inside.  It was a great way to celebrate my birthday.

They are very accommodating and attentive even though the place is swamped all the time.  I had the crab cakes and they are the second best I have had.  All real crab meat and wonderfully seasoned and fried. 

They also have free cookies at the entrance, they are salty and sweet, a great way to top off a meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen. Great environment and outdoor seating. The shade trees and overhead misters helped keep the temperature down. I was comfortable dispute the 106 temperature at 6:30p.
Good menu selections.

Must try the Red Velvet!"}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Chelsea's.   all we can say is YUMMM!   

Husband had the Short Rib Tacos and I had the Chicken Mole Tacos.  Both are served with a nice helping of guacamole and a fabulous Kale Salad.  

We sat on the patio. ( do it before it gets too hot!  Totally worth the wait!). 
We had a pitcher of Sangria which we think is a great price for $21.  It seems to be their signature drink.  There was a pitcher on practically everyone's table. 

The service was top notch and it ran like a well oiled machine.  

And then....there was...the....Red Velvet cake.  Like no other....  Don't leave there without trying it."}
{"text":"Get the deviled eggs! Fries were super crispy. Burger was on par. Swordfish Tacos rocked. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations to start with being in an airport and all. The meal started out ok with the tortilla chips and guacamole. However then came the deviled eggs and those were a hit! So I was impressed. Then I got my tortilla soup which tasted like chicken flavored dish water.... As gorden Ramsey would say \"what a shame.\" Then came the Caesar salad ... Gross took one bite and sent it back. That was strike two. Then I got the replacement mixed greens with ranch... Ranch was watery... Strike three. Not worth the time and money to come here. I'd do better with the peanuts on the flight."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere specially on the outside patio.  Service is quick at attentive.  Nice salads in menu.  Corn bread was small portion could have been larger."}
{"text":"Very nice local place. Excellent swordfish tacos and phenomenal cornbread. White sangria is to die for."}
{"text":"Skeptical diner at Chelsea's Kitchen in Phoenix but was proven wrong.  Reminds me a lot of North located in Scottsdale and Tucson.  Great spot for a happy hour, date or a family dinner.  Had an excellent tuna and spinach salad with spicy ginger dressing.  Found the service to be quite good and a very comfortable/relaxed atmosphere.  A spot like this was needed in that Camelback location."}
{"text":"This place sets the bar for an amazing restaurant experience. It is casual dining at it's very best!

It is a great looking place, that's always busy. Even though its always busy service has never suffered, as a mater of fact it's always super friendly and amazingly professional.

There is plenty to chose from on the menu, from upscale pub grub, to great Asian, a little seafood, and awesome chicken. no mater what we order everything is great. 

I don't like to compare restaurant to restaurant but Chelsea's is the only restaurant in town comparable to Hillstone or Houston's. They just have it down. 

End with the key lime pie...trust me about this"}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had in an airport. If it were near me, I'd eat here regularly.

The brussels sprout salad was excellent, the prime rib I added to it outstanding. The bloody mary was very good, but quite pricy -- over $10 each, and not a generous serving.

And, don't judge me -- it was a long, emotionally-draining weekend, and I was in a goddamned airport, so I got the pie. The key lime pie was terrific. 

Something to look forward to when passing through the Phoenix Airport, of all things!"}
{"text":"This casual, friendly restaurant located on the canal at 32nd just off Camelback, is a winner! The menu has options for every palate, and the staff is very helpful. Guests of all ages give the place a warm and happy vibe. The dEviled  eggs starter is fantastic, as was my rare and delicious  ahi tuna burger. There are options for vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores alike, and the restaurant uses as many locally-sourced products as possible. Drinks are well-priced. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Nice big restaurant and bar in airport.  Great green chilli burger!!!  It brings the heat so if you don't like it hot, get a different burger."}
{"text":"Happily surprised to get such a great meal in an airport restaurant. Swordfish tacos were excellent!! Very tasty and fresh with great sides of guacamole and kale salad with quinoa. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here twice now and it was excellent! The Corn bread is simply perfect. The ceviche is exceptional!  The taco platters (get the swordfish or the Ahi Tuna) are pure simplistic flavorful scrumptiousness. The fried Chicken sandwich is out of the world.  Oh and don't forget the free choc chip sea salt cookie(or three) on the way out!!"}
{"text":"great atmosphere, always amazing service. This place never disappoints. Start with their famous deviled eggs. Follow that with one of their rotisserie meats (their chicken, pork, or beef).

They have an awesome outdoor patio, with misters running during the summer months. It's shaded and very comfortable"}
{"text":"We have been here so many times and every time it is great food and great service.

This time we did get one meal that was very bland. I brought it to the servers attention. On the way back from the restroom the manager stopped me to shake my hand and thank me for brining it to their attention. \"I would rather find out these issues early in the morning (it was early morning) than go through the entire day serving bland food.\" We then later overhead him talking to the kitchen staff and asking if that dish had been adjusted. They also took care of a portion of the bill.

Timely, kind and sincere response to a negative customer experience will always keep me coming back. Every restaurant will have it's issues from time to time, but it is all in how they respond to them. This managers actions and demeanor where the true example of customer service."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio is beautiful at night with a great bar. Sat there while table was getting set and ordered a DIEGO RIVERA cocktail ... incredible! Everyone's dinner was delicious ... my swordfish platter was very good and a large portion - very fresh! Wait staff was awesome and had great recommendations. Red Velvet cake for dessert - must order. Can't wait to eat here again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We love the veggie taco plate! We are vegetarian and it can be more difficult to find something we really love! The tacos come with massive sides to stuff them with, and there are so yummy! My boyfriend and I can share the meal and we both leave really full! If you have extra room, the key lime pie is TO DIE FOR! It's comes with sorbet and it's one of the most delicious treats!"}
{"text":"What is going on at Chelsea's? I have been coming here since the beginning..the very beginning! The last two visits have been awful. In the past the service was top-notch! Makes me think the days of good service and food are over for my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  Went for lunch this weekend and waited 10 minutes for wait staff to come to our table. Yes, 10 min! The food took forever and our server was no where to be seen. When we finally got our food..meh. The fries were cold and not the usual long fries..short and stubby like the bottom of the barrel. The short rib tacos (used to be the best in the valley) tons of fat and gristle. Ugh..not good! So disappointed, don't know what is going on but hope its just a rough patch for my favorite place in Arcadia."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
Howie Burger was good but nothing earth shattering. I had great service and the ambience is nice. Nothing over the top though or that I would say you must visit while you are in Phx."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Chelsea's Kitchen with or without our children.  The restaurant manages to be both \"cool\" and \"family-friendly\" at the same time.  The focus is on quality over quantity and the Steak Tacos are excellent.  My wife loves the fried chicken.  The outdoor patio, indoor fireplace, cool bar really add the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite patio in all of Arcadia! I love coming to Chelsea's for brunch, but I've been here for lunch, HH, and din din too! The food and service are always fantastic! Don't miss the Deviled Eggs WITH BACON***as if it's really \"Optional\"***and the Crab Cake Benedict! Happy Eating and Day Drinking!"}
{"text":"I was here last Friday night (1/3/14). My mom and I were visiting from out of town and we chose this place based on yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. We arrived around 6:30 and only waited about 20 min for a table. We sat at the bar and ordered their delicious white sangria. Once we got to our table our waitress gave us great info on the menu to help guide our ordering process.  I ordered the Howie burger which was sweet and delicious.  My mom ordered the pan fried chicken which was moist yet crispy. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered.  We didn't even notice the amount of time that had passed until the waitress apologized for the wait.  We were absolutely shocked when the manager payed for our bill. It was such a kind gesture and we were very satisfied with our service and food.  If I am ever in Phoenix again I would make a point to return!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and consistency.  The swordfish tacos are to die for.  Probably the most deserving 5-star rating in Phoenix.  Their prices are very reasonable considering the quality of ingredients and preparation.  Very nice atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Great food! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it is hard to find good parking at this location. Its like LGO when it gets busy. Other than that service was great, good atmosphere, and great food! The fried chicken is awesome"}
{"text":"Wow! What an incredible visit to Chelsea's Kitchen! First of all, you MUST try the deviled eggs! OMG the best eggs ever!
Matt S. was our sever & he not only had a great attitude, he gave a great recommendation of how to dress up my veggie burger just rightwith a side of ridiculous French fries- the best I've had!! Highly recommend this place & be sure to ask for Matt 
This was my first time here & I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and menu is super creative. Highly recommend going. The atmosphere is unique and you almost fee you aren't in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious food and absolutely incredible outdoor ambiance.  Great service, excellent food, fun energy.  A must go!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Had the grilled salmon and it was wonderful. Service was great and our waitress was very attentive"}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here just this morning and I got to tell you that this place was great.  I dined here w/ a friend of mine while we were in the area for friend's wedding.  I won't get into too much detail about what we ordered but I would recommend the prime rib.  Our server here I forget her name was great.  She was very pleasant and since we told her we were out of town and wanted to visit the downtown Phoenix area she gave us some tips on where to head to.  

Nothing beats having brunch sipping on a bloody mary and some wine w/ prime rib people watching.  The crowd here does seem decently well off and I saw a few beautiful women.  I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely return if I was ever back in the area.  Patio seating for the people watching."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here today with the fam. We were in AZ for Spring Training baseball games and needed a good place to grab some grub. My husband, inlaws and I were meeting up with my aunt and uncle who live drove up from Tuscon so wanted to be sure to pick some place relaxing and worthy of the fairly long drive.

The decor inside was really stylish but being such a beautiful day we really wanted to sit on the back patio! There were 8 of us total yet the hostess was able to accommodate us quite quickly considering the relatively large number of our party. The patio has really great ambiance and backs up to a canal path that I would have definitely explored had we not had to leave for our game.

My Chiliquiles were delish and was so filling I didn't even need to buy any crappy ball park food later in the day. The Hubby's Prime Rib Hash looked amazing (even though I don't eat meat) and my sister in laws Kale and Quinoa salad was sooo tasty. Add in some White Sangria and a Bloody Mary and you got your self a pretty perfect little brunch!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here. Our group had the hatch chile burger, brisket sliders, and brussel sprout salad with rotisserie chicken. The only thing that we didn't like was the brussel sprout salad would have been a little bland on it's own. Very good sevice and atmosphere."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM.... did I say YUM? Everything about this restaurant is fantastic. I love the decor, the outside patio is the best. The bar set up is great and I love that the have an open kitchen so you can see your food prepared. The chicken nachitos with extra guacamole YUMMY! The roasted chicken outstanding! I love the chipolte burger! The mac and cheese is definately something to write about don't miss out on the MAC! I also love that they serve the Passion fruit tea. This is very good food at a very good price. I have only had bad service once, I think our server was new or at least I hope she was. Otherwise she was just a ding bat that couldn't remember to come fill our drinks or bring the extras that we ordered. Don't keep this one a secret!"}
{"text":"Been here many times for brunch but never for dinner. I love the atmosphere and the vibe. We were a group of 8 friends and we each ordered different items. For starters we got the deviled eggs and tuna tartar guacamole and chips. They were both amazing. I also ordered a bottle of sparkling rosé which I shared with a friend, it was very tasty. And for my dinner I ordered the surf and turf tacos, and though I'm not a fan of lobster but I really enjoyed the lobster here as it was very well made. 

Negatives, got gum on my pants from the table :-) but I didn't let that ruin my evening and the server got me a cloth with club soda at my request and I was able to get it out. 

I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"This airport restaurant and lounge is a great stop for the weary traveler.  Located outside the security gates amongst other stores and eateries it is an ideal spot for a pre-flight drink or meal.

Chelsea's features a limited menu (that is a bit pricey) allowing the kitchen to be quick and efficient while delivering decent food to its patrons.  

The comfortable dining area and lounge is well kept and clean; however, its becoming dated, quickly.

The highlight of any visit is its friendly staff that will brighten your travel day.

I will return the next time I'm flying to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went to Chelsea's Kitchen for my birthday dinner, and it was amazing.  
It was a Wednesday night, and the place was PACKED .  I was surprised because it was mid week, but I thought it must be a great place.  
It is a very warm and inviting place, with a beautiful dining room and patio area.  
We sat inside.  The service was great, and the food was delicious. 
We ordered: Chicken Nachitos, The Howie Burger, The Short Rib Taco Platter, Chelsea Burger, and the Ahi Tuna Burger.
The beef is ground in house, and cooked medium rare- which was perfect.  The Nachitos were very good as an appetizer.  
The Short Rib Taco Platter was delicious, and the server brought out additional warm tortillas as we were eating the tacos. 
Overall, it is an outstanding restaurant, and I can't wait to go back! 
They also let me bring a cake for my birthday which was nice! 
Don't forget to grab a salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out!"}
{"text":"Really? Did I just have the BEST prime rib dip sandwich at an AIRPORT? Yes! It happened! 

This charming restaurant (yes, charming - it even has a fireplace!) is located in the middle of Phoenix Airport, before going through the security lines. I was impressed that they were able to pull off an environment that feels like a 5 star restaurant in the midst of all the hustle and bustle.  The only time I was even reminded that I was in an airport was when I saw a few people with luggage under their table. 

Service is first class, food is a little pricy (but typical of the airport), menu is outstanding (they aren't messing around with their french fries!) and there is even a free gourmet cookie before you leave. Love it!"}
{"text":"New fave! Situated right off of Camelback, you will find Chelsea's and her glory.

Hostesses and our server were superb. Service and smiles didn't stop. 

I had their French Dip - probably one if the best in my life. No play. Their juicy roast beef and bread used is sooo scrumptious! Au jus wasn't too salty - full of flavor. And, their seasoned fries? They did right there too.

Patio is recommended over inside, IMO, because it can be pretty loud being that dining patrons can see/hear all of the chefs clanging nearby. It's fun to watch, but loud."}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try all the Yelper favorites around my new home so I tried Chelsea's for a Sunday lunch.  Combined the deviled eggs appetizer with the Del Mar Salad.  The eggs were perfect, mounded high with filling and perfectly balanced with bacon crumbles.  The seafood in the salad reminded me of being home in Seattle, on my own boat, eating fresh crab, that's how good it was!  It also had a pleasant after heat in the dressing that caught me by surprise after I devoured the salad. 

The atmosphere is relaxing, the music selection perfect an don't overpowering and the service superb. 

Only disappointment was they do not carry alternates to dairy for the coffee I wanted.

I will be back... Got to try the steaks everyone is reviewing!"}
{"text":"The short ribs are excellent as is the spiked lemonade.  My friends and I have our own secret name for the cucumber press cocktail-- it's that legendary.  Overall a lovely experience always to be had here."}
{"text":"I went with a friend to an early dinner/late lunch. We had the braised beef tacos and they were delicious. Even better than the food was our server, Kimberly!! Because of her, I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The wait on a Friday or Saturday night can be a little long but well worth it. There is free valet but I was able to park myself. They only have four beers on tap and I enjoy their sangria. The food here is amazing, our table of four shared the nachos- huge plate. My guests had burgers and fries (comes with this delicious seasoning). I had the short rib tacos.. by far my favorite tacos... comes with six corn small tortillas.. scarfed them down and took the left overs home. One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. My husband and I were in town for a long weekend and while we went to and loved some nicer places around town, like Tratto, we relished in the slightly more casual fare at Chelsea's Kitchen: smoked trout dip, nachos with green chilies (stuff dreams are made of), fish tacos, a beautiful caesar salad. House made cookies on the way out. We'll be back next time we're in town to try the green chili burger (and order more nachos). I should note that the service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Love this place, their drinks are amazing and their outside patio is gorgeous to sit out and eat."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance, and great service. I always enjoy going out to Chelsea's Kitchen. This restaurant is also kid friendly, which is a bonus when deciding on a restaurant."}
{"text":"One of may favorites in the Phoenix area. The attention to all details is apparent - seating, lay out, art work, service, back ground music - all of it is impeccable. One key criteria for a good dining experience - does it put you in a good mood once you step in? The answer re Chelsea's is a resounding Yes. They've done a wonderful job with the layout from the entrance patio to the fresh air indoor dining area to the indoor/outdoor bar that rolls out to the outdoor dining area for a Southwest feel with a fireplace. How about the food?- ribs, salads, burgers and especially the fish taco's are highlights. I've been a dozen times - for a number of events - drinks/appetizers, business, friends/family. Great people watching and terrific energy. This is one from the LGO family of restaurants.  A real winner."}
{"text":"have never had a bad meal. From the delmar salad to the short rib tacos, everything is fresh and tasty.

very great staff, only had one bad wait experience. great free kids menu, and they are always super friendly towards my two yr old."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in all of Arizona! Can't beat it, from the food to the ambiance, to the perfect mood!"}
{"text":"For being in an airport and the stereotypes the food here is top notch. When I fly out of here in the mornings heading back east I look forward to having my breakfast here. The staff is knowledgeable and courteous and the food, like I said, I good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always had a nice time, but I now feel compelled to write a review.

My friend and I went here last night for dinner. Though they were already very busy at only 530, the service was quick and friendly and our food came very fast. 

We decided to split the Brussels sprout salad and the short rib tacos.

We were both very excited for the salad, we are both huge Brussels sprouts people. However it fell very short. It would have been a million times better if they served it warm and the Brussels sprouts slightly sauteed. Instead its just a pile of cold chopped up Brussels sprouts and very spars bacon and almonds with 2 slivers of cheese. wah wah.

The short rib tacos were the STAR of the meal and a total meal saver! These were absolutely outstanding says the girl who is not a fan of ribs. I honestly can not stop thinking about them! The flour tortillas that come with are made fresh and you can taste it. It would be helpful if the tortillas were about an inch bigger, but that's my only complaint. 

I seriously will only ever get these taco for as long as I go to Chelseas! So yum! 

the atmosphere here is very nice. I love all the over sized lamps and flower arrangements. The bathrooms are nice and clean. The booth we were in was a bit saggy and could stand to be a bit firmer, but thats minor. 

Keep it up Chelsea's!"}
{"text":"OMG. The Short Ribs are fantastic. Every time I come here, I always have the short ribs or the tacos. When you walk in the front door, be sure to grab yourself a freshly baked cookie."}
{"text":"My second time in over the last weekend (Friday around 8pm) and it was great - not too busy, comfortable outdoor patio spot, nice looking crowd, friendly young university waitress. Food was great, my date loved the wine, and I walked out happy and full after a choice steak and dessert. A buck and half lighter in the wallet, but a swell late summer Phoenix night."}
{"text":"Great wood fire grilled steak and fish dishes. Request the courtyard for a beautiful evening out with attentive service and a good wine list. The airport location was also a winning experience with a terrific burger and the best chicken sandwich ever made by man - the apple gives a hint of healthy-ness that offsets the guilt of the delicious deep fried coating."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the portions are large. The restaurant has a great patio. The only surprising element is the valet parking. However, there are a few spots to self-park."}
{"text":"Had an awesome bday dinner here. Everything was perfect. I was very happy when all my guests dinners came out together. All 15 dishes!! How awesome! Waiter was prompt with drinks((:"}
{"text":"I love this place that I H8 it!!! The food is so damn good that I will have to keep coming so just take all my monies now!  I came in to celebrate a milestone achievement for a friend of mine and we were treated to a PHEEEEEEENOMENAL feast!  We started off with the prime rib and short rib but ended up getting the chicken, mashed potatoes, deserts basically as much as we could handle to ensure that we were uncomfortable.  The managers stopped in to make sure our experience was top notch and everything from the ambience to the seating selection exceeded all expectations.  Our server Matt was on point and super friendly ensuring that we were comfortable but these times call for eating like a fat kid and laughing to drinks and good company.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I waited wayyyyy too long to come here. This place is sooooooo good. First of all, the patio. Big patio fan and this one is awesome. Lots of flowers and they were playing really good, chill music, and it helped that it was a beautiful day. We split the Del Mar salad and the Howie Burger and loved every bite of both. Also, I got a prickly pear margarita that was equal parts pretty and delicious. Every plate that came past us looked really good and I can't wait to go for brunch some time. Also, service was great and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Nice quiet little place to have breakfast or brunch. I wasn't too impressed with the egg halendaise. The price is a bit pricey for what the portions all."}
{"text":"Modern, posh interior with patio seating in the back.  Nice clean touch to the venue.  Very friendly and prompt service.  With regard to the food, you get what you pay for.  I came for brunch and had the French omelet - well made, tasted great and came with a side of bread and fruit.  Nothing spectacular, but tasty and well-prepared.  A nice place for brunch, but I have yet to eat dinner here.  

Oh, and very good looking female servers (most of them anyway).  One looks like a very young Kate Beckinsale, but thinner.  Nice. Too bad she didn't wait on our table.  

There is valet and self-parking."}
{"text":"2 stars for the service/time waiting, 4.5 stars for the food. 

Located in PHX airport, my small group of 4 people were looking for a bite to eat at 10:20 am before our flight in 1.5 hours. The hostess was pretty disorganized due to the breakfast/lunch switchover, and it took several minutes to get seated, even though the place wasn't too busy. Once we were seated, the waitress went through her routine, finally getting to offer the soup of the day. When asked what it was, she didn't know, and had to go check for 6 minutes before coming back with \"black bean\". 

We put our orders in, and waited. And waited. 35 minutes later, we were told that it shouldn't be too long, our orders did not take long to cook, they would be right out. Normally, I wouldn't mind a wait, even a 35 minute one, if someone came up and offered an explanation or reassurance that we were being looked after. Unfortunately they did not take the initiative to keep us informed, we had to reach out to them. 

Mind you, this is in an airport, where a majority of patrons probably have time-sensitive needs. This caused a bit of concern with us, as we had been waiting a while and our food had not appeared yet.

Finally, our food arrived. Chicken Nachitos, Black Bean Soup, and the Short Rib Tacos. The Nachitos had generous amounts of toppings, from guacamole to jalapenos to just the right ratio of chip:cheese. Great!

I had the short rib tacos, which were amazing, although the meat was a tad dry. Healthy amount of meat, plenty of tortillas, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Also came with a side of kale salad. Not only was the quality some of the best I've had for airport food, it was one of the best short rib tacos I've ever had, anywhere. Sentiment echoed by the other people in our group. 

We requested our check as soon as they brought the food and were able to make it out in time to be the last to board the plane, but without having to run. If you have plenty of time to kill, come hungry. If you are even semi-concerned about getting through security in a timely manner, you have a tough decision to make."}
{"text":"I'm in Denver but I go to Phoenix, especially in winter, as might some of you. This is a terrific place, really almost in Scottsdale. There is no analog in Denver, it is good food, great setting, cozy, yet energetic, a spectacular covered patio with a fireplace for those chilly days and evenings in AZ fall and winter months. OK What about the food?
Eclectic menu, spectacular salads, elegant fish tacos, incredible guacamole, I had a crispy chicken spinach salad, to die for. My partner had swordfish soft tacos, the tortillas were wonderful, the fish perfectly cooked. The Del Mar seafood salad is absolutely yummy. The short rib tacos were not terrific, but then I am not a big fan of that rib meat. One piece of red velvet cake, shared amongst four, and it was devine, moist, soft, w the best cream cheese frosting. If you are in Phoenix, go to Chelsea's Kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I can't believe it's at the airport
The Swordfish is the best ever!!!
Awesome menu.
Rachel Mulligan & Kevin are amazing servers
Great environment
Delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Im not too picky, but don't like being treated like crap. Went for a nice lunch on the patio. 45 minute wait. We were then offered a front patio spot since we didn't want to wait. Waited forever for service,drinks, and food. The table next to us were friends of the server and got everything immediately. Guess you have to know someone working there to get good service.  Will not going back."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Great food, great service. Super Yummy. Short Rib tacos. Kale slaw. Great ambiance and free valet parking, Nice!"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is a great restaurant. I love the darker atmosphere and the food is always on point. The cookies on the way out is a real treat. Try the Brussels Sprout salad or the Howie Burger."}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday and I never write reviews, I just can't get over how rude and mean our waitress was. She was just mean It ruined my birthday lunch, made me so uncomfortable. She was trying to rush us and upsell, so pushy."}
{"text":"I am surprised 
The last time I was here was 10 years ago

Not my favorite

Now exceptional and unexpected 

Definitely will come back

The chicken nachos are everything and more

The service is bar none

The prime rib was to die for

All cliches but well deserved 

I really think this is a great dining experience even the ambiance had changed and improved"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona and always enjoy visiting to enjoy the great restaurants. Chelsea's Kitchen is now one of my favorite dining spots. I recently was in Arizona for college graduation and my parents took me to Chelsea's Kitchen to celebrate.

The atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic. Most importantly the food BLEW MY MIND! Everything I ate was delicious! I recommend the tacos, (I personally had the swordfish tacos) homemade guacamole and make sure to try the ceviche. 

My dad had the burger and he raved about how great it was. I was also surprised at how delicious the French fries were.

I have always been a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, but I think Chelsea's Kitchen is 10 times better! 

I can't wait to return to Arizona to enjoy this place again!"}
{"text":"I had a pork dish when i was here. It was pretty good. The wait here was long. Definitely make reservations next time we come.

The nachos we had as an appetizer was large, we split it between 7 people (remember an appetizer not a meal). Everyone had different dishes, most of my family got Tacos. They looked really good and tasted even better..

Food was well prepared and consistent throughout.

Next time we will have to try to sit outback, because i hear it has a nice view."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen provides an excellent dining experience. I was initially impressed by the service of the staff who were eager to serve and always checking on our table. The atmosphere was also welcoming. We sat on the patio where there were lights and foliage and many gas warmers for the chilly winter evening. The food was delicious and well-presented."}
{"text":"Loved it.  The Del Mar Salad was a terrific treat of fresh seafood.  Swordfish tacos were delicious.  Excellent guacamole.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  I only wish they hadn't run out of deviled eggs because I missed tasting them! :-(  
Can't wait to return - - next time, deviled eggs!! :-)"}
{"text":"This is truly a great restaurant. I love their fried chicken. I also love the free chocolate chip cookies while you wait. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is always great. Parking is kind of tough and they usually require valet."}
{"text":"What a gem at the airport! Stopped in and had carnitas, Brussels sprout salad and sangria. I have eaten at the other location, but this one is just as good, if not better -- and at the airport! WOW. My server, Regina, was pleasant and helped keep us moving. Don't hesitate to try Chelsea's at the airport in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience here last night. We have very complicated food allergies and the staff couldn't have been better! They even use organic corn flour for their tortillas--amazing! We will definitely return very soon--thank you!!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are visiting from the East Coast and wanted something small for lunch.  Hotel recommended this place.... The guy said it was one of his favorites.  We sat outside on the patio which was very cute.  Sure it is really pretty at night with all the lights on the trees.  We decided to share a salad and tacos.  We tried Brussels sprout salad on a recommendation of another yelper - excellent choice!  Definitely recommend.  And we ordered the surf and turf tacos.  Another great choice and the guacamole and kale slaw were amazing!   I am going to attempt making kale slaw when I get home.   Definitely will visit again!  And I forgot to mention all of the servers were very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Love the pretty atmosphere outside in the garden with umbrellas.  Good service and good food, so what's not to love?
Split an order of nachos that was huge.  Only complaint is there could have been alot more chicken and cheese--and maybe some mild sliced jalapenos on the side and a little more quac and sour cream, but excellent overall.
Also, had the trout lunch special which was trout, sweet potato and some greens that were stir fried.  Good taste--fishy but it was trout which is fishy usually.
I love this place, so will be back.  It's kinda hidden and out of the way which I loved myself.  This is a place great for talking to your tablemates or for a romantic dinner.  And one of the things I particularly loved about Chelsea's is that nobody rushes you out the door.  And, by the way, when going out the door look to your right at the bunch of carmel chocolate salted cookies under a glass trifle container--take some for your ride home = they're free!
Valet parking which is free, but we came so early we parked ourselves."}
{"text":"I have only been here when it's so busy that valet is the only parking option. I am not sure if that is the norm, but it's definitely a cool spot. The first time I went the only vegan options on their menu were a stripped down salad and a very light watermelon soup. It was good, but I was still hungry. They have some other menu options that can be made vegan. The veggie tacos can be made vegan - subtract the cheese and the kale slaw. The veg burger is vegan if served on lettuce - subtract the bun, which probably has dairy. The wait staff assured me that the bread crumbs in the burger are vegan. I have no problem with the prices of the food, unless I have to subtract parts of the meal and then pay for additional sides to make up for it because I am still hungry. Since my husband feels the same about the food, it is definitely not a date-night spot for us. So I will only go here if someone else, a meat eater, really wants to and I enjoy their company (and I've had a snack before arriving)."}
{"text":"The American Airline terminal has next to nothing as far as good food options, so it's best to stop before security to eat if you have time. I like many of the options but once I started choosing better food options (paleo/whole30), eating at the airport became near impossible. Usually, I end up eating VERY bland until I am at my destination. This place has a great menu with a variety of foods you can make paleo or whole30 friendly. I had seared ahi on a lettuce wrap with avocado and veggies (confirmed made with olive oil and not butter, by the way). It was actually VERY tasty and well seasoned. Tender and delicious! Avocado wasn't all hard, was perfectly ripe, and the asparagus was cooked to tender but not mushy. Yay! A healthy place that's not bland: it's tasty!"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen serves really nice food in a casual environment.  Its the type of environment where expectations are flat and your meal exceeds what you'd expect.  Kale slaw is unique and the short rib tacos were tasty.  Velvet cake was pretty solid.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Not only is this place extremely fancy but the food is amazing. Great place to bring your significant other and have a great time out."}
{"text":"A huge treat to dine here.  Set aside the devices and just enjoy the ambiance, energy, and conversation.  And, the food here does not disappoint.  Our meal included and chips with guacamole & a smoky salsa.  A watermelon salad, side order of rotisserie dark chicken, white sangria, and the short rib tacos with a side kale salad were full of flavor, tastefully presented and certainly enjoyed.  Request booth seating, if available.  Additional tables, a bar with seating and the misted patio are also available."}
{"text":"This is NOT airport food! It's wonderful and as good as the regular Chelsea's restaurant - - the chicken soft tacos are excellent.  The service is also very good! If you're at the Phoenix airport give it a try!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch At Chelsea's kitchen.
Little bit of wait for patio but worth it
Love the deviled eggs and the tuna burger is awesome.
The outside patio has just the right amount of shade for this desert dweller.
They have to have the best Arnold Palmer in the valley.
Staff very friendly and attentive  
The vibe of the place is great"}
{"text":"Great experience. We were in town from san diego for a swim meet. Popped over afterwards with 30 people. They took us no problem, set up and had great service. The corn bread is excellent. Also try the Ahi tacos. Delish!! We will be back next time we are in Pheonix!!"}
{"text":"Delicious New American food, friendly staff, and great outdoor seating.  Nice atmosphere, would be a good spot for a date.  Prices are moderate, and the beer/wine selection is solid.  Full bar."}
{"text":"Such a fun restaurant to check out. Came in with my daughter for lunch. She loved getting the wix stix to play with instead of color crayons. The menu was easy to read through and pick something that grabbed our attention. At the beginning of the meal we had great service as well but as the lunch rush came in we soon lost our server. The atmosphere was very relaxing as well. I hope to check it out again but maybe when they are not so busy!"}
{"text":"Im from nyc and I live in scottsdale.I've eaten in chelsea's many times.The athmosphere is great, even the service is good, but the food is not great or consistant..great place to have a glass of wine and some burgers or natchos but the rest.just not very good.I eat at LGO EVERY DAY SOMETIMES 2X (SAME OWNERS) BUT THE FOOD AT CHELSEAS IS JUST SUB PAR.NO FLAVOR. I think they need to take some cues from their counterpart.
Just my 2 cents.mark"}
{"text":"Just had to complain about our server, who ignored my wife's drink order, then after I reordered for her brought it in a dirty glass.
That's sad because we really like this place and we hate leaving a bad taste in their mouths with our complaint."}
{"text":"It was absolutely delicious. It is extremely pricey but it was all worth it. All together our lunch costed $100(plus tax and a $30 tip)...I got a 7up, ahi fish tacos, and a key lime pie( me and my mom split the key lime pie), my mom got 2 glasses of wine, sword fish tacos. It was very well cooked. We got our food about 15 minutes after we ordered, our waiter was really nice and answered any question that we had. Definitely coming back here once we win the lottery. And they had good music and a fabulous atmosphere and the chairs were really comfy."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  I had the ahi tacos and a side order of french fries (because I'm a fry addict), and both were fantastic.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive, and you even get a free cookie on your way out the door!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"As much as I get disappointed when I have to give 2 stars, I always find that the description states it so well. There's no better word to describe this than meh.

I went with high hopes on a Smunch day, having never been and expecting some pretty damn good food. We were able to push all the tables out front together (well, okay, I'll give credit where it's due.. they did this for us) to accommodate our group. And that's where the good stuff ends.

I highly doubt that I was just grumpy that day, because I'm never grumpy on Smunch day, but the prices seemed a little extreme for the amount and quality of food. I don't even remember exactly what I got, which nearly never happens. I just remember having sad face when I finished. Not because it was over.. .but because it was over so soon.. and with so little flair.

The real issue came with our check. No separate checks was an absolute nightmare and they wouldn't even help us figure out how much of the tax was ours etc etc... and I looked borderline annoyed when we weren't figuring it out fast enough. I had to use a calculator people. For real.

Maybe it was the crowd that did the trick, but they knew in advance we were coming. At least a week in advance. If they couldn't handle it, all they had to say was no."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch around 11am on a Sunday morning after a lovely visit to the Desert Botanical Garden.

In a nutshell..
-complimentary valet is offered
-the decor was nice
-the food was ok
-the service was indifferent with no sense of urgency

Read on for details...
-DECOR: I can't quite put my finger on the style, but with the wicker seats we sat in, the plantation shutter windows; and open air vibe especially with the outdoor patio I just felt like we somewhere tropical like Hawaii rather than in Arizona.  

-FOOD: We ordered the DEVILED EGGS as an appetizer. The eggs arrived on a cute wooden board, each nestled in its own crevice. The extra ingredients used to dress up the deviled eggs were chives, bacon, and a bit of cayenne for heat.  The deviled eggs were yummy!  
For our entrees, my friend had the SHORT RIB TACOS with a side of a kale and quinoa salad; guac; slasa; and made-to-order corn tortillos. I ordered the FRENCH DIP with fries. We placed our order with our server. After waiting for quite awhile for our food, our server finally brought it out to us.  My friend's tacos were yummy, especially the made-to-order corn tortillas. However my french dip was nothing to rave about. Our server must've been dancing while carrying my plate because the au jus sloshed onto my fries making them extra soggy AND the fries that missed the au jus bath were still limp because they weren't fully cooked -_-  The french bread wasn't fresh. Ieft my limp, soggy fries and huge chunks of stale bread on my plate. 

-SERVICE: Me and my friend were busy chatting while waiting for our food but after awhile we noticed we had been waiting a bit longer than usual for our tacos and sandwich.  I also noticed other customers in our section, who had been seated and ordered before us, still had not received their food. One of the managers came out to talk to a few tables and appeared to apologize for the delay. At this point our server was hardly to be seen and not once approached us to explain for the long wait. 
I flagged her down to ask how much longer our food would be. She clearly acted surprised as if we had just placed our order with her a second ago. She curtly replied \"it'll be out soon, your order is at the top of the list.\" We sat waiting for another 15 min before our orders finally came -_-  By this time there had to have been about a 30+ minute wait between the time we placed our entree orders to the time our food actually got to our table. My friend's tacos came with 3 small corn tortillas and when she asked our server for more, our server acted as if that was the most unreasonable request. She eventually brought  a stack of 10 tortillas and plopped down on our table. I was like WTF, why not give more upfront that way we could have avoided her rude and ungracious attitude? 

I was very disappointed in my 1st visit here, both in my choice of dish and in the service."}
{"text":"Why is it that any time you ask a waitress what they recommend they don't know what to say or do other than say... \"Oh Gosh there are lots of things, like the salads, the burgers, or even our Entrées are really good too \" Am I the only one that gets annoyed that they read you the menu instead of actually trying to give you a good meal? 

The customer service definitely was lacking. Not a single smile nor any personalization of any kind. The ambiance pretty much says, \"eat quickly and get out.\" 
 The food is a quite pricey for what you get. $17 for a salad? That being said, the quinoa salad that i had was very delicious! Crispy and except for a few too many bell papers, definitely worth trying. While I live right down the street it would be tough for me to come here when there are other places to see. 

While I'm here I am noticing that the management is on top of their customers, and wanting to make sure they are good. This is highly appreciated, and admired. They fact that they are out and helping wherever is needed is pretty unique. 
I might have to come back and give this place another try, and hope to see better waitress service, and not eat as much so as to try their really good looking desserts."}
{"text":"I came here during one of their Sunday bunches. It was packed! Service was slow, I think our server had a large section. Food was pretty pricey, and average. Parking is terrible, valet was lined up about 15 deep. I would Uber or lyft especially if you're going to have the bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Me and my fiance went there for our first date, the food is great and the place has an amazing vibe."}
{"text":"Great food Great service just a little pricey. Every taco dish is awesome as is the french dip sandwich. Today I had the green chili cheeseburger..........fantastic with fresh roasted in house hatch chili. The sangria is also special"}
{"text":"There are a few reasons why I continue to come back to Chelsea's Kitchen time and time again, but I think the top reason why is the service.  This past Sunday, I had the pleasure of sitting in Alissa's section for brunch, and I can honestly say that she is one of the best servers I have ever had here in Phoenix.  She was attentive, bubbly, knowledgeable, and just a pleasure to be around.  Next time we come to Chelsea's (which, because of this outing, will be sooner vs later) I will 100% be asking to sit in her section again.  She elevated our usual Chelsea's experience into something even more memorable and lovely, so I highly recommend that if you dine here to request to be seated in her section.   

Thank you Alissa for your hospitality, and thank you Chelsea's Kitchen for your amazing food and atmosphere!  Cannot wait to come back again soon :)"}
{"text":"No complaints here. This is definitely a place to try and will want to keep coming back. It is casual, yet has a splash of class. The ambiance is perfect. A nice little romantic evening, or a lunch with someone you may want to impress, or a casual place to meet up with an old friend, or even a nice place to celebrate an anniversary, graduation, etc. love this place! The drinks are delicious and so is the food! My favorite are the cookies on your way out. Put this place on your list of a place you must try. You will not be disappointed! :-) 
Attached are some photos of my tasty Cesar Salad with a big fresh juicy cut of rotisserie chicken, my fruit sangria, my boyfriends order of Chelseas cheeseburger, and his Old Fashioned bourbon drink. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best swordfish tacos on the planet (well, at least in Arizona). Just an amazing place to eat. Plenty of safe gluten-free options (including the fries and chips). Knowledgeable waiters and chefs. I would eat here every day if I could afford it. Plus all the wine I drink here - pretty great list (but not a lot of Arizona wines - I would take them down 1/2 a star for that if I could)."}
{"text":"My chicka and I are here to relax and celebrate her birthday. It was a awesome time because she told me that she loved the food at Chelsea's Kitchen but I thought she said she loved me! whoops mistakes are herd but she kisses me with passion. 

Back to the food. The food and atmosphere are awesome. The patio is to die for and the place is well kept. The staff is attentive and the brussel sprout salad is a must get. Also have a the cornbread. The bar is full service and has many drinks to offer. 

My girl and I are foodies (snobs) from CA and we love good chow... This was good chow. If in Scottsdale/ Phoenix are of 40th st hit this place up. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant outside of security at PHX!  Service was good, food was awesome!  I am usually only passing through but this week I had the opportunity to spend a couple of days in the area. I would highly recommend Chelsea's Kitchen to all who venture this way."}
{"text":"I've been to Chelsea's kitchen many times and highly recommend it  from the ambience to the amazing food but last night was truly one of the best experiences ever, The staff is always kind and polite our waiter Preston who took care of us truly went above and beyond with gratitude and gratefulness, he took the time to interact with us making the experience even better then the ambience and the food itself of course we had the Dixie panfried chicken which is amazing the deviled eggs appetizer,  I highly recommend this experience for anyone...

{"text":"What a gem! 

From the outside parking lot you think that maybe you made a mistake because it is in a off beat location and it looks like a house that was converted but once you go inside, see the bar, outdoor area and the dinning room you know that you are in for a treat.

The food, atmosphere and service was exceptional!  The vibe that this place has is so calming and the music that they play really made this a great hip date place.

We ate inside but the outdoor patio looked like it would be fun.  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My daughter recommended this restaurant so we decided to give it a try.
We met some friends for our annual New Year's dinner at 7:30 PM. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table and the maitre d' comp us with chips and dip. 
Three of is ordered the Chilled Shrimp Ceviche which was out of this world. I was expecting raw fish, but it had lots of shrimp with avocado, jicama and tomatoes. My wife had the TUNA TARTARE & GUACAMOLE made with fresh tuna, radish, soy-lemon vinaigrette and another person had the LGO CAESAR salad with whole leaf romaine, reggiano parmesan.
The gals ordered a bottle of Pino Noir and two of us had lemonade which was a bit tart, but better than sweeten with sugar.
For our entree, I had Chelsea's short ribs which I thought I was going to fight getting the meat off the bone. Surprise, surprise...this was the best tender short rib that I had in my LIFE. It was amazing and tasty. The prime rib and 'filet on the bone' looked \"OH SO GOOD\". There were no complaints whatsoever.
The wives had two orders of the roasted chicken and lobster taco. One of the ladies found uncooked chicken towards the bone. She just told the Christina, our waitress and a few minutes later the maitre d' came by and gave her a $20 gift card.
We ordered the apple tart and red velvet cake and coffee. The coffee was freshly made at our table with a 'coffee press'. 

I was very impressed with the service and the food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We didn't have time to make breakfast this morning and since Paradise Bakery was gone from the concourse, we decided we'd get our breakfast burrito to go.
We began eating our burritos in the waiting area. My wife started eating hers and after 10 minutes, I started on mine. 
First. My burrito started falling apart before I could get a bite out of it. Ended up eating it with a fork, secondly, the other half started falling apart when I tried to pick it up. When I lifted the burrito, the underside of the burrito was soggy and dripping wet from the salsa. My wife's wasn't like that and for that reason, this place deserves just a half of one star.

4/17/2014
I changed this from 1 star to 2 stars because I was a bit harsh. It was just a poor execution that drove me crazy. The flavors were there which was hidden by the way the burrito was wrapped."}
{"text":"So, I was missing New York City...especially that really cool farmhouse restaurant called Friend of a Farmer....anyhooo...  I was driven to this jaunt by some caring and concerned friends.  Here is the play by play experience...
We pulled up and were valet parked for free.  We walked in after 8pm on a Friday on a holiday weekend and were immediately seated.  The booths are fabulously placed and private somehow.  Menus distributed it took seconds for Alison to offer us their famous white sangria which I winced a bit at because they do not have red sangria at all.  But you know I still indulged.  Then moments later a very HOT guys whose name I did not manage to get but whose profile I did capture, placed our beverages in front of us.  Clinking glasses we realized that having to save to go out instead of going out EVERY day could really be okay.  The economy a concern, we still found the place reasonably priced.  I mean, the cost of the Sangria pitcher was about $20 and that pitcher well satisfied us.
Then, due to what was explained to us as having to deal with some \"interesting characters\", and only after one of us went to the host to solicit some attention, Alison...our missing server resurfaced.  She was apologetic and lovely.  Fearing that she might never return, we dumped all that we wanted on her at once...  The sashimi tuna, the shrimp esceviche, the mac and cheese, the rotisserie chicken, the swordfish tacos, and the soft-shell crabs were all drool-teasers listed that we simply had to try!  We even hinted early that the desert of Destruction by Chocolate and Red Velvet and Key Lime Pie might be victims and the CSI team could be tipped off that it would have been us that done it!

Not quite sure that this place would be able to pull off good drinks and excellent food, I let my eyes wander around the space that was created.  I excused myself from my friends to continue my search on foot.  I found a perfect oasis outside in the form of a delightful outdoor dining room which we had refused the offer to sit in upon arrival...clearly not knowing how wonderfully appointed this space would be.  There was a lovely fireplace, good intimate lighting, defined areas of conversation, and what appeared to be very attentive service.  I went to the ladies room and found that there was great style continued in there and the room was immaculate... really.

Returning to the table, I was greeted by the appetizers.  All was lovely.  To begin, the escheviche was perfectly marinated.  The tuna was so nice and fresh.  I really had to ask Alison where the tuna came from?  It was confirmed that the seafood is daily sent in from California and that nothing really just sits there...  This gave me hope since I am such a seafood lover and Arizona really has few waterfront opportunities.  

The main dishes arrived timely and exceeded expectations.  The rotisserie chicken was so tender, seasoned without being over-done, juicy, and afloat a lovely risotto.  I can still taste it 12 hours later!  YUM.
The mac and cheese was a white one but for me it was nothing special...It will please those who want a grown up mac and cheese without actually having any kick or  additional flavor to sort out.  It was a little bland but smooth and would compliment another dish that was full of flavor...
I am not gonna lie.  That soft-shell crab was almost as good as being in LaCombe, Louisiana for the Blue Crab Festival!  

The  swordfish tacos were adequately portioned and flavorful.  You will not go wrong with this option, especially if you plan on having room for the deserts I mentioned.

And yes, we had them.  They came with a scoop of Haagen Daaz in some cases so we just HAD to order them.

Definitely give this place a try.  It is good for double dates...I think.  Ask the table next to you when you get there...  I did."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Great patio. HUGE patio, with a large fire.  Great happy hour specials, amazing food.  YOu cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good and we had a great server, Kimberly but food was not that great. Burger was blah , no taste. Server offer to help but I was not there to get free stuff. But the funny part is 2 managers just keep walking around and around and not even checking on any table or even talk to guests in the restaurant. Even when we were leaving one female manager just stare at us leaving not even a thank you good bye. Wow where do we get these worthless managers. Food could be better.. Doesn't matter I am not going there anymore."}
{"text":"I had 2 hours to kill before my flight to London. I thought of eating at Chelsea. But very disappointed with the service (slow) and food ( over cooked burger )when I ask for medium rare.  No manager to be found around. Anyway not very impressed. Just feed back ."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chelsea's for at least 15 years. I love the location and look forward to the winter months when I can truly enjoy the outdoor area. 

The food is always amazing and the staff pleasant.  My only suggestion would be to have bartenders who know how to make a drink.  To state you've made thousands of a particular drink and for it to taste so awful the drink order changed says it all and is the reason for three instead of four stars"}
{"text":"Met up here with a friend for dinner who came in for a meeting. Seeing as how it's in the airport, I was skeptical. 

We had the kale/quinoa salad, deviled eggs and chips and guacamole. Kale salad was pretty good size.  My friend brought up a good point- you want to share this or at least take the rest to eat later.  It's a lot of roughage for one person. Good and light dressing. The flavors went well - kale, quinoa, sunflower seeds, red bell pepper, lemon rind zest, Parmesan cheese, and grapes.  Refreshing. 
Eggs were yummy but is anything not when you put bacon on it?  Good heaping amount of mixture. Not thee best I've ever had but pretty darn tasty.  
Chips and guacamole are house made.  Nothing mind blowing but still good.  Salsa had a kick and roasted flavor so that is good.  Not weak.  

Overall, pretty good for airport food considering I dont think highly of airport food. This did not let me down. I heard they make handmade tortillas so I gotta try their other location."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the best food I've had in Phoenix is at the airport.  In the ex-location of not remotely missed Chilis to boot.  My waitress Regina surely has shrines built to her by tired discerning travelers.  She sat me down, told me to relax & enjoy, explained the specials, gave me her recommendations & left me only after explaining where I could charge my phone. I'm a foodie from San Francisco. The swordfish tacos Regina recommended were sublime with wood fired fish that melted in my mouth & corn tortillas still hot from their maker.  I'm an ex-waitress who knows & appreciates being waited on by a server who knows food & cares for her diners' enjoyment.  Regina was that.    I will be back here every time I come through Phoenix.  Did I mention French press coffee?  Oh yes"}
{"text":"We made a reservation at Chelsea's Kitchen for Father's Day for 8 people requesting an indoor table.  
We were there prior to opening.  When we were greeted by the hostess she wanted to seat us outside.  We explained that we had requested inside. She then tried to seat us at a large booth in the south west corner of the restaurant which at most could accommodate 6 people.  When I said that it would not fit us, she took us to a larger round table in the south east corner of the restaurant and threw the menus on the table.  The tables at Chelsea's have posts embedded in the concrete floor making them unmovable.  The food was Ok.  Service was OK.  Hostess very rude.  Will not go back again.  There are so many great choices in Phoenix why would anyone go to a restaurant where you were not treated well?"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant!  Sit outside on the patio, even when its chilly it's not bad out here due to the fireplace and multiple space heaters.

Had brunch, the pancakes, light and fluffy and delicious.  One curiosity was the strong lemon flavor to the pancakes.  It wasn't bad at all, they were excellent, but there was no mention of the lemon flavor and it might turn off some people.

Great fresh squeezed orange juice in the screwdrivers as well :)"}
{"text":"So happy we did this! We asked our nail tech for a place for lunch-- this was the only place she said we should go! Great parking, seated quickly, yum chicken nachitos app. Then short rib, swordfish tacos and salmon all a hit! Ambience and decor were fun and comfortable. Waitress (Kim) was attentive and fun, straightforward with recommendations and banter! Will come back when return to town!"}
{"text":"Mehhh... Airport Food. But it's Chelsea's Kitchen! ... but in the airport... 

So confusing. I've been to Chelsea's kitchen outside the airport and something happens to food when it is brought into an airport - it doesn't taste as good. The presentation isn't as beautiful.... 

Side of potatoes $3   - crumbly, mushy, weird tiny cubes of seasoned potato that I would have easily believed were from a crappy corporate luncheon catered by Joes Shmo Deli in Wichita. 

The Huevos Rancheros were OK. Not worth the $13 though. Only had one corn tortilla buried under a mound of scrambled eggs with sauce, a pile of bitter greens separated it from a side of potatoes. A prettier side of potatoes than the other side of potatoes we ordered. 

However! Our waitress was very sweet, talkative and attentive. Loved her. She's getting married in November so congratulate her if you go!"}
{"text":"Quick Update....

They no longer serve the Mac & Cheese. Its a terrible tragedy. :("}
{"text":"I've been to Chelsea's in the past so this really isn't my first time here nor was it my only great experience but that was my pre-Yelping days so here it goes.

I took my mother here today for a second Mother's Day outing and arrived a little after opening which was good as the place was packed by noon. The hostess was friendly and sat us at a booth. I love the interior of this place; lots of brick, stone, wood and high ceilings not to mention a beautiful bar overlooking the patio which I will definitely be returning to check out more closely. 

Started out by ordering the Prickly Pear Margarita...so yummy and it's a pretty drink (hot pink). Perfect for the hot weather. We split the Del Mar Salad...amazing! The shrimp and crab tasted fresh and there were generous portions of both along with jicama, avocado, and tomatoes. Afterwards, we split the French Dip with fries. The meat was so tender and delicious! Next time, I'll probably add cheese as I felt it was only missing a slight something. The fries were yummy and they tasted like they were seasoned with something sweet...unexpected but good none the less.

Our server was Cara and she was great.She was very friendly without seeming fake and over the top. 

My only problem is how to avoid going to Chelsea's Kitchen all the time as I've moved in right near by. I guess I'll need to remind myself that while it isn't unreasonably priced, it's not the cheapest either. Who knows if that will even stop me?"}
{"text":"Had my first eggs benedict here  (w/ the spinach and crab cakes ). Amazing and very large meal. Thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommended this spot for Foodies."}
{"text":"As I type this I have decided that I might be slightly obsessed with Chelsea's kitchen...the food is fabulous, the restaurant ambiance is fantastic, and service is always impeccable. What more can you ask for?? I think the prices are moderate, but the food is always fresh and delicious no matter what I order, and I never leave disappointed. 

Must have is the Brussels sprout salad (It's aaaaamazing! Don't ask questions, just order it!) they will even split it to share as a starter. Other faves are the tuna tartare and guacamole, tacos (fish and chicken are both great), and the kale and quinoa salad is awesome. 

The patio is perfection from October-April. In the colder months they have a wonderful outdoor fireplace and plenty of heaters to keep you comfortable. The sangria by the pitcher is amaze as well! 

Just go."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is a gem for a 20-something young professional looking for a hot spot in Arcadia. The ambience is classy, dimly lit and decorated by a mahogany wood finish. Bottomless mimosas are $12, and although the menu is a little bit more expensive, the food is very much worth it. If you're looking for a unique and impressive dish, try the Chilequiles. This is perfect to take a group of friends looking for a ritzier brunch."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about Chelsea's kitchen, and I'm glad I finally checked it out. 

The food is fantastic. 
Most of us had the Howie Burger. Topped with caramelized onions, Gruyere, and a dijon sauce, it's a simple and perfect burger. The fries were really crispy and seasoned with garlic salt. Not really my thing, but I've never really been a big french fry guy. Everyone else liked them. 
My girlfriend and another person in our party had the taco platters. My girlfriend had the Ahi Tuna. I tried a small piece of the fish, which was wonderful. As much as I liked my burger, I want to go back just to try any of the other items on the menu, because this was so good. It's also one of the few times I've seen her nearly clear her entire plate. The other guy had the pork taco platter, and really liked it. 
We also split a pitcher of the Famous White Wine Sangria. A very sweet and satisfying drink. 

The atmosphere is cool. 
It has both a cozy and upbeat feeling. The music was a little louder than I would like, but that seems to be the \"in thing\" at restaurants nowadays. I hear the patio is the place to be, especially around sunset, but I guess that's an experience I'll need to save for another time. A note on parking, the only way to park is valet. It's complimentary, so there's no reason to complain (unless you're too cheap to tip the guy a buck or two). I just always find it funny when I watch a valet run to my car, when it's just a couple of feet away. It would quicker and more efficient to just give me my keys. 

Chelsea's Kitchen is definitely the place to be. It was still pretty busy at 8:00 on a Saturday night, and the restaurant kept filling up after we were seated. Plus there were five people in our party, and four of us ended up having someone we knew come over to our table, or we went over to someone else's table to say 'hi.' 

And on a humorous note... 
While waiting, a couple people in our party who arrived early ordered an appetizer. The bar was packed, so they got it while waiting outside, instead. A manager had taken care of the order, but the charge was never added to our bill. Taking an honest approach, one of the people in our party tracked down that manger to inform him of the mistake. He comped it anyway, and jokingly asked that if anyone Yelps, to just give them a good review. 
[I already planned to, but] little did he know..."}
{"text":"My favourite thing is to walk into a restaurant with my child and have him be greated with smiles rather than dismay. Handing a child a kids menu and letting them pick their own meal like the little person they are and giving them something to entertain them until food arives. This is part of what has made a few visits to Chelsea's Kitchen a true joy for me. 

Staff has always been superb from greetings to goodbyes. 

Food is always amazing beyond words. I've tried the tri tip tacos and the green chile burger and the nachos and the mac'n'cheese. You know I can't go somewhere and not try the mac'n'cheese. Be prepared to eat people. The Food is worth the price. Great heaping portions. Don't be afraid to ask for a to-go box!"}
{"text":"I wasted a lot of time not coming here because I thought it was just another trendy spot. I was wrong!! The food and friendly staff are equally amazing. This is a great place for date night, girls night, or out of town guests. It's a crowd pleaser for sure but I've also sat at the bar alone and had a wonderful time. Try the brussel sprout salad and short rib tacos!!! That's pretty much all I can ever order because I love them so much. Also do yourself a favor and check out brunch on Saturdays /Sundays with $12 bottomless mimosas. You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Recommended by one of the airport greeters and what a great airport restaurant! I started with the special squash soup... It was perfect. Not too sweet - just right with creme fresh and pine nuts. I then had the sashimi grade ahi tuna tacos and they were killer! Just get 'em! Service was friendly and attentive. I'm a big fan after one visit."}
{"text":"While waiting to catch our flight home, hubby & I stopped in to have a quick breakfast.  Overall food was good.  I had an egg white omelet with veggies ... pretty fresh tasting, as well as fruit to accompany!  Hubby had the muesli and he was expecting the portion to be smaller, so it was very filling for him ... no biggie really.

Service was a little slow given that it was early and no one was really there, so they lost a star for that.  Nonetheless, pretty good!"}
{"text":"The environment is welcoming and friendly. We were sat right away considering they said the wait would be 35 minutes. The food was excellent we recommend the deviled eggs with bacon, the burger, and any of the tacos. The only flaw as our service. Our waitress came around after we had been sitting there 10 minutes. And came back to take our order with her face in a screen never looking up at us. Overall it was a good experience, but wish our waitress spent more time with her guests than the screen."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It's such a cute spot for brunch, lunch, dinner, you name it! The inside of the restaurant is beautiful but the outside patio in the back is something special. It's perfect for a romantic date. Not a stuffy place at all. The food was also great and the service even better. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both travel a lot and we happened to be passing at the airport and thought we'd stop and have a nice lunch for the hour that we would see each other. Thought is the key word here. We both ordered the soup and caesar salad with chicken. Pretty hard to screw up right? Wrong again. Both soups were cold, not supposed to be, and the salad with chicken was just plain bad. The salad had a very light amount of dressing and the chicken was dry. Also, we waited at least 20 minutes for our soup and salads, long enough to drink our can of diet coke, yes can, that they charge over $2 for. Here's the kicker, when we told our waitress she said that the bowl has a lot of surface area and it cools the soup down and the other was never heated to the proper temp. What the heck? 

Anyway, I will not be returning there again for very overpriced bad food. I'ld rather get food from one of the kiosks past security."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was because I had survived a stressful week of midterms or the ambiance, but Chelsea's Kitchen was an excellent place to unwind. 

My flight to LAX was delayed on a Saturday night, so my guy and I took advantage of the situation and parked ourselves here. 

We shared the Chips, Salsa and Guacamole and an Oregon Pinot Noir. 

I'm a big fan of the original Chelsea's Kitchen and this location certainly did not disappoint - And going in, I had zero expectations given this is an airport. 

The salsa was perfectly smokey, the guacamole as fresh as it could be. 

Our server even offered us additional chips to not leave any of that goodness behind, but we declined. 

Great music, calming lighting, did not feel rushed at all, solid service all around. 

I'm not sure if it was the time we were there (after 7PM on a Saturday) but Chelsea's provided the right atmosphere to mellow out in between two stressful events!"}
{"text":"One of my faves! The short ribs with the egg on top...sublime.
the fish tacos-the best. I love the atmosphere and the servers are great."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is where it's at. Bottomless mimosas... enough said :) They have one of the best patios around. Shaded by the trees and it's dog friendly!"}
{"text":"I had the tuna tar tare and it was not that good they put a little bit of tuna and a gigantic amount of guac on it not to mention it was pretty tasteless"}
{"text":"7/4/12

I'd visited a few years ago, but it was too busy, and I didn't have time to wait 30 to 45 minutes to be seated, so I left.  I've had CK bookmarked to try since.  When I heard word that CK was offering a Fourth of July special (buy one entree, get the second for $4), I thought it was time to see what all the fuzz was about.

Two weeks beforehand, I made plans with a cousin to have lunch here on the 4th.  What a surprise to find out that CK was serving brunch, as well, and we breakfast lovers were thrilled to check out the breakfast items.  While our server went to check on a few ingredients for me, my cousin decided she'd try one of CK's more popular menu items, the Green chile burger, with poblano chile, cheddar, and chipotle aioli. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg#MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg  As you may notice, the kitchen had forgotten to add the chipotle aioli, but this was quickly remedied when we asked for some.  (Service during lunch was very friendly and quick.)  I couldn't decide between the French omelet (which, funnily enough, my cousin and I initially mistook to be French toast and wanted to order this immediately) and the Lemon-ricotta hotcakes, but when I was told I could order one pancake for around $2, I chose the Classic French omelet, with sauteed spinach, gruyere, and herbs http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA#TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA and a hotcake.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA#dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA  The omelet struck me as overcooked, and it was.  I asked my cousin to try it, and she too didn't like it, so I let our server know, and she quickly offered to take it away and replace it with something else.  I chose a plate of hotcakes, since we pretty much inhaled the first one!  I apologize for the lack of a photo...  My hunger got the best of me.  BTW, cousin loved her burger-- she finished all of the meat!  I never knew she could eat as much as me.  :)

The decor was beautiful-- lovely dark wooden tables and chairs, cozy booths lined with dark wooden beams, and heavy red fabric curtains, lightened with light-colored flowers, adorned the windows.  It felt classy bistro married country French and had a baby.  It worked for me.  

A few days leading up to the Fourth, I thought a friend would enjoy trying out the dinner menu with me, so we agreed to meet there slightly before 6p.  It was very busy, much louder, and darker indoors that night.  The wait proved to be around 30 mins, or so, and we were given a buzzer as we elected to wait at the bar.  He ordered a cucumber-laced cocktail, while I asked for a blackberry-prickly pear concoction.  Both glasses were served to us without coasters or napkins, so our glasses left puddles on the table from which water would eventually end up dripping from our glasses to other points of the table, or, in my case, on me.  Even when we were finally seated at the table, our cocktail glasses remained un-coastered (is that even a word?), but now we had water glasses, too.  What a mess...

Before we were seated, I had to use the restroom, and I'd already noted earlier, as we walked towards the bar, that it's much harder to traverse the restaurant's space on my four-inch heels.  Not so much because of the heels, but because the textured floor was very slippery, and it wasn't even wet then.  On my return from the restroom, I had to pass the hallway between the kitchen and the bar, and I slipped on a water spill.  Thankfully, I was able to recover without having to hit the ground, but when I hailed a passing employee to alert her of the spill, how I almost had an accident, and that maybe she could see that it was taken care of, she just looked at the spill, then at me, and then proceeded to head to wherever she was going before I stopped her.  She didn't acknowledge that there was a problem, so I assumed she didn't care and wasn't going to do anything about it.  

The food was OK-- he wanted to try the salmon ($22), but was going to order the filet mignon ($37) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA#W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA, and I secretly wanted to try the filet, so I ordered the fish, so that we could try both!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg#oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg  The filet was TERRIFIC.  Perfectly cooked- he asked for pink throughout, but there were a few red spots.  Still tasted amazing.  The kitchen ran out of mixed veggies so friend ended up with bok choy, which he's never had before, but soon learned to like it.  The salmon would've been very good, if it didn't have a slight rancid-fish taste to it.  The lemon-white wine reduction helped.  Still, our plates were clean at the end of our meal.  (He was hungry.)

Thanks to CK for brunch and dinner.  In spite of a few mishaps, we all enjoyed the experiences."}
{"text":"Been a coupla years since travelling to/from Sky Harbor.  All new local restaurants and brew pubs.  Great service, beautiful decor, relaxing atmosphere, and welcoming staff.  Just a quick glass of bubbly, fast check-out and on my way in a jiff.  Recommend before you have to deal with TSA/Security which is expedited if you have those pre-Check clearances.  Safe travels!"}
{"text":"Great environment. The waitress was knowledgeable on the wine selection. Had the guacamole tuna tartar and the salmon entree.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mom's first question to me when she picks me up from the airport is always \"are you hungry?\" This last time it was 9 AM and my answer was \"yes, starving!\"
She insisted we go to Chelsea's Kitchen right there in the airport. I was very skeptical. I'd been up since 4 and I wasn't in the mood for something akin to the quality of Chili's To Go or even Paradise Bakery. Fortunately, I was wrong & this place was great.
First of all, the staff was so so nice. Our host seated us right away and got us a highchair. He even showed us pictures of his own one-year-old (who is adorable btw). I know that having an energetic toddler in your restaurant can be irritating at best, but our servers were all very sweet and accommodating. 
The food itself was great. Their menu was small but included sweet, savory, and vegetarian options. They have a few kid-friendly choices not on the menu, too. My mom and I both ordered the gruyere omelette (she added bacon and avocado to hers) and coffee. I ordered the oatmeal for my son. The coffee came out quickly in our own mini carafe. It was hot and strong and delicious. Our omelettes were tasty and came with a warm English muffin with citrus butter & some kind of jelly- maybe prickly pear? Idk but it was great. My son ate almost half of his big bowl of oats, which is impressive for him. 
This restaurant is a gem- good food and great service at the airport, of all places."}
{"text":"Love their outdoor seating area, love their crab cakes & their kale salad, and love their complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies. This place is just so fun to go to, and I've found that everyone I meet pretty much feels the same way. Kind of wish they accepted reservations, but I can clearly see they don't really need them with how packed they always are."}
{"text":"From a romantic diner date to a Sunday brunch, Chelsea's Kitchen is the perfect spot. The quality of the service and the food deserve more than 5 stars. The outdoor patio is beautiful, can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"I went to Arizona over the winter holiday and I tried over a dozen restaurants that were highly rated by Yelpers.  Chelsea's Kitchen was by far my favorite of the entire trip.

Service is top notice.  The foods were extremely delicious.  The culinary staff knows what they are doing.

If you are ever in the Phoenix area on a nice day, stop by for brunch and request outdoor seating.  There are a bunch of birds in the trees that sing to you while you enjoy your excellent food.

Don't forget to grab a complimentary cookie on the way out."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was great! Came with a large group and our server was super friendly and handled our group of 13 with no problem. Everyone in our group loved the food; there is something for everyone. We brought two vegans a vegetarian a paleo eater and the rest of us did not discriminate any food. Awesome that we were all able to get a great meal."}
{"text":"Teeming masses of hungry foodies have overrun Chelsea's original location, making the parking situation difficult but not impossible...you'll need to be somewhat creative.
The problem, as I like to define it is this:
The lure of a fine meal, fast service and reasonable prices simply won't dispel the shame associated with blowing a valet. 

Hello Chelsea's Airport.
A mere five miles from the original located in Terminal 4, this location is never crowded and, if you're in a hurry, they offer a Chelsea's Express window adjacent to the entrance.

On my most recent visit, the rotisserie prime rib was in order. Fortunately, they had an end cut available, making the experience even more enjoyable.
The sides were equally delicious. Blanched, cold green beans in a light lemon vinaigrette along with a DD-cup of garlic mashed potatoes. Nom. Nom. Nom. 

Oh, and the parking is ample, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 charging only four dollars per hour.
Four bucks! That's it. 
A lot less messy too. 

Any bets on how long it takes for YelpHQ to remove this one?
I've never made their ROTD award, but I do routinely win their other ROTD award.
\"Removal of the Day.\""}
{"text":"Okay, while I have not been back. I am a HUGE proponent of being touched base with by owners/managers when I have a less than satisfactory experience.  A manager reached out to me and I will be emailing her back, but hearing her concern and that she wanted to make sure that they addressed any concerns I had is a HUGE plus for me.  Enough to go up two stars. Thank you for caring Chelsea's.  : )"}
{"text":"Had a burger here before my flight and the chef was nice enough to split my plate with my mom (we were hungry, but not enough to each have a burger). They had a generous amount of fries and even added extra seasoning per my request. 

If you're in the airport waiting for your flight and looking for a place to eat, they may seem pricey but its because they actually have good food."}
{"text":"This is why Not just me but most people traveling look for and love local places to eat. Driving past Chelsea's kitchen my coworker was talking me to the Biltmore area for dinner. As we were taking I mentioned I love to try local places ,  and in a split second he took a U turn and we were driving in the opposite direction and parked at Chelsea's kitchen. It was buzzing with activity , parking almost full ( must mention the free valet !!) , and people galore. We were immediately seated and had 5 more minutes of Happy hour. So took advantage of the $5 cocktail. I got the End Game , vodka with cucumber and chillies which was not great. But my Ahi tuna taco platter was worth every penny and minute spent at this place. Service was quick and the aioli and quinoa salad side with guac and fresh salsa were over the top great. I loved the homey feel and simple tasty food."}
{"text":"First time visit. I was excited to learn this place is owned by the same people LGO.
The restaurant is Beautiful on the inside. I did not sit outside.
I ordered the deviled eggs and they were very tasty. I loved them. Nothing crazy, similar to what we make at home but they had bacon sprinkled on.

Crispy Chicken sandwich and fries.
The Fries tho- YUMMY. They rank in my top 3 for fries. So good.
The chicken sandwich was ok.

I look forward to trying other item"}
{"text":"Fiance took me here on our first date and we hadn't been back for almost 3 years. We are complete idiots to not have. This place is SO great. We were waiting for a table at the bar and ended up eating at the bar because we were enjoying the people and bartenders. 

The bar is inside/outside with the way the windows work, so we got to enjoy the feel of being outside on their killer patio with out actually being outside. 

The first time we went, I had the braised beef tacos and we had the ceviche to start. This time around we had the deviled egss, I had the fried chicken and he had something else that I cant remember. Everything was fantastic and it made us realize that we need to come here more often."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem, beautiful location, ambiance is fantastic, food was delicious, service was above par, most certainly will visit again."}
{"text":"A wonderful setting with friendly service and delicious food! We had a large party, including one child, and were easily accomadated. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"On my second visit to Chelsea's Kitchen it was on Mother's Day.  They were very busy, we had a reservation and didn't have to wait too long for our table.  We had a party of 5 people, one being my 8 year old daughter.  I ordered a steak, a cocktail and dessert at the end.  A few things didn't go well, including somehow they did not even put in my daughters meal order and we had to ask where her food was 3 times before we found out.  She was upset because we were all just about done eating when they finally brought her food out. We had asked to have a manager come over a few times before what looked to be a young kid came by and never once said he was management or even address the problems we were having at our table.  My steak was also not cooked the way I asked so it had to be sent back which I hate doing but it was Mother's Day dinner and I should be able to eat the steak the way I ordered it especially at their prices.  After much miscommunication between the waitress and one of the managers who looked like a young kid, the head manager, Chris finally came to our table to talk to us about the terrible Mother's Day dinner experience we had.  He was extremely nice and did what a good manager should do for good customer service.  We will go back due to Chris making us feel like we actually mattered and not just another customer they didn't care if we come back or not.  We are grateful that Chris went above and beyond our expectations and that is the only reason we will be going back to see if they can redeem themselves with better service."}
{"text":"Great food with very good service. We ate on the patio in the evening. There is a fireplace and there are lights on the trees. The food is healthy and tasty. I had the free range chicken. Good wine selectionsn as well. usually a wait but worth it!"}
{"text":"Had the prime rib Friday night.  Holy schmoly it was awesome.  Very tender... super tasty.
Involved some arm twisting for me to NOT order the beloved Howie burger... but was glad I tried this delish plate.  Mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.  Only complaint was that the veggies were cold.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for dinner because of  it's overall quality. I love the ambiance, I always make sure to request the patio.. during the cold times they have a fire place going and the warm times they have the steamers up and running. This place can be very busy, but the wait is worth it! Food is delicious and not too expensive! For a total of 60$ we had gazpacho, deviled eggs, Ethan's tacos, and a bottle of rose. If your Vegan they have some of the best tacos I've ever had called \"Ethan's tacos\" I order it every time."}
{"text":"Reading my previous review, I felt I needed to update. While the whole of my review still stands, we've since had better experiences on the patio and the food is just plain great. Everything on the menu is done extremely well, including the options for kids. 

I will say that it is too expensive, even for the exceptional food and service. $20 bucks for tacos is highway robbery....even if they are really freaking good tacos. 

The cocktails are also amazing.

All in all, wait for your parents to come into town and suggest Chelsea's and make sure the bill winds up in front of your Dad and you're golden."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is a great restaurant. Absolutely the most uncomfortable bar area ever, but the food is so incredible that I just avoid the bar entirely. 

I enjoy that you won't find a Budweiser or Coors here (don't hate... I love my Bud Light poolside as much as the next red-blooded Arizona asshole, but it's a nice touch to expose those who might otherwise be unwilling to something new and delicious. Case in point: my father, a republican, Nascar-watching Miller Lite drinker, loves to have a Stella while he's here. That's saying something.). The food is wonderfully and artfully prepared, and my otherwise simple male companions always find new favorites here. 

The menu features accessibly delicious meals that men won't feel emasculated ordering (the spit-roasted prime rib, dixie pan-fried chicken), but still accommodates that girly bitch who lives at 44th and Thomas, but insists she's in Arcadia (Arcadia Featured salad, Vegetarian Nut Burger).

This could be why my Chelsea's is the only place my kooky family can agree upon."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a while and I finally made it here this past weekend. I loved the ambiance and decor! There were so many delicious sounding items on the menu. We started with the chips and guacamole, which was tasty as well as the salsa! For dinner, I settled for a caesar salad with white chicken. The salad was good, but I especially loved the way the chicken was served. My mom ordered the salmon and ate every last bite. 

This place can be a bit spendy depending on what you order, but it is worth it. I would recommend this place and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot in Phx! Service was great, prices are great and the quality of the food was amazing. 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Talk about fine dining at an airport! There is really great ambiance at this place and the prices were affordable.

I had the ahi salad which was good... needed a bit more flavor but it was just great with the guac side and my glass of wine :)

If you are at the Phoenix airport, this is a must :)"}
{"text":"Awesome environment, friendly and professional staff! Me and my sister went here randomly on a Sunday, surprisingly there was not a line outside the door. There is a huge selection of seating where you will most likely be seated asap. I don't lie when I express how impressed I was with their food. Don't believe me? Try their pancakes and try to tell me they aren't the best you have ever had. Will surely be there soon!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on lunch and dinner visits.
I've got to say that Chelsea's Kitchen is more hype than anything else. If I had only been to Chelsea's once and ate the short rib tacos, I'd probably be giving this place 4 or 5 stars. But since I've been there several times (at the request of visitors and friends) and have tried several items on the menu, I would have to say Chelsea's is your typical American new style restaurant. It's just OK.
I will say though that if you do go, the Short Rib Tacos and the White Sangria are the things to get. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend other items as they do not stand out. Also as a random comment, they have some neat bathrooms."}
{"text":"A really good restaurant at an airport?!?!  Arrived at the airport a bit early getting ready to fly home and we were looking to grab dinner.  One of the airport employees recommended Chelsea's for a 'sit down' place.  Thank you sir, that was a good call.  Definitely a more upscale feel for an airport restaurant.  There was a wait for a table, so we put in our name and headed to the bar.  Found some nice casual seating by the bar and decided to eat there instead.  

Started off with a good IPA and I ordered the French Dip, and my co-worker the Rib Eye Tacos.  Wasn't expecting anything great, but they delivered.  The French Dip and fries were delicious.  The sliced  rib eye for the  soft shell tacos looked like it was cooked perfectly and my co-worker thoroughly enjoyed it.  Overall, it was a really good meal, as I was very pleasantly surprised.  If you need a meal and have the time, I would recommend this to anyone flying in or out of Phoenix (it is almost worth going to the airport for dinner).  A bit pricey since it is at the airport, but best meal I have had at an airport by far..."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I couldn't figure out what to eat. I took the Bartenders suggestion and tried the short rib tacos with a brussel sprout salad. It was good but i should have adventured the menu. Ambiance was perfect at the bar. Staff was very nice and peasant. Several serves stopped by us at the bar for small talk."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Chelsea's. The place has a great warm feel and look. Menu seemed limited, but maybe it was just a lunch menu. My colleague had the short-rib tacos; tortillas were homemade and looked very delicious. I had the burger; very good. The bun needs to be upgraded to something better. I will be back to Chelsea's."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! No denying that. My issue? Their menu is deceptive. 

Their organic menu lists beef, pork, fish, etc. The ONLY thing that is even remotely organic is only the chicken. The beef and all other proteins are just USDA. FAR from grass fed or anything even remotely close to REAL high quality. The USDA label is a freaking scam. Look up what that actually means - it's not much! Completely misleading. 

Because of that, I am knocking down one star. 

I had the sea bass. It was pretty good, but not what I came here for. Please disregard ALL the grass fed reviews for this restaurant - it's no longer applicable to their menu and purchasing practices. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Last night I went at 6 for our very first time (my grandpa, parents, and I), the service was wonderful and the food was out standing! Definitely things I wouldn't normally pick out on the menu but we listened to out waitress and she was sooo right! We ordered the shrimp ceviche, the smoked Idaho trout dip (the best thing ever!), deviled eggs (could of ate a dozen), the ahi tuna tacos, and the fried chicken. Absolutely everything was done to perfection. I also ordered the Pinot noir, emeritus which was a perfect way to wash this meal down. We ended with key lime pie dessert  so yummy! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here at least ten times and the food is excellent every time!!  I love the outdoor patio area!  The inside has a nice ambience as well."}
{"text":"We have been to Chelsea's a few times for lunch and have not been disappointed.  The Howie Burger and the Santa Fe burger were excellent...not a cheap burger but they are super tasty( Fries were awesome also)

The last time we went, we ordered just the Chicken Nachos and the Tuna Tartar....that was too much food for both of us.

We really liked the decor and are hoping to go again when the weather gets a little cool.  Tha patio looks like a nice place to hang out...

Haven't had a bad service experience. It was pretty busy each time we went..."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times. The place is nice and has great outside seating. Staff pretty friendly. Food is definitely good but know it is a bit pricy for what you get. We love food though so we are willing to pay for good food. This place can get busy so reservations are always good."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen had a 4th of July special: Buy 1 entree, get a 2nd one for $4! We were anticipating a lot of people there for an Independence Day dining deal (And they do not accept reservations), so we came here for an early dinner. We got there around 4:45 and were able to get a parking space with no problem. When we left at around 6 though it was quite crowded and there was a line for parking.

We were greeted and seated promptly. After poring through the menu, we decided on the deviled eggs appetizer, and I chose the short rib tacos. I also had some of the green chile cheeseburger.

The deviled eggs were beautifully presented, and were delicious. The filling had a nice creamy, tangy zest to it, and the eggs had a sprinkling of bacon pieces on them.

The short rib tacos were quite tasty. The short rib had a lovely, slow-braised texture and rich flavor. The plate came with a huge portion of fresh guacamole, pico de gallo, kale and quinoa salad, and hand-made corn tortillas. The dish was $18, but at such as huge portion I could have easily shared it with someone else. 

The green chile burger I tried was juicy and packed with flavor, but not cooked to our specifications. It was ordered as medium-rare, but when we received it, it was closer to medium-well. It was still tasty nonetheless, but disappointing that for a $13 burger, it wasn't cooked to our requested temperature! The fries that came with the burger were excellent- perfectly crispy, yet tender on the inside. They were also dusted with a lovely bbq spice mix to add a slightly sweet, smokey flavor.

Service was good and drinks were refilled promptly as needed. 

When you leave, be sure to try one of their free salted chocolate chip cookies! When we went, the cookies were a little unevenly salted to one area, so certain areas I bit into tasted super salty."}
{"text":"Two words: deviled eggs.

No joke, these deviled eggs are LEGIT - I have to get them every time I come here.  My other staples are the del mar or brussel sprout salad, but everything here is delicious.  I also have a sweet spot for their patio - such a pretty place to have a great meal.  And don't you dare forget to grab a (free) salted chocolate chip cookie (or 2) on your way out.  

The only reason I'm not giving Chelsea's that fifth star is because of an incredibly rude server I spoke with today.  I called to make a reservation for my best friend CHELSEA's birthday this week and was told they only can book for 12+.  I asked if they could make an exception for 8 people and she said 8 isn't 12, sorry.   I wish she would have been a littler nicer - kindness goes along way, especially in the service industry.  Will still be going back because this is one of my favorite places in Phoenix, but beware of their policy and the varied customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I met up with a friend there for drinks after work.  I love the bar which has a garage type door that opens up so you can sit outside or inside.  Great intimate vibe outside under a big tree with lights.  Great warm vibe inside.  Great mix of basics and mexi-cali items like ceviche and tacos and burgers and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Who would thought an airport would have a traditional menus for the average tourist  I was so impressed. Being a foodie I was appreciative of the menu put before me.ml. After going to a wine bar not mentioned walked across"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a LONG layover before a flight to LA.  I was traveling with another employee and had a great time in the little couch / booth area.  It was so different from other airport restaurants.  It felt like we had a little peace and quiet area to ourselves.  The food was okay overall.  I got the kale salad (not a big fan) and the tortilla soup (okay).  The best thing we got were the prickly pear margaritas.  Mmmmmm.  The server was a little uneven -- our waiter got busy at the bar and disappeared for a long time.  We got apology cookies (tiny!) but we didn't mind much as we had the time to kill.  Big thumbs up for those margaritas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday, I was impressed!! I sat at the bar and the bartenders were great. For food we have the brussel sprout salad and the Howie burger, delicious. One of the best burgers I have had, i had the temp of the burger med rare."}
{"text":"Very nice for a summer night out.  Sat inside at the bar and everything was great!  Food was excellent and plenty.  We shared a meal and still took leftovers home!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family before I flew up to Vegas and was really disappointed. I stopped in because this is one of those places I really wanted to check out but I wish I'd stuck with the actual restaurant. It really doesn't translate well to airport. 

Food was so so at the very best. Service was slow and seemed inconvenienced."}
{"text":"Great ambiance -- low lit and welcoming, with very comfy tables and a great little bar area. The cocktails on offer are spot on -- I had the Bobby Love, which had a nice little kick. And the food is great and reliable -- the tuna tartare with guac is a good sized portion (if a bit underseasoned) with what seem like housemade tortilla chips. The Howie burger is nice, fat, well seasoned and well prepared version, the short ribs are deliciously tender and enhanced by the optional egg, and the free salted chocolate chip cookies hit the spot. The veggie burger is a bit crumbly, but it's a minor quibble, and the flavor (I believe it's a bean base) is appealing. The service is also noticeably pleasant, helpful and accommodating. Just a great place for a relaxed dinner any night of the week."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern:


I recently had the most pleasurable lunch at your Sky Harbor Chelsea's Kitchen, thanks to Rachel C. She had great recommendation for the menu as well as a GREAT place to take friends and family for dinner (Chelsea's Kitchen at 40th and Camelback). What a beautiful location and setting for dinner. Her recommendation to dine on the patio was perfect. Family and friends loved it, some had heard of it, some had been wanting to try Chelsea's Kitchen and some had never heard of it, but the all LOVED it! My hats of to such a knowledgeable and efficient waitress. We don't have Chelsea's Kitchen in CO but next winter it will be one of our new FAVORITES! ThankYou Rachel!

{"text":"I have been here many times and have always had a great experience. The service is always good and the food is the best. The tacos, Howie burger, kale salad, ahi salad, chips and guac, fried chicken ... I could go on and on. All are great.  The drinks are good too, and they have Delirium Tremens on tap. Could it be any better? Doubt it."}
{"text":"Decent place. Kids menu is free, but they don't tell you that until the end. The outdoor patio is shaded, but has pollen all over the place and they make no effort to clean the seats from what I can tell. We had flies flying around our table at first, but somehow they went away. Food was descent, but overpriced for what you get. I guess that's what happens when you have an executive chef at a hole-in-the-wall. Canal passes right by the patio. Wait staff was nice. I would say it's not ideal for kids because most people there were at the bar for late afternoon dinner."}
{"text":"Oh fellow yelpers, is there anything more wonderful than an unexpected food find, a bit of culinary serendipity to brighten one's day? Such was my experience when coming across this delightful eatery in none other than the Phoenix Airport Dining area, next to Sauce, another solid eatery. 

I was catching a morning flight to California for the holidays and realized that Chelsea's kitchen had been put in since my last visit. I was charmed by the lights above the bar made from antique spritzer bottles and felt a little like I had stepped into an establishment in that greatest of American cities, New York. 

As it was a bit early for me for lunch I ordered the oatmeal, which as far as oatmeal goes was excellent but I also ordered a cup of coffee and most glorious of surprises, they bring you a mug and a good sized french press, which you let sit for a few minutes and of course....you guessed it, press. The coffee was amazing. I asked the bartender what he thought and he agreed that it was exceptional. Best of all, between the oatmeal and the coffee the whole bill was only $8.20 and with tip, $10.50, that is a heck of good deal at the airport, not only on price, but on the exceptional quality. After reading the other reviews I'll be going back to the airport for something other than a flight and you guessed it, to eat at Chelsea's kitchen. 

Note, I loved the place but I want to try a meal or two before I consider the coveted five star rank but from my initial experience, a solid 4 with 5 start possibilities.:-)"}
{"text":"Cool, inventive and of course delicious.  Burgers, taco platter, paella and fried chicken- all delicious."}
{"text":"Phoenix and Scottsdale have great restaurants!  But Chelse's Kitchen is not one of them.  Oh, the scenery is nice don't get me wrong. But the food is at best just drab. I sat at the bar.  The seats are too big and difficult to get in to sit even when there are no patrons at the bar.  I ordered the Green Chili Burger. I asked for vegetables instead of fries.  The bar tender offered me some mix veggies with lentil, etc. I get the burger and the side is something completely different with cucumbers...I hate cucumbers!  So they bring me a fruit bowl...and it wasn't impressive! I would say it was a very small cup of strawberries (or should I say strawberry because there was one or two in the cup) and a dozen grapes. Technically it is a fruit cup!  The burger was not good at all, very average at best. The meat had too much char on it. For $14 bucks, I expect better than average. And it was a small burger too boot.  Heck, I'm still hungry!  I had a beer with the meal and was out $26 bucks with the tip!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant. Best airport restaurant I've enjoyed and I travel a lot. In fact, it is one of the best restaurants I've visited in Phoenix. Try anything with Tuna. They do it well.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"We've been here for brunch/lunch a few times and always enjoy it. They've got some different options, (that I like to think are on the lower calorie side, though I am probably fooling myself) such as the Brussel Sprout salad (YUM!) and the Kale Salad with quinoa. I really enjoyed eating both and didn't feel like I was missing out on anything because both were legitimately delish! When the weather is cooler the patio is nice too, nothing like sipping Sangria in the sunshine! Overall, always an enjoyable experience. And don't forget to snag one of the complimentary mini salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 7 pm. The hostess was very up front let us know it would be about 45 min
She took our info down and we went to wait at the bar. 
The bartender was busy but that's no reason to be short with your customers. We ordered 3 drinks. All the same. Quick order. He was very irritated with us. 
Good thing the wait time turned out to be 20 min. 

Our server was awesome. He knew the menu. 
He really went out of his way to make sure our experience was perfect! 
I had the ahi tuna burger with fries! It was awesome! Just enough spice. Not fishy at all. 
My boyfriend had the roasted chicken and green beans. 
It was a bit over done and dry but still had good flavor. 
Our friend had the ribs. He said they were absolutely what he was hoping for. 
Over all it was a delicious."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly and attentive staff, good portions and a very nice outdoor patio where you can still feel the breeze from the air conditioning. I had the deviled egfs ans the crabcake Bbnedict. I would recommend both for any visitor of this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place!  This isn't your typical airport restaurant food, the food is fresh and delicious!  They have vegetables and amazing salads.  The food doesn't taste like it's been sitting around for awhile or some prepackaged mess.  

Chelsea's Kitchen makes my visits to the Phoenix airport pleasurable."}
{"text":"Had the Chelsea burger here a few weeks? ago. I've been here a few times since it opened. (I go to the airport location since I work at the airport). I like coming here.

 Overall, it's a nice place. I do recommend this place to travelers that ask where where they should eat. 
It's nice inside, the staff is friendly, and the food is always cooked properly and it's tasty. The prices are ok."}
{"text":"Update: Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen for inviting me back. Fast forward to a couple months and our experience from before was like night and day. We visited again on a Sunday for brunch however this time we dined inside and it wasn't nearly as busy as our last visit. I was able to appreciate the lovely interior decor which is chic, cozy and welcoming. I couldn't help but notice the huge arrangement of fresh, yes, fresh flowers in the center of the dining room and the attention to detail of the wood ceiling, simple yet thoughtful red curtains and large lamps.  The entire ambiance is that of an upscale yet cozy down to earth home.  The music playing in the background is the perfect blend of jazzy/modern/brunchy/feel-good sound, played at the perfect volume. The small but well appointed bar was buzzing with guests and as I passed by it on my way to visit the restroom I couldn't help but notice the large volumes of \"Sangria Pitchers\" being made. Which goes without saying their Sangrias are superb! Let's get to the food ordered...1. Short rib hash with over easy eggs were deliciously made, well presented and enough to feed a village!   2. Short rib tacos which is fitting for a Sunday Supper, these were perfectly made, moist, seasonsed well,  and worthy of eating with just a fork however they do come with a side of corn tortillas, salsa, freshly made chunky guacamole, and a slaw of (kale?), the amount of meat was enormous and I was only able to eat 1/4 of my entree. 3. As a starter we had the chips, salsa and guacamole which were all authentic and made  with fresh ingedients...4. Best for last, the pitcher of white sangria! Spectacular! This sangria is a must if you are here as it consists of diced apples, citrus and is a light refreshing party in a pitcher but definitely packs a punch after 2 glasses. The glass pitcher is a bit heavy to handle, thankfully our attentive server ensured our glasses remained full. The service was top notch and I look forward to now sharing this lovely establishment  with friends and family. Sidenote; I did not inform management that we were invited here, nor did we use the gift card that was given to us from our first visit. Our goal was to truly give them an authentic 2nd chance."}
{"text":"On a rainy Sunday morning, Chelsea's Kitchen  sounded really good.  Unlike other brunch places, they open at 9:30 am which is GREAT! Because I love getting up early, grabbing the paper and having a leisure Sunday morning, reading about all the sales and news.  

The servers were great. They brought a French Press pot of coffee to the table and even came back to pour the first cup.  Really good, and only for $2.50.  I was sold!

I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon instead Canadian bacon.  Plus a side of tomatoes and avocado.  The plate came out pretty quickly.  The yoke was a bit over done, and the sauce , not enough of it.  But it was tasty!  The English muffin was delicious!  The eggs came with a bowl of fruit. 

The environment was great, they had the fire going and really easy going music playing, making it a great Sunday morning.  

I will have to bring some other yelpers to join me on a Sunday, would love to try the white sangria, without being called a lush!"}
{"text":"Justin is fantastic. He took out old speakers and updated with flush mounts. New receiver with two zone listening; inside or outside or both. The price was right, he was honest and fair and very professional. I give him 5 stars and will use him again. Thank you Justin! We love the new set-up!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The patio at night is the perfect spot to sit and have dinner with friends. Great food, staff is friendly and give great recommendations. I have been to Phoenix several times and this is one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Solid food, atmosphere, service and variety.

HOWEVER, a major (and surprising) screw-up is that their \"Grilled Salmon\" is FARMED!! Boo! And it's NOT DISCLOSED as such on the menu. In fact, it's actually blatantly misleading/borderline false advertising, as just an inch above the salmon item on the menu, it states \"using only premium, domestic, and organic meats of the highest quality.\"  

Most people would rightly assume based on this statement that the salmon is not farmed, but is wild. So they are not likely to bother asking the server if the salmon is farmed. And at $25, especially so.  We did ask and were really surprised to hear it was. Beyond \"yes,\" there was no info given as to where the salmon farm is, whether the farm is sustainable, organic, etc.

This is a glaring omission at least and a blatant attempt to mislead at worst. This review is meant to alert those thinking of ordering it so they can make an informed decision, as well as a request to management to change either the type of fish or how it's presented on the menu. 

Note, I understand farmed salmon is extremely common and becoming more so and shouldn't surprise diners to find it on many menus. However, when there is a statement specifically leads one to believe it isn't, we have a problem.

Why such a big deal? Depending on the type (and location) of the farm, farmed salmon can be MUCH different nutritionally from wild. I know some say there are sustainability/contamination (Mercury) issues and there is a debate about the differences. However, it should be transparent what you're getting. 

On other notes: 

Brussels Salad at $15 w/o meat is overpriced by a lot. Also, there are TONS of dried cranberries on there which aren't disclosed on menu. Overall it's just OK. Also, be sure to ask about the dressing as that is missing from menu too and may not be to your liking. 

Deviled eggs are a bargain (6 halves for $7) but really pretty bland.

Tuna tartare is also pretty bland."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. Food was excellent, prices were a bit high but you're getting higher quality, service was great and the environment was very nice. We sat outside at night, very pleasant. We'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! The food is awesome and the atmosphere is even better. Anything Ahi and I'm sure you'll fall in love. My ahi burger is always amazing!! And the last time we ordered cornbread as an appetizer, and damn was it delicious. And while typically this place has always been solid for us and the family unfortunately our last time here was not so great. Our service was just out of character, Arthur was the name of our server and unfortunately very rude. Would tell us to shhh, when he couldn't find something on his iPad. And although he didn't say anything rude TO us, you could tell by his demeanor that was a really cocky dude. Which in real life is cool but at a restaurant with the family is just unnecessary. It was just awkward every time he came to he side of the table. Either way, make yourself out to Chelsea's Kitchen, but make sure to get served by anyone but Arthur."}
{"text":"Ooooh-Wa-Weee-Wah-Woooo!! Chelsea's Kitchen is delicious! I dragged a friend in Phoenix out of his sick-bed when I was visiting, and he - in return - \"dragged\" me here. It was a random April day and a mini-monsoon was torturing the patrons in the patio area, and making the wait a tad longer than expected. Luckily, we bought a bottle of white wine and drank at the bar until our table was ready. 

The far was good - it didn't blow my socks off, but it was delicious. Service was very friendly, and the environment allowed my dinner date and I to talk, laugh, and be happy without disturbing our neighbors. Speaking of which, we just so happened to dine right next to Mayor Phil Gordon!"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat at airport restaurants but had sometime to kill and Chelsea's Kitchen looked promising. My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered some drinks and shared the tacos. I liked the short rib and the guacamole was really good. They give you a lot of corn tortillas and can give you more. Really enjoyed our time here and excellent service from Michael."}
{"text":"The world has gotten better since the era when I first started flying for business, when a good airport dinner meant White Russians and warmed-over hotdogs.

The food isn't quite on a par with the main restaurant, but it'd still qualify as good restaurant food. A burger is a respectable upscale burger that I'd call pleasant yet unmemorable... but the fries! The fries! The fries are even more addictively amazing that Smashburger fries. Whoever was in the kitchen is the maestro of fries. Whoever's choosing their wine is also brilliant. Given usual mark-ups, my choice is probably pretty cheap in the bottle, and it had the dimensions of something much pricier.

The push from 4 stars to 5 was that I went here hoping that an airport might have servers familiar with the concept of \"lone woman diner,\" so I'd get decent service. My server was wonderful: present without being obtrusive, helpful, and generally everything I could ask in a server. She got a 33% tip. That won't pay anybody's rent, but it's better than an empty table.

It's great living in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chelsea's Kitchen. Their outdoor patio is well designed and the bar service is excellent. That being said I think the food is a bit overpriced. Went for lunch yesterday, I had the french dip and my dining partner got the ahi tuna tacos. Both meals were delicious; I especially enjoyed the fresh made corn tortillas with the tacos. 2 people for lunch and a bill over $40 bucks - Not so impressed. They have sangria though, so I am going to have to go back when I am not on lunch. Kicking back on the patio with a tall sangria sounds wonderful (in a few weeks when it is not 100 at night)."}
{"text":"The best in Phoenix area so far. We keep going back with friends. Food is good and service is better. Prices are reasonable. Patio is awesome. We love the place."}
{"text":"A mediocre meal, at best.  My partner and I asked to be seated at a table rather than a booth, but when the hostess hemmed and hawed like there was a problem, I suggested a half-booth with a chair on the other side.  Never mind that to get to it we walked by several regular empty tables that were fully set and that had no \"reserved\" indicators.

Our server, Michael, was above reproach - attentive without being hovering, and always pleasant and polite.  The devilled eggs were a delicious appetizer, but my partner was disappointed with his soup.  My Prime Rib had to be the toughest, most gristly piece of meat I have ever eaten. It should not have been served.  The kale slaw was ... interesting, and the mashed potatoes were very good.  My partner enjoyed his rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes, but pronounced the cauliflower as \"Meh\".  We skipped dessert.

All in all, not a great meal, despite the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Cozy & pleasant atmosphere, delicious food, awesome service, great patio area and free valet. What is not to like about Chelsea's Kitchen?

We loved every single plate that we ordered. Not only was everything tasty, but it also had a beautiful presentation. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts salad!! YUM! I think this was the best salad I've had, ever! If you don't like brussels sprouts, this salad just might change your opinion about it! hahaha The rotisserie jidori chicken was very tender, juicy and flavorful! Delish :) The surf and turf taco platter was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. They also have a great selection of signature cocktails. Cucumber press was really good and very refreshing. Also, you can never go wrong with the white sangria! 

I will come here again if I ever visit Phoenix again. Great experience, highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"I have been back for brunch and it is pretty fab. My kid loves the bacon and I devour the chicken chiliques (sp?)"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is an amazing restaurant with fantastic food, great for kids and adults all ages. The staff is very kind and understanding. The decor is beautiful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna Tacos...I feel like that should be all I have to say.  

I have been an on and off low-carb dieter for years and consider Chelsea's Ahi Tuna Tacos with a side of cottage cheese to be the closest thing to hedonism a low carber can experience.  The soft taco shells come on the side, so you can just attack the Ahi, a little Guac, and the Taco Fixins without restraint.

This is besides the fact that it's a clean, well managed, high service operation.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with a very large group for brunch and I left extremely happy/tipsy!! The food is really delicious and no its not because I was drinking lol. The surf and turf is excellent, so are the deviled eggs. The mimosas are a bit pricey but that's common. The staff was extremely quick and helpful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, good food, and good service.  I'm not over-the-top on this place, but it's good to go there every once in awhile.  I think they cater to a slightly older demographic (say 30-60).  Put it this way, my parents love this place, we just like it.  If the vibe was a little bit younger and hipper, I would have given it four stars."}
{"text":"Just had Sunday lunch here. The food is the best I've possibly eaten in AZ and certainly in Phoenix. The service is great and the food was amazing even when it was packed. Worth a long drive out of your way to visit for unique, fresh and exceptionally good food. Keep up the good work in helping Phoenix get on the foodie map! Thank you Anthony!"}
{"text":"Wow- was not expecting to find such a great place to eat while waiting out my 4 hour connection!  The food was fresh and exceeded my expectations. Definitely worth the additional trip through security. Fantastic roasted tomato soup."}
{"text":"The vibes of the restaurant are great and the patio is spectacular. Staff is very nice and accommodating. However, the food is just average and the menus is much too short. If Chelsea's is going to have this short of a menus then they should at least make one of the dishes on it taste above average."}
{"text":"I found a piece of glass in my water!  So be careful when coming here...

The food is ok - it is a little on the salty side."}
{"text":"Surprised  is what comes to mind for an airport restaurant. This place has great coffee, drinks and food. What also is amazing is the service at the bar. Very friendly. Gives foreign tourist a good perception of America. Great job!  The deviled eggs and white sangria are amazing."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen is a really nice place to eat and the food is amazing. It was my first time there today and I ordered the Green Chili cheeseburger and fries. Being from New Mexico I am picky about green chili and CK really surprised me! The green chili on my burger had such great texture and it was actually hot... :) not an unbearable-slamming your water hot but it had a good kick to it and I was in love. The fries also had a yummy seasoning that I was living for :) I will return to CK many more times and work through their menu :) 

Ps remind me to try some of their Gelato next time :)"}
{"text":"Great place to be in Spring...fabulous patio under a giant mesquite tree with dense shades. Great food & drinks selection. Love it here! Fabulous time with friends."}
{"text":"Don't go here!!! One star only because that's the minimum. 
I went on Monday after Super Bowl and the place wasn't nearly full as I easily found a seat at the bar. 

I waited 20 minutes to get a coffee which was sitting 10 feet from me. The patrons next to me had had there food delivered and completely ate it before I got my coffee or had my order taken. Then, I was told I couldn't order breakfast because it was 10:40.....not to mention if they let me order when I sat down I would have been within the window.

Thankfully I don't fly through Phoenix regularly because they leave everything to be desired."}
{"text":"First time having brunch at Chelsea's Kitchen: 

-The french press coffee is delicious however they don't offer any soy milk or creamer. Huh? Only whole milk or half and half. Come on CK! Get with the lactose intolerant times! 

-Hot cakes are delicious. Their menu doesn't do a great job describing this, but essentially it's lemon ricotta pancakes. They're melt in your mouth good. 

-Eggs benedict is very good. Not enough hollendaise sauce though. 

-French fries are crispy and yummy. 

-Guacamole and chips are yummy too and enough to feed our 9 person table. 

-Whoever answers the telephone doesn't communicate with the hostess that our 9 person party is running late for our reservation, hence a 10 minute wait. Work on your communication issues, CK and we'll have a better relationship. 

Until next time!"}
{"text":"While looking up a menu for a different restaurant, we realized it was Arizona Restaurant week.
We skimmed through the list of other places and called for a reservation.
we were told it wasn't necessary for a Saturday night, that it was about a 15 min wait, so off we went! We didn't even wait..we were seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty full.
It was LOVELY. Such a pretty restaurant. Nice, friendly service and a beautiful patio.
We sat outdoors and it was great. A nice selection of music was playing and it was just a great vibe. Yes it was loud, but in a fun way.
We ate off the AZ restaurant week menu-salad, short ribs and red velvet cake. All AMAZING!!
The short ribs were super tender and the dessert was perfect.
Pretty restrooms too :)
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very good lunch, great outdoor patio feels like a southern california vibe. Good service they use an ipad to take orders and also process payments which speeds up the service. Food fresh and came out fast. We had the kale and quinoa salad with rotiserre chicken along with surf and turf tacos. The chicken has some sort of rub that gives it s beef jerky taste, prob my favorite item. Also seems like a good spot for a business lunch or happy hour. Only negative is its a little pricey for what it is which is new american food. But considering the area and vibe its def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This has been a fav spot for years. Best thing is the patio, chilaquilles for brunch and bottomless mimosas and the nachos. The food is good. Always solid. There is something to eat for everybody even vegetarians. Service is good. Sometimes it gets a little crowded so there is a wait but it's worth it. It's hard for large groups too as the tables don't push together."}
{"text":"Been to Chelsea's a couple times for dinner on the weekends recently, and had just as great service as when I've been for breakfast/brunch.  I also like their patio at night.  Even in the winter it's not cold under the heaters. Too bad the food was  as disappointing as my morning meals there.  Most of the items on the dinner menu don't interest me (their street taco plates and salads, while good, just aren't enough food for me, fried chicken with gravy is way too far on the other end of the spectrum and there ain't much in between), so I stick to the burgers which would be very good if they were executed according to the menu description.  Last week my green chile burger came with a bunch of stuff different from the menu including, of all things, pickles.  Pickles, not on the side, but smack on the green chile burger so the pickle juice could run into the green chile and burger.  Nasty.

I go back for the service, but really need to remember to get a bite before going next time."}
{"text":"The dynamic duo (Gabi K and Jared M) scooped me up from the airport, and off to dinner...

Chelsea's was finally decided upon, and what a great selection it was! 

Tuna Tartare with guac appetizer: AWESOME. A bit hard to eat, but very good. 

White sangria: PERFECT (x2) under the \"misters\" on a hot September evening. (105. I've never even SEEN misters, I like them. Like running through the sprinklers while you eat, but not so wet). Actually, no...I know exactly what it's like. Being a piece of produce at the grocery store...the only thing missing was the kitschy little \"I'm singing in the rain\" bit they play...For some reason, that always makes me smile. 

i digress, but at least I am well watered. 

Swordfish Tacos: The fish was excellent. Tortillas were a bit soggy, but only due to the massive amount of toppings. I also tried some of Jared's Steak Tacos. They were a little skimpy with the steak...boys need to eat! But, it was well prepared. 

No room for dessert. Ok, that's a lite. We went to Gspot for gelato ;) 

Really great spot, props to GK and JM for the tour!"}
{"text":"The Short Rib Tacos are amazing. Their rotisserie chicken and their hamburgers are really good too but those tacos man, I could eat them all day. As far as the atmosphere I don't know how they do it but it feels classy yet casual. Its a super comfortable and trendy restaurant with incredible food. Check it out if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Omg!  This place is absolutely AMAZING!    I'm waiting for my flight and I  decided to have a late dinner and drinks, then I  had a desert that would knock your socks off!. I  couldn't decide on Ahi tuna or the rib eye so I  ordered both with tortilla soup!   Mathew our server was extremely helpful and on point with his customer service!   I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Good luck I'm not in a rush,  service is about as slow as watching paint dry,  onto mention is not busy! Food was decent.  Too bad there are not more options in this area of the terminal"}
{"text":"Despite having heard wonderful things about Chelsea's Kitchen, I've never made it in to dine here before until last night.  I don't know why I waited so long, but I wish I had come sooner.

Aside from being easy to find, Chelsea's has a low key look from the outside, but easy to find and spot from the road.  Upon pulling up, I realized that they had complimentary valet.  Nice!  Place is wonderfully decorated without coming off as intimidating, and has a great clean, sophisticated look yet still makes you feel comfortable eating there.  I like that. 

I was greeted right when I went in and was waiting for my friend Robin and her mom to arrive.  I waited outside and realized that there's a table for 8 people right outside the front door! I hung out there until Robin and her mom arrived.  When we were seated, staff was warm, friendly and attentive.  Hostess made sure we were comfortable where we sat and the server was right on it the whole night through.

Since I had never been there before, I had a few questions about the menu, and in between the server and my friend, they were able to answer everything for me.  I went with the Chelsea's Cheeseburger minus the Russian Dressing.  Friends mom went with the Wood fired chicken quarter, and Robin went with the Ahi Tuna.  When the food came out, it all looked really nice! Burger was awesome, and the fries were sweet potato (i think) and were excellent.  

While we were eating, the guys at the table next to us ordered a steak of some sort, and it was HUGE, and looked absolutely delicous. If I hadn't already eaten, I very well could have gone over there and taken the plate away from the poor guy it looked so good.

I didn't get a chance to see it, but I heard that the patio is beautiful. I was going to go look, but I was so engrossed in my dinner and conversation, that I never got to check it out. Next time I will though.

I would like to say that I wish I had come here sooner. This is my kind of dining establishment, and its absolutely worth every penny you spend here, and worth every mile you drive."}
{"text":"4 hours to kill in Phoenix airport because your flight is delayed? 

Ummm...Chelsea's Kitchen comes to mind as the best place to be! The ambience transports you to somewhere other than an airport. A swanky San Francisco restaurant perhaps and if you sit with your back to airport side you could probably forget where you are. 

I started my flight delay time here with a Prickly Pear Margarita which was delish! super refreshing!! It was a perfect accompaniment to the chips and Salsa/Guacamole appetizer I had. Both Guacamole and Salsa rivaled some of the best I have ever tasted. Definitely had a good signature taste, especially the salsa which had a bit of a sweet kick to it. 

For my dinner, which I literally crave, I had the short rib taco's. OMG...seriously so good! The tortillas looked like they were freshly made, no \"mission\" tortillas for this airport restaurant. The taco's and kale topping were so yummy! No better way to describe it. Bottom line...if you're in the Phoenix Aiport waiting, seriously just go here, because I Said so ! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I looooooved it here! I went for the first time for my birthday dinner with bae. I ordered short rib tacos and he ordered a veggie burger. The tacos were AMAZING esp bc they were served with homemade tortillas! Bae devoured his veggie burger like he always does. For dessert we ordered mint chocolate chip gelato which was super legit because they use REAL mint and high quality dark chocolate (which is unheard of elsewhere). After that, we ordered coffee, served freshly brewed in a French press. YES.

The patio seating was perfect. I loved the cozy backyard feel with strings of lights and TREES. The trees reminded me of home. The staff was great too! They were patient, charismatic, and even snapped a pic for us! Multiple pics actually - because I kept blinking lol. 

I've been raving about this place ever since. I can't wait to go back!!! I wish we had one on the west side."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to sit and relax and chat with friends and all before the security area since it's a restaurant in an airport, but the food didn't impress me.

I ordered the ahi tuna burger and the ahi tuna patty was bland and a little overcooked. The bun itself wasnt that toasty either. The fries were pretty decent though.

I probably should order something else next time. My friend's ahi tuna taco platter looked pretty good (but is also almost $10 more)"}
{"text":"This is a very charming place. I recently visited for lunch and was surprised how awesome it was. You must sit on the patio for the full experience. The food was very good, but the atmosphere was what won me over!"}
{"text":"The ribeye was very thin,
On the brighter side the Pinot was rather desirable had two 9oz glasses. The service was good and the food did come out rather quick."}
{"text":"Just tried to grab a bite to eat before catching my flight home. Sat down, was seated for nearly 10 minutes, and the blonde female waitress walked by me a couple of times. No acknowledgement at all...so I left. Maybe I'm invisible, because everyone else around me at least had drinks. Not attempting to go here again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! So delicious....the Idaho trout dip was fantastic. We also had the ceviche which was awesome and the short ribs tacos. Soooo good!!! Great service and even better food."}
{"text":"Pricey by my standards ($50 including tip for drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees), but the food is exceptionally good. We could go somewhere else and eat for half that price, but after eating here, I have a difficult time going to other restaurants with lower quality food. Now I prefer to go out half as much, and eat at Chelsea's. I agree with the previous review that if you are a vegetarian, this is probably not the best place for you. I basically order the same thing every time, a hamburger, and the Arnold Palmer. Both are very good. As I said, after eating these high end burgers, I cannot eat fast food or even regular restaurant burgers any more. They taste gross to me. If you like eating cheaper burgers, don't eat here because it will ruin the experience. The environment and ambiance have a good balance between laid back and nice. You don't have to wear a suit (although you could), but you don't want to go looking like a slob either. As other reviewers have said, they have a great patio right on the canal with lots of shade."}
{"text":"Location in the PHX airport, great beer selection and food (try the Deviled Eggs if you're into that kind of stuff). The bartender was really friendly as well."}
{"text":"EAT THE FRIES. Homemade and delicious and worth every penny. Ate here twice in my short visit to Arizona. Also, free cookies."}

When I go Yelp, I see a reason
For you to try.  We've been through this before
In every town, in every review

So please don't ask for more

Can't you taste it in their food
This might not be our last goodbye

Chelsea's Chelsea's, things they make are great
Chelsea's Chelsea's, I'm sure we'll meet again


Chelsea's Kitchen has been a long time staple restaurant and great eatery for the valley for quite some times.  

I've always known Chelsea's Kitchen for great tacos and drinks.  Tonight I went for a glass of wine with my friend and she recommended we started with the French Deviled eggs.  Overall an excellent start!  The eggs were creamy meshed with some pickles and bacon that we added giving it some crunchy texture!  The paprika added an extra kick.  For our entrees and went for the tacos of course; short rib for sure with creamy guacamole!  The shorts ribs were smoky and braised to perfection with a nice subtle and not too strong BBQ sauce atop.  The kale salad was definitely a welcoming new texture and taste to my palate.  

In the end, Chelsea's Kitchen is close to my heart because since moving here to the valley I've always known of the is place being consistent and being an awesome place for good eats.  They've never failed me and I don't see them doing so anytime soon.  Service is always tops and the place is very welcoming! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As a seasonal resident of AZ, this is the very first restaurant that was so poor that I felt compelled to comment on.   

Well I thought I'd give CK another try after 2 disappointing visits. So for a late bite we arrived around 9:30 pm, the place was dead, staff talking amongst themselves, smelled great and asked to sit on the patio. The Hostess tried to sit us where it would be convenient for the server, but we chose a more intimate area and got a vibe like we might be asking for something out of the ordinary. We were coldly greeted by our server, who looked similar to every other server, young, averagely attractive, no visible outstanding qualities. Yes, I work in a seasonal food service business and hire and fire these clones daily. Anyway, this is our mediocre apathetic workforce of today. We received our wine and I noticed my wine glass was dirty or smudged. I decided to just let it go, but as I thought about it and the level of detail I require in my own business, I decided to ask for a new glass, but only once our food had arrived, fearing kitchen reprisal. The server brought our food, and I asked for the new glass, pointing out the smudge, which she immediately snatched up the glass, noted the smudge and left the table without one word. Now onto the food, well where do I begin, poor plate presentation even for a $12 veggie burger, very anemic like the server. Oh, no utensils or napkins or even an offer of water. I waited a few minutes and decided to get my own utensils, which were neatly wrapped in a napkin by the patio door. I turned the bun onto the veggie patty and it is cold and I decide I will not eat this, it is beneath me and how can someone serve something so pathetic and get away with it. When the server checked on us, I told her I wasn't happy and explained that I thought the bun should be toasted and her attitude was its not our policy to toast the bun and I should specify how I want my bun. With this I asked for a credit to my bill and she took the plate, turned and curtly walked away. Once again, no apology or attempt to rectify the complaint, only a confrontation that I the one paying her salary was some how responsible. We left with no parting adieu, never to return. We drove to their sister venue, Postino, which for the second time we had a great experience. Staff were personable, professional and uncloned. As for CK, go if you like camouflaged mediocrity, enjoy being snubbed by the people who are suppose to serve you and paying for it. I'll take mine at the S&M."}
{"text":"I would come back just for the free chocolate salted cookies. And they don't care if you grab one or a dozen and stuff them down your pockets. These guys are pretty cool.

But you should save the cookies for the end since they have some good brunch here. Great place for kiddies or you can hang out at the bar and have several adult drinks too."}
{"text":"They have the best rotisserie chicken & red velvet cake EVER made!! Go there, try it & i believe you won't call me a liar! 
Thank you Chelsea's kitchen for making my hubby & I's wedding anniversary dinners a real treat. Were looking forward to the next one- only  5 months to go & counting..."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I can't believe it's taken me this long to come here. A friend and I came in for lunch yesterday...if that's what you want to call it. I'll call it grown up Sunday Funday. I say grown up because we were super classy and drank wine. So we order a bottle of the rose, we're sitting at the baron the outside enjoying the fine Sunday afternoon. The place is relatively busy considering it was that awkward time between lunch and dinner. 

We ordered the deviled eggs. um. duh. Of course they were great. Kinda hard to eff up a boiled egg. But there's is real good - bacon on top. Anything with bacon on top is better. Well you know, after some girl gabbing and a few glasses of crisp wine, and some eggs, we just had to order another bottle of wine. The bartender was a gem. So attentive to our glasses - were never empty for more than a minute. She knew what she was doing that's for sure. Then we ordered the baked mac and cheese with bacon on top - so damn good. I might have been buzzed eating but that was some preeetttyyy good mac. And I know mac. I guess the reoccuring theme here is bacon and wine. I don't hate it. 

There were these three douchey old men that insisted we scoot over so they could sit at the bar...he kept calling the bartender honey sugar or some name of endearment. I threw up in my mouth a bit. 

The only reason it's not 5 stars is because there were like a billion flies. Okay, I get it, I was sitting outside, and they were doing their best with the high powered fans but that shit was still nasty. Flies in or around a restaurant is a big no no. Go get one of those blue zappy light things and exterminate those little fuckers cus I'm pretty sure one ALMOST landed on an egg and that would have been real gross. Flies throw up or poop or whatever every time they land. Yeah think about that. Real appetizing. I'm fairly positive I'll be back for plenty more grown up Sunday Fundays because that outside patio, sans flies, is the perfect little relaxing spot to get a good Sunday buzz."}
{"text":"While the food can be sometimes unpredictable such as undercooked, overcooked, over salted etc...  except the swordfish which is predictably always awful - however, the customer service is always impeccable. We come here frequently and never leave disgruntled...  This evening we were fortunate to have Christian as our server; she was patient, extremely pleasant, prompt and efficient- we will ask for her section next time."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a huge group before we all parted way to travel and they were incredibly accomodating and helpful! The food was out very quickly and it was all delicious - I'd definitely recommend the chips and guacamole as well as the steak tacos. Both were fantastic, so much better than most food you'd eat at an airport! I know they have another restaurant downtown, but how convienient to have a location at the airport and now I know that I would love to go again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I met up with out of state friends for their 2 hour layover at Sky Harbor Airport.  On the fly, one of us picked Chelsea's Kitchen (inside Terminal 4).   We were graciously greeted, and we were seated immediately.  On the menu, there were a whole bunch of selections that had an airplane symbol next to the item.  Those were the ones that would be served within 8 minutes!  HOW FANTASTIC!  Each item was delicious, the service (Mike or Mark) was perfect and the place was beautifully decorated.  We happened to sit next to a cake display stand with chocolate chip cookies that were FREE samples!  I really enjoyed every aspect of the visit.  (It really was great to see a friend I hadn't seen in 20 years, all the while having the perfect restaurant experience.)  Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Looking for affordable bottomless mimosas with brunch? If so... Chelsea's Kitchen is your spot! I've only been here a couple of times for the brunch + $12 bottomless mimosas, and have had a fantastic experience each time. The food is delicious (my go-to is the chilaquiles), the customer service has been on point, and the vibe here is nice and relaxing. My friends ordered the lemon ricotta hotcakes and chelsea's burger. The hotcakes were amazing! My friend was craving french toast which they didn't have, so our server suggested these hotcakes and she was not disappointed. The burger was also great, but the shoe string fries that came with it was even better (we had to order extra fries as a side, if that's any indication how good it is).

There are lots of seating indoors and out in the patios. There's valet for parking. The only thing I'd change is to add more variety to the brunch menu. Other than that, I'd most definitely come back here for brunch again and try out their lunch and dinner menus."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday lunch with a girlfriend and it was absolutely delightful! Though it was crowded we were seated immediately inside and warmly greeted by our waiter. He informed us of his favorite menu items and got our drinks. The atmosphere is rustic, classy, warm, and charming; the perfect place to chat with a friend, have a business lunch, or even a romantic evening out. The tables are very comfortable and are not packed in next to each other. After letting us study the menu and chat a bit out waiter returned to take our order. We each had the tuna salad and thought it was delicious. If I had not been wanting a healthy salad for lunch I would have gone with the burger and fries because the man at the table next to us had one and it looked and smelled incredible. I will definitely be returning to have the burger. The other dishes on the menu looked enticing as well; tacos with various meats, brussel sprout salad, sandwiches, and fish to name a few. 

Chelsea's is not cheap, but you do pay for quality, and you can taste it in the food as well as experience it with the service they provide. We were never without drinks and always waited on promptly. On your way out be sure to grab a chocolate chip sea salt cookie, they are so yummy! This is a great place for any occasion, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Was there tonight! The food was good but the customer service wasn't really friendly, and pricing was a bit high for tacos and French fries. But they do have valet parking so don't forget to bring cash"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service, and ambiance. Love the outdoor patio! We came for my Dad's birthday and had a great experience. Highly recommend the burger and fries! :)"}
{"text":"While traveling for business this was recommended for dinner. The atmosphere was great and the portions were large. I had the short rib tacos and they were delicious!! It is obvious they use high quality fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for special occasions! 
If the weather is mild the best place on earth is the patio, absolutely incredible atmosphere.
The menu changes based of whats in season, but be sure to order the deviled eggs, so damn good.
have yet to have a less than stellar experience at Chelsea's!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, always good. Their Tacos rock and the place just feels nice. I do wish they didnt serve coke out of a can, but otherise a+!"}
{"text":"Well, we wanted to sit on the back patio.  You see, being hearing impaired, a crowded dining room is just a horrendous cacophony of sound, none of it understandable.  I wish more restaurants got this.

Anyway, walked to Chelsea's as it's in my neighborhood.  At 7:30 on a Friday, they were booming, even feeding people on the front patio!  For me, that is just weird, dining in front of starving people waiting for a table.  Daughter went to the hostess, and requested a patio table.  The curt response was, \"First Available, one hour wait\".  Sheesh, not very inviting.

We wove our way to the back patio and tried to get near the bar, after about a ten-minute wait, I was next in line and my daughter calls me to turn around, a waiter had stopped to take their drink order.  That was super-nice, but I knew it meant another ten minutes easy, since he had to go back, put in the order, serve and clear tables and get our drinks back to us.  I would have preferred to simply order myself at the bar, but whatever, they had already started.  I have to say, the servers here do not reflect the attitude of the hostess and the guy that got our drinks picked up an easy big tip for that.

Eventually, we were called to our table, smack-dab in the middle of the cacophony.  Christina, our server, quickly appeared, made sure our drinks were updated, made some recommendations and left us to decide.  I was interested in the Chicken Nachito's, having stared hungrily at a woman eating them in the bar area for like, 20 minutes. (sorry panama-hat lady).  I was confused by the menu description, \"Chicken or Green Chile\".  Christina assured me that they could do both, and in fact, suggested that I try the short-rib meat too.

Damn, that girl was on her game.  I went with her suggestion, and it was killer.  First daughter had the Nachos, but with almond-cheese (gak!) - it's a vegetarian thing.  Second daughter had the veggie burger and wife had some sort of salad, and some of my Nachito's, which I was in the process of scarfing.  This was a portion so huge, that I took half of it home, and just finished it, with some of that green-chile cheese dip from Hopdoddy's poured over it.  Super tasty.  I highly recommend the Nachitos, bag the chicken and go for the short-rib meat.  Tasty, crunchy, cheesy, fresh guacamole, sliced fresh jalapenos, it is indeed a meal in itself.

Service made this visit exceptional, I didn't get the server's name on the back patio that served us drinks, but thanks for going the extra mile!  Christina was exceptional, friendly, accommodating, timely - everything a server should be - thank you Christina for making the night!"}
{"text":"Easily the best brunch spot in the valley. Speedy and friendly service with amazing food options. Not to mention, the patio is so nice on any day of the year."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen has great customer service they sent me a message regarding my last visit/review and offered me a e-comp to return to the resturant and give it another try.  I came here with my boyfriend and our roomate + his gf.  She was visiting so we thought why not go to a fancy brunch?  We were sat promptly and I showed our waitress my e-comp.  We ordered our appetizer and sangria.  Sangria at 11am .. definately a splurge for us.  It was kind of the same as last time minus all the people.  They weren't packed this time but the service was REALLY slow, I say really slow this time because we came when it was open.. there weren't much people there.  Our server was very nice, we ordered ahi tuna guac, sangria, crab benedict, short rib hash, mac & cheese, and a burger.  

Ahi guac- this was actually better last time, seemed to be too much guac and not enough tuna this time.  Still tastey none the less.

Sangria- awesome like always

Crab benedict- It was a bit on the heavy side but I'm assuming that the dish itself, hollandaise sauce + crab + eggs + bread = too much too fast.  Maybe if the hollandaise sauce was lighter?

Short rib hash- Again this was my order that turned out to be my least favorite one.  I had high expectations for this because the short rib tacos were so good last time.  However it was a dry disaster.  There were barely any potatos at the bottom and no flavor.  Am I always the unlucky one that gets the worse dish or is it that I have such high expectations? I'm not sure but everyone had a taste and they did not like it.. commenting it was too dry.  

Mac & cheese-  If you were in heaven and there was mac & cheese on the menu they would be serving you Chelsea's kitchen's mac & cheese.  They had jalpenos pieces inside that gave it a little kick, AMAZING.  

Burger- friend said it was like any other burger, not worth the price.  

After reevaluating I would have given this place 2 stars, but the mac & cheese deserves a star of its own.  A place this beautiful makes you expect their food to be amazing.  They should really re-evaluate their head chef, whoever it is should be stepping up for a place this beautiful. 

All in all I again I felt like the place was nothing over the top except the prices. I am all for paying top price for a great meal but the food really isn't worth the prices. Pretty hefty tab we racked up...even with the e-comp."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had. The short rib tacos were tender and came with a kale salad instead of lettuce. You make the tacos yourself. An order of chips/guac and the tacos were enough for two people to share."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance especially the cute patio. It looks like you are in another city. 

Came for brunch this past Sunday around 2pm (brunch ends at 3pm). We were seated promptly but then it took A LONG time for anyone to help us. Loved the bottomless mimosas. I ordered the eggs benedict with short rib instead of crab. The egg was overdone, not runny at all and the meat was cold. I asked them to remake it and it came out tasting great. My date ordered the rotisserie chicken and was very underwhelmed. It was also cold. He ordered a white sangria which we both agreed was good. Then he ordered a pitcher of the sangria and we both agreed it was not as good or strong as the single glass."}
{"text":"It's been so long since I've written a review but I've been on vacation mode even after my vacation has been over awhile ago so BOOM! I had to review this place because I highly recommend Chelsea's Kitchen to anyone planning to visit Arizona. 

PARKING:
The lot is a decent sized but I can already imagine the craziness when it's busy. They also have complimentary valet parking! Super fancy *sparkle sparkle* 

RESTAURANT:
The inside is very classy, dark wood with table lamps adorned around the restaurant. I felt as if I was in a golf club dining room. I felt a little under dressed since everyone was wearing semi-formal attire while I was wearing a summer romper haha but after awhile I didn't pay no mind to whatever I or the other diners were wearing. Seating is plentiful: booths, 4 seating, bar, patio and outdoor seating. 

FOOD:
I personally thought that the menu didn't have a lot of variety. Each item was $10+: salads, burgers, sandwiches, egg Benedict's, steaks and such. Their menu definitely reflects as a brunch setting. My friends ordered their deviled eggs as an appetizer which tasted amazing and I'm not even a  fan of deviled eggs but these babies were tasty. I ordered a typical eggs Benedict, which was actually the first time I ever tried it and it was really good. Only downside was the muffin itself at the bottom was too spongy and it was difficult, and messy, to eat. But the eggs were poached to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was thick in consistently and not swishing all around the plate. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries and damn those fries were yummy! Burger was absolutely juicy and flavorful, wish I ordered that instead of the Benedict because it wasn't too filling. :( 

SERVICE:
Our server was Emily and if I can give a BEST SERVER AWARD, she would definitely win that award and I'm not even joking about this. Never have I ever had a server as attentive and personable as Emily. I wish every server was like her, she definitely made my experience at Chelsea's Kitchen 100000% excellent.  She made sure that we had water, she struck up sincere conversations and checked up on us frequently. 

SUMMARY:
- prices of food are 10+
- dress semi-formal or at least don't come here looking bummy.
- definitely give their daily specials a try. 
- bottomless mimosas (10AM-3PM?) $12
- I recommend any of their burgers with the fries, super yummy! 
- make sure you get Emily as your server!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cozy and nice but it was very noisy the night we were there.  Lots of families probably because it was right before Christmas.  The swordfish tacos were very good, but I wish they gave you more than two small tortillas.  Unfortunately we did not like the Caesar salad at all, the lettuce was not crisp and the dressing was unlike most I have had.  It was too cold to eat outside otherwise I think we would have enjoyed it more since the patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"very cute for breakfast, lunch and dinner. the outdoor patio is adorable. 
I loved the deviled eggs and my kale salad! Friend got the ahi tuna salad and loved it as well. They put fresh twists on ordinary dishes and for the better. 
Service was a little lacking but it was just so quaint, I got over it really quickly!"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! Cookies available while we waited. Small menu but everything is high quality. The lemon ricotta pancakes were amazing! I dont usually like ricotta cheese but you can't taste the ricotta. We also did the $12 bottomless mimosas, and Chelsea's cheeseburger. You can tell the ingredients are high quality and top notch"}
{"text":"Nice little quiet patio located just off of Camelback. Nice little fireplace on the patio.  Food was good and the portions generous.  Mostly a preppy type of clientel. One thing lacking was a wide variety of craft beer, choices were very limited and nothing was local."}
{"text":"We come here at least 52 times a year.  Lately things have been going down hill.  Today I ordered the Short Rib Hash because I heard it was so good.  It came out burnt to a crisp.  I mean the meat was so cooked it powdered when touched.  Burnt to a cinder comes to mind.  The last few times our food has either been overcooked or undercooked.  We are going to give the place a break for a while until they change back the managers or whatever is going on..."}
{"text":"I can't say the food is terrible. Chelsea's Kitchen uses fresh ingredients and, for the most part, delivers a decent meal on its overpriced menu.

What disappointed me most about this restaurant was the service. All evening long we felt like our snooty waitress was not listening to us when we spoke. This was evident when the wrong appetizer was served to us and had to be sent back to the kitchen. Our water glasses remained empty all evening long, ketchup that was requested two times didn't arrive until after I was done eating, our plates, with food still on them, were cleared without our waitress asking if we were done with them, and our final bill was brought out to us without ever asking if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink.

Service was so quick I felt like I was eating at an Applebee's.

Considering the number of similar restaurants in the area, I won't be back. While it has almost nothing to do with the food, It's a shame because service is something that can certainly be corrected if its important to management."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes this place wasn't too shabby. But at least once I'd like to be asked how things are. Just a hey how's the beverage? How's that burger? Something. Don't stare at me and then huddle around with your coworkers watching sports center. Had they asked I would have said \"delightful thanks\". Instead I'm just waiting for my check and ready to go spend my cash on more booze elsewhere cause I have 2 hours to kill."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu, so great that I stared at it and had no idea what to get because there were so many good looking options. For an app I settled on the tuna tartare and guacamole. It was pretty good and the chips that came with it were also pretty good. 

For my meal I ordered the short rib tacos, which I was very excited about, I thought they were good, but I definitely expected better. I also was able to try the filet, which had a really good first bite, but strangely it lost  flavor by the end. 

The reason I gave it 3 stars was because I didn't think the food was that great. I have been eating out at least once a week for a pretty long time now, so I definitely expected better. The service was very good and I liked the decor of the restaurant, I just didn't think the food was that good."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the coolest places I've been in scottsdale. There were four of us there on a Saturday night around 7 so of course it took a while to get a table. We went with first available so we didn't get to sit outside on the patio but what a nice space. No wonder it was crowded! While we waited which was only like 45 minutes I had a drink called Mind The Gap. It was so good I asked them for the recipe on Twitter so I could make it myself. It's a mix of cucumber vodka and cardamom and Serrano simple syrup. It's delightful.

For dinner we started with the devil eggs which were so good. The smaller size comes with three which was perfect. We also shared a pitcher of white sangria which is an absolute must. The come mix it at the table and pour it into everyone's glass and add fruit to your glass too so it doesn't spill everywhere. One of my friends and I both got burgers which were so good. I had the green chili one with a lettuce wrap. It was really flavorful. It's served with fresh cut fries which were really good. I'm a lover of French fries! 

The service was also really really good which can make a good restaurant really over the top. Not to mention the free chocolate chip cookies you can grab on your way out. 

Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at Chelsea's Kitchen, at a friend's suggestion, and it certainly won't be my last! I was very happy with our meal from start to finish. Our pitcher of sangria was more than enough for the three of us to share, and our server Ryan had excellent suggestions and was very attentive. I finally decided on the baked mac and cheese and the short rib tacos. The mac and cheese was fabulous, and I would highly suggest it as an appetizer. The short rib tacos were unique and very well prepared, and the portion was generous enough that I still have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Overall, I had an amazing experience at Chelsea's Kitchen in Scottsdale. I felt well taken care of, and I look forward to returning to this restaurant in the near future. Five stars!"}
{"text":"We were welcomed again for another experience, and we had a great experience. I think going when it's not as busy helps out, but service was amazing, and food was so good. I recommend the surf and turf tacos and the filet mignon, mashed potatoes. 
The sangria was delicious and gelato is good, red velvet cake was not my favorite. 
But overall they went above and beyond to care for their customers and our experiences at their restaurant."}
{"text":"In a word, overpriced. 

In a few words, not worth it. Grilled swordfish tacos were bland. $91 for two people to eat dinner is a crime against humanity."}
{"text":"I love Chelsea's Kitchen.  The food is great, the service is top notch and the atmosphere cool.  The ONE complaint I have is being forced to valet my car!  In N.Y. or L.A. valet parking makes sense to me (there is seldom a near-by parking place and you would be forced to walk blocks to park your car).  In Phoenix it makes no sense!  You are never more than 50 feet from the front door in any restaurant parking lot and in the case of Chelsea's Kitchen there's a ton of parking all over the place.  I don't like people driving my car and I object to having to pay an extra $3-5 bucks for something I am capable of doing (and prefer to do) myself.  
Rich D."}
{"text":"Don't go here.
A chicken caesar salad, chicken sandwich and 3 drinks was $80 without tip!
The wine was \"corked,\" Sent it back
Had to ask for salad dressing 3 times.
Salad was bad.
Chicken sandwich was dry.
The menu isn't impressive.  Hugely disappointing."}
{"text":"Wow. Every single thing we ordered was delicious. Loved the deviled eggs. Short rib tacos were delicious. And the red velvet cake - oh my.  Great for families and large groups."}
{"text":"One word: Chilaquiles.  They are fantastic here!  One side has red sauce, while the other has green - I love split personalities!  I also like the comfortable atmosphere here, on warm days and nights their patio is lovely, with a nice fireplace, those good white lights (not the god awful led ones), and a selection of items that will appeal to everyone.  They open earlier for brunch on Sundays than on Saturdays which we discovered one unfortunate Saturday after we had done a charity walk, and were starving only to discover that we had an hour to kill.  I had my heart set on those chilaquiles as well as some guac, so not even Vincent's market next store could quench that beast and we wound up getting nice and happy with a bottle of mimosas while we waited for Chelsea's to open.  A word to the wise, 2 people can eat off those taco plates and still take home leftovers (I'm also glad to see they took that uninspired white rice and beans off the plate and replaced it with kale salad!), and I never order dessert here when those scrumptious chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are taunting me as I walk out.  I know this is probably bad form, but I always grab at least 2.  I know.  I just can't help myself."}
{"text":"Well, lets start by saying when we first arrived it looked like a front yard BBQ.  We placed our names on a long wait list at least 45 mins to an hour. After an hour wait we were seated; The server came to take our drinks but after the hour wait we studied the whole menu and was ready to order.  We waited and waited and waited and after an hour waiting for our food a lady comes to apologize for the slow service which and said our order will be out soon....tick tock again the order arrived.  My cheeseburger was the worst ever...I should have just gone to Burger King were it taste better.  My friends food was cold and I had enough. The initial server we had never came back to us to see if we needed anything but we notices he was at everyone elses table. The outcome was we didn't pay and we left.  Somehow I am still speechless from the poorest service I've ever received.  Their was no excuse for bad service and bad food! Save your money."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Kale salad and always add salmon. I have learned how to make a version on my own, but it always tastes better here. I also always make sure to show up to the airport early so I can get this as a pre-flight meal. 

And don't forget to leave room for the delicious red velvet cake!"}
{"text":"This place comes in clutch at the airport. I LOVE the kale salad here and the apple cookie. I mean, you can't really go wrong with a majority of their items, but the sweets and salads are the best! 
For a different spin on chicken salad, they put apples in it, which is surprisingly good... but the sandwich itself is kinda messy and hard to eat. 
Great upgrade for the airport tho!"}
{"text":"Had the green chili burger and the wife had the short rib tacos, both of which we each sampled and concurred were excellent.  To top it off, we split the red velvet cake.  I have to say as one who is not a big fan of red velvet, that it was fantastic!
Next time we're back here, we'll be in again for sure."}
{"text":"Two words. Lauren O!!!

A table of 13. on a Saturday night. and her service was flawless. Most would grunt and sigh over such a large party but she was friendly, attentive and consistently provided quite possibly the best service I've ever received. No glass was left empty, whether it was water or their signature white wine sangria and the food was delicious. We will be back. And we will be requesting Lauren O. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I am going to start light railing it to the airport just so I can eat and drink. There are so many great choices now, including Chelsea's Kitchen. 

My boyfriend and I got to the airport way too early for our flight and decided to spend our time at Chelsea's Kitchen. I had a glass of pinot noir, which was really good, especially considering it was only $7. Foodwise, I ordered the short rib tacos, which were perfect in every way. Flavorful, tender, and it's always kind of fun to make your own little tacos. My boyfriend had the Chelsea's Burger, and I know it was amazing because he didn't offer me a single bite. Jerk.

The only negative here is I don't think you could eat here if you only had a limited amount of time. Our server was also the bartender and was pretty slow. Our meal took a lot longer than it should have. Also, even though there was ample room in the restaurant, including some comfy looking couches, the hostess sat us right next to another table."}
{"text":"Went on a double date here a couple weekends ago.  We sat at the bar and each had a drink while we waited for our table.  We got to sit on the patio, which is very romantic and lit up and they even have space heaters if you get cold.  The food was great, I got the Brussels Sprout salad and everyone else had a burger.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals!  Will definitely be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"$17 for scrambled eggs, bacon and orange juice? Ouch. Service was good but the food is average. I won't be spending my money here again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I have the Ahi tacos. Comes as a platter with fresh tortillas. Can miss dish!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!  Great service, good atmosphere and fantastic food!!!"}
{"text":"It hurts my soul to only rate Chelsea's Kitchen with 3 stars, as I love the restaurant in our neighborhood and the food is always great, but unfortunately this experience was not good. The staff and overall service was horrible. The hostess was pre-occupied and acted bothered to seat us, and both of our servers (drink order and food order) were both very disengaged and flat out rude. It was almost as if they were inconvenienced to wait on us. No follow up during our sit down and not even a smile or \"thank you\" for stopping in. One can only hope that everybody was having a horrible morning and that this isn't the norm, because it was sad. Chelsea would have been very disappointed. 

Maybe next time. :/"}
{"text":"Chelsea's is our all time favorite place to go for any occasion! On a nice day sitting outside on their patio under the bright yellow umbrellas makes the food taste even better.  and the complimentary cookies waiting for you at the door are worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Tips:

$21 for a pitcher of white sangria
$12 for endless mimosa (only orange mimosa)

They offer delicious sea-salt chocolate chip cookies as you wait for your table. Snag a couple bites because they are delicious!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The atmosphere is amazing, both indoor and outdoor seating are great to sit in. 

Great for dates or a small brunch gathering. The only criticism I would give is that I got the eggs Benedict and my egg was cooked thoroughly all the way. It's a shame that the egg wasn't poached correctly, but the dish itself still tasted good and was a filling portion.

I would highly recommend getting the white sangria, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Although the environment outside under a beautiful tree was ideal.... The food selection and portions were very small. Presentation, taste and service was very disappointing.  I would not suggest it!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty old fashioned's with big 'ole square ice cube. Sat at the bar and had a great view of the outdoor dining area which was being misted. Great ambiance! I had the rotisserie prime rib which was delish."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can really say. Admittedly this place is a little out of my price range but the food quality and flavors did not disappoint. The attention to detail from the moment you walk in the door to the moment you take your last bite - blew this foodie away. I had the Kale and quinoa salad to start. So many taste bud pleasers in one dish; from the sweetness of the grapes to the salty parmesan cheese to the earthy Kale to vibrant lemon vinaigrette. Then I had the short ribs for my main dish. omg! So tender and perfectly cooked. No knife needed to cut into these delicious little pieces of meat heaven. They are nestled on top of mashed potatoes that would make grandma cry- they're so good and creamy. Then I finished with a scoop of one of their seasonal gelato - peanut butter chunk. Whew! So delicious. 
** notes I love the simplicity of the decor but the attention to all the little details."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for a date!

Has the perfect ambiance, amazing food and located in a great part of the valley. Try their brown sugar fries with your burger! You also get a cookie on the way out... I'm a huge foodie and there's too much I love about this place. The only downside can be parking... But they have valet so problem solved ;)"}
{"text":"This was a second trip for a friend and me, the first being overall extremely positive so decided to unleash it on our significant others. And they were very happy we did. Once again, we were greeted pleasantly at the door and taken to our outdoor table. The patio is such a lovely setting, making you feel secluded in the city. And our server was accommodating as we kept changing tables trying to avoid the sun. Bear in mind, the fact that it is late May and you can dine outdoors without misters speaks well overall for the patio.

Two of us chose brunch (the SW baked eggs) and two chose green chile burgers. The eggs were served in a cast iron dish which really retained heat and allowed the eggs to continue cooking, which was nice as they arrived a little runny but set up nicely as the meal continued. There was no shortage of tender pulled green chile pork and pinto beans in the dish, very flavorful and satisfying. AND it was served with four freshly made corn tortillas. The tortillas were obviously fresh and had good flavor, but I couldn't eat more than one. I was more intent on what was in that little pot of cast iron tastiness!

The burgers came as ordered- medium rare. They were covered in roasted green chiles and I was told the chiles were delicious. The burgers looked good... I will only know for sure when we go back! The only comment I heard about the burger was that the bun seemed a little big for the burger. Fair enough. The french fries that came with it were not your average fries. They are covered in a savory sweet seasoning (think brown sugar with paprika and seasoned salt) and were very good. I'm not sure I could eat a whole order of them, but they were good for sharing. 

On the previous trip, I had the brussels sprout salad and was pleasantly surprised as this isn't my favorite veggie but decided to step out a bit. The sprouts were bright and tender. I was asked if I would order it again and my quick answer was no- I need to try other items. I would also kick up the dressing with a little more acidity or salt, just to make it a little more dimensional. And maybe some toasted almonds. Yum!

The menu has a wide variety of items that are sure to please just about anyone and will be added to our list of places to return to."}
{"text":"My parents flew in from the SF Bay Area, and I couldn't wait to take them here. It was the first time we brought our four year old along for the experience. We had a beautiful table outside - the plants around us were in full bloom, and the food was (as usual) perfect and magical. My step-mom has gone to culinery school, and is one of the best people I know at name-that-ingredient game. She also is the biggest stickler on good service - hates being overly tended to or ignored. She was so blown away by the food, service, and atmosphere that she actually weeped happy tears of joy - I have never seen this happen before, except when our daughter was born. This place is seriously the best!"}
{"text":"Always spot on. Great quality for reasonable prices. They never miss delivering great atmosphere and awesome food.
Had an exceptional surprise. The Valet service (DESERT PARKING) blew us away. They took our car, parked it up front ,and had it ready as we walked out. And they couldn't have been more polite.
We are planning our next dinner this weekend.
YEH !!!"}
{"text":"One thing's for sure, and that's that Chelsea can cook a mean meal.

Our group of three swung by this spot on a Tuesday after our original plans fell through, and we called ahead to see if they had any tables open. They had one, and they so graciously held it for us since we were just a few minutes away. We were seated right when we got there as promised, and I could tell right away I was going to love the atmosphere! 

I tried the white sangria and thought it was great. I wanted to order more cocktails but was trying to do that whole \"responsible\" thing. My eyes kept going straight to the Prickly Pear Margarita, so that's what I'll try next time. 

Moving onto the food, the brussels sprouts salad with almonds, manchego cheese, and bacon is excellent, and perfect for sharing. I had to order the grilled swordfish tacos because a few people told me about them beforehand, and I'm so glad I did! The toppings were wonderful, and the kale slaw that came on the side is worthy of ten stars. So much flavor, and I felt good about getting a solid dose of greens in. What I loved most about my dinner was that most of it was so healthy - fresh veggies everywhere. 

I would absolutely visit Chelsea's again. Another home run in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Typical airport service, most food was very good.
First off, soda drinks are In a can.  
The Deviled eggs with bacon appetizer were delicious, and served on a cool wooden plank.  
Rotisserie chicken was soggy and shriveled on the outside, not crispy and rotisserie looking, but the fresh veggies were delish.
Burgers were unique, cooked to order and tasty and had nice presentation.  Chicken tacos were build it yourself with an ample portion size.
Coffee was French press and spot on.
We had to flag down the server for refills, sauce needed, and plate clearing. This part put a big damper on our supposed fine dining in an airport experience."}
{"text":"Slightly better than the typical airport choices but not worthy of the 4 stars. 

The green chili burger was messy but not as good as it should have been. The chilis weren't as tasty as other versions I've had in New Mexico. And the crispy sandwich was fairly bland despite the interesting toppings. Actually the cottage cheese was the best part, which I've never said before."}
{"text":"We stopped here during a layover at PHX airport.  Not sure how long it's been here, but it replaced the Chili's that used to be here...so...how was it?

meh....

way over priced for the food....and they REALLY like kale....kale everything....

it's fine to eat here once or twice...the portion sizes are VERY small...see the photo I uploaded...pay a premium for a cheese burger...litle tiny patty hidden in a big bready bun and TONS of kale 'slaw' on the side...or tons of french fries....WEAK!

I understand it's an airport but, this really was very cheap and 'low brow'...especially for a place that's trying to pass itself off as being 'higher end' than the chili's that used to be there.

the food itself, was decent enough.  No complaints about the flavor or quality.  Burgers were cooked properly to order.  Service was fine....really, they have a captive audience in this airport.  There just isn't anything else for a selection if you want an actual sit-down meal."}
{"text":"New to Arizona, Chelsea's Kitchen was a suggestion from a family friend that lived in the area. 
I looked at the menu online and wasn't too excited about it, but my husband and I decided to try it anyways. 
Wow, I'm glad we did! We had Caesar salads to start, he had the pork tacos, I had the grilled salmon for dinner, and for dessert he had the key lime pie, while I tried the chocolate pavé. 
Everything was delicious! The chocolate pavé I took home with me and it took a couple nights to finish it was so rich! So good though."}
{"text":"I consistently enjoy Chelsea's Kitchen, even in uncomfortable circumstances (long story). This last time was no exception.

We started with \"white\" sangria, which none of us had heard of before, despite prior visits. The \"white\" is a pinot grigio so it was an easy decision to order the pitcher. The sangria was delightful - we didn't quite finish the wine, but the pitcher-ful of fruit was polished off.

My swordfish tacos were delicious and filling. My friend's fried chicken (a special) was good but a bit dry. I suggested gelato after dinner; no one had room.

Service was a bit inattentive. The table seated after us received menus, waters and had their order taken before we had a server approach the table. After the first server, another seemed to take over and things got better.

The atmosphere at Chelsea's is good, as others have pointed out. It's a great place to hang out. The setting is beautiful. I will return."}
{"text":"the staff is amazingly friendly. The food is tasty. The ambience and decor are cool. We had the short rib tacos, chilaquiles, and ahi tuna burger. All mouth watering dishes.

While we waited for seating, the outdoor lawn and pond was a perfect place to play chase with my son. A little on the pricey side, but you won't walk away feeling like you were ripped off. Well worth the relaxed atmosphere, great staff, and wonderful food.

Bonus: Children eat free 3-6"}
{"text":"Yes, this place lives up to all of the great reviews on here. Went here for brunch on Sunday. We waited about 15 minutes to sit outside on the patio which was great. We started with deviled eggs that were amazing. I got the eggs benedict which was also quite delicious. Bloody Mary gets a thumbs up as well. I can't wait to go back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Airport Bar on 3rd level.  Nice place, airport prices as usual.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen has some of the best flavors! Everything you can get here is literally a party in your mouth. Unique pairings like the chilled gazpacho watermelon soup, or if you want to keep it simple, a benedict piled high of lump crab meat. I had the Santa Fe Eggs and it was mouth watering. The service was exceptional as well. Good thing it's right across the street because next time I am definitely walking over and getting myself some endless mimosas. I just got out of the pool when I walked over so I felt a little under dressed, but casual to semi formal is cool too."}
{"text":"First time at Chelsea's, fabulous! There were 5 of us and we got 2 salads, both types of chicken, & the paella. Everything was great and we shared across the table. Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Since I'm writing this post a special thumbs up for the rotisserie chicken!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice night to sit outside. I had the guacamole and chips appetizer it was absolutely delicious! For dinner I ordered the Green Chile burger unfortunately I had to send it back because it was under cooked, they remade and it came back out under cooked. Although I wasn't happy with my meal I really like this place. I think I need to try something different. My server was great very attentive and kind. I'm going to try the red velvet cake with a scoop of ice cream! Can't go wrong with that! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"This is a well known restaurant that just so happens to have a location in the airport. I was excited to try it knowing that airport food is not always the best. I met my parents before I headed out on a flight. Overall it was a pleasant experience. The server let us linger and enjoy our conversation. My dad's chicken sandwich came out overcooked.  He never sends his food back. After hearing my mom talk about it the entire lunch my dad subtlety mentioned it to our server as he picked up the plates. I was pleasantly surprised that he took it off the bill. He said it was not up to the standard and quality is very important. I was more than impressed. Great job at exceeding expectations. To top it off they give out complimentary cookies at the exit!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in Arcadia. Service has always been great here! I love the Brussels sprout salad with chicken, and although it's nice to know its fresh chicken when it comes as half a rotisserie, I'd like it if they cut it off the body. It's easier to mix that way. The crispy chicken sandwich is good, but so big! The half soup half salad with chicken is a good deal because they are still very large portions. Ambiance is great here. Cool local spot."}
{"text":"Delish! I really liked this Chelsea's we ate on the patio and it was beautiful. The food was really good I had the fillet tacos and they were perfect! The key lime pie was the best I've ever had and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fantastic atmosphere. This place is busy for lunch and busier for dinner. You can't go wrong ordering just about anything. A personal favorite for lunch is the French Dip. The salmon was outstanding. Try the side of Mac and Cheese. It's the best I've ever had; white cheese, and creamy but not very thick."}
{"text":"Great environment. Bartenders are outstanding. Always have a great experience. And if the halibut is ever on special... just order it and don't think about it. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"I am a firm believer in if you can complain about it then you should also praise it!  We went back for Lunch yesterday, sat on the Patio, under the cooling misters and we had a nice time.  Our server was attentive, our drinks came right away and our food was exactly what we had ordered.  The fries are some of the best fries anywhere and the Rare French Dip is amazing.  I am so glad that I went back again,because THIS is the Chelsea's that I know and love.

Thank you for encouraging me to try again, Allison!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I eat at Chelsea's about once a month. We love the chicken nachitos. Don't be fooled by the name; they are enormous. There is nothing \"ito\" about them. They come generously topped with fresh shredded chicken, silky melted white cheese, chunky guacamole, and sour cream. That appetizer is accompanied by a fantastic red salsa. Yum. 

Another of our favorite entrees is the swordfish tacos. The fish is always tender and cooked to perfection. I love the homemade tortillas and kale salad too. 

The service is always impeccable. They are quick to refill bevs and ask how we are doing."}
{"text":"When I visit Phoneix for the week I stop here at least once (try to get here twice).  

This might be my favorite place to eat of all time.  Chelsea's is busy, but I've never had to wait more than 30-35 minutes.

My go to items:

We order the Sangria.  It is unbelievable.  I rarely drink, but it is a must have.  

The Short Rib Taco's.  The Short rib's are excellent, so flavorful.  The corn tortillas are served warm and soft.  The only thing I put on my short rib taco's is the guacamole because it is amazing.  I generally sub out the kale for their mash potatoes.  

I recommend this place to everyone and no one has ever had a bad meal.  In fact, when people travel their they generally send me a pic of their meal to make me jealous.  I always am.

Don't forget to grab a chocolate chip cookie topped with Sea salt on the way out the door.  Although, sometimes you have to dust off some of the sea salt.  

Great service, always friendly staff and the patio can't be beat when I travel from MN."}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant in an airport I have yet found in the US. It's essentially a really cool fusion steak and western cuisine grill house similar to Houstons or StoneHill with a n unbelievably fresh menu.

The center bar is manned by solid bartenders who have real personalities unlike many other airport bars where androids serve you watered down drinks.

This place is legit. 

On a long flight delay we had a couple delicious from scratch margaritas and the soup soup of the day (black bean with green chili). The fries are seasoned and delicious. The burger is as good as anything you would find on the best spit fire grill, and the Rotisserie Chicken is slow cooked all day in an amazing seasoning.

I can't say enough about this place. Hopefully the airport formula makes sense for them as a business because the restaurant ads more value to Sky Harbor than most of the airlines do."}
{"text":"Swordfish tacos were delish! With a very cold Mic Ultra."}
{"text":"If you feel like escaping Phoenix for an afternoon no need to leave the Valley just head to Chelsea's! Set against the canal, the back patio is a urban garden paradise. Service was second to none, attentive but not overboard. And the food was good too! We had taco plates, the protein was so well cooked. The tortillas didn't really work with the delicate flavors. And for the price we would  have liked a little more. But all is all, a great little spot."}
{"text":"This is simply my favorite restaurant  for brunch/lunch/dinner in town. As a small business owner the fact I I appreciate the most is the CONSISTENCY -  or great food and great service. There is no bad days here. If you see a person there ordering chicken nachitos over and over and over.... that's me :) Congratulations to management on tightly run ship!"}
{"text":"Beautiful patio, just gorgeous with lovely flowers lining the outside wall.  We got a table right by the fireplace. We had a nice meal, I had mahi-mahi tacos, not a lot of flavor but good presentation. Really friendly server.  The venue was exceptional."}
{"text":"Dropped in hoping for dinner last night or rather what I thought would be dinner.
While I hate waiting for a table, and there always seems to be a wait here, I liked the text message notification alerting table availability.
My companion and I headed to the bar where there was no seating available.  There were two high top tables on the patio adjacent to the bar. We asked a server if the table's were available and she advised that on the weekend they were seated by the hostess and she was unsure how they were being handled on a Tuesday night?
We confirmed with the hostess that these tables were first-come-first-served and took the seats under the very messy tree.  Nothing like small leaves in your hair and food.  No wonder they were available!
After about 10 minutes sitting unattended we lassoed a waiter. He acted more than a little put out that we found him rather than the other way around.
While the bar food, nachos, was edible it was served cold. The melted cheese had already congealed by the time it reached us. That was dinner, there was no further waiting for a table where actual dinner was served.
Bottom line, for me, is the entitled Arcadia-scene is not for me. The food here, is edible.  The valet parking is unnecessary.  The wait, because of un-bussed tables (at least on the patio) was unnecessary.
There are other more civilized places in this town to spend money. I won't be back."}

{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service from the entire staff. My server Liza was absolutely amazing. This place never misses."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is great. The food is awesome and the restaurant is great. Once you get to the table, the service is great. Any taco option is great, the veggie burger is tasty and the fries are tops.

Service with the hostesses can be lacking. Reservations are not typical here. Making a reservation means you get \"preferred seating\" but are still on the wait list. This means you may very-well end up waiting 45-60 minutes during a rush even with a reservation. Also, I get the feeling that the hostesses skip over less-vocal people waiting.

It is still one of our favorite places, we just plan on a little extra wait."}
{"text":"Tonight I was here my grandparents. It was my first time and I am beyond impressed. It was my grandpa'a birthday and he is very hard at hearing and gets confused easily because of it. Our waiter (I should've gotten his name) was so patient and went above and beyond to make sure he heard and understood him. The food was also amazing with list of vegetarian options! I will be back! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My classmate and I came here for restaurant week and were very impressed!

Here's the scrumptious choices we selected: 

BRUSSELS SPROUT SALAD
almonds, manchego cheese, smoked bacon (optional)

CHELSEA'S SHORT RIBS
with pan roasted vegetables, add an egg

GRILLED SWORDFISH TACOS
freshest fish in town w/ made-to-order tortillas

RED VELVET CAKE
with grateful spoon butter pecan gelato 

I must say that my favorite parts of the meal were the tacos and the spoon butter pecan gelato. The salad tasted very fresh. The tacos were so flavorful and what really spoke to me was how tender the meat is here. The butter pecan gelato was so delicious I asked for two scoops! Yum! This place filled me up and I enjoyed our experience. Complimentary Valet parking is awesome also!

Note: They do not make a very good non-alcoholic mojito. However, the white sangria is delish!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen. We were told it would be about an hour wait, but told we could order drinks at the bar. I had the Buck & Rider cocktail which was perfect for any whiskey lover. After only about 25 minutes, we were shown to our table. I love the decor and the openness of the restaurant. Next time I definitely want to try and get a table outside. For my main, I ordered the daily fish special. It was cooked perfectly and paired with slight sweet sauted vegetables. My friend ordered the filet. I tried a bite and it was also perfectly prepared paired with mashed potatoes and green beans. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The guacamole was on point!  My boss and I had today's special, brisket. The meat was so tender and fell apart effortlessly.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff we came across this place because we had a 5 hour layover so we decided to go here for brunch, the food was just basic I had a French omelet and my bf had the burrito both was decent but 4 stars because of the great service and the pitcher of white sangria we had was amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I've been here a few times and always leave thinking that whatever I had was the best thing ever. So far we've tried the lobster and filet taco platter (which is reasonably priced), cheeseburgers, Caesar salad, and most importantly an off the menu item: short rib nachos!!!!!  It was so flavorful and so wonderfully fatty, that honestly no other nachos could ever compare! It was huge and even with several of us eating from them we got no where near even halfway through the platter. Just trust me, and order them!"}
{"text":"A very good restaurant for an airport.

Good food, good service, nice ambiance.

Highly recommended.!"}
{"text":"Great spot in terminal 4. Ive never been served such good food so fast! I had the veggie tacos which were amazing and came with guacamole, pico, and a delicious salsa/dip? The homemade tortillas were so good too and the perfect size. Just slightly bigger than a street taco tortilla. My server was awesome and was on top of it. Refills, extra tortillas, and service were at quick and great timing. Not an easy thing to do! 

I enjoyed the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Lower lighting, piano music, and fun to people watch. 

If I'm ever at terminal 4 again and waiting, I'll gladly stop here for food and a drink."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with a friend while we both had a comfortable hour to wait for our respective flights.  
I have a lot of food allergies.  Some require very strict adherence.  Our server, Kris, walked me through the menu patiently.  I ordered a salad minus a lot of items that would cause issues.  The salad came but it was topped by a vinegrette that I can not eat.  He calmly explained that the salad was prepared in advance this way.  But he would be glad to suggest other items.  
  Without an ounce of hesitation he removed the salad brought the menu back and patiently explained other options.  What it came down to was creating my own green dish - avocado, tomatoes and sunflower seeds.  It came promptly and was delicious.  
My friend's meal was also very good.  
I'm giving these folks a 5 stars not only for service beyond the norm and for great food, but for their cheerful attitude, great atmosphere and great value."}
{"text":"For dinner, it's Hillstone/Houstons with a bit more flair. But you'll end up spending a ridiculous amount of money on a non-offensive, passably mediocre menu. Brunch is a much better bang for your buck. The sangria is great along side some chiliquiles or the lemon ricotta pancakes. Or just go to LGO to avoid the 20 percent mark up for brunch."}
{"text":"I had a layover in Phoenix and stopped here for a bite to eat. I ordered the kale/quinoa salad. It was great. A very healthy portion of a very healthy meal. The service was quick and friendly. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the area and chatted it up with us as we sifted through the menu and decided what to eat. The only downfall about the setup is that you have to re enter security after eating, so give yourself enough time to leave and re enter."}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas, they say. 

Go to Chelsea's Kitchen, they say. 

Better then RndR, they say. 

Wait....what did they say! Sorry, I'm lost in the endless amounts of champagne and OJ and the delicious tastes of classic American dishes with a twist. This place is awesome and if you want a great experience with morning booze and food that actually makes you jump up for joy, this is your spot. 

RndR was sooooo last week. There is a new Kween in town and her name is Chelsea."}
{"text":"Perfection every time! I love the ahi tuna tacos, and the short ribs are incredible too! Top 5 in town for me!"}
{"text":"I'd give the restaurant 4 stars like the original restaurant, but everything I come here the service sucks. Maybe it's an airport thing????

The food is usually good, but $4 for wilted fruit that was made last night is not acceptable.

The bartenders are always in a bad mood and they don't pay any attention to you. 

I've been here about 10 times and this will be my last. I guess they're after 1st time customers and that's it because its an airport.

And what's up with the New Yorker type workers with their attitude???"}
{"text":"Wow, such a great find in an airport of all places!  The dark, upscale ambiance here was a welcome contrast from the usual airport feel and I'm glad that the food and service matched it accordingly.

Our meal began with some chips & guacamole and while the former could've been fresher, I loved the creamy guac.  Next, my carnitas pork roast was sliced paper thin and topped with just enough BBQ sauce to deepen the savory flavors without drenching everything.  Finally, the key lime pie at the end was sweet and refreshing.

A five up high goes out to the waitress too as she really did an excellent job throughout the meal - well-spoken, enthusiastic with recommendations and very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"I had plans to go to another place but ended up here for brunch for New Year's Day and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't see the usual mimosa under the signature drinks but the sangria was a nice change for brunch and really good! We ordered deviled eggs that I was suspect about... But was excellent with the bacon on it. I ordered short ribs hash and was ok with my decision because of all the great choices, I tossed a coin at the end. The only down was my friend wasn't a fan of the Bloody Mary, although pretty in the wonder women glass! The atmosphere was clean and bright. It will definitely be back and order the devil eggs"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen was kind enough to give us voucher to come back and experience the restaurant again on them.  We appreciate the effort that was put forward to make things right by having us come back.  5 stars to the staff of Chelsea's Kitchen.  

We had to present our voucher to the waitress upon ordering.   In doing so, we felt as if  her mood changed immediately when she saw the voucher.  Maybe it was just our thinking, but we did not receive as good of service as the first time.  She did not box our food or even crack a smile to be honest.  

I have to stick with my first review about the food.  I had the steak and my girlfriend had the ahi burger.  She said she liked it more than what she ordered the first time.  I did like my steak, but again the food wasn't hot when it got to our table.  Overall, the food is at best mediocre.  

But, I will give the staff and the overall ambience of the restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"I didn't love it the food but I didn't hate it either. the set  up is really great though. sit outside, it's really fun."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of my sister in law while we were on vacation.  We fell in love with the ambiance of the outdoor eatery, and the food and service were amazing.  We will for sure recommend it to others and will go back when we return to AZ."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of buzz about this restaurant, I finally got the chance to check it out.  I had attempted to go a few weeks earlier, but the hour wait for a table was a little too much for my already-growling stomach to handle.  This time we called in a reservation, which made our wait pretty non-existent. 

First thing to note was that the place was very busy and pretty noisy.  Not as noisy as Delux, but soft-spoken people are going to have to take it up a notch.  Luckily, my party was comprised of pretty loud people, so we were okay.  When things did periodically quiet down, there was a pretty cool selection of music playing ranging from Iron and Wine to Simon and Garfunkel. 

We were seated at a table in the center of the dining room that had two chairs on one side and a bench seat on the other.  Being relatively short, a couple of us found a bit of a challenge sitting in the bench, which is a little lower than at some other places.  It wasn't horrible, but we definitely had to sport excellent posture all night. 

To start the meal, we ordered the Chicken Nachitos.  The portion was not giant, like you see at many other restaurants, but a good size for all five of us to split and still keep our appetites.  We ordered a couple of burgers, a prime rib and the crab cakes.  The burgers were delicious, possibly even better than those at Delux (gasp!).  The review of the prime rib was good as well.  The crab cakes, which were a special that night, went over well, although for two crab cakes and an ear of corn, the price of $30 seemed a little hefty.  For dessert we ordered the Turtle Sundae.  It was your average sundea but with the hot fudge and sprinkles on the side, so you can be as conservative or crazy with them as you'd like. 

Overall, I enjoyed the place.  Cute place, good food, nice atmosphere.  

That being said, I do have one complaint in regards to their beverages.  Soda is served by the can with a glass of ice, something that is the norm in places like NYC and Europe.  That's fine, you don't want the hassle of dealing with a fountain.  I'll deal.  I will say that it is pretty annoying when combating the desert heat of Phoenix.  Charging $2 for a can of soda that probably costs less than a tenth of that when bought in bulk just seems like highway robbery.  Phoenix has always been the land of free refills, proabably because it's really hot here and people need to drink a lot of fluids to survive.  It's not just the soda that they're stingy with though.  A few members of the party ordered iced teas and lemonades, which came already poured in large glasses with ice.  That setup seems made for free refills, but they too were charged for each glass.  Additionally, there were times when our server or another staff member came up to the table and refilled the glasses without even being asked, helping us to rack up a non-alcoholic drink bill equal to the prime rib.  C'mon.  It's hot here.  Really hot.  People drink a lot of liquid.  Why be so stingy with the beverages?"}
{"text":"I like short ribs...If you like short ribs have it here also?!   I would eat here more often if:

1. I had more cash, can get spendy if you ate here everyday
2. I live an hour away...
 
I need to get a job by 40th street, this is a MUST dine location.  You should be happy with just about anything you order here.  This is on my top 10 list......"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today. We arrived at 10:45am, and they were kind enough to seat us before the kitchen opened at 11:00am.

The service was very good, decor top notch, and the prices very reasonable for the quality of the food. One of the best French Dip Sandwiches I have ever had. The menu is very simple with just a few choices... I have noticed that places who try to serve every dish for every taste only do so half-ass.

Really nice outdoor patio too!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, usually for lunch. I always get the cheeseburger and fries. At first, i couldn't imagine paying $12 for a hamburger, but once i tried it, i discovered it was well worth it. This is one of the best burgers in town and thats why I get it everytime. The woodfired grill gives the lean meat great flavor, and the handcut fries are fresh and delicious. Try them in ranch dressing. This place is real trendy and always crowded. Sit on the patio, it is a great atmosphere. I had the pumkin pie and it was amazing, even though it was $8, but the slice was huge. Well worth it. For an upscale dinning experience go here and enjoy the fresh, natural food and professional service."}
{"text":"To start off, this review should have been given months ago since we tend to go here a couple times a month. Chelsea's is our favorite place to ride our beach cruisers down the canal so we can partake in some cocktails and great American comfort food. 

Favorite Dish: It has to be the Prime Rib French Dip. With very generous potions of beef and a homemade baguette you would think that would be enough. They take it a step farther with an amazing homemade horseradish sauce and perfect au jus. Wait there is also the Fish Tacos. The fish is so fresh and flaky and the brown's sauce with fresh vegetables make this a meal that has to be tops. I then remember the Chicken Nachitos, Pan Fried Chicken, Soups and so much more. There are so many favorite dishes it's very hard to choose one. You can't go wrong.

Service: Chelsea's has had a lot of the same servers for the last two years we have been going there. That tells me two things, one the establishment takes good care of there employees and they are happy. The other is that Chelsea's has done an amazing job in finding good, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Amazing how service can make a meal taste so much better.

Dessert: Yes have the Red Velvet Cake. You will gladly run the extra 5 miles tomorrow. 

So after a great meal and some drinks we make our way home via the canal in hope that the ride will burn a few of the many calories we indulged in. We are so fortunate to be able to have a pit stop midway at the Biltmore Resort. Review coming soon!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful, warm, and secluded. I was welcomed by complimentary valet and the smell of good food and tasteful music. We sat outside on the patio with misters and well groomed trees. I chose the seafood paella which was absolutely delicious, my friend got the short rib tacos. Everything and every bite was bursting with flavor. We were told to get the Sangria as well and we got the pitcher size, which was wonderfully made. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Small portions and high prices at an airport are expected. Bait & switch aren't. Heck, I wasn't even paying and it still bugged me. 

Went to the To Go counter at 12:30. The sign advertised  a Caesar Salad with chicken for $13. Okay I'm in. But wait, there's a catch. That's only for the pre-made salad and once they run out you have to pay more for them to make one for you. It's $6 more and the chicken is bone in from their rotisserie. 

I was starving so I went ahead and ordered. Next time I'll eat somewhere else even though the food was good."}
{"text":"Great fish Tacos and an Ahi Tuna burger to die for."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, service. Lots of options, great deserts. Enjoyed the patio. 4 stars instead of 5, mostly because it's pricier than it ought to be on many items, though that doesn't  seem to stop them from being crazy busy all the time."}
{"text":"The ownership of Chelsea's Kitchen, La Grande Orange Grocery & Pizzeria and Dylan's got it right! Fresh food and basic choices that are consistently good. 

We had dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen on 5/16/2010. We had the white sangria, fresh guacamole & chips with charred tomatillo salsa, lobster tacos w/ melon & tomatillo salsa along with their fresh made corn tortillas, the Chelsea cheeseburger. All were great!  I can easily say this because we live in San Francisco and in my opinion we have some of the freshest and best food around by far.  Chelsea's food, ambiance, service and all-around menu choices are tops."}
{"text":"Just got back from Chelsea's Kitchen with my boyfriend on a nice Sunday afternoon early dinner. I heard about this place a few times from friends and decided we should go check it out. When we walked in the restaurant smelt tres good! We decided to sit outside - great choice there was a big fireplace and lots of heat lamps which I sat right underneath.  We asked the waitress what they had for happy hour (everyday 4-6) it was around 5. She recited the drinks but we had no idea what she was talking about when she said the food part of the happy hour. I understood nachos and we got that (minus the chicken, im a veg head) Those were good, they say it is a smaller portion of the Chicken Nachitos on the menu ($13) they were $8 (for happy hour) and pretty good, good portion of guacamole on top and we both enjoyed them. My bf got a beer (happy hr - $2.50) and I got the white sangria (happy hr it was half off $3.50) - pretty good, needs more fruit. However, I saw a table order the pitcher and we regretted not doing that (tons of fruit and super big pitcher!). My bf ordered Chelsea's Cheeseburger with fries. It was a big portion but he didn't care too much for it. It was $12. I had a bit of trouble finding something to order - all the salads had meat in them! I ordered the Brussels Sprout Salad and got avocados instead of the smoked bacon. Overpriced for a salad - $13 not that big - medium sized. It was good overall but nothing exceptional. Overall the restaurant was really good for the outdoor seating. Probably won't go back since there are soooo many great restaurants in PHX/scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went to Chelsea's Kitchen for the second time this past weekend.  I wanted to try it again to be sure that my first experience was as good as I had remembered it. It was so I have deemed it review worthy. 

Saturday night it was crowded but we felt comfortable sitting at the bar and enjoying some sparkling lemonades while we waited.  The wait was about 25 mins but it went by quickly and when finally seated I found the service to be good. 

The food was good, not memorable but good. I had crispy chicken and my companion had the short rib tacos.  The chicken was prepared well and the rib tacos looked good as well.  I like Chelsea's Kitchen and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! I have nothing bad to say about this place. Everything is fresh and local, and the service is fantastic! Outdoor seating is lovely too.

I ordered the tacos. They were YUMMY! My friends ordered the salads, which they claimed were amazing and just as yummy as my tacos. 

Make sure to get a pitcher of the sangria as well. Some of the best sangria I've had.

MUST GO."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite Phoenix restaurant. I love all aspects of the menu. I typically start with the guacamole or Brussels sprout salad, followed by the prime rib or surf and turf tacos, accompanied by the white sangria, and I love to grab a complimentary salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out. In addition, the servers are always outstanding, attentive but absent and friendly, without overwhelming. You will wait about 35-45 minutes for a prime time on a weekend evening, but in my opinion, it's absolutely worth it. You are also limited to valet only on busy nights but it's free with the exception of a tip. I only have two hesitations, the first being that the host staff are just okay. Usually, I find that the hostesses are artificially upbeat and slightly condescending, but not specifically rude. The second being that they don't take reservations, with the exception of large parties. That being said, those issues are minor and I will be returning often!"}
{"text":"I use to really enjoy this restaurant but lately not so much.  The food comes out cold and when you send it back they reheat it instead of making you something fresh.  This use to be one of my favorite places to eat, too bad!"}
{"text":"Having experienced such great food at the grocery and pizzeria a trip down 40th street to LGO Hospitality's proper restaurant - Chelsea's Kitchen - would prove to be much of the same and with brunch service starting at 9:30am I arrived just a few minutes after the doors opened to find the patio already partially filled as the warm sun and late October breeze filtered through the space.   A large restaurant with an enormous open kitchen, plenty of seating, and vastly more parking than the grocery I'd heard some mixed things about Chelsea's but with the same high standards of food, service, and setting I really enjoyed my visit - though perhaps not QUITE as much as my frequent stops down the street.

Hotcakes:  Having asked my server, Jenna, if I could order the children's hotcakes as a side dish to my main course I was instead offered the option of an individual cake for $2 (as opposed to the children's $6) and happy to take her up on the offer the hotcake turned out to be light, fluffy, and golden brown; perhaps not the most exciting option on the menu but a textbook example of how a pancake should be done - particularly when paired with high quality pure maple syrup.

Dixie Pan-Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Vegetables:  The main reason I visited Chelsea's on the day that I did was because I was going to noca for the Fried Chicken showdown that evening - what better way to prepare for fried chicken than with fried chicken?  With that noted, the comparison between the bird from Chelsea's and that of noca, fnb, or any other are a little bit difficult because of the style of preparation, but all things being equal what I really enjoyed about the chicken at Chelsea's was the moisture content of the meat and comparatively light breading overlying the well brined bird.  Crisp and savory with just a bit of spice further enhanced by the peppery potatoes this was down home comfort food - like the hotcakes nothing fancy, just well-made with superior ingredients, though I will say the mashed potatoes and vegetables could have used a bit more salt...and the chicken was even better with a drizzle of the leftover maple syrup from the hotcakes.

Red Velvet Cake with Butter Pecan Gelato from Grateful Spoon and Fresh Mint:  A thick slice of LGO's classic cake served with a scoop of butter pecan gelato from Grateful Spoon and a mint leaf - much like my meal at Lo-Lo's it wouldn't have seemed right to end a breakfast of fried chicken without a slice of red velvet and while I still prefer the version at Lo-Lo's overall it is only by the slimmest of margins and based entirely on a personal preference for a sweeter frosting, something La Grande Orange shies away from, instead focusing on the slightly sour notes to help temper the otherwise dense chocolate cake.  Six of one, half dozen of the other - and the gelato was excellent, though more butter than pecan, and definitely upping the dish's sweetness factor but a significant degree.

A great room and a lovely patio with professional service and fresh, natural, and delicious food I'm sure I'll find myself back a Chelsea's Kitchen soon - but likely not before a good dozen additional visits to the grocery and pizzeria."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!  I was in town for business, but my boyfriend grew up here.  I asked him if he was in Phoenix right now where would he eat, and this was his suggestion.  I was not disappointed.

I arrived around 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed and there appeared to be a wait.  Since it was just me I was able to walk up to the bar and find a seat right away.  I was greeted right away.  

Since I was feeling a bit sick, I really wanted soup and all their soups are homemade daily.  I forgot the name but it was a chicken & rice soup with a broth base, so delicious.  My guy also recommended I get the kale salad.  The nice part is they will do half portions of all the salads.  I had that with the white meat chicken.  The salad had an amazing light dressing on it and I loved the addition on grapes to give it a different texture and flavor.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and very moist.  I wish I had more of an appetite because there were so many more things I would have liked to try.  They also had a really nice craft cocktail list.  

I was also excited about the ambiance of this place.  I really liked sitting at the bar area that was connected to the outdoor seating area.  The place was dimly lit with string lights going overtop the seating area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving 4 stars to an airport restaurant. Here's why:

This is only one experience and we were hungry due to the flight delay. There was no seating in the restaurant so we sat at the bar and had great service from the bar tenders. We asked about a couple of the menu items and figured two of us were planning to get the same thing so we asked about it and the server indicated the sandwich was 'huge' so we ordered it and asked to split it. They were very accommodating.

The food had good flavor and was well-prepared.

Good experience for eating in an airport. Thanks."}
{"text":"2nd time around was much much better.  We had a great time, a great meal and service was spot on.  Cookies on the way out are awesome! I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co worker. She had the vegetarian tacos. Looked amazing and she said the task was wonderful everything had flavor. She especially liked me homemade tortillas and the kale slaw. I ordered there green chili cheeseburger french fries. It had a wonderful spicy kick to it and crunchy pickles and onions just made it even better. Our server did and excellent. Went above and beyond customer service."}
{"text":"Menu is a bit short, but reasonable prices. Nice open bar and patio area. Very consistent service. Surprised how fast and early the place cleared out."}
{"text":"Outside of the security check in at Terminal 4, PHX.   

Great service (thanks Rachel), solid food (Green Chile Burger is very good, Kale Salad is killer) and West Coast IPA by Green Flash on tap (the reason I stopped here). All at a reasonable price, especially in an airport.  An interesting range of music playing at a good volume, and power for your phone or laptop.

If you have some extra time before heading through security, stop here."}
{"text":"A fine place to grab an expertly crafted sandwich for a reasonable price, a little pretentious but that's west coast living"}
{"text":"This place was rockstar! I thought for sure it would be a rip off since it's in the center of the Phoenix airport. But I was very pleasantly surprised.

You have to get the deviled eggs! You have to get the deviled eggs! You have to get the deviled eggs! Make sure it's a large order. They were the best I ever had. I wish I knew how to make deviled eggs this good!

The tuna tartare and guacamole was out of this world as well. The fish was fresh in the guac was wonderful. Thinking back now I should've squeezed a lemon all over it. I will do that the next time I'm in Phoenix because I'm coming back and having a large order of the deviled eggs and probably the tuna and guacamole again.

If you're in the Phoenix airport eat here do not hesitate."}
{"text":"I've been to Chelsea's half a dozen times or so, which is infrequent compared to my appearences at other places in the area.

Why, you ask?

1.  Parking.  It SUCKS and half the lot is blocked for valet, even on a Tuesday.  This being 2010, I use a debit card for most of my transactions.  I don't have cash to tip a valet.  I understand its a small lot for a place that busy, so take this complaint with a grain of salt.
2.  Some Pretentiousness.  Somehow Chelsea's didn't get the laid-back vibe of the other restaurants in their empire.  I went on a Tuesday last week, after work, a few minutes before my wife, who was coming from 24th/Camelback, and they wouldn't seat me.  Ever hear the phrase \"It's not what you say, its how you say it\"?  Well, the attitude with which I was told I wouldn't be seated literally ruined my dinner.  I've never punched anyone before, but I briefly considered it that Tuesday night.  And I think 2/3 of the crowd was lawyers just getting off work, dining with other lawyers, who still had that \"holier than thou\" attitude.  While waiting for my table this one fat guy bumped into me three different times without so much as an excuse me.  Its not like I jumped out at him - I was standing in the same spot for 15 minutes.  But I take comfort in the fact that he was obese and I am not.

The Good:
1.  They were extremely open to changes in the dishes.  BIG kudos for that.
2.  The food is great.  Some advice:  \"Medium\" salmon is equivalent to \"half-raw.\"  I now know to order it well done.
3.  The sell a 10 oz glass of wine. 
4.  Cool spot, nice patio."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Everyone from the hostess at the front, our server and then when we were leaving. 

We stopped by to eat before boarding our flight home to Los Angeles. 
Ordered the taco beef short rib, the Howie burger and side of fries. 
I can't describe how juicy my burger was!! Medium rare...oozing cheese and tender sautéed red onions. 
The short rib was also flavorful and loved the dark crispy pieces. 
The fries....what can I say? It's crispy, thin, seasoned lightly and just darn heavenly good!

As you walk out of the restaurant, you can grab a salty chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Their white sangria is the best I've had besides my homemade one. The Nachitos are delicious and portion feeds around 3-4 people, they should be called Nachotes!! I like everything on the menu, kudos to the chefs.  Great atmosphere and very attentive servers.  I stop here when ever I can and recommend it to family/friends."}
{"text":"Celebrated with my girlfriend on her birthday; we had wonderful service from Amanda! We enjoyed the chips and guacamole and salsa tasty as usual. My girlfriend had the kale and quinoa salad that  she thoroughly enjoyed.  I was completely delighted with the Delmar salad which has shrimp & lump of crab -fantastic!!! We celebrated with a piece of their famous Keylime pie which came with a side of fresh strawberry gelato or ice cream- sublime!!Can't wait to go there again"}
{"text":"This was great.  Romantic, outdoor seating, yummy food."}
{"text":"The IN Place to go. Very Southwest Fusion.........  
We sat on the Patio which is great at this time of year in Phoenix......

Try the Ribs or Deconstructed Tacos.

Specialty Drinks were VERY good too. Had a take of on an Old Fashion with some kind of orange liquor that I never heard of in it and it made it a Unique, in a good way, Cocktail."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've had the luxury of dining at in decades. I couldn't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic.  The signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you dainfully sip your way into alcoholic bliss. 

The oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' situation.  

The cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure. They soothe the restless 'fat kid' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving Cheslea's Kitchen a bit more bareable."}
{"text":"Want to impress someone?  Take them to dinner on the patio at sunset at Chelsea's Kitchen.
I've been here for drinks and appetizers with friends before and finally returned for a dinner date.  It was fantastic as expected.  We sat on the patio near the fireplace shortly before sunset.  We were able to enjoy our cocktails in daylight and then dinner under the Christmas lights.  Speaking of cocktails, they have a fantastic wine list, selection of craft beers, and I enjoyed a delicious vodka lemonade.
Our server was so friendly and polite.  My prime rib, potatoes, and vegetables was so delicious.  My date's house made french fries were great and he said his burger was tasty.
I love this place.  My date was way impressed with me to say the least."}
{"text":"It's an awesome brunch place and definitely worth the try. We ordered a variety of dishes and everyone was happy with their order. I ordered the Short Ribs Hash and I could not get enough of it. The service size was huge  so it was so worth it. Their mimosa glass size was a little disappointing, but the meal and service made up for it. 

If you are planning to go for brunch be prepared to wait. Everything on the menu looked amazing and the service didn't miss a beat. A must try brunch place."}
{"text":"What an over-rated pretentious place.

We went there on a wine club bike and dine event. First impression was nice. Bike parking by the water entrance, nice patio with trees.

We had a section outside reserved for our group but that section was not covered by trees and we didn't have any more places to sit or even stand comfortably so we sat down at a table next to the group on the patio.

10 minutes later no one brought us water or asked if we wanted anything but  a douche of a waiter covered in colorful tattoos told us we couldn't sit there because it was reserved for guests. I asked him why he thought that we weren't guests and he gave me an attitude about how this is for different guests and we had to get up in a threatening voice. He probably wanted this table for a tip that otherwise wouldn't have went directly to him.

Despite their greediness we still stayed with the group and went inside where I had a Mexican coke but I didn't think that it was warranted to spend 30 dollars on some ribeye tacos and a fancy alcoholic drink because I don't like being treated like cattle.

Within 15 minutes 4  tables opened up and I went back outside where I sat down at a table again and the tattooed jackass gave my wife and me a mean intimidating look as if he was about to get violent to the point that my wife was scared of him and wouldn't dare sit down.

I wonder if they hire their wait staff directly out of tent city.

Anyway, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Grateful Dead, Bob Dylon, The Police, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton... these were the first five artists playing overhead at this Arcadia dining destination.  Totally kool and definitely my cup of tea.

Oh, and the food was pretty good too... actually, I've been to Chelsea's a handful of times, and I've enjoyed the food and ambiance on each occasion.    You can't go wrong with the rotisserie chicken but tonight I went with the steak tacos and shared the swordfish tacos with Colleen C from Chicago Yelp.  No drinks for me as I was DD tonight - yes, I let the girls have their fun!  

Tunes, grub, and ambiance make this place a 'go-to' whether you sit inside or out..."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place for rib eye or prime rib.     The quality is by far top notch.   Tonight we had the tuna tartar with guacamole.    It was fresh and delicious.     Service is also on par.   Friendly and prompt.   What more cud you want.   Service tonight was with Janel.   She was great!   
Our food came out quickly and was hot and cooked just as we ordered.   The rib eye tacos were amazing.   They serve with fresh made corn tortillas,  pico de gallo, guacamole and a very tasty kale quinoa salad.   
Thank you to Chelsea Kitchen for another great meal !"}
{"text":"Decent food. Big pile of Salt on their cookies, WHY?? Dry burger buns. Great red velvet cake.

Really friendly service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and now they have a satellite location at the airport! Awesome staff and service that is very friendly and helpful. Food is very flavorful and fresh. Ingredients are top notch and it is definitely reflected in the food. I love that the airport now has a great food option instead of the normal fast food garbage!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the kale salad and sea salt chocolate chip cookies. I think I've tasted every libation on the menu and it does not disappoint"}
{"text":"LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen! It is definetly my go-to place. I am usually one to try something different anytime i go someplace more then once but their Del Mar salad is to die for! I've always had good service and even when it is busy having a drink at the bar or even waiting at the door it seems to never be a long wait. Great atmosphere, love sitting outside, weather permitted."}
{"text":"I had no idea about this place but was invited from a local that lived nearby.  When we first arrived I thought \"oh no valet parking\" because there was no regular parking. Yes I'm cheap I hate to pay before I've even gotten in the front door. The good news is they don't charge you when there are no regular spaces so I was ok.  We sat inside and I really liked the atmosphere from the get go.  Very upbeat and the place was pretty packed for a weeknight.  The menu looked good with many selections.  My friend go the ribs and I had the aji tacos and the other woman with us had the veggie tacos.  My plate normally comes with either black beans or fermented veggies.  I kind of could not decide so I had them give me both of them.  I liked the presentation of everything, The tortillas are really good and the only problem is they give one plate for two hungry people.  We had to ask for a couple more plates they were so good.  Everything tasted great and I thought the wait person was super nice and friendly.  There was a cute little baby at the table behind us that made everyone smile.  It is a little loud but not too bad.  It is definitely a good date spot. Overall a fun time"}
{"text":"Cute place horrendous service. Last meal in Arizona and in 9 days worst service yet.
Ordered a mimosa on recommendation of waitress - 15 minutes later I asked where it was to be told the champagne wasn't cold - another ten minutes later for a glass of wine.
All our plates came out separately and once finished sat for another 20 minutes to get cleaned - luckily had left lots of time for flight!  update- manager was so nice and comped our meal / give it a go but leave enough time"}
{"text":"loved our experience here.  the outdoor setting we were seated at had a great atmosphere.  the food was very good.  I would highly recomend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Wine by the bottle, very reasonably priced.  Service was splendid.  Food, cooked right but nothing over the top sensational.  Some nice healthy alternatives though.  Great place to conduct business both inside or on the patio.  Great thing is-not packed with kids!"}
{"text":"I live in scottsdale and never venture out much but decided to stop in to Chelsea's kitchen because my girlfriend wanted to try it out. REALLY BAD DECISION!!! The Service was terrible!!! They hate people from scottsdale or not local they think we are privileged and treat us that way. I could never ever recommend this place to anyone who is not a regular because they will treat you like you do not belong so why are you bothering us.  Simply just rood an awful service.  Spend your hard earn $$$ elsewhere"}
{"text":"We had the brussels sprout salad and the kale salad. Also had the prickly pear margarita. Everything was yummy! Service was good as well. 

The only complaint I have is that the chicken was dry despite being dark meat. You'd have to really overlook the chicken to make dark meat dry."}
{"text":"Short rib was amazing. Service was excellent. Open air bar is a nice touch and they have patio seating. Great meal for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sangria! This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Arcadia area. The specials are always delicious and the service is always great. They have a fantastic patio, but I wish the trees would drop fewer leaves in my food."}
{"text":"What can I say for an airport restaurant, this place is over the top good.  Good music great bar staff good electrical plug ins at the bar for laptops and oh did I mention the deviled eggs for four bucks?  Yum yum"}
{"text":"Wow we had three people recommend this place. We arrived in Phoenix and it was one of our first stops! The food was amazing and the service was even better. Short rib tacos and French dip both really good! The atmosphere is very comfortable and relaxing. Had the pumpkin pie which was very good and obviously home made. I usually like it a little sweeter but good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! Food is great- this is a good date spot!"}
{"text":"I have to say literally every time I dine here I have a wonderful experience! The food is consistently delicious, fun atmosphere, beautiful restaurant and great service, what else can you ask for? The pan-fried chicken with the sweet, cinnamon roll thing, are you kidding me? so good! The chips and guacamole is always a crowd pleaser.  If you go on the weekend prepare to wait but stop by the inside/outside bar and grab a margarita and it's all good. I don't usually get dessert but our party decided to split a few and the red velvet cake was to die for! Key Lime pie pretty darn delicious too! If you haven't been to Chelsea's stop what you're doing and go, now!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food!  Airport food no less!  Coworker and myself took a short trip to AZ and winded up here on the flight back.  Just seen this place and walked in.

Ordered:
Chicken Nachos - Really good flavor...cheese was sharp and ingredients were fresh as can be.  Best part was the guac was real, not the baby food style guac!  

Short Rib Tacos - Flavors and tenderness were off the charts!  I asked the waiter what the best thing was and he suggested this and man was he right.  I'll go out on a limb and say it's one of the best things I've ever ate.  Well rounded flavors and just great ingredients.

I'm coming here anytime I fly through PHX...SERIOUSLY!"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh food.  Perfect setting.  I couldnt have asked for more.  Well worth the price"}
{"text":"After see the Instagram photos of the patio we finally checked this place out for Sunday Brunch. 
Thank goodness for the free valet! This place was packed. We opted to sit on the front patio to avoid a 30 minute wait for the back patio. 
We started the devil eggs & bottomless mimosas. 
Our waitress was attentive, mimosas fill. All of the food was great for our party. The pancakes have an amazing lemon flavor that works perfectly with the maple. The fries has a great seasoning - the burger was good but I could live with just the fries. 
I recommend the front patio - it's great for people watching the Scottsdale customers. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is prices. The prices are clearly set for the Scottsdale crowd with $24 Tacos. Our bill for 3 people was $96 which, even with mimosas is pretty spendy."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant due to a co-worker's recommendation. It was surprisingly good.  I had the kale and quinoa salad with ribeye steak. The salad was very good (more kale than quinoa), and the thin steak was perfectly cooked medium rare.  

For an appetizer, I had a half order of the deviled eggs--a little dry, but otherwise tasted well. 

The restaurant has either gelato or key lime pie for dessert.  I opted for the key lime pie and it was excellent. Surprisingly, it had a side scoop of strawberry gelato, which was very good and had bits of strawberries in it. 

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to my server. I rarely saw him and had to ask other servers for drink refills and dessert.  The other tables didn't seem to have this problem 

I highly recommend this airport restaurant!"}
{"text":"So for airport food it was good and the drinks were pretty great. However, for airport food its pretty expensive. Unless your looking to impress your fellow travelers then you definitely should think of checking out one of the other hundred establishments in the area for half the price. But the food was pretty good and get the prickly pear margarita. It's pretty amazing."}

{"text":"AWSOME food !! Great vegetarian options . Very friendly waiter Desere ! Cornbread withe pepper very delicious!! Kale salad , country style veggie in Pesto , black been burger , veggie taco salad were outstanding . Our drink had good flavour with exotic cardomum . Only thing mediocre was the Brussels sprout salad . 
Thanx for a great eat great food !! Lastly yummy cookies as we are exiting complementary sweet and salty mini cookies hit the spot.."}
{"text":"In the area for a work conference.  Found this place on Yelp and could not have been happier with the service, food, and atmosphere.  Would love to go back when I am in the area.  Thank you for such a great experience."}
{"text":"An excellent place to 'hang' while waiting for your flight or for a rendezvous-vous! Food from fresh ingredients, generous servings, and professional servers. We really like the Guacamole & Chips appetizer, Tomato-Basil soup, Kale salad, and French dip sandwich. Try the 'real' key lime pie and local vanilla bean gelato. A real treat!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The Rib tacos and Tuna Tartar was delicious. Cocktails are great too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic swordfish tacos served w kale and grape salad, and guacamole. Delicious. Excellent staff-Janel was fantastic on recommendations. Pleasant seating inside and outside on patio w misters - even on a sunny afternoon it was comfortable."}
{"text":"I hate this place!!  The food is way too good; the by-the-glass wine list second to none in the valley, the eye candy is always enjoyable, the service anticipatory; the physical site - indoor and out - extremely pleasant; complimentary (and quick) valet parking; and - yes, the vaunted chocolate salted cookies on your way out.

Why do I hate it then?  It keeps drawing me back!  I am a \"luncher\" - generally later in the day, often near cocktail hour.  Over the years I've \"curated\" my list of 6-8 spots that have great food combined with an excellent by-the-glass wine list; generally visiting each once or twice every couple of weeks.  Chelsea's Kitchen, and its sister LGO restaurant just down the street - Buck & Rider - are supplanting all but one other.  This place has me hooked.

If you didn't know this was a LGO restaurant, a quick look at the wine list would be your first clue.  Excellent by-the-glass offerings at a variety of price ranges.  I can personally recommend the rose cremant, the Foxglove unoaked chardonnay, the Byron pinot, and the Madness and Cures sirah; I am not a fan of the Ironstone Cellar cab -  the Lodi vineyard, should have warned me away.  Larger group, or special occasion (?) - the Vineyard 29 cab ($80), and the Robert Craig Howell Mtn. zin ($75), both only available  by the bottle, are awesome choices, and priced about 2/3 of other valley wine lists.  And, if like me, you are a liquid dessert fan, and have a designated driver or are Ubering - a small measure of the Taylor Fladgate 10 year old tawny port is an awesome finisher.  Ask about wines that may be in stock, but not on the wine list.  Recently I discovered a Rombauer Chardonnay, only available by the bottle, and only until the current stock is depleted.

OK - important stuff out of the way; now for the food;  my favorites from the top of the menu are the deviled eggs with bacon (that's the midwestern in me); the California part favors the shrimp ceviche.  I could eat both the LGO caesar and the brussels sprouts salads as stand alone lunches but then I would miss out on the entrees; so if dining with someone both salads are enough for two as a entree precursor.  The Chelsea's cheeseburger (angus beef), sans bun and rare for me, is a satisfying and enjoyable lunch, especially when paired with a glass of the Byron pinot.  This past month I had the fish of the day which was grilled Idaho trout with the vegetable of the day - chargrilled brussels sprouts - paired with the Foxglove chard, and it was excellent.  On a previous occasion I had the prime rib, served with the obligatory side of horseradish sauce, paired with a glass of the Madness and Cures.  In an earlier reviewI had been critical as my idea of rare, and the chef's, appeared to differ; I like my rare mooing when I get it; the portion I received on that occassion was more medium rare.  Subsequently, I have had two \"mooing\" servings of the excellent prime rib.

The physical layout, along with the rear patio fireplace and ample bar seating - both indoor and out - is inviting and enjoyable.  If you sit on the patio be prepared for birds - lots of birds - chirping away; indoors the restaurant has a high noise level which encourages one to simply sit a bit closer to one's companion, assuming the dining occasion is appropriate for such.  This restaurant's location in the Biltmore area, along with its menu price points,  ensures that it attracts the local, well-heeled crowd, as evidenced by the cars in the parking lot, and the jewelry and accessories on the diners.  My companion on a December Friday evening cocktail hour visit asked me if I knew what all the men in the bar area had in common?  My response, after a moment of surveying, was that, like me - they were all with women 20 or more years younger.  After I recovered from the nasty elbow to the ribs I received; she commented that all the men were wearing Rolexes.  [I guess men and women notice different things.]

The restaurant appears often chaotic, however the service is not reflective of chaos.  Orders are taken when the diner is ready, drinks and food delivered promptly, food and wine pairing recommendations are made by servers who have obviously been trained to address such questions.   I had lunch at the bar recently, and bartender Kayla was able to provide anticipatory and superb service even with a busy bar area.  

The General Manager - Natasha - reminds me of my pilot training many years ago; head on a swivel we were taught in yesteryear.  Watching her walk through the restaurant, head on a swivel, seeing all, one observes a true a professional in operation.

Be aware that the price points for this restaurant are inline with the neighborhood; excellent food and wines are fairly priced, expect $25 - $35 person for lunch; $35 - $50 per person for dinner; plus wine/cocktails.  {I recommend a minimum 25% gratuity for superb service such as I have received.}

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for lunch on her layover and we chose this spot to catch up in a relaxing setting. It was just that. We talked for awhile and finally ordered. 

Thanks for great service and letting us chill there for awhile. To us, the time was going by too fast! We even outlasted our server and had other well mannered servers complete the end of the experience. Thanks Dawn and Dawn.

I had never been to this chain before, but I loved the food and there were other things I wanted to try on the menu. I heard the French dip is awesome. So that'll have me coming back! 

I live in town so it was interesting trying to get into the airport, but in the process I got to use the new SkyTrain, which was cool. Lucky for me, I don't have to go to the airport the next time I want to dine at Chelsea's Kitchen. I appreciate the local Phoenix culinary influence in the airport, but it's also nice to know I don't always need to worry about airport antics if I'm not traveling."}
{"text":"Best fries, virgin mojito, and veggie burger in town.  Their fries are downright addictive, and this comes from someone who doesn't like fries. 
They have a beautiful outdoor patio for winter dining, the service is excellent, and the food is delish."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this airport restaurant.  I would definitely eat here again.  Excellent salmon, actual mashed potatoes and perfectly crunchy green beans."}
{"text":"Love this place. I went for Sunday brunch and despite the 30 minute wait to be seated, I was impressed by the staff and the set up as well as the food. Bottomless mimosas, amazing huevos rancheros  and burgers. I will definitely be back.

Price wise, it is on the upper end --everything was upwards of $15 per plate.
The bottomless mimosas at $12 were reasonable and I believe the valet is complimentary and the line is usually long so that's a plus. 

The location doesn't look like much outside but the space has been utilized quite beautifully inside and out with a bar that serves the back patio and inside the restaurant. If you're looking for a hole in the wall, this isn't it. If you're looking for a nice place to have brunch or dinner, this is a good choice.

Edit: on my last visit, I sat at the bar...the service at the bar was trash. Although I enjoyed my food, I had to wait far too long to be acknowledged and it was not busy enough for that to be the case. You don't have to like your job however when you work in a customer serving role,please act like it."}
{"text":"So the reviews say that it's the best place for food in terminal 4 (southwest).  I though the food was good for an airport but below average for a place outside the airport.  I got the most well known thing there, beef short ribs taco and a lemonade.   I liked the lemonade more since it was made fresh (lemon, sugar and egg whites).  The beef short ribs was tender, and pretty big sized.   It's just that it wasn't amazing (have to keep expectations low at the airport).  Anyhow, I'd go there again if I was in terminal 4."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. I take everyone I know there. Friends that I have taken there are now going and taking their friends and I love that!

The best part is the service- no the food- no the service- AHHH! You get the point. I love the manager Chris, the chef Bruce, and the pastry chef Jeannie. I have been there so many times that I wish I could buy stock in the place!  They treat me like a queen and I am no one. So that must mean they treat everyone like that. That's the way to do business.

All I can say is- GO! I have been there almost 4 dozen times and I feel like I should set up a cot. 

This is also the PERFECT place to take people visiting from out of town because they will never have anything like it at home. If the weather is cooperating sit out on the patio. It is beautiful.  

I love the DelMar salad, the Brussel Sprout salad, the french dip, and their seasoned fries are awesome! My son loves the ahi tuna burger and the red velvet cake. Our newest favorite is the short ribs. OMG. The short ribs. With the egg.  MMmmmMMmmm. 

Try the key lime pie.  It was awesome. I  don't usually like pies like lemon meringue and key lime but my friend got it and I took a bite and then wanted one of my own!!! I recently tried their sangria too. It was DEEEELISH! Just give me a side of fruit please! ;-)

And I must mention the chocolate chip cookie plate on your way out the door. They are to die for. (Btw- the old recipe is better) The right combination of sweet and salty. You must try them to understand. Then you will PLOT how to take more than one, but still be polite, and not look like a slug for taking an entire stack of them. NOT kidding!"}
{"text":"I love Chelsea's Kitchen!  I've been here several times, and I'm always happy here!  
I love the deviled eggs, the tuna sashimi, the guac,  and the kale salad!  My fiance has had the prime rib, and it was amazing!  I think they put crack on the french fries.  I don't normally care for french fries, and these were delicious.  

I want to try the pb and j sushi rolls for fun :-)  Sounds cute!

Loved the strawberry gelato!

The service is excellent!  Love the cookies on the way out.  It's a great place."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen at the airport is pretty good. My husband and I had lunch there before he left on his flight. We each had the prime rib. It was excellent.
He had the strawberry gelato for dessert. 

The food is good but it's definitely not the ambiance of the Phoenix location. Great food for the airport, but if you are looking for the atmosphere go to their other location."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers has mentioned Chelsea's more than once and after a morning of walking dogs at AAWL, I shot up 40th street to try Chelsea's.
The interior is contemporary and open, the bar seating is interior but open to the patio.  The patio has several tables and umbrellas but I can see how it can fill quick.  I arrived at around 1140, they were still serving brunch (which I believe is served till 2 on both saturday and sundays).  Not really feeling what I saw on the brunch menu, I asked for a lunch/full menu.  
I ordered a  white sangria which was refreshing and served with crisp apple slices and juicy sections of orange.  I finally decided on the Howie Burger cooked medium.  It is served with a nice gruyere cheese carmelized onions and a dijon sauce.   I was expecting the onions to be more simple and not marinated with a balsamic vinegar and I found the dijon sauce excessive and rather sweet.  I can't complain too much the burger patty itself was cooked perfectly medium as ordered.  All said and done I wish I had ordered the regular burger."}
{"text":"I have the short rib tacos and a dirty martini. Excellent late. Beautiful presentation. Everything was delicious. I would highly recommend this establishment if you have at least 20 minutes to have a incredible time and experience"}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen has become my default destination when I want a decent sit-down meal and can't think of anything new or exciting.  Everything is done very well.  I especially enjoy the fish tacos, which come with a surprisingly good side of rice and beans. But my favorite item on the menu is the tuna tartar & guacamole appetizer. Nothing else on the menu really pops, but my friends and I haven't had any complaints yet.

Service is always strong, as with the other LGO properties. This is especially evident at Chelsea's Kitchen where it appears they have implemented the Houston's-style service approach, which is a Good Thing.

Finally, the thing that really makes Chelsea's Kitchen stand out is the building itself.  A great example of the sprawling, airy Arizona ranch-style house with great front and back patios. It can be difficult to get a seat on the back patio, but the rest of the restaurant is pleasant enough that I don't mind. The only negative comment I can make is that the bar is on the small side."}
{"text":"As an Arizona native I'm lucky to get to make the trek to camelback and 40th street to get my favorite Del Mar salad and white sangria on a whim but today headed out for a flight and no lunch, gave me the opportunity to grab these two gems at terminal 4. The quality and service is always top notch and everything was yummy as usual!! If you find your self in terminal 4 and hungry stop in you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Chelsea's Kitchen to grab a bite to eat before heading home from a business trip. They had a good sized crowd - but weren't super busy - and we were immediately sat at a table. Our waiter was on point all evening. 

I decided on the ahi tuna burger and instead of fries I opted for the kale quinoa salad. It was a healthy sized 'burger' but didn't sit too heavy in my stomach which was just what I needed. The wasabi mayo added the right zing. The kale quinoa slaw was the right balance to pair with the burger. I don't tend to eat in airports too often these days, but if all the restaurants were like Chelsea's Kitchen, I would find myself there a lot more often."}
{"text":"Absolute love CK!!! Their food and drinks are amazing - especially the green chile burger - hands down, best burger in town. Outside patio is charming and a fun place to hang out with family and friends. Very kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Food is fresh and delicious. The only problem we had was that the parties at our table all got charged different prices than the menu and from each other even tho we ordered the same items. Very strange. It was remedied once we brought it to the manager's attention, but odd nonetheless. Nice place for a bite to eat, just watch the bill."}
{"text":"One word: Amazing!! Service was excellent. The entire meal (especially that Red Velvet Cake) was crazy good!"}
{"text":"Had the Howie burger, it was perfectly medium rare and delicious. The fries have an awesome seasoning on them. Dad got the crab Benedict brunch and said it was amazing. Service was good, nice ambiance, and it smelled like a wood fired grill inside."}
{"text":"Flight was late. Plus, I gotta fly SW on a Sunday night. Read: zero flight etiquette and crew making stupid jokes attempting to make up for being an hour late that make my walmart shopper-filled plane snicker.  But i digress. Plenty o etiquette at this place. Sat at the bar. Jazz and latin over the speakers. Bartenders as they should be. Dressed in white with black vests. Attentive. Quick. On point. Not pushy. Got the menu. Ordered the french dip which did not disappoint. Good, crunchy on the edges bread...rare beef on the inside. Mmmmm. Didn't mind the spiced-mayo stuff that came with it.  Had the broccolini with parmesan and sauteed onions. Very good. Nobody slapped the check on my table two seconds after i stopped chewing. Respectful-like, see?  So, french dip is very good. The ceviche looked fantastic, too. Service was perfect. I will come here again. No longer mad because of my delay...belly-full and at peace.  Thanks, Chelsea."}
{"text":"great taco platters, mothership on tap, fabulous patio. this is a wonderful place to go in the valley, i would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone, you gotta try it."}
{"text":"I had time before my flight to do a real dinner so I stopped here before going through security. I got seated right away and the waitress came by to take my drink order.  Drinks did take a bit of time as the bar handled them but overall I had a good experience. 

I ordered the Howie Burger - Havarti cheese, caramelized red onions, Dijon sauce - wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun.  I had the kale salad as the side instead of fries (even though that is what I really wanted).  The burger was very tasty.  Loved the cheese on top and the Dijon sauce was not too mustardy.  And the kale salad was great.  Lots of cheese in it.  

The waitress let me work and did not bother me too much and brought refills when she could.  Definitely a nice spot for dinner if you have the time over the fast food options.  Also they had TVs so you could watch whatever game you were interested in."}
{"text":"Good food and good service for a pre security restaurant at PHX. Glad i stopped!! Almost everything came with a gluten free option and the wine list was quite good along with a full bar."}
{"text":"I took an early flight and decided to get some breakfast at Chelsea's Kitchen. As this is an airport venue, the breakfast options are limited but even looking over the menu, it was hard to decide. Everything looked so good!

My husband and I ended up ordering the traditional breakfast (eggs, potatoes, protein side and english muffin) and the french omelet. We also ordered bloody marys and asked for extra olives. I also asked for some light cheese over my scrambled eggs and added havarti. Because my request of extra olives and cheese (on my eggs) our server brought over some additional blue cheese stuffed olives - just cause! I thought that was very nice and unnecessary. I appreciate the little things and that wasn't something I expected.

Overall, we loved our breakfast! I'm quite picky with my eggs, especially with omelets and I was very impressed with the omelet they made. It was a good ratio of egg, protein and spinach and all the flavors went together very well.

A few things to take into consideration, this location is at an airport so the prices are quite high. However, I do believe you get what you pay for and the service was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Chelsea's is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  The service is consistently top notch - free valet, efficient and friendly hostesses, always greeted by a server soon after being seated, and attentive throughout food service.   Some of my favorite menu items are... the brussels sprout salad (with chicken added, it makes a great meal), short rib tacos, chicken nachitos, rotisserie chicken  and green chile mac and cheese.   Non menu item - margaritas, on the rocks, with salt - one of the best I've found in Phoenix!  Their brunch is excellent as well - try their chilaquiles or the short rib hash.  Mmmm... oh and their mimosa specials on Saturday mornings are well worth it too.  A trip to Chelsea's is never a bad idea!"}
{"text":"I was taken on a date here for a late dinner and the place is great! 
I love the ambiance, and the lighting is perfect for date night. 
The male servers are hot. like really hot. hahahah
We started off with the guacamole and salsa is better than I've had a most restaurants. 
I ordered the grilled swordfish tacos, which was labeled as \"guaranteed best in town\" um, that couldnt be more true. The best swordfish tacos I've ever had, and the servings were HUGE.
If it wasnt a first date, I would of took a picture of my dish. but i didnt want him to know about my yelp addiction just yet.
cause i mean.... i've definitely got a problem. hahaha
a must try for dinner! 
I really want to come back for brunch on the patio though."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot in my life. Yes, this is true. As a result I've taken to exercise with a passion. This business of a moment on the lips and forever on your hips is heresy.  

It is also a known fact I enjoy a nice wine here and then. 
(Shhh!) Insert extra cardio time.

And if you know me well enough, you know I moved to Phoenix for the following reasons:

- The nice views
- The nice people

Everything I've just said is available in copious amounts at Chelsea's Kitchen. 

A visit to Chelsea's Kitchen is always a treat. I had to re-write my review to (hopefully) reflect the adoration and fondness I have for this neighborhood staple.

Before I forget, let me start with my recent palate adventure. I enjoyed the BEST. BURGER I've Ever Eaten. 

In my entire life.

No joke. If you haven't had the joy of savoring a \"Howie Burger\" you should stop, drop (whatever you're doing!) and hussle over there. ASAP.

Emily, our super awesome server, helped me narrow down which burger to dine on. She sold me with her prose and obvious delight in the Howie. Carmelized red onions, Havarti cheese and Dijon sauce played so well together in my mouth I had a moment. A long moment. My friends were just not there. (Sorry peeps. My food took precedence.)  Not only were the ingredients doing wonderful things to my tongue the burger truly was cooked rare. It fell apart in my mouth.

I just sighed as I wrote that.
I may have to go back soon for another one.

Yes, every meal at Chelea's Kitchen is divine. They are plated with artistry and presented to the table with flare. The servers all know the story behind each dish and are prompt to attend to any need you have. 

It doesn't matter who you encounter during your visit to Chelsea's Kitchen everyone offers the highest level of customer service. That means the hostess, the servers, the bartenders, the bussers, the kitchen and management.

There is no such thing as a bad seat.
On a lazy day, if you so choose, you can look out on the canal. 
If you feel like it, there's a wonderful patio.
(Of course they have misters. That work and don't drown you.)

If the Phoenix Oven is in effect there is glass to protect the Dainty Humans. 
Oh, and there is just so much air conditioning you should bring a sweater.

Yes, the wine here is amazing. 
So is the sangria.
So are the cocktails.

Of course you've heard about the sea salt cookies. 

To be honest I've never made it to dessert. 
I should probably plan a visit specifically around a sweet. But the main entrees are so good I've never made it that far!

This is the place to bring 
- a date
- a work colleague 
- the family
- out of town guests

And pretty much anyone you want to impress. Dress up, dress down, this place is for everyone. This is Arcadia. You will love it here."}
{"text":"Best airport food ever! Wine list is great. Hamburgers are awesome. The Brussel sprout salad is a show stopper. Try it!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent albeit a bit pricey.
But the noise level is Outrageous--We could not converse at all.
Will not return during lunch or dinner hour unless some acoustical treatment is installed."}
{"text":"Lunch today.  Excellent food, service, and everyone is attentive and friendly!  We have been here several times and we will certainly be back again soon!

My husband got the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich...he loved it & gave me a bite....best we've ever had.  I always get the Short Rib Tacos....excellent!!

Thank you, Chelsea's!  This was a \"do over\" for a terrible Anniversary dinner we had last night!  Thank you for saving our Anniversary!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! Charlotte our server was a delight and she made our dining experience one to remember. If you are interested in great ambiance, great food and drinks, you should not miss this stop. Charlotte is the best server here and ask to sit by the fire. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I started on yelp after looking for a place to vent about the sad excuse for a short-rib I experienced at The Estate House....I may have found it at the \"other\" waterfront location - Chelsea's by the... canal.

I found my short rib. It's not that short. There aren't any ribs in it. It's juicy, it melts in your mouth, and it's found only at Chelsea's Kitchen!

...then there's that thing about putting a fried egg on top of it. Although some swear by it, I just cant understand why you would mess with perfection.

BOTTOM LINE: Great patio. Wholesome & simple food. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant of the LGO family that I love....

I'll start with it was Cinco de Mayo and my husband just wanted some good nachos. So... off to yelp app on my iPhone and Chelsea's was one of the restaurants close by. It was settled, done deal... that's where we're going! 

We love Chelsea's. Great atmosphere, great service, great food, love the Howie burger, and awesome drinks. 

But.... tonight it was all about the nachos and the margaritas!

On the menu the nachos are called \"Nachitos\"... and trust me, there's nothing \"-itos\" about them. They are absolutely HUGE!! So good... I swear there's a whole juicy rotisserie chicken on there. And the guac... yumm!

5 stars because I really like this restaurant. The patio is great if you can score a seat there. 

But 10 stars for the manager holding on to my iPad that I forgot last night in the booth. ( Think 3 strong margaritas............... ) That is SO awesome...Honest mgmt -- THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"This defines three stars for me.  Food was ...pretty good.  Not great, but the service was sub par.  My wife had the veggie burger, which she said was pretty good, but nothing great and I had the veggie tacos, which were pretty good.  We felt a bit shuffled around with our wait staff and had to wait a pretty long time for our check and the end.   I liked the text message wait system they had going, but again the rest of the service wasn't great.  With so many other good restaurants I probably won't be back.  This doesn't really matter too much, but I thought the decor reminded me of a rich lady's vacation home...not exactly what I expected when we walked in."}
{"text":"I came back after being offered a e-voucher for my last experience.  We were seated much quicker this time (about 15 minutes) and the service was great.  I had the Prime Rib and mashed potatoes with veggies.  The veggies and potatoes melt in your mouth.  The prime rib is a bit chewy but was very tasty especially with the horseradish.  The cabernet we got- Rock and Vine was one of the smoothest red wines I've ever had.  Their patio has some of the best ambience in all of Arizona.  Lots of green plants and white lights cover it.  I really enjoy eating/drinking out there.  I would like to come back when the sun sets and see how it is at that time.  They have totally redeemeed themselves and I will be back again :)"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with my dad, my brother, niece, nephew, and their cousin. There were some definite pros and cons to this restaurant. 
Pros: 
Good caesar salad
CUTE kid's menu, little wax toys for them to play with, AND cute sectioned plates with a good serving of tasty food....really nice for kids
The green chile burger was tasty...not 'crazy' good, but good. 
They have a very nice patio which is great for beautiful days like today

Cons:
Valet parking....really unnecessary
Their soup of the day was not very good...a pork posole... it did not have a ton of flavor and was not hearty enough...
The prices are a bit high


Overall, I liked it and would come back, but they could make some improvements."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, service and food!  Eccentric menu...nice to have unusual options!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many, many times. When my \"Foodie  Friends\" come to town, I know that they will enjoy a great meal, with a great atmosphere. 

I love to sit out on the patio, when the weather is nice.

Grab a little cookie on your way out the door!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch before my mother in law had to take off for her flight. 

Nothing on their lunch menu really appealed to me and I thought that everything was a bit overpriced. But then we are at the airport. I ordered the Tuna Tartare & Guacamole. This was really good but I'm not sure if it was worth $15! I also ordered the White Sangria which was really refreshing. 

We had a really good server that was friendly and attentive. I would probably stop here for a drink before flying but that's it."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the very first time w a big group of friends. We sat in the patio with two large heaters around us so it was actually quite nice. The ambiance and restaurant itself was very chic and I liked the sophisticated interior. And as soon as we sat down, our server greeted us kindly and asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered a glass of prosecco and we ordered the smoked Idaho trout dip, guamocole & chips, the real corn bread w green chile and chicken nachitos to start. There were 9 of us so it was a great start especially since we were all starving. The trout dip was kind of like a tuna salad mix that you put on top of a cracker. It was ok... a little fishy for my taste but if you like trout then this is definitely for u. I loved the guacamole and chips! It even came with salsa made fresh. The cornbread was super buttery and absolutely delicious!! And the chicken nachitos was really good as well! 

As my main dish, I ordered the carne adovada which is New Mexico red chile, short ribs w braised kale w guacamole and an egg on top. It was absolute heaven. It came w three hot tortillas that you can make into tacos. The short ribs were done perfectly and the egg over easy just complimented the dish perfectly. I loved it!! Needless to say, I couldn't even finish it so I took it home and enjoying it as my lunch today. Very happy w my experience and the food was seriously to die for!! Did I mention, they give out free cookies?? Yum!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good. The atmosphere is great. HOWEVER, making reservations there is a different story. 

I had 7 people.. tried Chelsea's, Postinos, LGO... read below:

My grandparents were in town, and can't really \"wait at the bar\" until a table is ready. They are old and tired. Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told me they couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.

I also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.

I own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it. 

Seems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \"snooty.\""}
{"text":"What an awesome find along the canal. We saw it on a bike ride from the Arizona Biltmore and walked over for brunch. The bottomless mimosas were a a great way to start our Sunday but don't forget you have to walk back to the hotel! Start with the roasted tomatillo salsa and guacamole first, then order the chilaquiles. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. They have a really nice outdoor patio and looks like a great little place to have a drink with friend as well."}
{"text":"Chelseas Kitchen is an atmosphere kinda-place. The food is definitely above average, but definitely traditional. Get the cinnamon roll as an appetizer. The also do a good job with the Ahi-Tartar. 

I've had the pork-chop, roasted chicken an burger on various occasions. All hold their own, juice and delicious. I'll definitely be back for the food. The patio seating great for lunch/early dinner. I've noticed the service-level has been dropping off the last 2 times I've been. Anyways, I always look forward to the local-made gelato for desert."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. The service is always top notch and the management is knowledgeable and responsive. The atmosphere is wonderful inside and out and sitting by the fire in the wintertime is lovely. We have been coming to Chelsea's kitchen for over 10 years and some of my favorite dishes are the short rib tacos, Dixie's pan fried chicken, jidori chicken, and Ethan's vegetarian tacos. And for dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is absolutely out of this world. But unfortunately, the chocolate cake has been discontinued, and for some reason and the red velvet remains. This, to me, is a mystery. When friends visit from out of town we always come to Chelsea's kitchen and I rave about the food, the service, and the chocolate cake. For me, the flourless chocolate cake has always been the perfect ending to a perfect meal. In the future, I hope the chocolate cake returns so I may again enjoy a perfect meal in a perfect place!"}
{"text":"The patio in back is one of the best in the valley!  Cozy, lots of seating, huge fireplace.  We love the outdoor seats at the bar.  You can't go wrong with the menu, something for everyone.  Small beer selection but always something I like.  Make sure to ask for the free salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out."}
{"text":"The food was good but what was amazing was their customer service. A waitress spilt wine, thank god it was white, on my sister who had a cute outfit on and not only was she apologetic and helpful, so were the other waiters and waitresses. The manager rushed over and handed us a 20 dollar bill for dry cleaning and a $25 gift card for the restaurant, I heard the bar staff asking our bartender to get us our drinks immediately which were comped. Way to make us happy after a sour accident!"}
{"text":"Fan-tabulous! My first time in and I am impressed. I went in alone around 6pm this evening. I love the outward appearance. The lovely walkway leading up to the large wooden door was beautiful. The landscape leading to the door was very pretty and I managed to crack a smile at the water fountain. I love the little bear splashing in the water. 

The entrance felt warm and inviting. I'm not referencing the fact that it was 104 degrees. The vibe when I first walked in felt casual, and very relaxed. I was greeted right away by two servers and a very beautiful hostess. I love the warm colors and the open floor plan. The open kitchen to the right was also very nice to look at. The Chef's/cooks were clean, the kitchen looked very clean and very busy. I witnessed no one standing around.

I sat on the patio as requested. I love that there is no bad table there. The patio is surrounded by beautiful trees. I sat in a corner with my back to the canal so I can see the goings on around me. I don't patronize bars, however, If I were too, this is a beautiful bar. From the inside, the bar opens itself to the patio. Very nice, quaint and casual. 

I was greeted by Dakota. This young man was awesome.  He greeted me with a genuine smile and a willingness to spend time sharing  recommendations for a first timer. Dakota was attentive, and very gracious. 

He recommended the \"Green Chili Burger.\" Sold! the description from the menu got my mouth watering. This massive charbroiled burger patty was at least an inch and a quarter thick. That alone is 5 stars, as most places are serving thin little patties. This medium rare patty was laid atop a thick, crunchy piece of iceberg lettuce, topped with real cheddar cheese and topped again with Ortega chili's.  The seasoned, freshly ground to order patty in concert with the other flavors were enough to satisfy this carnivore, but that's not all...Add to that my requested \"Well Done\" French fries. This sent me over the top. The portions were amazing for the price. I love the seasoning as it had a slight sweetness to it. Dakota said it was a BBQ dry rub with a hint of brown sugar. Mmmmm...mmm. 

The price was good for what you get. I am well satisfied. My only shock came at the price of a 12 oz can of Diet Coke. Yes... can's of coke for $2.25. Sticker shock? Absolutely. However, Given my overall experience, I am more than willing to overlook this petty complaint. I will return. This place is great. Certainly worth every penny spent. And hey, ask for Dakota. Tell him Thought Creep sent ya."}
{"text":"Told us no wait for inside table, showed up 5 minutes later to find a 20 minutes wait. Poor phone answering staff!  Been here before and this is the type of place the staff feels like it should be sold out every night and your lucky to be eating there. Instead of giving good service and being happy your in the restaurant in the first place."}
{"text":"Ate here today before heading back home to Columbus. I cannot say enough good things about the service, food, and atmosphere. We ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer. They were quite tasty and very well presented. I ordered the short rib tacos which were amazing along with the homemade tortillas. We finished lunch with gingerbread gelato and sea salt chocolate chip cookies. I would come back again when in town, and would definitely recommend it to anyone in or around the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place gets an A+ for ambiance and setting, and for their complimentary sea salt choc chip cookies. Yes, that's right - there is sea salt on top of these cookies. 

BUT, when it comes to their actual menu and food, its only a C for me. Their chicken nachos? Save your $14. They give you a ton of chips but lacked cheese and chicken so you can't really call these nachos. 

Their Ahi Tuna Burger - this is not a flank piece of ahi. Instead, its ground up ahi tuna meat mixed with fillers to create a patty.

Probably the best thing i had was their Kale Salad, but that's not enough to draw me back here. Save your money and go somewhere else, and make your own sea salt choc chip cookies."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with two of my friends. When we arrived, they told us the wait is about 15-20 minutes. We walked by the open bar to see if we wanted anything to drink while we were waiting.

By the time we walked by to the entrance, they were ready to seat us (it was definitely less than 15 minutes). The place is dimly lit and it has a very casual but a nicer atmosphere. 

Our waitress was very nice and asked us if we had questions regarding the menu. The wait staff is very responsive and attentive.

We ordered the chips and dip (guac and salsa) as an appetizer. The guac wasn't anything special in particular but it was good. It tasted like fresh guac made from fresh ingredients. The salsa was good, it was a chipotle salsa, nice and spicy - good kick to it!

I ordered the Howie burger with the kale slaw. I definitely like the kale slaw, I RECOMMEND it. I am a big kale and quinoa fan, I make my own. I really like the grapes and sunflower seeds to it, it gives a slight sweetness and crunch to the salad. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The cheese was melted and the onions a sweet and nice texture to it. I enjoyed it a lot.

I would definitely recommend trying this place. Try their kale slaw!

(Today [7/4] they had the buy one entree, get the other entree for $4 ---greatt deal!)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in AZ, always great service, tasty food and drinks and beautiful ambiance. They also have a great happy hour and indoor outdoor bar area along with free valet parking. You won't be disappointed, come experience Chelsea's Kitchen for yourself!"}
{"text":"All I had was their Sangria so I dont know if I can really rate them or not, but based off of their sangria, definitely 5 stars!! Good service also. My friend and I got a pitcher of sangria and its house made and the pitcher has a bunch of fruit in it, no ice which is good bc sometimes the pitchers has so much ice and hardly any drink. I was a fan!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is right across from me! I've loved everything I've tried from the tuna salad to the veggie burger (my favorite). I went in tonight and had the basil gimlet from Chelsea, the bartender, which was delicious. I usually go in when Iesha is working. She's aaaamazing. She always has good recommendations and we have great conversations.
Thanks for the good times!"}
{"text":"The location, decor, patio and atmosphere are amazing.  I love it for that and if all I wanted was drinks then it would do just fine.  Alas, I wanted a good dinner and we went there because everyone in the group heard such wonderful things about it.  Almost everyone at the table experienced some disappointments but no one could say that anything was \"bad\" - they only said they would not be back.  So, the food is not bad but it does disappoint in several categories.  The prime rib was cool and dry, not very creamy or tender.  My burned ends were not ends at all, they were cubes of the brisket that were later burned to look like the real thing.  That is cheating and very easy to detect because it is dry, hard, and over smoked.  To be fair, everyone had elements in their plate that made it very nice and kept the frowns at bay.  Something is missing in the kitchen, but it is a VERY nice place."}
{"text":"Love love loved this restaurant! Food was delicious, excellent service as always. Our waitress April was great. Thanks to you -April! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale ambience, excellent food.  Forgot I was in an airport terminal.  All the staff were friendly & happy to help me make great menu choices.  They obviously retain their staff here.  Fast, quality eating at upper scale price to match product."}
{"text":"Great spot with great food!  Lovely spot to sit down and wait for my departure!  :)  Enjoyed their tuna tartare, green chile burger, and (on a splurge) prime rib.  All delicious!  Try the prickly pear margarita too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, great atmosphere. One suggestion for the staff though... Don't poor your pitchers of sangria out of a bucket at the bar for everyone to see. No one wants to know their $8 drink came out of a 5 gallon bucket."}
{"text":"I LOVE the brussel sprout salad, fresh made tortillas and the prime rib hash here (wait, that's also everything I've ever had here!). The prices are kind of steep, but the brussel sprout salad is a HUGE serving.   

Don't forget to pick up a mini cookie on your way out! 

+1 extra star because Chelsea's Kitchen is one of the food sponsors at my volunteer organization's annual major fundraiser. (I experienced the aforementioned food a paying guest in the restaurant.)"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio! Just FYI you have to valet, it's complimentary but always nice to have a few bucks to tip with. 

White sangria is excellent. You can't go wrong with the Deviled eggs appetizer with bacon on top (needed for salt and crunch). I feel like if you are wanting something more than a regular salad they have lots of great options to make you feel like you aren't eating just another salad. Ceviche is decent, I enjoyed it but probably will order something different when I go back. 

Dinner Entrees were decent but I'll probably stick to this place for brunches and lunches. Great place for bridal shower or bachelorette party. My husband didn't enjoy this place as much as I do. 

Don't miss the salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out!"}
{"text":"I love grabbing a drink at the bar here before a flight. The bartenders are always friendly and treat me very well for being such a busy airport restaurant. This place also has some of the best Bloody Marys, and good breakfast options."}
{"text":"Been here several times. My favorites are the fish and brussels sprouts. Top of the line produce all delicately prepared. The staff is good and attentive. Leisure meal time a must."}
{"text":"Went because it was close to where I was visiting a friend. Best. Choice. Ever. I might have given it 4 stars because the wait was a little long, but what can you expect with food this delicious. Once we sat down it took no time at all and our food was there. It was by far one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I got the one with harvati cheese, sautéd onions and lettuce. My friend got the ahi tuna burger and raved about how good it was. Both burgers came with fries which were amazingly seasoned and we got an order of the market carrots with a pesto sauce, cheese etc- really great. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! Presley was awesome!!! She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept my drink full. She even gave me a togo iced tea! 

I had the potato yanks to start off with, which were really good. I got them without sour cream to make them vegan but I bet the sour cream compliments this dish well. Even without the sour cream, they were still good. I also had the shredded kale and quinoa salad without Parmesan and I added avocado. The best think about this restaurant is they don't charge for avocado. How cool is that?! The salad was delicious and fresh. 

For desert they offer a vegan strawberry gelato which is more like a sorbet. It was a little on the sweet side but hit the spot. 

I live the atmosphere of this place, very warm and welcoming and with some really neat decor. The patio area is nice and cozy with misters and plenty of seating space. Parking can be a bit tricky as half the lot is blocked off for valet. I parked down the street and walked. Such is typical for some Phoenix area restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place for ages! We finally came on New Year's day simply because Parlor and Centurion were closed. First pet peeve (that includes Parlor) is being forced to valet park when the lot is half empty. Even if valet is complimentary. We were seated promptly and decor is simply gorgeous. My daughter had the PB&J kids meal and milk. I was pretty annoyed when they charged us for a refill on the milk. So, we got charged twice for two kids milks. I didn't see much that interested me on the menu so I ordered a few things I have gotten often at LGO: the shrimp ceviche and caesar salad. It was very good but odd that I was ordering LGO menu items. Pretty cool were the chocolate chip cookies on your way in/out. Can't beat that!

I have heard that their brunches are fabulous so I will give it another try....."}
{"text":"The Brussel sprout salad, scallop special and best red velvet cake all were great choices.  I would definitely go again!
Service was great, only negative was they turned off the misters on the patio half way through our meal and boy did it get hot. Never pleasant to sweat while eating."}
{"text":"Quite a nice restaurant for an Airport, the prices are really fair. Had dinner with some fellow colleagues before our flight. I had the Howie burger with Kale Slaw, both which were very good. I think the slaw could have used both a little more acid and salt, but still very good. Service was excellent! My coworkers loved their meals as well."}
{"text":"The one redeeming thing was the deviled eggs - they were amazing... The service was terrible - the bartender who helped us would not even respond to my husband when he said thank you... Or wanted more food... Over and over. The tonic water was completely flat. Margarita was okay... So many options in this airport and we left desperately wishing we had tried somewhere... anywhere else."}
{"text":"Situated inside the airport.  Gourmet Kale Salad with Salmon.  Very good service.  Great job."}
{"text":"One of the best Prime Rib spots in Phoenix, with great salads and fresh fish. Wonderful outdoor patio and bar, rarely a wait, and excellent service. I am that idiot who has to change everything on the menu, and they have never had the slightest problem making any adjustments I asked for. I would give them ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"Such good food for the airport and beyond. Regan was a great server for my lunch. The Ahi Tuna tacos were delicious!  The chopped kale salad was so tasty.  They had a nice selection of a different type of foods. Would highly recommend stopping by if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"A very nice place, pretty interior, I had the prime rib hash whih was very good. The music is a little too loud."}
{"text":"First I love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Grea spot for happy hour and dinner. It is with a heavy heart that I report that the breakfast didn't live up to the hype. Had the crab cake Benedict. It was okay.  The chiliquilles were just okay too, old skip it next time and opt for something else."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!!! Hubby and I came here recently for a weekend lunch around 1pm, place was packed but the wait was only about 15 minutes. Valet parking is there to help as the parking lot is small.  They have inside and outdoor seating, and even with the high temps the patio is cool with the misters. Service was excellent and friendly and the menu had a good amount of variety.  The kitchen is small but they have a real good handle on getting the food out.  I enjoyed the short rib tacos but the star for me was the kale salad.  Outstanding.  Hubby had the burger and said it was the best that he had ever had.  A bit pricey for lunch, around $15-20 plus drinks and/or appetizers but well worth it.  I would not hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"I live in Vegas but in town for a short visit. My experience from the hostess till when the server Kim dropped the check was simply delightful.  The food was outstanding.  Kim gave us impeccable service.  I will definitely come back the next time in Phoenix.  :)"}
{"text":"Got to the airport early as I refused to eat another meal at the hotel I was staying in. Had been in Chelsea's once before and remembered it being okay so thought I'd give it another go. Definitely has a nice, relaxing feel to it, unlike a lot of other airport restaurants I've been in. Though looking at the menu again, I was reminded of why I only thought it was ok. Don't feel like there are great options and definitely think some of the prices are too high. Got the burger with cottage cheese. Burger was not as good as I was hoping. While the Russian sauce was good, it was just not even to provide enough flavor. Cottage cheese was fine. They serve it with olive oil on top, which  now having it, wish I hadn't. Hope I remember this review next time I'm in this airport and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"After my first dining experience at Chelsea's, I was disappointed and was never going to return.  But, I had a change of heart and decided to give Chelsea's a second try, and this time I was NOT disappointed.  The appetizer and entree were amazing, cooked perfectly.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  I am glad I went back and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very impressive for an airport oasis.  The bar is spacious with a number of interesting brews on tap.  The menu is eclectic with many of items fresh and home made.  The atmosphere is anything but your typical hard plastic airport food court.  I typically spend some time here waiting for my friends who are traveling in from other places and I almost forget I am in an airport!  The only knock is the typical airport price bump, but that is going to exist for any establishment in the terminal, so I can't blame the restaurant too much.  Keep in mind it is before security which has its own pros and cons, but I highly recommend it either way."}
{"text":"I had a group of 12 coming in for a birthday dinner. A concierge I know is who recommended it to me! When I called earlier in the week they advised me of the deposit required and the process was quick and easy! My party arrived on time and they had a table outside ready to go and we sat down, had an excellent dinner and evening! The food was excellent and the service was as well! Perfect for a nice 21st birthday before we all got crazy in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is good, the red velvet cake was amazing. We couldn't stop eating it. The service was good and the atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"Beyond worst service I've ever encountered in a restaurant In my life :-(. Unbelievable!!! My friends mom paid for about $80 of the tab in cash and they still ended up charging for those items in the final bill. The manager continued to argue with us and would not take responsibility for the restaurant's error and lack of respect. It took the server about 20-30 to check on us each time for water/wine. I will never ever go back there again and I will make sure to discourage other people I know to go there. It was my friend's bday and they made it into a stressful experience. I've never experienced such a lack of customer service and respect in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Really?  At an airport??  Who would ever expect to get real restaurant quality food at an airport.  This is not chili's this is go out to dinner fine food. I had swordfish tacos. A full swordfish filet comes out with all the fixings. Green beans were crisp and tasty.  Servers were all friendly.  Good job!"}
{"text":"This was my best lunch in any airport restaurant ever. I had the rotisserie chicken with cannoli beans and green beans (the veggie of the day). 

Both the green beans and the cannoli beans were cooked perfectly. The broth in the beans was savory with a hint of lemon. The chicken itself was exactly as moist and tender as you could want from rotisserie chicken. The entire meal was delicious.

I was also surprised to see that their pretty short beer list had some really interesting choices! I really enjoyed my Belgian Karmeliet Tripel. It was quite tasty and potent. The wine list also looked small, but interesting.

I think I heard my waitress say it was her first day at Chelsea's, but if so they did a great job in bringing her in. She was perfectly attentive and knew exactly when to stop by the table. She also told me about the free chocolate chip cookies that are available on the way out.

Before tip, my lunch came to $30. Not at all cheap, but worth every penny, especially  after a week of poor business travel eating.

If you're flying any of the airlines out of Terminal 4, check your bags and grab a bite to eat at Chelsea's!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but it's not good enough to make me recommend it over the other better restaurants out there.  When a restaurant has prices for food like they do, I expect to enjoy everything I eat.  Unfortunately, that's not the case here.  Their food and sides are hit and miss and I don't feel like I'm getting the value of what I'm paying for. For example, I ordered the beef tacos.  The beef was great and prepared nicely with a tasty marinade.  However, the guacamole side was bland and the kale slaw just did not taste good to me (and I usually love kale, the kale salad from True Food is one of my favorite salads!)

Plus the wait on the weekends is kind of ridiculous.  I'm glad they are popular and more power to those who love this place, but it's not my preferred dining destination."}
{"text":"I recommend patio seating. The shaded area gives it a serene feel even when it is full. The fireplace adds to the atmosphere. 

For an appetizer, we had the shrimp cerviche. It came with corn chips. The shrimp combined with the diced tomatoes was a nice change of pace from chips and salsa. 

I had the Howie Burger. The havarti cheese and caramelized onions complemented the beef well. The bun was so fresh and delicious. 

My wife had the sea bass and would get it again. On her last visit, she had the brussel sprout salad and raved about it. 

For desert, we had the red velvet cake. It was the best I ever tasted. 

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was we had to wait fifteen minutes at the table before we were waited on. Once we were waited on, the service was great. Otherwise, it was a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I'm lukewarm about Chelsea's. Love the patio, front and back. Love the noisy chatter. And love wasting time with wine and friends for hours here.

But I have to say I'm not thrilled with the food. The veggie options are ok, at least there is more than one choice. The flavor is less impressive though. The veggie tacos were blander than bland. The actual veggies are lovely and change seasonally: spaghetti squash, mushrooms, peppers, etc. But can I get a little salt and pepper on these bad boys? They tasted like nothing.

The veggie burger is the same as LGO, but was perhaps prepared differently. I didn't get any of that smokey goodness I love so much at the sister restaurant. The guacamole was also lacking. Good thing they brought out a few orders of those little handmade tortillas though, cuz those suckers are melt in your mouth deliciosos.

There is also a happy ending on your way out with some killer sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Between the wine and cookies, I'm good. Just wish there was a little more oomph to back up the price of the meatless fare."}
{"text":"Our residency program treats our applicants to lunch here, which means I get to come here every week during interview season.  Chelsea's Kitchen manages to mix a classy environment (multiple lamborghinis in the valet-run parking lot at once?!) with friendly service and dang good food.

I've tried a lot of the dishes here.  The swordfish, ahi, and short rib tacos are always a hit, but I honestly haven't gone wrong yet with the Fish of the Day.  Last week, I had grouper.  I'd never eaten grouper before, but somehow Chelsea's managed to make it tender and pair it with an absolutely delicious sauce.  The deviled eggs are my favorite appetizer, and the chocolate cake paired with a french press coffee is heavenly for dessert.

That said, I might go off my standard meal plan next week... one of my friends had the prime rib and it was perfectly cooked and literally as big as her face."}
{"text":"My wife and I picked this restaurant at random as a place to go for our anniversary dinner this year. Not knowing what to expect, I had low expectations. I'm happy to report that Chelsea's Kitchen far exceeded those expectations in every way. We arrived around 6:30p on a Thursday evening (no reservation) and were given a 25 to 30 minute wait time. We ended up waiting only about 15 minutes and were seated on the patio near the big fireplace.

My wife prefers not to sit outside so I thought this might be a problem but they had heaters placed all around the patio so it honestly felt like we were indoors. Cozy ambiance, string lights and trees to hide the road and cars - very nice setting. Tables were spaced far enough apart that we could talk at a normal volume and not have to overhear others' conversations.

Our waiter was attentive without being overly intrusive. I ordered the swordfish taco platter and my wife the short rib tacos. Both plates were delicious. The tacos come out with all the meat and fixings (guac, pico, kale slaw, sauce, etc) and then they bring you out fresh hot street-sized corn tortillas, as many as you need - and you build your own tacos. Serving sizes were large enough that neither of us could finish our plate and had to get a box.

Chelsea's is definitely one of our top restaurants in the Arcadia district. The prices are a little high for us so it will probably be a place for special occasions but definitely worth every penny. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We had a 7 hour lay over at the airport and this place hit the spot! We got a big comfy booth to rest our weary feet and fill our bellies full! We hung around for a little while because they have two TVs in the bar area and they will play local sports games, NFL, baseball, etc. It's the best spot to kill some time as far as eating goes at the airport. We got the Guacamole and Chips ($12) which was really good. The chips come out toasty warm! But of course you have to consider that the price for some chips and guacamole/salsa is kind of crazy. Airport food. Anyways I also got the spicy chicken sandwich ($16) which was delicious! They put a twist on it by adding a Granny Smith apple slice, pickle, and spicy coleslaw. At first I was sure if I made a good choice but the acidity and the crunch of the apple and slaw paired really well with the seasoned crispy chicken and toasted bun! Yum! My hubby got his usual dip sandwich thing with au juice or whatever that is. Haha. He said it was good. (It's always good) But I guess that says that there's something for everyone, including the person in your group who gets the same thing every place they go. Service was terrific, so friendly.
NOTE: Menu changes for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"SO good! The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because they don't take reservations for parties under 12. If you don't have a reservation, you can be waiting for a LONG time!! However, the food is good so it is worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Another great experience at Chelsea s Kitchen. We ordered a Sunday Brunch special item  which was a baked  mixture of shredded pork Mexican spices seasoning(forgot the name of the dish) with black beans, guac, sweet potatoes and a baked egg which was all perfect. The other dish was hot cakes. It was very simple but tasty it had a hint of lemon so it was a nice tart change from a traditional pancake. Very thin not too heavy and I think the serving was 4 or 5 hot cakes.

The service from beginning to end was great. The host was very energetic friendly and prompt. Our server truly made our day. We had mimosas flowing not thinking to ask/confirm if they had bottomless on Sunday's. We didn't ask till the last round which was probably the 3rd or 4th at the most. Not complaining at all but just asking/confirming. She comes back shortly after saying sorry I didn't ask and said she will have her manager bill it at the bottomless rate they offer on Saturdays. When the bill comes they were taken off completely!! This was not expected,  required or needed but a very generous gesture! Leaves a great impression on my 2nd visit of many to come."}
{"text":"If you come here, ask for Desiree to be your waitress. She is awesome and so nice. We were able to trust her recommendations for both food and drinks. As a party of 11 she was so on top of things and wasn't stressed out."}
{"text":"Very cool and urban.  Comfort food with a modern twist, awesome patio and bar, the BEST service in town.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars was it is a little pricey for what you get and bar staff did not share the same great attitude as the waitstaff.   Great for people watching.  People that put on airs are so entertaining!    This is a must do.  I really like this place.    I honestly question the person that reviewed a few reviews ahead of mine.  An agenda or a poor attitude, unsure which, but they are not being objective."}
{"text":"Best Airport Food Time After Time!

As a frequent traveler from Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4, I have found Chelsea's Kitchen to have the most consistently delicious airport food available for several years. When I fly. this is simply part of my routine, and it is far more predictable than what I might find available beyond the security checkpoints. 

Granted, Phoenix Sky Harbor has added numerous restaurants, but none as satisfying as Chelsea's.

Generally, I travel in the morning, so their Classic French Omelet is my favorite. I add either applewood smoked bacon or ham. The omelet has always come out perfectly cooked, and with exactly the right balance of spinach and gruyere cheese to the eggs. Although I have had numerous breakfasts at Chelsea's, I can not bring myself to have anything different. It is THAT good.

Traveling later in the day, my fallback is the Tuna Sashimi Salad. The Del Mar salad deserves mention, but I am hooked on the Tuna Sashimi Salad.

Service has always been great. I sit at the bar, and the bar staff is very attentive. I've had excellent Bloody Marys on occasion, and their coffee is always really good.

Chelsea's has simply become how I start my travel. I have not been disappointed yet. It is a bit on the pricey side, but nothing is cheap at the airport..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chelsea's kitchen, although it does end up being fairly pricey. They have great food, drinks and a cool atmosphere. I strongly suggest sitting on the patio during your dining experience.

I've had a few things from their menu including a green chili burger, nachos and tacos. They recommend getting your burger done rare to medium rare but I am not one to eat my meat that pink and uncooked. The burger wasn't my favorite but the nachos and tacos are delicious.

Be careful what you order during happy hour. I feel it is slightly misleading in that you think that all wine is five dollars a glass when it is actually only certain glasses of wine. I ended up spending $17 on one glass. For that price, I could get a whole bottle at the store.

They have free salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door. Being gluten free I haven't been able to try them but I've heard they are delicious."}
{"text":"Whether it is a quick bite at the airport or 40th and Camelback, there are a number of choices, veggie or carnivore, for ones tastebuds. 
Soup and salad: check. 
Devil eggs: of course. 
Chicken or Prime Rib: the rotisserie chicken is a regular go to. 
Tacos and burgers: juicy and fresh. 
Dessert: not my favorite dessert place, but I've enjoyed plenty of fresh berries."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, don't know why I haven't checked it out sooner! They do have complimentary valet (with a break between the lunch and dinner shifts). They also have an amazing patio. The best part of living in Phoenix is right now, in February, we can sit outside on the patio and enjoy a drink while the rest of the country weeps into their Uggs and Northface's. 

We got there around 2, a bit too early for happy hour (3-6 FYI), but ended up going with a pitcher of their white sangria. Now, usually I am a red sangria type of gal but this stuff was tasty! My girlfriend and I polished it off nicely. We also split the Nachitos. Oh god, these were soo good and perfect to soak up the sangria before having to drive home. Full of cheese, chicken, guacamole, and pico de gallo, these nachos were massive. I felt like we kept eating and the plate never ended. Eventually, we begged our waitress to take it away. 

I'm excited to go again and try more (I'm looking at you short-rib tacos & brunch menu!)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! It has this log cabin look to it, with flickering candles and roaring fireplaces. Best time to go is during the winter season, around 7 or 8pm. It does get packed on Saturdays. They have complimentary valet, and I always bring some cash for tips. It's pretty quiet in there, has a nice romantic atmosphere, and great food---try the fries; trust me on this. If you are just a walk in, the wait isn't too long. Dress code isn't too rigid, but a lot of people do dress nice."}
{"text":"My mom points to this random restaurant as I'm driving and says \"I've always wanted to take you there\" I replied \"really why\" she said quickly \"I took your brother and he really liked the baked MAC and cheese\" as I'm pulling a U-turn I say \"you can't take my brothers to something you're suppose to take me to first-momcode\" 
Of course I had to try the baked MAC and cheese but we also got the cheviche appetizer and two Shirley temples. 

The baked MAC and cheese was delicious and had the perfect texture to it. It's rather greasy but that to me shows they're using top notch cheese! Coming from a gal with Wisconsin blood (thanks to my pops and dad) I can appreciate a good cheese! 

The cheviche was perfect I had to try it as it had fresh avocado-which I'm a sucker for! The chips were cooked JUST right I even used them for my MAC and cheese. 

Now the famous Shirley temple yes that drink you got when you were younger to \"appear\" as if you had a mixed drink. Well I'm well over drinking age but a Shirley temple. Sounded refreshing and delicious and the waitress caught my smile when she brought me an old school glass sprite bottle. 

It was an enjoyable meal my mom appreciated that I wanted to try it and liked it. To her I say \"I'll pay the tab as long as you keep this our mother DAUGHTER restaurant \""}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere with amazing food AND service, Chelsea's is the spot! First of all, the bartender Chelsea is the friendliest member of the staff. She works hard with a constant smile on her face. Her knowledge of wine was some of the most impressive I've seen in the industry in a while. Second, THE FOOD! The steak tacos, Brussel sprout salad, and guacamole are some of the most delicious things I've ever eaten!! I had a cocktail before my meal and WOW were the ingredients fresh! Chelsea helped us select the perfect drinks for us and I couldn't have been more impressed! Can't wait to keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Nice patio (a little fishy from time to time) but price not worth it & staff/mgmt arrogant. Prefer Houston's/Hillstone & don't have to valet!"}
{"text":"This place is very unique.  Everything is fresh and the ahi tuna burger is the best thing ever.  The staff is attentive without being bothersome.  The decor is nice as well. 

Best airport restaurant I have ever been in and I fly all of the time."}
{"text":"The salmon was cooked perfectly, the dressing had a hint of lime and garlic...it is the most delicious salad I've had in a while...unexpected pleasure at Sky Harbor"}
{"text":"Extremely fast service. Friendly servers as well. Food was good! Good size portions & will make you full. Vibrancy feels like you're in a fancy restaurant in Vegas lol. It's pretty and well-designed. Mimosas was also good. We liked it! Thanks!"}
{"text":"So good.

Stopped in for lunch one day and we were very happy with the experience. It got busy quickly; we were able to snag a parking spot instead of having to valet. Inside, there's lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The booths are super big and comfortable.

Started with the deviled eggs, which were great. I had the veggie tacos, which came with an interesting mix of beans and greens in addition to tortillas, salsa, guacamole, and delish kale salad. The seasoning was so good and it was just a nice hearty lunch that didn't feel like it was a complete slap in my diet's face.

Husband had a burger, which he asked for medium rare but received medium. Not a big deal - it was moist and delicious. The accompanying fries were excellent and we ate ALL OF THEM. Literally every single fry - worth it!

Service was good. I'll definitely be back,"}
{"text":"The food gets a 5/5 from us. But they lose a star due to service. We ordered the corn bread appetizer which was fantastic. It was fresh and buttery and had just the right amount of green chiles. 

I had the short rib tacos. Everything on the plate was delicious: the meat, slaw, salsa, tortillas, guacamole...I keep dreaming about how perfectly the slaw paired with the short rib meat. My husband ordered a special that night which was beef brisket from their smoke yard with the colcannon potatoes and he licked his plate clean. 

Our only complaint was the slow service. It took a while for our waiter to show up at our table, return to take our order, and deliver the bill. He also made a rude comment when I asked for another glass of water. It was really bizarre and kind of stunned us. But he just seemed like he was in a bad mood from the start. 

Anyway, order the corn bread!"}
{"text":"Oh Chelsea... I envy you. You have 54 reviews, why not one more? 
Chelsea's Kitchen is located on a sort of \"landmark\" for me; this location (not building - just real estate) has been so many fun things over the years. I am happy that Chelsea found her home here. 
The menu changes with specials and chef's delights, so one night you might find yourself eating a surf and turf and the next a really great seasonal salad. 
The drinks are flowing (try the LGO) - I didn't like their beer selection, but no biggie the pitcher of LGOs made us happy. 
I LOVE the fact that their menu doesn't have a million things on it....You don't need a million options. Just a few very well executed and well prepared dishes. 
We started off with the nachitos - this is a meal in itself. You could share this with a few drinks and be just fine. The chicken didn't overpower the other elements and the tortilla chips are fresh and, imho, the way tortilla chips *should* taste... 
This last visit, I had the short ribs. They were tender enough to cut with a fork. The over-easy egg on top was a nice addition. There were tender baby veggies on the bottom which also was nice. 
We ended the meal with chocolate pecan pie with fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Nothing more to say about this other than it was fabulous. 
There is a burning fire outside and inside, a nice cozy bar that's big enough to not feel like you're standing on top of your neighbor, and the staff (even management) was not pretentious or rude. They were accommodating and happy. 
My only drawback is this (and it's not worth taking a star off of)This is one of those really trendy places - so if you get intimidated by that *crowd* or you just don't have the patience for *them* I would suggest going either a little later or a little earlier. But I wouldn't use this as an excuse to not go to Chelsea's. 
Simply stated, this isn't a 3 star experience. This is far above 3 stars. Chelsea's continually delivers a great meal with a great atmosphere. It's not hit or miss; but it's not a hole in the wall either...."}
{"text":"Really tasty, but even more overpriced and nothing here is exquisite.  The space is nice and the service is good.  But $64 for 2 glasses of wine, a salad, a sandwich and 2 cups of coffee for lunch is a little ridiculous.  

My rule of thumb here is that I only go to Chelsea's Kitchen when it's not my money."}
{"text":"It really felt like a concerted group effort to not serve. We sat at the bar and were completely ignored after our first drinks were delivered. Attempted to give the servers the benefit of the doubt but after an hour of waiting with only one drink served and no follow-up and then our appetizer order not served we opted to leave."}
{"text":"Long wait time for a basic food item.  Yes, it was tasty and I had high expectations given the lofty prices here... but it took nearly 15 minutes and I ordered from the fast to-go counter.  They need to fix this if they're going to be in business at an airport terminal, or they need to warn everyone that it may take 15 minutes.  And when you're waiting for food to hurry through security to make it to your plane - that 15 minutes feels like an eternity."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!  Great food!  I will come back to Phoenix!  Food is very fresh and delish!  Ambiance and service is great!  The music is spot on!  Please try the tuna tartare and the deviled eggs as starters.  My ribeye taco was amazing ... very upscale!  I like!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today with coworkers (8 of us) and Chelsea's was exceptional as usual. The service was slow for showing up at 11:30, but then again it seemed as if everyone was showing up around the same time. Luckily the food was amazing as always and you can't rush love. I will be back . Hopefully for the restaurant week dinner."}
{"text":"Chelsea's kitchen is one or stops on our way home from the airport and its worth the detour for us . The food is always fresh and over the top delicious ! Weve had the burgers , nachos , every taco on the menu, short ribs , breakfast... I've been there so much it's a shame that it took me this long to write a review. A couple of  pluses to note : 1) children eat for free before 7 PM and the children's menu is pretty impressive and not your typical fried nasty kids meal. 2) Pick up a free chocolate chip cookie with a hint of Fluer De Sel."}
{"text":"Great food and really unique menu with a beautiful outdoor patio setting! A MUST for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Even after 10 years I am yet to have a meal that wasn't great and super yummy!
The service as usual was great, the drinks refreshing and the food as delicious as it was last time.
Love places like this where the menu doesn't change (especially when it is this good)!!"}
{"text":"I think I am the last resident of Phoenix to try Chelsea's kitchen....have wanted to go forever, but finally got the chance yesterday for a business lunch.

We arrived at 11:30 as we heard it gets busy fast and were promptly seated outside on the patio, which was great!  the weather was perfect.

We started with the guacamole and chips - which were to die for.   We each fought over it.   As soon as our chip stash started to dwindle another plate arrived...that never happens (unless you are at a mexican restaurant)

I ordered the brussel sprout salad and it was amazing.  the ingredients were so fresh and plentiful.  

The only thing was the service was a bit slow - even for us arriving so early and it not being crowded it did seem like it took quite some time to get our main orders in and then to get the check when we were done.   

Oh and I did I mention the yummy chocolate chip cookies waiting at the front door when you leave...I only grabbed one, but it was soooo delish!

I definetly want to come back for dinner and sit on the patio when the fireplace is roaring - so charming!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness fabulous!!! Lunchtime visit with my gal pal and we had a wonderful time. Service was attentive, and the food was delectable. I had the Brussels Sprouts Salad and Cauliflower/Garlic Soup. The salad was fresh and green with tiny bacon bits throughout. The soup was vegan and pureed to a very creamy consistency. Great flavors. My friend had the swordfish tacos and that piece of fish was grilled to perfection. Lovely ambience sitting outside by the fire mid-week and not too terribly crowded. The little cookie on the way out the door really hit the spot too. Thanks Chelsea's Kitchen - I will be back!!"}
{"text":"How to begin AMAZING! 

I had lunch here on Sunday. Because I was dining alone I sat at the bar that opened onto a beautiful patio. Was such a nice day outside. I was greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable bar tender. Everything on the menu looked so good I couldn't make up my mind, so I asked for help. After some wonderful suggestions I went with the GRILLED AHI TUNA taco plate. The fish was seared to perfection with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos came with hand made tortillas, spicy aioli sauce, fresh guacamole and chipotle salsa. I topped it all off with a fantastic margarita.

This is my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Okay, YES!!Sat outside and the ambiance, etc. was awesome. Our server forgot to put in our appetizer, but at the end of the meal we didn't even care as our entrees were so fabulous! Highly recommend! 

OF NOTE: They do the annoying 'forced valet parking'."}
{"text":"I personally think this place is CRAZY overrated.  Decent Houston's knockoff atmosphere, forgettable food (sorry, but their fried chicken is a joke) and nothing else of note.  I think people just like the location..."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The rib eye steak tacos are the bomb!  I have taken numerous friends and co-workers here and everyone is always happy with their meals.  Service is always excellent.  The parking can be a pain and sometimes you need to wait for a table, but those inconveniences are well worth it."}
{"text":"Possibly the best dinner spot in Phoenix! Great environment, great staff, EXCELLENT food. 

I've been a couple times now, and both experiences have been perfect. 

The first time I got the Howie Burger. Arguably the best burger I've ever had. The grass-fed beef melts in your mouth. Get Medium Rare or Rare!!! 

This most recent time we sat outside in the back...great set up, too! I got the Steak tacos this time, also unbelievable. 

All the drinks are great (and stiff), except for the Spiked Lemonade( a little too much pulp). 

Date night, family in town, special occasion, excuse to eat well- it doesn't matter. This place is perfect for everything!"}
{"text":"I had to visit the airport for some personal business being a local I knew the airport had added some great local restaurants. I was treated very well. The hostess and server were wonderful! I had the meatloaf dinner and it was fantastic! Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Chelsea's Kitchen definitely ain't kitsch. 

It's places like Chelsea's Kitchen that are a welcome retreat from the mundane and cumbersome things of daily life. The place is able to mix some figurative water and oil - water being chillness and oil being professionalism - and make it into a wonderful experience. 

I am not sure how long this place has been around, but I think it can eventually corner the market for exquisite breakfast, brunch, or lunch eateries. 

Can't speak for dinner cause I didn't dine for dinner.

They offer the Bottomless Mimosa deal, but don't give you light fizzle champagne with lukewarm orange juice. They give you the ice cold Miller Lite commercial deal, combined with a freshly popped Mexican Coke bottle type carbonation. Honestly, need I say more how great this place is?

But I got to. Food is the bomb . com. I ordered the spread of a man who could only watch the food channel and dream of eating where Anthony B ate. I assure you that whatever you get will satisfy your palate and stomach. 

One slight drawback that almost made me give the place four stars, and that is the parking situation. Get there early. You are probably thinking early means I can leave 30 minutes later than when I planned to. Nah fam, get here early. Probably like 60 parking spots total for a place that will attract that many in its first hour.

My friends and I had a splendid time here. I wish I had gone here more to be honest. Chelsea's is a place to make memories."}
{"text":"The first time I dined at Chelsea's Kitchen I was not impressed. The second time, Chelsea's Kitchen redeemed themselves. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and the surprise of the night was a Screaming Monkey. Yum! Sweet martini with slices of green chile. It was so good I ordered two! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon from church which is always busy. This time there was no wait for 2 people. The parking is sparse but was able to find a spot. 

LGO Restaurant with many items from the LGO menu. The exception is there is nicer seating and more than the LGO down the road.

Tried the Short Rib Hash which was very good was served with onions and potatoes topped off with an egg on top served with a English Muffin. Also had the devil eggs which came out on a wooden plank.

Service was exceptional and always filled up our water and ice tea before the glass was below the middle of the glass.

Personally I prefer the ambience of the LGO Restaurant down the road but both restaurants are a can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Part of the growing empire of those who brought us LGO and Postino...  quite good.  Upscale casual.  American favorites like roasted chicken, burgers, fish tacos...  the ceviche is not so good.  Don't go there.  Overall, I enjoy this place.  I probably eat here once every 6 weeks and have always had a good meal.  It is a good place to bring parents and your relatives from the midwest -- it's a nice local place with a neighborhood feel, but the food is non-threatening.  Everyone is going to find something they like here.  FYI, the key lime pie is super good."}
{"text":"Great!
Ask for a table on the patio, it's one of the best in Phoenix. 
The short rib tacos are fantastic."}
{"text":"First thing you should know- THE PARKING. 
Luckily I got there early enough before all the waiting for tables and being forced to use the valet parking. There's a handful of parking spots you can park in yourself if you're lucky.  I personally just am not a fan of valet parking. All the dudes running around frantically and adjusting my seat...Just nice, but no thanks.
I came for brunch on a Sunday around 11 am and it wasn't terribly busy, but by the time I left the crowd waiting outside for a table was quite large. Sat on the patio, it's gorgeous...but the nature. There was this bird that kept swooping down and trying to eat food off the floor from the baby at the table next to mine and it was literally terrifying. 
But the foooooood. My friend and I shared a large order of deviled eggs- UGH. Delicious. They're texturally interesting with a little crunch from pickle or something and bacon on top. Really. Just do it.
I got the short rib hash which was a huge plate of crispy bits of tender short rib, potatoes, carrots, over easy eggs and an english muffin. It was great. But it needed a little more spice in my mind. Something spicy to bring it to the next level.
My friend had eggs benedict and you can't really go wrong with that.
Overall, we paid about $50 for brunch for two on a Sunday. A little pricey but the food and atmosphere was nice. Just not the best price point for breakfast for two college kids."}
{"text":"You know an airport restaurant is good if you have to write a review about it. I have been twice now and both times food was excellent as was the service. If you have time to kill it is even worth leaving your terminal for!"}
{"text":"Wish I'd happened upon joyce k's review, prior to trekking in here last night, cuz the $14 ahi burger jump started an oddly disappointing evening.  Very thin composite patty, neither grilled not seared pink inside, but griddled grey all the way through, like a Boca burger. The bun was maybe one grade above a commercial McDonald's bun. Soft and unsubstantial. Since this $14 entree excluded sides, I paid an additional $3 for \"root vegetables\", apparently Chelseas' code for 'colorless scoop of undercooked fried potato cubes'.  

We'd eaten here a year or so prior and had a more than respectable meal with a charming young waiter, so were genuinely surprised at how cobbled together and prideless this dish appeared. Yet even I admired how our strategically inattentive waitress 'forgot' to ever swing by and inquire how little I was enjoying this star crossed (or was it Starkist?) patty.  She gets it...this restaurant biz. 

A grand total of four beers on tap, starting at $7 a pint? You do realize, Chelseaphiles, the object of your rather pricy affectation abuts the backside of a gas station along the guanoed canal and a bug infested apartment eyesore looms across the street?  Yeah, sure. It's \"Arcadia\". Whatever you say.    

As a weird and perhaps inappropriate aside, it took my actively searching wife and I most of the evening to spot a single 'person of color' in this sprawling, adequately lit establishment.  It was packed with a forty minute wait, so we're talking hundreds and hundreds of people.  I finally saw an older woman off in a corner who the missus confirmed vaguely looked Philipino. Sure, it's just one snapshot on a Thursday night, and I have nothing against PV Caucasians descending from hilltop palazzos for a \"comfortable\", burger, cookie and confab.  White folk gotta eat.  Heck, we're hungry, white and reside on a gentle knoll ourselves. But all the same, in a major city in 2011, it's probably fair to at least wonder if such a notable absence of color was entirely coincidental or, like some of the food and service, a product of less tasteful intentions."}
