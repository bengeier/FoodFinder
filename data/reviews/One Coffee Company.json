{"text":"New ownership. Small cup of regular coffee is $3 and for a coffee company, it is surprisingly bad.  Food is good. Parking is sparse but there are usually open spaces - seems this place is only frequented by tenants of nearby buildings."}
{"text":"Awful. Still City Market Deli with a slightly different menu. Came back after not eating here for a LONG time after the 'change' in ownership and I'm disappointed to see the same rude employees and disgusting food. Over priced, crappy food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine went there to get something to eat, they are out of the first two things she ordered and so she got a 'breakfast croissant' without cheese. They sent one with cheese and she sent it back only to get half a sandwich that was extremely burnt with uncooked eggs.  Also she payed about $6 and waited 30 minutes for this food as well. When brought to the attention of a manager he told her the croissants were cosco and the eggs were microwaved and 'you get what you payed for' being very rude (if I could post pictures of his horrid response I would) and goes to say more disgusting things to her. I would never take my business there and I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to a disgusting establishment such as this one as well."}
