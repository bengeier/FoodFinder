{"text":"Wasn't expecting anything spectacular here, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's a build your own roll place with pretty good quality. With the selections you can only produce the rolls you may find in a grocery store, but at a better price. Definitely a great quick meal place."}
{"text":"This place is great. Clean, friendly, food is great (slamin salmon always had a lot of roe) and great value (go during happy hour). A great place to eat in phoenix."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place several times, and every time I have ever went, it was nothing but good experiences. The ingredients are nice and fresh, and it's great for people that don't like \"real\" sushi with raw fish and seaweed (but don't worry sushi snobs, you can still get both of those things). The rolls are really big (and apparently they're supposed to be pretty healthy too). My personal favorite is the Beefinator, but if there's someone in your group who is particularly picky or just wants a snack, a kid's meal will do just fine (my personal favorite there is chicken and strawberries) and you get a cup of fruit or miso soup, a drink, and a toy so it's totally worth it. It's never usually crowded (however the most recent time I came was later at night because it's open until 10:00pm!) I totally recommend this place, especially people who don't like Japanese food."}
{"text":"In terms of my sushi fix in AZ it has come to this. While I'm a sushi fanatic (particularly sashimi) it's an inexpensive way to get a bit of that satisfaction in the desert. I typically go for the bowls (more bang for your buck). My favorite by far has been the 3 alarm roll with spicy salmon. They also have great seaweed and cucumber salads to compliment your roll. Overall the quality is \"meh\" but what do you expect for inexpensive sushi? It does the job!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Sometimes it is so hard to find a fun, comfortable, friendly and clean restaurant that can accommodate my kids (who eat meat) and my husband and I (who are vegan). This place is perfection!   And since we are skipping the meat the husband and I we can get a roll for $3.95? Get the heck out of here!  Edamame and a cucumber salad for less then $2 each. We went wild on rolls and sides and still spent way less then we would have at someplace less healthy or interesting.   If you are shy of ordering then check out the menu online and walk in with it written down what you wants.. also the website has a great feature that allows you to build your roll and check the nutritional value of it. I can't even tell you how much I appreciate that!   The people were friendly, helpful and nice. The place was spotless. I think we are going to make it Sushi Sunday and go every week. Can't wait now for the weekend."}
{"text":"This is a \"subway style\" sushi restaurant which is actually a really cool concept.  Really casual.  Caters to people who marginally like sushi as most of the rolls on the menu have cream cheese but you can easily build your own roll which was the best option here.  All pretty affordable.  They did have a few bottled beers to choose from.  I would recommend it for a quick and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Been there twice, won't try again. Sub-par ingredients. Cucumber salad was bland,  but the seaweed salad was tasty (normal). Rolls were loose, rice was chewy. I picked a piece of salmon out of a roll and ate it by itself, and realized why the roll did nothing for me - the salmon was bland. This place isn't cheap enough for how cheap the food tastes, so I'll pay slightly more for better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"New concept of fast food Sushi ... you make your own ... going through a fast line, you pick your rice, wrap  ( seaweed or soy paper), 3 vegetables, then your meat or fish.   Entire process takes about 2 minutes, and ends up with delicious custom sushi.  Portions very filling, staff friendly, and place spotless.    Price very reasonable.   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is why didn't I think of this... is not like going to AH-SO or RAW, but for fast sushi it works.  Food was good, serving size plenty.  What I would change, is parking, and maybe having some of the people working there, working a little harder to keep the place looking clean.  Also the staff needs to act like they like working, , be more grateful they have a job. and parking, did I say that already??? OH heck, so hard to find parking, forget lunch time unless you have 2 hours to spend."}
{"text":"I originally considered the food here just a notch above grocery store sushi.  But this was during opening week and things have improved since then.  The calamari salad is a great deal.  The rolls are nice but found that they are challenged in cooking brown rice properly.  But who isn't?    Nothing bad but nothing great.  If you are looking for a quick, decent priced sushi fix this is your place.  PS: Forget about parking at lunch time.  Smallest lot in the world for 6 restaurants."}
{"text":"When we walked in, a guy behind the counter informed us the computer was down and we would have to pay in cash, which wasn't a problem fortunately. We ordered 3 rolls and the guy pulled out some ingredients and then asked us what we wanted to order. A bit of forgetfulness but not an issue. We went up to pay and the person in line behind us asked a second employee for some edamame. The guy helping us fiddled with the register for an unusually long period of time then asked us if we had just ordered edamame. We explained that we hadn't (which seemed to confuse him) and handed over our cash. The second employee quickly informed us that the computers were back up and we asked if we could use a debit card instead. First guy didn't respond so we just took our food back to a table.   The helpings were impressive and the ingredients looked fresh but mine was very clearly missing something. I didn't order a vegetarian roll so I asked the second guy (the one who didn't seem so out of it) why there was no meat in my salmon roll. He said he would fix it and quickly brought my food back. The taste was ok and would have easily earned 3 stars if I hadn't found a hair in the second to last piece. All together not an ideal situation. Too bad because it was convenient and affordable and I really liked the concept."}
{"text":"Not at all what i would have expected from a place that i originally assumed was nothing more than Subway for sushi.  Great selection of saki and bottled drinks to go with the main course. Which, by the way, i could find no serious fault with. Im not a sushi connoisseur but those of my friends and family that are tell me its pretty much the best you can get for the price and speed as well as the wide selection."}
{"text":"For what it is, I think this place is yummy. Its like a subway but for sushi. pretty cool. the fish was fresh when i had it. and the toppings are what makes it. the only thing that wasnt good was the edame. it was old. but the sushi was good."}
{"text":"You would think that the idea of \"fast food\" sushi would send you running for the hills, but that is certainly not the case with this concept. It is clean, simple, and the quality is consistent. The only reason for four stars is that a very large portion of going out for sushi is the experience and trying new things. How do you roll is just for getting your fix without all the fluff and stuff. If you want to try something different for lunch and you are in a hurry you can be in and out of here in 15 minutes (that is including time to nosh). Definitely out of the ordinary and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"It's pretty cool that you get to make your very own special rolls, with toppings & sauces and you get to make a \"meal\" out of your personal order. However, the price is a little steep for this \"fast food\" environment! For prices like this, I expect a server, a menu and a little more atmosphere then their \"subway\" look. Toppings are priced as add on's so be sure you know what you're getting & be clear on the added price of each topping. Other than that, it's a pretty cool place, I would visit it again IF I had too."}
{"text":"I really like this idea. Like many other reviewers, I like being able to have my choice of fillings for my sushi. I want a weird combination of veggies with no fish or meat; at How Do you Roll? - DONE.   For only having veggies inside of my roll, I wish it would have been a little cheaper, but it was filling and tasty. In total, I had a make-your-own-roll (veggie), seaweed salad, and medium drink. It was $9. And I was definitely satisfied afterwards. Could I have eaten another roll? Yeah, probably. But I didn't, and my stomach was still very happy."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was first skeptical but I really enjoyed this place. You stand behind a glass counter and make your own sushi. They have many items to choose from. Such as shrimp, tempura, spicy tuna, chicken beef. They also have vegitarian and vegan options.  The atmosphere is very low key and the establishment is very clean. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi I have ever had. The wasabi was way hotter than any wasabi I have had before. The soy sauce was extremely salty, almost like someone added salt to the container. I ordered the spicy tuna and miso soup. The miso soup was every bit as salty as the soy sauce. I couldn't finish it. The spicy tuna was utterly tasteless and the rice was slightly crunchy and tasted like it was under cooked. To top it off, now I'm feeling sick, hopefully it isn't the food. My wife made her own roll with a mix of tuna and salmon, both of which were completely mushy and tasteless. She couldn't even finish half of her order. The employees called How Do You Roll like the subway of sushi. However if you want to pay restaurant prices and eat nasty sushi then this is the place. I recommend you don't eat here though, I think you would thank me for steering you away from this place. You can much better, fresher sushi for the same price at an actual sushi restaurant rather than frozen fast food sushi here. And we were OVERCHARGED $2.50. If you look at the online menu the create your own roll for $6 includes one protein however when I pointed this out to the girl she said \"that's not how we do it.\" Um, ok, but legally you must give the price listed. We went ahead and paid the extra thinking it would be worth it, it wasn't and since their roll cutting machine is, and I quote the guy working there \"on it's last leg because it's not cleaned enough\" we were handed balls of mushed up sushi, not nicely cut rolls. We will never go back. Also, asked if they had WiFi and the response was yes but no one can get it to work. So really you mean no we do not have WiFi and we are too lazy too call our service provider to figure out the problem. Gotcha."}
{"text":"My large family LOVES this place. The workers are really friendly, the food is fabulous. No, this isn't the place to get top-of-the-line sushi. In fact, the description: Subway of Sushi pretty much sums it up.   However, this is a great place to get something healthy that nourishes your body and fills you without feeling heavy. And, if you are counting calories, their website has a great online tool for figuring out the exact calorie composition of your order.  Make sure you sign up for their rewards program. You get a free roll if you order a certain number. Because our family is so big (we get about 11 rolls at a time) we get a free roll each time we order. Sweet deal.  BTW, if you are unsure of something, ask the workers for a sample, they are very happy to provide little tastes of new flavors. I like that. Also, get the sauce on the side. It is really fun to dip the rolls into the sauce using chopsticks. Makes me feel all authentic. LOL."}
{"text":"wide variety of yummy fresh veggies and meats or fish  nice friendly service"}
{"text":"I Come here all the time, the service was excellent! Fast, friendly and efficient. The food is ALWAYS fresh. The atmosphere is very relaxed, the restaurant is VERY clean.   I have AND will continue recommending this establishment to my companions."}
{"text":"This is a very poor implementation of a great idea. I have eaten pre-packaged grocery store sushi which tasted better than this! If you really want to roll your own sushi there are plenty of instructional videos on Youtube. Otherwise, there are plenty of other sushi restaurants priced similarly, which deliver a much superior product."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place! Another reviewer called it a Subway for sushi, and it's a good one. I think I called it Chipotle for sushi, which isn't very far off either.   It's a cute little place- you go in, line up, and a row of tv screens tells you how it is their business works. The staff, too, are very nice and make sure to ask if you've been there before and understand how it works.   Basically, it's a build your own sushi roll bar. You can order a premade roll, or you have a certain number of options you can choose when it comes to making your own roll. You can use seaweed or soy paper, white or brown rice, and x number of veggies and meat toppings.   I wasn't keen on a roll, so I wound up getting a bowl (which is very much like chirashi! And I LOVE chirashi!) I got white rice, topped it with cucumbers, avocadoes, and cream cheese. (You get up to 3 'veggie' toppings in a certain selection.) I then had half and half spicy salmon and smoked salmon for my meat, and topped it with masago, because I love killing tiny little fish babies when I eat. I loved their selection of toppings, they had everything from kewpie mayo to creamy miso.   It was really all quite good. I'd say 3.5 stars rounded down to 3. The rice was so so- I rather wish they had fresh rice out of a cooker instead of preportioned, flattened between paper rice. It still sort of held that shape when I started eating my bowl, which wasn't very convenient. I love the selection of ingredients, and I love that you could mix and do half and half for your fish. I love love that they had tamago and the types of sauces that they had. And for all that I DID get, with all the extra stuff I put on it, my bowl came up to about $10. Not bad at all.   It's a neat place, go check it out and go again. Don't expect world class sushi, but it's fresh, inexpensive, and not subway. They're generous with their ingredients, the staff is nice and friendly and it's a great concept. Just note that parking also gets a bit hairy- it's a tiny lot they share with a lot of other businesses."}
{"text":"Ok this is NOT a dinner out for sushi (or at least that's what my date told me :)), but it is pretty awesome for getting a quick sushi fix without refinancing the house. The concept is cool, simple, and affordable. Think subway meets Ra sushi. I really like the options of brown rice and soy paper which more and more sushi restaurants are adapting to, it makes you feel like you are REALLY eating healthy....right up until you tell them to add cream cheese :). This concept is something I had always thought should exist, but had never seen before until 7th Ave and Mcdowell fast casual plaza opened up and low and behold...viola fast food sushi. They even have options for saki, edamame on the fly, and mochi ice cream. I have been here about 20 times so far and it has been consistently good each time. Check it out if you want to do quick and easy sushi or if you just want to grab something to go."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, they are open until ten so thats a plus for me.  They have many different options for you to try, or you can simply just make your own.  Miso is also not too bad."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing concept and both food and service were great!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! My DH and I tried three different rolls on both of our visits.  The Slammin Salmon Mango Tango And Crazy Cajun  The Slammin Salmon is my favorite. Its delicious. I had it on both my visits, and my husband tried mine, the first time. And ordered it, for himself, the second visit. At first I was kind of iffy, because it has strawberry and creamcheese, I was expecting a dessert like sushi. But it was very well balanced, and I didnt feel overwhelmed with creamcheese, like I have at other sushi places. Mango tango is also really good. If you like a little fruity kick to your sushi, thats the one. The mango isnt in the roll, its put on top of the roll, in a bellpepper/mango kind of fresh salsa. The Crazy Cajun was delighful, but a little too spicy for my palate. They really layer on the Sciracha sauce, which I love, but it was potent sciracha, and thats a little too much for me. My husband loved it, though. And ate half of my roll.  The portions are great!! They are hearty rolls, and they come in ten peice. So if you want to share, theres plenty.  I also paired my sushi with the miso soup, which is nice and hot, not too much tofu, and its light and fragrant. Which I appreciated, with my meal.  Id like to go back. I really enjoyed the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant. The employees were always friendly, and helpful. They chatted a little, with us, while we ordered, and helped us maximize our groupon. Which I thought was awesome.   We will definitely go back, in the future. I just really enjoyed both visits."}
{"text":"this place is amazing, its like chipotle but sushi instead of burritos. you go down the line adding whatever you want to your roll, and its all incredibly reasonably priced and super fast.   i can't believe i haven't eaten at this place sooner. i'll be coming back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Best idea ever! I love being able to choose what's inside my roll an they have soooo many choices. Everything is fresh and the staff is super helpful. It is fast, affordable and delicious. They even have eddamame that they heat right there for a dollar and miso soup for a dollar too. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back and try another roll."}
{"text":"I went to HDYR today for lunch, Ordered up a seaweed, white rice, cream cheese, sprout, asparagus, with spicy tuna roll and covered in spicy mayo, my mother and brother also ordered rolls, my brother Is pretty picky when it comes to food, and I never heard him complain about his rolls once. Is the quality the greatest, no its not, but when you consider the concept for this place its a place for many people to be introduced to sushi, to make it quick, and make it affordable, I think the quality lives up to anyone with reasonable expectations, and for my meal to be $9 with a coke it was pretty reasonable, also get the combo not just a soda, soda is $1.80, combo is $1.95.   We tried the green tea and vanilla Mochi, not sure I'm a huge fan of the rice coating on the outside.   I ordered a seaweed, white rice, cream cheese, asparagus, avocado, and unagi roll to go for dinner, and I swear I can hear it calling my name right now.   I think it would be pretty cool for this place to maybe teach sushi making once a month or so for a small fee, have people pay $10-$15 and show them how to roll sushi and make their own right in the store, I'd sign up!"}
{"text":"Tried How Do You Roll? Sushi a few days ago and I truly enjoyed my experience. Fresh ingredients, great spot for lunch, fair prices, and quick!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good lunch time sushi."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner in Downtown and surprisingly there arent a lot of sushi options here. I love stopping at HDYR after a late night or for a light lunch. While the parking is a bit tough there, the service is always fast. Ive never had to wait long in line. While it is a like a subway for sushi the fish taste good, the portions are generous, and the price is right. I probably eat here every other week. I like to make a custom roll with eel, avocado, cream cheese, green onion, and jalapeno. I think its like .50 for the extra veggies. Its a good lunch or dinner for under $10. While its not comparable to your typical sushi restaurant, it is REALLY GOOD."}
{"text":"Like most people are saying on here it is a really unique concept when it comes to sushi. For what it is, the sushi rolls tasted pretty good, people behind the counter were friendly. The cost is comparable to grocery store sushi but you get to be the dictator. Be prepared though, if you come during busy hours the parking situation is chaotic."}
{"text":"Reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I must have eaten at a different restaurant. I order two spicy tuna rolls with brown rice. Both had zero flavor and could have been molded from Elmer's paste instead of fish.   Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Seems like a good concept."}
{"text":"I really like it here...it's fast and it's good. My personal favorite is the three alarm roll, spicy and so delicious. I order take out lunch at least once a week. I would highly suggest giving it a try, it may or may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Call me a traditionalist but I don't think Sushi should be ordered like a Chipotle Burrito and when my roll is rolled I think a Sushi Chef should be doing the deed and not a machine.  That being said, Welcome to How Do You Roll.  I got to give it to the founders of this place for coming up with a sushi spin to the fast casual market.  They are also smart to offer a \"Happy Hour\" where rolls are on discounted pricing.  If you're looking for sushi somewhere between the quality of a grocery store and a nice restaurant give this place a shot.  Maybe you'll like it?"}
{"text":"We saw this place was coming months ago and have been excited to try it out. The staff is friendly and realizes you don't have a clue about how it works. You can choose ready-made rolls OR make your own!   You choose soy skin paper or traditional seaweed wrap (nom), white or brown rice and move onto choosing veggies/meats/etc. I'm a vegetarian so was glad to see their veggie rolls were really affordable: $3.97 (for 3 veggies - this selection includes tons of fresh veggies and their cream cheese/fried soy skins/sweet egg) - and anything over 3 choices is only $.50 extra. I got two rolls and a tea for $10. Not bad!  They have every sauce imaginable and some fun toppers, as well. I wish I had seen that they have seaweed/cucumber salad ($2.50) and miso soups! They are filling and cheap and delicious! Is it the best sushi in the valley? No, but they give me options and it's visually appealing. Next time getting a roll with a side of seaweed salad and miso soup! Yum! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good and then move onto the bad.  The concept behind the restaurant is down right brilliant and quite novel. Being able to customize your sushi is a great idea. The customer service is phenomenal, the employees were very polite and were having a great time making my food. Happy employees make for a great place to eat at in the long run. The interior is decorated in a modern upbeat style and there were ample comfortable seating options. The food portions were huge, expect one roll to fill you.  Below is the bad, all of which is improvable so do not give up hope on this place yet, hence three stars instead of two. This place is quite new and will likely improve over time if management pays attention.  Overall the quality of the food was OK although there were a few things that stood out that could use improvement. First off was the tremendous amount of rice in my Philly roll making the pieces chewy and the subtle flavors normally found in sushi understated. Sushi is one of those foods where less often means more (to a point). Less rice in the roll would have made the saved the business money and made it a much more enjoyable meal.  While we are on the topic of too much there was definitively too much cream cheese in the roll that I ate. I get that it was a phily roll but having too much cream cheese also dampened the over all texture of the roll as a whole equal portions of veggies, tuna and philly could have made this much better. Often times cream cheese is used to give the roll a hint of creaminess not make the roll entirely creamy.  It did appear that someone didn't take sushi 101. The nori flipped the wrong way. The smooth side was facing outwards while the rough side was facing inwards. The reason why there is a rough side and a smooth side is so that the rice sticks better to the smooth side of the nori while the rough side adds to the overall texture of the maki. If you cover the rough side of the nori with rice it is very difficult to feel the texture of the seaweed on your tongue (where you normally feel this texture) thus dampening the experience of the meal.   While overall the quality of the fish on the three rolls that we ordered was good the tuna was an exception to this. The fish sits in bins much like veggies sit in bins at Subway while they make your food. Leaving tuna out exposed to the air like this drys it out and thus degrades the overall quality of the fish. Often why you see pieces of fish wrapped in plastic wrap at almost every other sushi bars is because it prevents the fish from drying out and thus maintains the overall quality."}
{"text":"The sushi is OK.  Not fantastic, but the options are endless, and the ingredients seem to be pretty fresh.  The rolls are huge, with 10 pc each.  The staff was friendly.  My main complaints are that there aren't dishes to mix your soy/wasabi/etc in that keeps the ease of dipping.  Also, the lack of low sodium soy sauce is sadness.  All-in-all, I'd go there all the time if it was convenient to work."}
{"text":"One night, I was futzing around on Yelp and came across this new place.  There were a lot of good reviews, so I went out the next day on a mission to try this place and review it, too!  While the location is great (across the way from SideBar), the parking kind of sucks, but I found a spot eventually (it was also lunch time on a weekday, so that's probably my bad).  I met a friend there, and we were eager to see what all the hype was about.    Basically, everyone is right!  It's like Chipotle or Subway, but with sushi!  What a great concept!!!  You can choose white or brown rice with either soy skin (which I thought sounded effing gross) or the traditional seaweed (way better!) and then you can pick three veggies (anything additional is 50 cents more) and you can add meat(s) for a little extra, too.  I opted for the seaweed with brown rice and added avocado, cukes, sprouts and asparagus to it.  It was quite a nice little green roll, if I do say so myself (and I do).  They take the roll and put it in this nifty roll cutter, and out comes 10 perfectly cut sushi pieces.  Then as you move closer to the register, they ask if you'd like any toppings (crispy tempura, roe, sesame seeds, etc.)  They have all kinds of sauces: ponzu, soy, teriyaki glaze, sweet chili, sriracha, eel, and maybe more that I can't remember. You can also grab a bowl of miso soup or some edamame just in case you want a little something extra.  When I went to pay, my rolls were only about 4 dollars plus my drink= 6 dollar meal.  Woo!  When you go to the condiment bar, it's full of ginger and wasabi and two big iced tea pitchers and then two more that are full of ponzu and soy sauce.  It was awesome and I was in condiment heaven!!  I grabbed some of the hibiscus tea and was ready to go.  The roll was soo delicious and the tea was surprisingly good.  I went back for more, and grabbed a roll to go for my woman and a cucumber salad (they also have a squid salad and a seaweed salad).  All in all, my expectations were met and then some and my friend really enjoyed her meal, as well.  The food was great, the staff was friendly and helpful (they saw the look on my face as I walked up and totally knew I didn't know what I was doing), they explained how everything worked and made my experience that much better.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Just opened today, make your own sushi roll, AWESOME! Not for the faint of heart or those who can't make decisions. Fruit on rolls? Try it, pineapple rocked! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place in the neighborhood for a bit & kept meaning to stop in. I even have a close friend that eats lunch regularly at this place & still hadn't made it in till this last Saturday for a quickie lunch. I was so happy with the staff. It was my first time & they led me right through the process of making my own sushi but I opted to try the 3 Alarm (a regular menu item) & I LOVED it. Loved it so much I'm sending the hubs back 2 days later today to get me another. Can't wait for my spicy hubs lunch delivery today. Mmmm mmmm"}
{"text":"First found out about this place through the yelp app for hot new local places and after reading about this place, I was stoked and wanted to try it out for it being a sushi version of subway/chipotle.  When I got there everything inside was pretty nice and green, the staff were all very nice - the sushi is what it is. The sushi is basically average quality and is for those that are on-the-go and need it quick than waiting at a typical sushi shop. The more items that you add onto it is going to add up of course and it will all depend if you know your sushi on what sauce you want to add on there to suit your likings.   Overall, it is a good place but it's not something I would crave for and rush there but more like if I'm in the area and not feeling other fast food joints."}
{"text":"If you have any appreciation for good sushi then stay far away from here. If McDonald's decided to make sushi this is what you would get."}
{"text":"very interesting....  Its good but not wonderful. its perfect for your in a rush sushi craving... Basically this place is subway but with sushi. You can build your own rolls or pick from one of their signature rolls. I always make my own (adds a little more fun to the experience)   The fish itself is pretty fresh but not the best,  I would be curious to know where they get their fish from and if its frozen before. I do like the fact they give you a choice of brown or white rice (pre-made which kinda weirded me out) you can also pick from soy paper, seaweed (the usual) and rice paper. they have several different veggies to choose from as well as Saki (mmmmmmm my favorite) The rolls are decent in size so that was a plus, but I was taken back when I ordered edamame and it was cold. The ginger also threw me off (it looked like pink fake ginger) I loved the fact they have Ponzu and Soy sauce (low-sodium and regular) basically on tap.   I'm a huge fan of sesame seed and when I asked the girl for \"a ton of sesame seeds\" on the inside and out she had no problem doing that and there was no extra charge.  The staff here obviously gets the same questions over and over again and new people all the time because the couple times I've been in they have all been very friendly and have no problem explaining the process of things.  I'll be coming back for my quick fix soon."}
{"text":"Went today on good Friday across town during rush hour and it was closed. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"On our way to the Chipotle in the same complex today, my husband and I were accosted by one of the staff members encouraging us to come in and try How Do You Roll. The menu looked interesting and affordable, so we decided to give it a try. We were told it was their first day of business and we were excited to try it. It is basically build your own sushi roll. It is a lot like Subway or Chipotle, where you pick your rice, wrapper, veggies, raw meat, cooked meat, sauces, and toppings as you walk from one end of the counter to the other. They had a great selection of ingredients and I was impressed by the toppings and sauces that were available, including sesame seeds, spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, masago, etc. My husband and I each had one roll and a cup of miso soup for a grand total of about $16. The rolls were pretty good and the veggies were crisp and fresh. Each roll is cut into 10 large pieces and won't leave you hungry. While the miso soup had a good flavor, I wished it hadn't tasted so watered down. The staff members were very friendly and paid careful attention to every detail. One employee even picked up our table for us when we were finished eating.  All in all, I am glad that we had lunch here, and we will definitely go back soon and try a new combination of ingredients in our rolls!  We are happy to welcome How Do You Roll into the neighborhood and hope that they do well!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out for lunch. It's esentially a Chipotle set up but with sushi. You can pick a pre selected roll (ranging from $6-11) or make your own a la carte. You can get soy paper or the traditional Nori wrap. I forget the name of the roll I had, it had crab and uni. It was decent, nothing to write home about. My wife actually attempted to order a riceless roll and while they made it for her, it seemed to be a super task. Overall I give it a solid 3 stars. Not sure I'll go back, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Finally, customizable sushi rolls! I'm a huge proponent of customizable food of any type, simply because, as prepared, there is always at least one ingredient that I don't want in a dish and typically one or more ingredients that I wish were included. Sushi tends to be the hardest to customize, based on the difficulty of communicating with most sushi chefs...as well as the mysterious and often exorbitant costs that result.  However, at HDYR, you can get exactly what you want. This not only indulges finicky palates but it enables you to more easily watch your calories.  The quality of the ingredients at How Do You Roll is comparable to most other sushi places I've ever been...I'd even say better than many. I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about when they say that everything tastes frozen; that's just the cliche that people go to when some external factor (in this case, their sushi snobbery) gets in the way of their enjoyment of something that is legitimately good; they just assume that if it's affordable and franchised that it can't be good.   For my tastes, HDYR perfectly balances quality, price, and portions. In fact, if anything, they're too generous; I found myself wondering how they can make a profit with such large portions of high quality food at such low prices."}
{"text":"Great concept! Choose your rice (white or brown), soy or seaweed wrap, 3 veggies, and one protein. Then they roll it for you. Add toppings or sauces after it's sliced for you. Try it!"}
{"text":"What a cool concept. My friend had a Groupon so we decided to give it a try...figured it wouldn't hurt. Upon first impression it was super clean. It's in a building with a couple other establishments and parking was easy.  We decided to share three rolls and the seaweed salad. We ordered the spicy tuna, five alarm, and philly roll. It's like a Subway for sushi...the seaweed or soy wrap is made ahead of time with whatever rice you choose (white or brown). It doesn't take long for the \"sushi artists\" to put the rolls together. Then they put it in a sushi cutter type contraption and you get 10 equal sized pieces. When we were about to ring up we decided to all the grilled chicken roll to our order (don't remember the exact name). We each got a beer and the total came to just over $20 but remember, we had a Groupon. The full prices for each of the rolls was about $8-$9 and the beer was $4. You can also make your own roll...seaweed is $4 and soy wrap is $5 and you get a choice of 3 fruits or veggies, protein extra.  All of the rolls were really good...I think the chicken was my favorite. My friend thought that the spicy tuna tasted like lipstick but I couldn't really tell. Everything was fresh. We ate everything but were stuffed...we didn't really need that fourth roll but were happy we got it.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something casual, inexpensive, and good."}
{"text":"I wanna try this place because they care enough to read and respond to reviews. YELP has a huge influence on where me and my family eat. Way to go in the customer service department!"}
{"text":"This was decent sushi at a reasonable price and super quick (especially for sushi) service.  I love the concept and wish I had the funds to invest in this franchise and open one up in our home area.  If there is ever a HDYR opened around me, I will be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Neat little shop thats the \"Subway\" of sushi. Rolls were good and I like that you can customize them as you go.   Its worth a shop and a convenient location."}
{"text":"The workers here were very helpful on explaining the concept &prices. It's good quality for the price I'm paying. A roll is equivalent to 10 pieces, which is a little bit more than what you would normally get served every where else. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Started off being a favorite, however the service has gone down hill fast!!  There are two male  workers named Daniel and Peter and are absolutely horrible. One of them was so busy cruising the female customers and staring at their bodies and the other one was incredibly rude and condescending.   There are plenty of other restaurants around the area that provide much better service."}
{"text":"Such a great Sushi place you can get a ton of sushi for $20.00!! Comparable to 45-60.00 at other places and the sushi is great! I have come with my wife 5 times in a year and the food is consistent and really good."}
{"text":"We're not quite sure what to think of this place.   The concept is different, the food is average, the wait for food is longer than average for \"fast food', and the service was decent.   Thus, the 3 stars.   The concept of \"fast food\" sushi is interesting.  You select from a fairly complicated menu that includes \"a la carte\" options as well as prepared selections.   The ordering process was actually kind of annoying yet could be attributed to our first visit to this store.   Overall, the process is slow.   Quality/Taste:  This is where the concept may go very wrong (and could be fixed).  The sushi rolls we had were no better than grocery store quality.    It lacked taste and the \"freshness\" didn't seem to compare to regular sushi restaurants.    The options are healthy (brown rice, vegetables, and raw fish of course).     Food Portions:  The concept allows the restaurant to strictly control food portions (good for business but likely not much of an impressive factor for clients used to a normal sushi restaurant.  That said, the rolls we had were decent and \"normal sized\" compared to regular sushi establishments. k  Service:  The service was good.  The guys explained the process of ordering and the menu.   They were nice and professional.   Overall, I don't believe we will ever return to this restaurant.   Again, the concept is different so we hope they do well and find a niche in the market.   It just isn't our preferred way of enjoying sushi.   Give it a try.  See what you think."}
{"text":"Just got back from this place, and I rushed to leave a review as soon as I got to my computer. It is a hobby of mine to try new sushi places. I was excited at the idea of this place, but in truth this was truly awful sushi. My boyfriend and I ordered 5 different rolls and each one was a disappointment. The specialty rolls had clashing flavors, the masago tasted off, and overall the rolls were poorly executed. The miso soup left little to be desired as well, with two miniscule pieces of tofu and less than a few scallions tossed in. The assembly team was unorganized, unnecessarily rushed, and spoke fluent mumble. On the bright side the edamame was good, though let's be honest how can anyone mess up edamame? If you want overpriced, below average sushi, this is the place for you. I only pray that the upset feeling I have in my stomach is the feeling of regret and not of food poisioning (which seems to be a more than common factor at this \"restaurant\")."}
{"text":"Super fun concept, but needs a few tiny tweaks.  The fruit option (mango) wasn't ripe and it messed with my roll.  They told me that their eel sauce is called teriyaki here... what?  Whatever, it still tasted good!  The service was friendly and helpful, especially as I toted a couple of messy kids in with me.  Looking forward to a return visit in the future."}
{"text":"great addition to the neighborhood.  surprisingly delicious sushi.  very friendly and clean."}
{"text":"I came here this afternoon because I was feenin for some sushi and heard good things about this place.   I parked on the street to create less stress for myself so I can't talk to much about the parking situation..so.. lets get over that lol!  I had a shrimp roll with crunchy tempura on top with 3 side sauces, sweet chilli, a peanut flavored one ( wasn't feeling this) and the Spicy mayo (My favorite). The workers are really dope and friendly, and walked me through the whole process of choosing veggies, wraps, meat etc. I was pretty full after my meal and would def be back whenever I'm in the area.. too bad I don't work downtown anymore, this place would be real convenient and has a great return factor  4 STARS**"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place! I agree with one of the reviewers below that it is the \"Chipotle\" of sushi, so if you're looking for something authentic this is not the place for you. The reason why I'm a fan is because I love being able to create different combinations with the ingredients that I like, they have a ton of options and they have quality fish. I come here when I'm craving something not too heavy and healthy, and don't want to break the bank on authentic sushi."}
{"text":"This is where you're own creativity. Pays off. Have it anyway you like it. Really injoyed it."}
{"text":"I've been getting into sushi a lot more lately. It's not really something I ever craved before, or considered as a food option, but that's changing.   A colleague of mine had reccomended this place to me. I was in the area for lunch and decided that I would check it out.   I really don't know what I was expecting, but when I walked in that was it. It reminded me of a fast-food place. No big deal. I walk up and start to order. It kind of reminds me of Subway. You know, how you can customize your own stuff?   Anyway, I'm still a newbie and not as adventurous when it comes to sushi. So I ordered the Cali rolls. Very good! A lot of sushi for a reasonable price.   It's no Kabuki, but it definitely scratched the itch!"}
{"text":"I've visited a few times now, and have no complaints. I do appreciate how fast the service is - it's hard to plan on sushi on the way to work, as it's usually a lingering meal for me - but I can go into How Do You Roll 15 minutes before work, get a couple rolls to go and still punch in on time. That's a definite plus!  With all the restaurants sharing a small parking lot, the parking can be a bit insane at peak times. Happily - my work schedule is far from normal, and I'm not anywhere at peak meal times!  The food is fresh, staff friendly and informative, and this provides a great alternative to fried fast food or tired subs.  That said - I enjoy the soup/salad/breadsticks at Olive Garden, but I don't confuse it for real Italian food. I will grab grub at Taco Bell in a pinch, but I don't confuse it for real Mexican food. How Do You Roll is a nice change of pace, but I would not confuse it for real sushi."}
{"text":"Great concept. You basically get to build your own sushi. Generous portions, each roll was about 10 pcs. Lots of options and very good! The owner was there and very personable."}
{"text":"Let's start with the basics...  clean establishment- check,  friendly staff- check, interesting concept-check,  my favorite sushi elements- definitely check!  The girl behind the counter broke down the concept for me and encouraged.  I wrapped my delicious runs roll in soy paper.  For my second, I turned my eel roll into a bowl.   A bowl of sushi heaven.  I. Will.  Be.  Back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the fam. I was excited to try this place since the concept intrigued me. Since the guys working seemed slow for assembly, my husband and I both opted to order from their signature rolls thinking that it would be faster (it wasn't). My husband loved his roll which surprised me since he came in with low expectations.  I, on the other hand, was very disappointed.  I chalked it up to maybe chicken shouldn't be in a sushi roll.  But the next day... I learned another reason why I won't be coming back here.  I got food poisoning.    I had been unimpressed with the way some of the food was being stored and also had a little issue with the way that they cut their rolls- with a machine.  Every roll goes thru the same machine.  What if you had food allergies?  And how often is that thing cleaned?  In my opinion you should be cleaning it after every roll that is cut.    I should have gone with my gut when I saw the presentation of the food... instead my gut told me later why I should have listened to it in the first place.  Both my husband and I got food poisoning which lasted two days.    Avoid.  Avoid.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I have to admit, walking in to this place was almost like a dream come true.   The only down-side was being plagued with the loud voice in my head screaming \"why didn't I think of this?\"  Seriously.   You can customize your roll to be exactly what you want, no matter how silly or slight. Pricing isn't too steep, either. Now let's make a roll...  Want to go traditional with white rice and nori? No problem. Oh, you like brown rice? No problem. Want soy paper instead? No problem.   Now pick some veggies. Don't like avocado? DON'T CHOOSE THAT THEN. Don't want any veggies? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET THEM (this aint your mama's roll)!  Hate the crab and mayo mix? SKIP IT. Pick WHATEVER YOU LIKE (salmon, tuna, spicy or not, egg, cream cheese, go nuts people)!  Do what YOU want. Smile. Be happy. Watch it all happen in front of your very eyes...   THEN!  It gets rolled up tightly and sliced.   Now you can add sauce or \"toppings\" (I do sort of feel like this term should change). They even have some custom sauces!   I mean, the only thing missing here was for someone to feed me the rolls.   Seriously.   It is a casual atmosphere but it feels hip. Would be nice if there was a bar nearby- oh wait, there is! Across the street. Would be nice to drink on the patio though... This is how the only got four stars out of me.  Great. Now I wish I lived in the neighborhood.   Well, time to start house shopping. Or maybe I should just open a franchise..."}
{"text":"It was about time I rolled into this place!  We had passed it so many times and I kept wondering if was worth a shot.  Finally...my hubby and I stopped in last week to try it at the end of our date day.  He is allergic to shell fish, so I was happy he would be able to try sushi since they have meat as well.  This is all based on the idea of customized sushi, just like they make customized sandwiches at Subway.  In fact, the people behind the counter say the same thing.   But they also have set menu sushi combos as well in case you don't want to try to make your own combo.    I tried their Five Alarm, since so many here said how good it was.  Then, I attempted to put my own combination together with tempura shrimp, crab, cucumber, green onion, soy paper, white rice, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo.  I looooooved being able to get soy paper because I like it way more than seaweed!  Sadly, it wasn't flavorful enough because of my choices I put together.  But the Five Alarm was pretty tasty and perfectly spicy without being over the top...if you are used to spiciness that is.    My hubby decided to go with their combos and ordered the Beefinator and Funky Fresh Chicken.  I had mentioned to the gal behind the counter that it was his first time having sushi since he is allergic and I'm glad I did because she was on top of it enough to use a clean knife to cut his rolls instead of putting in their automated cutter.  Thank you!!  He said he wasn't a huge fan of his rolls, but he also said that he thinks sushi are appetizers.  Ha!  What does he know?!  :-)  We took ours outside and enjoyed it out on their patio since it was later in the day.  The concept is pretty cool and I kind of want to take some of the roll recipes at my favorite sushi joint that I never get because it has salmon (not a fan) or eel on it...and instead use some spicy tuna or crab possibly at HDYR.  I'm definitely going to give it another shot and see.    Their ingredients aren't as fresh as the sushi restaurants I frequent, but they are still pretty good.  If you try it, I highly recommend getting one of their set rolls off the menu and maybe making another of your own."}
{"text":"Having lived in Tokyo, our family knows when a sushi roll is A sushi roll. We finally tried How Do You Roll and we loved it!  Not only is the sushi good, but the whole concept is awesome.  It is pretty much like going to Subway or Chipotle.  You go in to the counter, choice of white or brown rice, choice of traditional nori or soy, then there is a wide range of fillings and you get to choose what you want in your roll including toppings! For the squeamish eaters especially when it comes to raw fish, you can have a roll made with cooked beef or chicken or just a veggie roll.  What a great idea!  Sides of edamame or miso soup is available and cucumber salad, etc. plus choices of ponzu or shoyu, ginger, and of course they have wasabi!  Prices?  Truly reasonable, way cheaper than going to a regular sushi bar.  Cons?  Servers need to change gloves more often especially when shrimp is involved.  I am hypersensitive to shrimp and my ears were itchy after eating at this place.  Perhaps the customer before me ordered a sushi roll with shrimp.  Another con?  Sushi roll is served on plastic plates lined with paper...  C'mon people.  Can't you guys do better than this?  All in all, I would go back though and ask for the server to put on a new pair of gloves though!"}
{"text":"This was good and fun.  It was a nice place to go as a family and not very expensive.  However, we enjoy making sushi at home and that is an even cheaper option.  Head over to Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  Pick up a rice cooker, Japanese Calrose Rice, Sushi Vinegar, seaweed, all the veggies you want and sushi grade fish of your choice.  Don't forget a bottle of sake for $4.85.  Our family of 5 can have all you can eat sushi and all you can drink sake (for the adults) and it only costs $20 at home.  Okay, back to HDYR.... The menu has 6 featured roll choices ranging from $5.95 - $9.95.  The funnest thing though is to choose your own.  #1 You Choose Your Wrap & Rice- seaweed is $3.95 per roll and soy paper is $4.95 per roll.  Your choice of white or brown rice for free.  You can choose up to 3 \"veggies\" to go in the roll.  Choices are: Asparagus, Avocado, Baby Spinach, Cream Cheese, Cucumber, Green Onions, Jalapenos, Sprouts, Egg, Tofu Skin, Seasonal Fruits & Seasonal Veggies.  If you want to add a meat to your sushi roll it is an additional $1.95 (for beef or chicken or crabsticks) up to $2.95 (for freshwater eel, shrimp or seasonal fish).  Some toppings like chili powder, sesame seeds and cilantro are free.  Others cost money ranging from 99c (crunchy tempura & smelt egg) up to $3 for some seasonal offerings.  Sauces on top are free- creamy miso, ponzu, spicy mayo, teriyaki, japanese mayo, sesame chili oil, sweet chili and wasabi mayo.  All sushi rolls are 10 pieces.   HDYR also has salads- cucumber, seaweed and calamari.  edamame and miso soup.  For dessert you could get mochi ice cream for $3.  Drinks are tea/soda/water/japanese soda as well as beer, wine and sake.  They do have a kids meal for $3.99.  This includes a 5 piece junior roll OR beef or chicken teriyaki bowl with edamamae or a fruit cup, kids drink and a toy.  My kids wanted a full size 10 piece veggie roll for $3.95 and a bowl of miso soup for 99c and a free cup of water with lemon.  I felt that was a better value for us."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a date night a few months back, and I was pretty pleased with the options.  It was late in the evening and I was glad to see so many fresh veggies, and the staff was super friendly (I always walk away from a dining experience happier when the employees are friendly and chatty, treat me like a friend, not a paycheck).  I've never been a huge sushi fan, but occasionally I get a hankering for it, and this really hit the spot (their sauces are super yummy, too).  I definitely want to go back.  It's location right across the street from Sidebar doesn't hurt, either."}
{"text":"I had avoided this place for a bit because I didn't want to be standing there in line going \"Uh...Ummm...Uhh...\" and not be able to decide on what I wanted. When I finally decided to take the plunge I was pleasantly surprised to find it was very easy to order what I wanted.  My roll was the bomb.  Big tip? Cilantro is like bacon, it belongs on everything. Enough said. Try it out, it's rather yummy!"}
{"text":"For three and a half years we've lived in the Valley, and for three and a half years we've searched for the sort of reasonably priced, fresh sushi was had frequent access to in Portland. Some places are phenomenal but bankroll-busting (Roka Akor). Some places are decent, but you're still overpaying (Stingray, Ra, everywhere else I've gone).  How Do You Roll? is a horribly-named chain out of Austin. It's the Chipotle of sushi, where you pick the ingredients, and some guy who looks like he belongs at Chipotle or Starbucks puts it together for you, and there are all kinds of options. It's disconcerting. Everything about this place seems like it'll suck.  But you know what? It's pretty damn good. I'm not saying this is the best sushi in town. I'm not even saying it's as good as somewhere like Stingray (which, as I mentioned, isn't all that great, either). But it's close, and you get what you want. And the best part? You don't feel like you're getting gouged. It doesn't even feel like going out.  I'm convinced How Do You Roll? is going to be a gamechanger. It's going to draw Americans to sushi who wouldn't have considered it otherwise. It'll be an affordable way for sushi lovers to get their fix. There's plenty to balk at (again, that name is AWFUL), but this is our new sushi default in the Valley.  ADDENDUM: After a third visit, some cracks showed. The seaweed wrap was doubled up or something, and became obnoxiously chewy. Then our cashier charged us for eight meats instead of four, and it took quite some time to remedy the situation. Also, I've got the feeling they're masking the taste of the sushi with sauce. (This is not a place for sashimi or nigiri.) Anyway, we'll try again, but I was scared off a bit. Fortunately, if my wife's craving it, there's always Five Guys, Chipotle and Jersey Mike's nearby if I'm in the mood for something else."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place or sushi!  I went by myself one day and ordered one roll and was so happy that I could custom make the roll anyway I wanted.  The rolls are actually really big.  I like this place and will return!"}
{"text":"It was so-so. This place is basically the Chipotle of sushi. The Philly roll has way too much cream cheese and wants for something crunchy to balance the soft textures of the avocado, salmon and cream cheese. I will probably come back if only so that I can try my hand at a custom roll and see how that turns out."}
{"text":"The parking for this business is atrocious, but I wouldn't expect anything different because of the location.   The dining area is large and was clean.  There was kind of a weird smell, but I wasn't entirely sure it wasn't me! They have a menu of rolls they have devised that you can choose, or if you aren't overwhelmed by all the choices like I was, you can have them assemble a roll from your very own imagination. I would recommend paper menus at the door so you have a little better idea what to expect when you get to the prep line, as people making decisions & asking questions slows down the entire process.   Very delicious!  I can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots for rolls because I enjoy building my own custom creations. I'm not eating meat these days and they have a good selection of veggies and a few fruits to choose from.   My favourite roll is this:   Soy wrap  White rice Cucumber Avocado Mango Cream cheese Sprouts Spicy mayo Sriracha  I usually eat out in their patio or on the larger tables in that courtyard area. Everyone who works here is friendly and they make your rolls pretty fast. If a line forms, I notice they are very good about getting help other people on shift.  Totally recommend everyone who decides to eat here regularly ask to sign up for their loyalty prgram. I've earned many free rolls and am happily eating my way up to Rockin' Roller status!  My only complaint about HDYR is that at this location the tables are sometimes sticky if you chose to dine inside."}
{"text":"Cheap quick sushi. Simple. Not great. But hits the spot, albeit a bit messily. It's not unfresh, it's just a LOT which can be good but this makes twice that I've consumed just too much.   Not really their problem."}
{"text":"I rolled on in for my first time for lunc today and nowI really have mixed fellings.   My Roll did taste good, but anything covered in spicy mayo would.   I like the brown rice, but the complete lack of artisan craftmanship with the rice, icrean scoops used for fish and cutting leave me unimpressed.  My real quandry is when it comes to value. ~7 for a sushi roll is not a bad price (or a great one) but for lunch $7 for a seat your self type place is on par however one sushi roll is not really filling enough for me.  Thus the 3 stars based on my ability to feel full after a roll + miso soup (.99).  Service ws fast friendly and helpful. I liked the idea of soy sauce in a iced tea like despencer.   If you are not too hungry, and want a fast lunch that can be somewhat healthy give this place a try."}
{"text":"I'll give an honest review for this place - although How Do You Roll isn't a bad place to eat at, I've gone to much better places that serve better-tasting sushi at the same or less price than this restaurant. For this, I gave two stars - I got the bowl with brown rice, tuna, tofu skin, and avocado - it came to be about $10.80 after tax. Although the description sounds like the selection would be good, it really wasn't anything special, and the portions were small for $10. Compared to the other sushi places that I have gone to, How Do You Roll tasted like any other fast-food restaurant that didn't really care about the quality of their food, but rather quantity and pricing of some rolls. I would recommend resorting to some of their rolls (they have some rolls for $3 during happy hour). I don't recommend getting the bowl. Overall, I was disappointed and although I wouldn't avoid the place, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was sad to see this place is closed as of March 16th for failure to pay rent.  I really liked this place and the concept. Will keep an eye out to see if they re-open or re-locate (fingers crossed)"}
{"text":"Fun, fresh, and flavorful. You know exactly what you're getting since all the sushi is made to order right in front of you. Employees are friendly, and the restaurant is always spotless."}
{"text":"A fantastic idea!!   I'd describe How Do You Roll? as the Subway of Sushi - but good!   You are able to select each and every attribute of your sushi roll and they make it right in front of you as you like. Yesterday I created my own version of a traditional Spicy Tuna roll and it was phenomenal! I had a Seaweed Salad on the side and was stuffed on just these two.   Since this was my first time I was impressed that the staff was so patient with me, especially with the epic line forming behind me. This is definitely a lunch hotspot! If you're a sushi fan, I'd say this place is DEFINITELY worth a try!"}
{"text":"The place is da bomb.com/wickedawesome . I know the parking lot is annoying but you can get in from the other side, by give guys or park by pei way and walk over.   They have a few rolls on special for happy hour which I love- slammin salmon is the best or the three alarm if you like spicy. Everything is fresh and tasty and you can make your own rolls like you would at a chipotle or subway. That's great but if your not so creative like me they do have a traditional menu. It's a convenient spot near downtown and is very casual. I'd feel comfortable here on a date or just on my own."}
{"text":"This is fast food sushi, so my expectations were dropped, it's great for a fast custom roll, but lacked the flavor, quality and care that exists in a traditional sushi bar.  If you are looking for fast and custom (and custom is pretty awesome here), this is a place for you.  I have my doubts about them knowing the tradition of sushi making and didn't see any \"running water\"."}
{"text":"This was my first time at How Do You Roll? I thought it was an interesting concept, but I am still skeptical. I was able to design my own sushi role and picked things that I wanted. I have to say that I am not sure that I know how to design a sushi roll and it was not that delicious. I would even say it was weird. There were a few rolls to choose from that were standard, but I wanted to be adventurous. I will admit that I may not try that again.   I feel like I have to do research on sushi ingredients before I try creating my own again."}
{"text":"I really liked it! And I can be a bit of a sushi snob.  The rolls are BIG.  One was too much food for me.  So, if you're looking for cheap, delicious, fresh sushi rolls.... give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Love , Love, Love this place..."}
{"text":"So, it's not high brow sushi.  So what!  As an alternative to chipotle, 5 guys, rando sandwich shop - this place is a real winner.   Sure, it's designed for the American palette but with a sharp inviting interior, free wifi, and decent beer choices this place is a decent quick service alternative.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try How do you Roll? since I first saw it last year! I was very happy with my experience! I like the concept- custom rolls or a few choices of their creations. It's a great sushi place to take kids to introduce them to new foods. There's a choice of meats that are cooked including beef and chicken in addition to shrimp, crab etc. as well as the traditional fresh salmon, tuna etc. I made my own roll like a Philly- white rice, cucumber, avocado, sprouts, salmon and cream cheese. I order rolls like this elsewhere and it was very comparable in quality to my favorite spots. I got rice bowls with krab and cucumber for my boys and they liked the teriyaki sauce on the side. There are 2 different kinds of lemonade in the fountain and herbal iced tea which was delicious (hibiscus raspberry frenzy) and black passion fruit tea also. They hAve 5 flavors of mochi- we tried strawberry, vanilla, mango, and green tea- the 3 of us each chose a different favorite but agreed they all hit the spot! We did not try the coffee flavor.  Very casual inside with a front door facing 7th ave and a back door with patio. Laid back vibe.Parking can be tricky, but I lucked out today.   Customer service was awesome. Very nice staff. I look forward to returning for happy hour with friends as well as with my nanny kids for lunch."}
{"text":"Not good. Frozen sushi is not real sushi. The portion is fine for a sushi place but if someone makes ur sushi in less than 10 seconds something is wrong. The rice is already attached to the roller by the time the girl take it off the cooker. The ingredients looks and taste really frozen. I dont like bashing new upcoming business but this is basically the Mcdonalds of sushi, fast, frozen, bland sushi. If your looking sushi drive 5-10 more miles for other places such as ibachi, teharu, lis bowl, and others around that has real sushi experience. Pls stay away, but if u love mcdonalds or something like that pls feel free to try them, oh just a reminder i ordered 2 sushi and paid alslmost 20 bucks, 20 dollars in teharu can give u sooo much."}
{"text":"Good rolls & selection for the price! Not \"top notch\" sushi but if you are looking for that don't expect to pay $5 per roll!!   Our best combo:  1)Wrap: soy paper 2)rice: brown 3)Protein: salmon 4)Veggies/fruits (3): sprouts, tofu skin, STRAWBERRIES(!)  5)Sauce: sweet chile  Pleasantly surprised by all our random combos but this was our fave."}
{"text":"IT'S LIKE SUBWAY FOR SUSHI!!!!!! I loved this place. I took my dad here since I had a $20 groupon. He made his own Tuna Roll and I got the \" Re-EEL-Y Good\" Roll. It tasted great and also they have edamame and miso soup for $1 each. I like that you can customize a sushi roll and it's a whole new concept for sushi! I plan on going back whenever I am downtown!"}
{"text":"The concept of this place really appealed to me.  A sushi place where you can custom make your own rolls to exactly how you want it...what?!?!?  Thinking that my dreams of sushi creativity have come true I was very underwhelmed by my experience a couple of months ago.    Walking into the establishment, it was okay.  There were quite a few tables that needed to be bused and the smell of the restaurant reminded me of like a hole in the wall Asian food market.  Not typically the best smell to entice an appetite but I kept an open mind.  The menu seemed clean and precise, just exactly what you would expect a restaurant where you can make custom sushi would be..here are the ingredients, mix and please as you wish.  So I did...  They pulled the rice out of the container.  It had already been placed with the nori and I was instantly hesitant on my order.  Just looking at the rice from behind the sneeze guard, the grains of rice looked like one cohesive blob of rice.  That's one thing I hate in supposedly \"fresh\" sushi places is mushy rice!  I continued my order...got the salmon with green onion, avocado and cucumber.  Those ingredients looked fresh so that was a plus.  The fish was decently fresh but not anything to rave about.  Here is the part that got me thinking a little more skeptically about this place.  My boyfriend ordered a chicken roll and ordered ahead of me.  Upon time to actually roll the sushi, she added the \"raw\" salmon to my roll and then with the same gloves added the cooked chicken to his roll before having the roll's rolled.  Maybe I am one of \"those\" people, but I would prefer not to have raw fish on my cooked chicken roll especially if they are two separate rolls.  Just imagine that the person wasn't my boyfriend who order in front of me or if that same person was allergic to fish...  The staff seemed okay...somewhat helpful but the lady who served us almost seemed annoyed that it was our first time.  I also didn't care for the chopsticks.  Splintered wood is not good for any dinning experience, but I did like that you can get your own soy sauce and amount of wasabi.    All in all, my food was kinda bland, even with the extra flavoring sauces and the rice was, as I mentioned above, mushy and chewy.  Not a great experience and probably won't be going back or recommending this place either.  If I want sushi like this again, I'll just go to my local grocery store and pick up the pre-made sushi that basically has the same consistency, and taste."}
{"text":"Walmart of sushi! I found a hair in my rolls. If you don't know me, I'm bald. It wasn't mine!  They offered to remake my rolls. What? So I can have another serving of hair?! No thanks. Then when I asked for a refund they said they could give me a credit. What?! So I can return for a second helping of hair! No thanks! This place sucks! They call themselves the Subway of sushi. Does Subway know they're calling themselves that? The safest thing I would order from this place is a bottle of beer and I would make sure you open it yourself."}
{"text":"I love that they've built up this little corner with some places to get a quick bite.  HDYR is very clean and the staff is friendly.  The have like 4-5 basic rolls to choose from or select your own ingredients.  I'm a very indecisive person so this place isn't good for me- I dont know what the hell I want in a roll so I just ordered a Philly, it was on par with the rolls you can grab at the grocery store deli. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Got 2 rolls - one the steak choices the other was create your own - was able to get half roll one protein and the other half a different type of protein for $15"}
{"text":"I really like coming here - it's my go-to \"let's go somewhere fun!\" place. Their pricing is really fair (even if I do wish the seaweed salad were cheaper), and I really enjoy the experience. The serving staff is always friendly, and it's a really great place to go for a quick lunch that will break up the sandwich monotony of everyday life.  Also, How Do You Roll? is a GoodDining participating restaurant, so there's the added bonus that when I go, a portion of my sale goes to my favorite charity! Woo!  A quick note on parking: there is a private lot, but it is a tiny one shared with about 6 other restaurants. I would NOT recommend trying to hit this place up at the lunch hour as it will be a major headache."}
{"text":"It was a 1st date, and he picked the place, told me we were headed out to get some sushi, and I was like yea! Love me some sushi! We got to How Do You Roll, and I thought, wow what a cute name, but then stepped inside and saw it meant literality how do you roll, like what do you like for your rolls, Now me being a new person of sushi only know how to order of the menu of rolls put together, so I felt dumb not knowing what to make, thanks HDYR haha , time for me to start learning so that when I come back the next time I will sound like a pro!  We ordered the Philly Roll, which was salmon, avocado & cream cheese, it was good and tasty I liked it!   Also ordered the Slamming Salmon Roll, had salmon, jalapenos, cream cheese, strawberries covered in sauce. Now who would have thought salmon and strawberries & jalapenos would work, but omg they do! This was a great roll! And it started giving me ideas for other rolls! It had heat & a sweet taste; I think it was my fav roll!   Last roll we ordered was the 3 Alarm Roll, it was spicy tuna, cucumber & avocado and topped with sauces, this one also packed some heat, but I was blown away with the Slamming Salmon Roll, I think it stole the show!  So now I will do some sushi making homework before I venture back, but I will be headed back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great fast food concept that is referred to as the \"subway\" for sushi as it relates to the ordering and assembly process. The process is easy and just like Subway you can design your own meal or select from one of the standard items on the menu. The quality of the product is quite good - the tuna looked exceptionally fresh during my visit so that's what I had. Outside of their menu items, you can design your own roll by selecting your preferred wrap, rice, three veggies, one protein and any sauce/topping you want (some toppings cost extra). The staff was very friendly and even shared some upcoming possible changes that may be happening - Deep fried tempura rolls. Yum! They also offer beer, sake, and Mochi Ice Cream.   The best part is they are open till 10pm, Mon-Sat. This is awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent idea for a new take on going out for sushi. Just as delicious as many of the high end pricey sushi restaurants....and I've been to almost all of them in metro phoenix....and well priced. This will be a hot spot for me  and I'm so happy it's just a bike ride away for me and my friends to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Took a friend here today for her birthday lunch and really enjoyed it. We ordered two of the featured rolls and split them as neither one of us had been here before. The first one we got was the Spicy Tuna. It came with the traditional seaweed wrap and we got white rice in it. We also opted to add the tempura crunch on top. It was very tasty. The second one we got was the Crunch Daddy and I liked it best. It came with the soy wrap and we opted for brown rice inside of it. It also had shrimp tempura, mandarin oranges, jalapeño, spicy mayo, tempura crunch, and chili powder in it. We both agreed that it was the better of the two. We ended up getting the combo that came with a drink and a side of edamame. I will definitely be back as the food was good and the prices fair!"}
{"text":"The kids wanted Five Guys but my husband and I wanted sushi... A bunch of restaurants are all clustered here at the corner of 7th & McDowell so we got to do both! Sushi wasn't bad. Staff was very friendly and helpful, even suggesting alternatives with our choices. The Slammin' Salmon was deelish with cucumber and strawberry. The Spicy Tuna was great with asparagus. Love the concept.  Not sure how quick the line moves when the place is busy but I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of primarily sashimi, not rolls, but have heard good things about this place.  To quote a friend, \"it is Chipotle style, but sushi rolls.\"  They were correct, except I have never been greeted by a friendly staff at Chipotle.  The opposite was true at How Do You Roll, we were greeted with a \"Hello how are you today, is this your first time in?\"  They walked us through all of our options and explained every combo we could make.  They have 6 standard rolls and an option to build your own.  They also have a small selection of alcohol to accompany your decision.  My wife and I had the \"Slammin' Salmon\" and \"3 Alarm Roll\" and were not disappointed.  We also had the calamari salad, which is the same as any other sushi joint in the valley.  I was surprised how impressed I was by the food and counter service.  I will definitely be back.    If you build your own roll on your first visit be prepared for them banging the gong."}
{"text":"This place is great! Tons of options, super clean, and the staff is really friendly! The menu and concept  can be a little overwhelming for the first time customer so the staff is amazing in walking you through everything and explaining. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was told that How Do You Roll was a religious experience and I just had to try it.  So, my wife and I finally made it over there to give it a try.  This place is basically the Subway of sushi...which is a neat concept, but it isn't really much less than going to a regular sushi restaurant where I can be more confident that everything is fresh.  I only say that, because I got sick after eating here. It did taste good though, and maybe it was something else that made me sick...but their menu offerings are very peculiar and unorthodox. And most of the rolls are covered and drenched in extra stuff that is kind of a turn off. Your mileage may vary, I suppose."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The restaurant is functionally similar to chipotle but with Japanese sushi. There is a great variety, from traditional style sushi to more \"modern\" varieties (dying to try beef in my sushi!) can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like it!  Awesome concept. It's literally the subway of sushi. A great option if you want something healthy but don't feel like a sandwich or salad.  There are rolls you can choose from but you can also make your own. First timers like myself need a bit of hand holding through the first order, and I wish the people working there were more enthusiastic and willing to help. They just kind of stare at you a little annoyed that you're taking so long.   Sushi was pretty good. Certainly not the best, not even close, but kind of what I was expecting for this type of establishment.  Parking sucks. It just sucks. Tiny lot and always crowded.  Probably wont go out of my way to come back but it's a good option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"the fun of building your own sushi, without the hassle of cutting those tiny strips of cucumber & then #$%(ing up your roll b/c you don't have a sharp enough knife to cut it! or maybe that's just me?  at any rate, had a great experience with the kiddos & sis tonight. we all got our own rolls made just the way we like them :)  ok amount of veggie options, bummer the miso is made with tuna broth (WTF?). but as I vegan I had no problem finding plenty to fill my belly.  there have already been many comparisons to Chipotle & Subway- yes, it is true!   dinner for all 5 of us, including cucumber salad, seaweed salad & edamame, was about $40!"}
{"text":"So 3 stars about sums it up. The service was good, food was pretty good, and options were plentiful. However, everything does have a 'pre-packaged' feel to it. Now that isn't totally bad, it worked in a pinch. I got the sushi I was looking for but I just don't have an urge to go back. If you're in the area and want some OK sushi, I would say try it. Just keep in mind this wasn't even as good as the sushi booth in my local grocery store."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I've been wanting something like this to open for years, and now it's right around he corner! I'm a huge sushi fan, but I rarely have enough time during the week to stop and get any... Until now! This place is exactly what you'd hope for in a fast food sushi joint- helpful, friendly staff, good variety, good prices, and a clean dining space. I admit the whole make your own thing can be a little intimidating at first, just order one of their features rolls to get yourself started, then take off the training wheels on your next visit. You pick white or brown rice, meats, up to three veggies, and whatever sauces you want. The possibilities are endless! I've eaten enough sushi to know generally what works together, so I've been pretty happy with what I've come up with so far. The rolls are tasty and filling, and their traditional sides are great if you're super hungry. The only complaints I have are that the fish can be a little bland (even the so called 'spicy'), so you pretty much need to add a sauce of some kind. And some slices of fresh jalapeño! The parking lot is also a nightmare during weekday lunch hour, but I still think its worth it."}
{"text":"This place was really good and very affordable. I love that I can make my own roll because I am super picky and they have lots choices too. The place was very clean and service was friendly and fast. I will be back here for sure when I have a craving for sushi."}
{"text":"It is as addicting and tasty as Chipotle - prolly way healthier too ??? I eat here 3 to 4 times a week cause I am addicted.  The Slammin' Salmon is the best!  They have quick service and the employees are all very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sunday afternoon around 5pm, the place was closed. Checked their hours on the door and they were supposed to be open until 9pm...upon further inspection my husband and I realized it was out of business. They didn't have the menu on the wall and the table tops were gone. I had only been here once and it was very overpriced for the amount of food in my opinion but I was going to try it one last time."}
{"text":"My internship isn't far from here, and when I want something that's not quite fast food without having to deal with the trouble of ordering at a real restaurant during the 5:00 o'clock rush and feeling absolutely antisocial. I can order and take the food to go or sit at a booth. It's not the greatest sushi, in fact most of the fish is more like \"fish-paste,\" than prime, fresh cutlets. But when you go to How Do you Roll, you aren't looking for premiere sushi, you want the fast-food equivalent that let's you make your own monstrous sushi-abomination usually for less than $10. I highly recommend the squid salad and seaweed salad; these are much higher quality and cheaper than everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Really didn't want to like this Subway-owned chain...who's ever heard of fast food sushi?  But I had to try.  Granted, I have NOT tried the meat/fish here.  I wouldn't.  But the make your own veggie rolls...OMG.  Finally I can get a roll with tofu, sprouts, and mango in it...or jalapeño, avocado, tofu....or sprouts, spinach, and avocado with sesame on top...you get the picture.  I LOVE vegetarian sushi.  LOVE that I can have it built my way.  LOVE that I don't get charged a fortune for it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor food and the service is equivalent. The rolls fall apart before you can eat them."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for anyone who needs a quick sushi fix that is easy on the wallet. You can basically decide what goes inside of your sushi roll. So a little bit of creativity will be helpful here.   Pick your rice, brown or white. Pick your three veggies. And pick your meat. If you are drawing blank and have no idea, don't worry. They do have a small menu with some roll ideas.   We chose two rolls off of the menu and made one of our own. They all turned out pretty good. You can get sauces on the side. Wasabi and ginger are placed next to the drink fountains.   One idea for improvement would be to get rid of those small packaged soy sauces and have bottled soy sauce on the tables or next to everything else. Those little soy sauce packages are annoying, make a mess, and make you feel like you just got sushi from Smiths or Walmart."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious sushi that is made quickly, in front of me, and the way I want it? YES.  That is all that needs to be said.    There are definitely people who turn their noses up to this place because they believe in the integrity of the sushi-making process, but I do not believe that this restaurant is belittling that process at all.  If you want a piece of artwork by a renowned sushi chef, go to a high-end sushi restaurant.  If you just need your quick sushi fix and only have an hour for lunch on a work day, How Do You Roll? is the place."}
{"text":"Everyone on Yelp is right, this place is great. It's fast, fresh, and affordable. I created a roll filled with everything I like, and so I loved it. I got: white rice, seaweed, spicy salmon, green onion, cucumber, masago, chili oil, and sweet chili's. Since I decide what went in it, I controlled the calories. My sister got one of their bowls. We were both really happy with our orders."}
{"text":"Chipotle meets Sushi.  High quality ingredients, innovative idea, select your own sushi, affordable, and easy! This was definitely a great place for a meal. They keep the menu simple and healthy. You can put everything ranging from fish to strawberries in your Sushi! Your sushi can be made in 90 seconds flat. The ingredients taste fresh and healthy.  I will definitely be coming back in the future; I see them doing extremely well for themselves. It definitely brings a great concept to a competitive fast casual market."}
{"text":"Had originally given this place two stars trying to be nice. But, once Shane commented on my review and SO MANY others insulting people and being rude which is classless i had to change it. I would give it zero if I could. Shane, why would people come, or come back to your establishment when you clearly have no respect for your clients?! Hopefully you catch on that its the people that keeps your lights on not the feeling you get when you trash our reviews. How about taking some tips and clues so many Yelpers have left you and improve on your business model?"}
{"text":"Great concept and friendly staff. Food was fresh and combinations are endless.  makes it a nice light and cheap lunch. I cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Build your own sushi roll? YES PLEASE! It is so hard to find a sushi place for a vegetarian that offers variety of rolls. You get tired of the same ol' avocado roll and veggie roll that has boring carrots and cucumber. Bring in the variety!  At How do you Roll you actually can pick exactly what you want in your roll. So if it sucks, that's your own darn fault! I always get the seaweed with brown rice, avocado, cream cheese, jalapeño, and spinach. Sound gross? Oh no no no. It is the most delicious roll I have tasted. Some days I'll switch it up and get asparagus, cream cheese, avocado and tofu. That's yum too!! I just wish I had one near me in Goodyear. :-( I would probably eat there every other day.   They also have delicious variety of drinks like Hibiscus tea, green tea, and your regular sodas and stuff. I cannot rave about this place enough. It's like the Chipotle of sushi!"}
{"text":"Instead of seasoned sushi chefs I have been accustomed to, I just got my sushi rolled by a college student. And I liked it.  We had a Groupon for How Do You Roll so we decided to check it out.  The atmosphere is very much a fast food environment, but it's clean and bright. The staff is perky and helpful.  You can create your own rolls, which can be overwhelming or you can choose from some of their specialty rolls. I chose the 2 specialty rolls, one vegan and one vegetarian. Even if you pick a specialty roll they are still customizable and you can substitute, eliminate, or add an ingredient. (One of my rolls came with soy paper instead of seaweed- who would want to lose that salty seaweed wrapper? I asked for seaweed instead.) For drinks, I chose a beer that I picked purely for novelty. The bottle was shaped like a Buddha! I nearly died. We also ordered some miso soup. (I was informed that the soup wasn't vegetarian- it had a seafood broth. I appreciated the heads up but I didn't mind the broth.) My husband had a custom roll with tempura shrimp. We both substituted brown rice for white rice in our rolls.  The servings of the sushi were huge! And the sushi itself was tasty. Not gourmet by any means but decent.   I also love how you can stay on track with your diet. Substituting brown rice and customizing your rolls with healthy fillings keep your rolls under 300 cals. Add some miso soup (only $1) or a side salad and you have a guilt free meal.  How Do You Roll is a very cute concept. I recommend it for a lunch break or a very casual date."}
{"text":"I am actually surprised that this place has gotten so many four and five star reviews. This was okay for on-the-go sushi, but I felt that for the quality it was overpriced. I would much rather have great than sub-par sushi.  We went on a Friday night and ordered a Philly roll, the 3 Alarm roll, and a custom roll, plus a serving of edamame. For all the rolls, they use pre-shaped rice sheets that are a bit dry and chewy. This just made eating the sushi pieces more of a workout for the mouth than it probably should be.  The Philly roll was alright; it was made with salmon, cream cheese, cucumber, and, surprisingly, avocado. This was actually the best tasting out of the three rolls we bought, even though there was nothing special about it. My boyfriend ate the 3 Alarm roll and said he was disappointed with lack of spice in a supposedly spicy roll.  I'm not sure I would try this place again since we could easily get better quality sushi at cheaper prices during happy hour elsewhere."}
{"text":"I mean, I knew what I was getting in to... and I had even heard from others to pass on this place. But I decided to give it a try anyway.   Now, I'm hardly a sushi snob, but honestly this is pretty easily the worst sushi I've ever had. Nothing about this place is quality. The rice was super dry, along with the chicken that I tried. I even got spicy mayo and chili sauce all over my sushi and it was still almost flavorless.   The chop sticks here, oh my... I literally don't think you could buy cheaper chop sticks. Almost paper thin, I could snap them in half so easily. Plus, they were not smooth at all. Splinters ALL over them. The cups, the lids, everything just screams \"cheapest product we could buy\" here.   All in all, I actually did want to like this place. But I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"My daughter was in the hospital and everyday all she wanted was sushi! I am not very familiar with Phoenix or good sushi restaurants so I went to my phone for help. This restaurant was on the way to the hospital so I thought I would give it a try. It wasn't quite what I expected. Kind of like a sushi \"subway\" restaurant.  I ordered a shrimp tempura roll and a salmon roll. I am going to have to agree with Marc that it is a step above grocery store sushi.  The service was eh and the food was ok....But probably not somewhere I would go back to."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting family in AZ and decided to try this place on a whim (we were headed someplace else but went here instead).  The food was quite good and tasted fresh.  I dig the concept and wish we had one in DC!    I will say that the staff was kind of odd..not bad, but maybe just slightly awkward.  But there were other staff members in the restaurant at the time who were quite friendly.    We'd definitely come here again when we're back in the area."}
{"text":"The creator of this concept is a genius!  The Chipotle of sushi.  How did it take someone so long to come up with this idea?  After all, up until sushi became a trendy delicacy in the late 20th century, it was actually japanese fast food.  To navigate through its menu, just think Chipotle.  You pick your wrap (seaweed or soy) and rice (brown or white).  Then pick up to three veggies, your protein, then sauces and toppings.  The prices change based on your selection, but for about $6 to $8, you'll walk away with a pretty generous sized roll.  If you don't know what combinations work best, there's a small selection of \"signature\" rolls they'll put together for you.  I made a spicy tuna roll with brown rice, jalapeño, avocado and chili sauce.  Good and hot!  The food itself is decent.  I would rate the quality of How Do You Roll as a couple of steps above a high-end grocery store sushi bar (Whole Foods, AJ's, Fry's Signature, etc).  But, it's not even close to as good as any of the trendy sushi spots in the valley.  It's not cheap.  But considering it's fresh fish, it's not expensive.  If you're looking for a big calorie busting meal, there's just about every other fast food option within 10 minutes of How Do You Roll.  If you're looking for something that's of a higher quality, and can be served in very healthy style (as long as you avoid the mayo based sauces), then roll with it!"}
{"text":"I've been anxious to try this place out and Groupon just so happen to have a deal that I purchased - PERFECT. My friend and I tried this place for lunch today and while I like the idea of customized sushi rolls, there are some things that they can work on. I didn't like the fact that they compare their establishment to Subway. Why? I understand the concept is similar to Subway, but ugh Subway is gross. Maybe Chipotle but not Subway. Anway, I tried the Spicy tuna roll and it was okay but not great. The Miso soup was good as well as the Edamame. The trays that they place the food on was very sticky and not so clean.   Parking is HORRIBLE, which I was well aware of since I frequent the Chipotle next door. So, beware of not being able to find a parking space if you're in a rush for lunch.  Prices are very reasonable, so that is a huge plus. So, you're definitely getting your money worth because the sushi rolls are huge. Overall, it's a nice concept but it needs a little bit of work."}
{"text":"One of the few spots I can take my hubby (who hates Sushi restaurants) and we can both enjoy a meal. He can get his made exactly how he wants it and I can do the same. I don't think I've built the same roll twice in the times I've gone there. The veggies are fresh and the seafood is pretty good too, especially for being in the middle of the desert. They've got both seaweed and soy wraps, which is great. They also make the rolls wrap side out, instead of the traditional rice out way of sushi.  The parking situation is awful. There is never enough spaces and I've circled the lot for up to ten minutes waiting for a spot. Great news is that they deliver now so you can avoid to horrific parking. I also love ordering ahead of time online so I can skip the line and enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"My first time and the sushi is actually pretty good!  I will be back!  I wish there was one of these here in Mesa"}
{"text":"I went here in October (sorry for the late review!). I can be a pain when it comes to my sushi order, because I don't like roe, or the california roll stuffing thats pretty standard for many different rolls.  I ordered an avacado roll, cucumber roll, rainbow roll, and I asked if they had sweet potato or yam and they said they did (on the phone). We got this all take out, the service was friendly, but it was pretty busy, so not super fast, which is to be expected.  I got the two veggie rolls, they did not have sweet potato at all, and the cost to make a rainbow roll would have been around $30 or more so I didn't get it.   All of the roll fillings are a la carte, so the more you want, the more expensive it gets. Sadly, the rice was also so overdone it was more like a paste, and had way too much rice vinegar. I could barely eat two rolls before it was just too much for me to handle. The rolls were gigantic though. My eyes were bigger than my stomach, which sucks because sushi does not keep well.   By the way, if you ever come across a place that serves sweet potato rolls, esp tempura ones, get them. They are absolutely amazing. I've only found them in Vancouver, BC."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots - good, everyday sushi at a decent price. Go during happy hour, 2 to 5 for their best deal. I go at least once a week to get my sushi fix. I like making my own roll selections though I have tried the menu items. It's very nice that they don't charge extra for brown rice. It's not gourmet sushi but it is good and if you want sushi as often as I do, this is a great place to get it."}
{"text":"While the service was nice and prompt, I was not impressed by the quality of the California sushi roll that I had at this restaurant. It tasted lukewarm and was not up to standards especially for the price they are selling them at. I could not even finish my roll and had to throw it away. I am an avid eater of sushi, so I know how it should taste. I think this is a very neat idea and I liked the feel of the restaurant, but I think I will stick with regular sushi bars.  I will give it three stars for good service."}
{"text":"Refreshing new concept for our fine city.  Quick, affordable and high quality product to go with some very friendly/helpful service.  Vibe of restaurant is very \"hip\" and clean.  Rear patio area is a great place to people watch.  Nice to leave a fast casual restaurant without feeling guilty.  Will be back next time in am in the area."}
{"text":"It really is like the Subway of sushi here!  You go to the counter, order your wrapping (Seaweed or soy), and customize vegetables, meats, spices, and sauces before it's wrapped, and then cut in their special multi-cutting machine.  For sides, they offer selections such as miso soup or edamame, and you can make it a combo with side and drink for a little over $2.  They also offer a selection of non custom rolls for those don't feel like making their own.  I got a salmon roll (They offer spicy, smoked, and regular raw versions here) with asparagus, green onion, and avocado.  It was a huge portion, and I was definitely full after just 1 roll.  I upgraded by getting a combo, and the miso soup was light, and not too salty.  The quality of the roll itself: decent.  The rice was a little mushy, but the veggies and salmon tasted OK.  My friend had the 3 alarm roll, and it looked out of this world good!  It was topped with so much sauce and spicy ingredients that she could only finish about half of it.    Parking can be very difficult if you come here around lunchtime.  I had to circle around the block twice before luck was on my side and a spot opened up.    Service was very friendly, and they were very patient as they explained the concept of the restaurant to me since I was a neophyte here.    I'd probably go here again to try out another roll, but probably at a less busy time.  It's a cool concept to create your own roll, for a pretty reasonable price."}
{"text":"As someone who loves sushi rice, but not the raw fish that usually accompanies it, this place is perfect. When we came in, the manager described it as the Chipotle of sushi, and with the affordable prices of PeiWei. While I thought it was kind of strange to describe this place in terms of nearby restaurants, it really is an accurate description.    The rolls are a decent size and quite filling. I'm a big guy but two rolls filled me up easily.  I got a brown rice, mango, cucumber, and asparagus roll, and a white rice, avocado, spinach, and tofu skin roll. Both were delicious and only $4 each for 10 pieces.    This place is my new favorite place in all of Phoenix. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was my first time in this place. When I entered the door, I was exited. The concept is great, I can choose the filling of my sushi. I can choose whether I want in bowl or in rolls. I can choose the sauce, topping, and others. The price is average. I would like to go back and recommended this place for everybody to try and eat in here."}
{"text":"I went yesterday. Have to say this place has the worst food ever!! When asked about a refund they stated they do lot do refunds. The roll was a typical Philly, not sure how hard that is. They have us credit however there is nothing at this place I would eat. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix about a month ago and was dying for some sushi, I didn't even care from where! Boy I was lucky to find this place. It's like a Subway... but sushi. Choose from a soy or seaweed wrap, pick brown or white rice, and decide on your fillins'. It's nothing hardcore or odd either, which can be nice... you know exactly what you're getting in your roll. My favorite is the Philly roll w/ the smoked salmon. It's quick, it's easy, it's relatively cheap. The restaurant is cute to eat in or outside is a little patio. Staff is very friendly and the place is typically clean (thank you!!!!) I would definitely recommend it to friends and coworkers. I go there about once a week for lunch. I'd be super excited if there was a lunch special that included miso or edamame for the same price as one roll, but it's whatever... and I'll still go back, so really they win. But go ahead and try it, it's nice for a quick sushi run to satisfy that craving."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, its like a chipotle but for sushi.  I would give this place a 2.5, there weren't a lot of variety to \"make\" your sushi compared to the restaurants that you order from the menus. I think to enjoy this place you should really know what goes well in a sushi roll. Mine came out to be not as flavorful as I would have liked while a friend's came out really well. I guess it all depends on what you put into your sushi roll. I also ordered the California roll, all it had was imitation crab stick, cucumbers, and avocado. Don't order it. It was very plain! I've had better California rolls...  Another negative thing that stood out was what they called \"tempura\" which you could top if off on your sushi roll, it looked like rice krispies and it tasted like rice krispies. Avoid using that as your topping."}
{"text":"I passed this place so many times that I finally decided to stop by with some co-workers. I can believe how overprized this place is...a co-worker ordered a 10 piece roll and a drink and was charged $17!! I paid $19 dollars!! WTF!! I didnt even get a drink and she did!!! Fuck this place first and last time!! The roll fell apart before I even picked it up..NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I didn't even get to eat. Lady acted like she was in drugs. She saw me taking my time and she totally walked away saying this isn't worth my time. Idk id she had a bad day or something but I walked right out and don't really care for it that much. There's plenty of sushi places out there"}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about this place! I was so excited when a friend found this restaurant, as we had been looking for a great casual sushi place. Every roll is always fresh, large, and delicious. They offer meats such as chicken, for guests who don't like fish in their rolls. They also offer a frequent buyer program where you get free sushi after 10 purchases! I love HDYR, and come here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"The concept is interesting, its like subway but with Sushi. I think I will go back again. You can call your order in also which is great when your on your lunch break"}
{"text":"Don't go there for the ambiance or for a luxurious experience (because it has neither), but go there for the cheap sushi, fully customizable menu, and decent presentation. The concept itself is cool and it's well-executed. Not exactly a place I'd take my date to, but if you want a quick fix, this would be the place to go to."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I wasn't sure how our visit would turn out bc several reviews said that they didn't have anything that they liked. Very strange bc you build your own roll. They do not offer tempura rolls which is my favorite but we found lots of good combinations that we all ended up loving and wishing that there was a place like this where we lived. The miso soup was great too. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Please keep this place alive. Quick, easy, delicious - it's the American way."}
{"text":"So.....my wife saw this place on \"Shark Tank\" and she wanted to try it.  She is a picky eater and usually will not eat sushi or anything like that (she is pretty much anti fish stuff).  She read that they will make a roll with chicken in it so we decided to come here after my burger.  I was pretty full from my burger but I asked myself, \"Tim...when are you ever going to eat sushi in Phoenix again\"?  I answered myself, \"Probably never\".  Might as well order a roll. This place is like an assembly line of sushi ordering.  You tell them what you want in it, they put it in, roll it, cut it up and serve it to you.  Very fast and efficient.   So here is what I got................  I went with a seaweed wrapper with white rice.  To that I added avocado, green onion, jalapeno and shrimp.  They will usually drizzle a sauce on top but I decided to get mine on the side in a cup.  I went with the sweet chili sauce.  My wife got seaweed wrapper, white rice, cucumber, avocado and chicken.  She got hers drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  Total for 2 rolls was just over $13.00.  My roll was very good!  I'm not a big sushi fan and if I eat it, I will usually puss out and get California rolls and stuff like that.  My combo of shrimp, avocado, green onion and jalapeno was a winner though.  The avocado made it creamy, the green onion made it fresh, the jalapeno made it spicy, the shrimp made it cool and the sweet chili sauce made it hot.  I don't know if I could have picked a better combo for my things.  My wife absolutely loved hers.  It was exactly what she expected and she says it was a 5 star joint in her book.  Service was friendly and efficient!  I would definitely go back again if they ever made one in San Diego."}
{"text":"What a great new concept!  I love how you can create your own sushi roll.  You start by selecting brown or white rice, seaweed or soy paper then veggies, meat/fish and top it with your choice of sauce(s).  If you aren't creative they have some menu items already created for you.  And, to also note, if you aren't a fish fan, they have chicken and beef as well.  Each roll comes with 10 pieces, so portions are big.  The food is fresh and it was a blast to create my own roll. I will definitely go back!!!  Well done!"}
{"text":"The concept is great, basically a design your own sushi roll. There are a lot of options, and the prices are relatively friendly. If you want to add a lot in your roll, that's when the price of the roll can get high. However, all the ingredients are extremely fresh and the size of the roll itself is suitable for a light meal!  I had a brown rice seaweed roll with salmon, asparagus, mango, and cucumber. The sesame seeds on top added the crunch that I like, and the fresh ingredients made for a delicious combination. It's definitely not authentic or extremely high quality, but it's satisfactory and balanced. After sampling my familys' rolls, I found that the tuna is also very fresh. They also have a large variety of sauces and toppings so you can really customize the flavor and texture of the roll that you want!"}
{"text":"We eat here occasionally and the experience is consistent and mediocre. More Arby's than Subway, because the ingredients are uninspiring. Nor is it a great value in that it is only slightly less expensive than real sushi. All that said, it is convenient fast and strangely satisfying"}
{"text":"We placed a large order for lunch today and they gave us no chop sticks, no ginger, and believe it or not, no wasabi!!! The sushi was warm, it had very little flavor and some of us actually spit it out after one bite and threw the rest away. There are much better options for sushi in the area, unless they step up their game this place might make you sick."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this place does not have AMAZING sushi BUT they do have good sushi that is cheap, convenient and has a kitschy set up. The BF works right across the street from this place and he has brought the sushi home a couple times. I like that I can have a choice in what I have in my sushi including brown rice and many different veggies that are fairly fresh. I can't speak for the fish, as I don't eat fish, but I have had a roll from here with chicken in it and it was kind of bland...not worth the extra money. Although the sushi is just ok, I like that it is fast and inexpensive and the rolls they give you are large and plenty big enough for a meal. I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"For $7.05, I got a brown rice, mango, avocado, jalapeno and spicy salmon sushi rolled in seaweed and topped with creamy miso sauce, sesame seeds n chili powder.  Quality was ok--- the fruits were canned and the fish wasn't top notch, but the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Always look forward to this place when I travel to Phoenix.  Custom sushi. Good service. Love it! Wish we had one in Cali"}
{"text":"The fish that they use is pretty decent.  It's not the freshest, but for the price it's definitely not bad.  I love the concept of this place, and the staff is really pleasant and patient.  What was a big selling point for me was all of the gluten free options.  Their menu is clearly labeled, and all of the soy sauce is gluten free as well.  The person behind the counter also was sure to verify any ingredients that he wasn't sure of instead of simply guessing.  I was very impressed.  And the total for my hubby and I?  under $20."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty sushi in Central Phoenix?  I'm so in love!    Love, love, love the concept!  After seeing this place posted in \"Hot New Places\" on Yelp, some friends and I went for lunch today.  The owner (it's a franchise that started in Austin) greeted us outside and was very personable.  You can pick your rice, wrapping, 3 veggies/cream cheese and a meat, and you get 10 PIECES OF SUSHI all for about $7-8.  They also have all kinds of sauces you can add for free!  I had white rice with seaweed wrapping, asparagus, avocado, mango and spicy tuna, with unagi sauce on the side.  Delish!  Loved it!  I also had the cucumber salad, which was also really really good!  My only disappointment was the miso soup, which didn't really seem to have any flavor -- it was weird.  Other than that, the food was great!    I also love that they are rebuilding that area!  Once they get done with the construction on the other side of McDowell, that will be great little go-to spot!  Dinner at How Do You Roll and drinks at Sidebar! :)  Woot woot!"}
{"text":"I will agree that this is a great alternative to other types of fast food eating out places but it is a little pricy.  If you ask for soy paper, its $1.00 extra, ask for an additional piece of fish in your roll, $2.50 - $4.00 additional (on top of the menu price).  Went there today and spent $24.00 on two rolls with no drink just a cup for water.  If your going to spend this much, might as well do something with a dine in enviroment like Fez or Bliss Rebar!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, wish I had one near me in LA!  Like others have said  it's like a Subway/Chipotle for sushi. Is this the place to go if you are looking for a sexy sushi date or to have some crazy, culinary experience? Probably not. If you are looking for tasty, fresh, fast and reasonably priced sushi this is a great place to come.  Love that they offer brown rice for no additional charge. Also love that they don't charge extra for avocado. I was just wanting a simple spicy tuna roll, got it with brown rice, avocado, cucumber and those little green plants. Took the employee's suggestion to drizzles a little of the spicy sauce on top. (Don't remember what it's called, it's that chipotle mayonnaise stuff, I think.)  Loved that I could help myself to ponzu and ginger.  The roll was really big, I think it was like 8 or 10 pieces. I got that with some edamame and I was good to go.  Will definitely come back when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"The Subway of SUSHI! That pretty much says it all.  And its just as fast!  PICK YOUR + Wrap: Seaweed or Soy + Rice: White or Brown  + Veggies: Avocado, Cucumber, Asparagus, Tamago (Egg), Sprouts, the list goes on + Meats: Beef, Chicken (I know crazy huh) Salmon, Smoked Salmon, Tuna, Ebi (Shrimp), Unagi, the list goes on  If you are lazy to customize your roll, you can hand pick from a fixed menu, not as many though.  Another option is to turn it into a bowl instead of a roll! Hey that rhymed! Just as delicious! An average meal will run you about $9.  They do have a condiments area where you can self pour a small cup of soy sauce and unlimited ginger and wasabi.  Go nuts I say! :P"}
{"text":"So after coming here for a couple years now, I have to say in disappointed in them.  First off, the area where they put the ginger, wasabi, etcetera is disgusting. Never been cleaned type of disgusting. It was 1130am, they open at 11, so you know it was from not being cleaned at all. This wasn't one occasion either. I had to visit my Uncle at the VA everyday and this was my lunch spot. It never looked clean.  Secondly, their kids meals are disgusting. My son loves sushi, not so much the kids meal. The rice is stale and absolutely different and gross tasting. He likes salmon on his roll, when I asked the charge they told me 0.75 extra, but they charged me for a full add (2.50). Since they only gave me half of the normal serving (since the roll is half the size), but charged me full, I asked for them to add the other piece to the side, which they refused! They made such a huge condition about it that it was embarrassing.  Thirdly, their employees that have been there are fantastic. The new ones are pretty horrible. All my bad experiences are with the new group. Every single time I've been in has had some bad customer service related experience.  If they cleaned it back up, made fresh kids sushi, and replaced those newbies, I'd love to continue to go."}
{"text":"Get This.  My boyfriend and I passed by How Do You Roll? And oooh. Shark Tank.... after a massive dinner of insane Mexican Food.  We were stuffed but since I'm from CA and was leaving AZ the next day...I had to. I Just Had To.   It was like a Chipotle of Sushi..or a Subway of Sushi....  I was excited about the concept. It was indeed one of a kind.  You pick your wrap... and they slap on white or brown rice...which was already pre-made and square.... put in your fillings...pick your meat.. cooked or raw... pick a sauce..and off it goes to the sushi roll cutter...pick more sauce..and then toppings... and WHALA... your SUSHI ROLL is SERVED....  I don't know...it's like settling for something and losing the authenticity and the art of making real sushi...  The raw fish cuts were a bit on the smaller side..   They only have the common raw fishes.. No Uni.. no Toro... You can't have Raw rish to be topped on your maki.  I dunno.. It was a good experience for me.. and that was that... nothing more."}
