{"text":"Decent food. Overpriced and I found the staff to be very rude. The lady with three teeth it works the register is especially nasty.  i've seen them drop dirty dish towels on sandwiches and they don't really wear gloves. That being said the turkey chili is good. If you want great deli food just go across the street to Al's deli - it's amazing."}
{"text":"The real deal in downtown Cleveland.  Good sandwiches, quesadillas and fries, fast and friendly people, good prices.  What more could you want for lunch?  Rock and Roll!"}
{"text":"David's food is of high quality and always fresh & delicious!  David's family has been in the restaurant business a long time and he really knows what he is doing.  He goes out of his way to make his customers happy!  I highly recommend him.  He catered my wedding and did an amazing job.  Everyone loved the food and he was extremely professional."}
{"text":"Food is great. Both breakfast and sandwiches. However the cook is extra rude. The african american guy to be exact. The only way i can describe him since i didnt care to further ask him anything. He has a nasty smartmouth attitude everytime i have been there. Who knows if he miserable with his job or life in general but he should definitely be doing something else. I expressed the dissatisfaction just for the cashier to try to inform me \"oh hes new im sorry\"... Not that that should even matter but i responded with a \"no mam he most definitely is not new because he had that same funky little attitude when i was here a few weeks ago but thank you. She was very friendly but i would have to rate it bad service good food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, the Stromboli was good. Several good selections to choose from. Staff is friendly. Plenty of seating. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to David's deli.  It's located on the corner of 12th and Superior in the Eaton Center building.  It's a little hard to find the actual entrance which is either through the building or on E 12th.  Great little place for a sandwich or a bagel for breakfast.  This morning I had the everything bagel toasted with cream cheese.  The bagel was very good, which is surprising because it's tough to find a good bagel in Cleveland.  The woman behind the counter was very friendly and they can accommodate any kind of special order you may have (I added tomatoes and onions to it)  Atmosphere is nothing great, but I took it to go.  Prices are reasonable and they have free wifi.  The baked goods look delicious, but I didn't have any."}
{"text":"Stopped by David's Deli for lunch recently and had the salad bar along with a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. Mimoza, the owner, was very friendly during my visit. The salad bar is excellent - she even has sliced green olives, which I like on my salad, but can never find.  There were lots of salad dressing options. I found a new favorite lunch spot that is closer to my office than other options. The broccoli cheddar soup was yummy.   I will be back to try some sandwiches!  Recommend!"}
