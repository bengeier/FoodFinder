{"text":"I have been to Thai House several times as there isn't any other Thai options in the area.  Every time I've been here, I've been disappointed and last night was my last visit.  

This was my first time ordering Sashimi here.  We had a party of 8. We arrived at 8:00 pm and an hour in, I still haven't received my food.  The rest of the table already got their food and was nearly done.  I asked several times and they just kept telling me its coming or tried to avoid me.  I went up to the counter to see what was going on and they told me they're still making it - this is Sashimi..it's raw fish - all they have to do is cut it for me.  I didn't even end up eating there because of the delay. I asked for the order to go since the rest of our group was about done.  

Our waitress walks up to me a little later and apologizes.  She hands me something saying they took care of me.  I look at what it is and it's actually the bill....for the whole table.  Apparently how they took care of me was to discount the bill $12 ....for the whole bill, not just mine.  We also wanted the bill split instead of a whole bill for the table - they never asked.  We had to mark off what we ordered and they went off to split the bill.  After about 15 mins they come back and hand me my bill.  There was no discount.  I asked and they took off the drinks I ordered.  I asked what happened to the $12 they took off originally and she tells me it was applied to the group bill...so we all got $1.50 or so off apparently.  

I would have for forgiven all this if the sashimi was half decent.  It was not, the sashimi was horrible.  The fish wasn't fresh and I think they quick thawed some froze fish.  It was warm and tasted weird.  

Food and service was horrible.  I've also have had the Thai food here and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Was just passing through on our way to Gulf Shores and New Orleans... yelped this place rather than do a road side chain. (I like to try local food when I'm on a trip.) I totally enjoyed my Pad Thai with pork. Super hot, just the way I like it too. Perfect time of year to get the mango & sticky rice. So save room. 

Only issue was the waitress disapeared on us. Might need more help and y'all get that last star."}
{"text":"I was immediately impressed with the decor. It felt as close to Thailand as I've ever been...I think. I love Thai food and was  excited about finding a new, highly reviewed restaurant within my work area. Pad Kee Mao is my \"gold standard\" for Thai food. As usual it was ordered with pork and extra spicy. Very quickly my food arrived, I was shocked to see a deep red sauce on this dish. While I knew this was not typical, I was willing to try it. I would like to say I was pleasantly surprised, but quite the opposite, it tasted exactly as it appeared, sweet-and-sour sauce from a cheap Chinese buffet. While I could see quite a few red pepper flakes in the dish, they were completely overwhelmed by the sickly sweet sauce. I can only guess the folks that are happy with the food from Thai House have never had good Thai food."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from the LA area I was anxious to see if Gastonia had a decent Thai restaurant and was itching to give this place a go. I tried the Pad Thai and, while okay, was nothing overly great or \"hot\" like I requested. I've had much, much better (and hotter) Pad Thai but the Thai Iced Coffee was delicious and the atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"When we lived in this area, we loved to stop here and eat. It is a very nice atmosphere and very clean. Beautiful hand-carved wood throughout with both a casual area and a formal area to eat in. We always had friendly service. We love to order Duck dishes here, Delicious. I would order the curried duck and my wife would order a less spicy duck entrée. Seaweed salad was another favorite. There is another one of these in Charlotte also, owned by the same people. Chopsticks or silverware, your choice. Give them a try. Happy Eating."}
{"text":"Great service, but food was blah. The knockout rolls were chewy, the Tom Kha soup tasted like salt water, and the Pad Thai sauce was completely absent of peanut flavor."}
{"text":"I'm only in town a couple of times a year, but I always make sure to go here at least twice when I am. Best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  I always get the Namprigpaow with Beef and #3 on the hotness!  Love it!  The soup that the bring out is great too.  The wait staff is always good, your glass never goes empty here. 
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and always wonderful service! They go above and beyond to be sure my gluten free needs are met."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai and Jasmine iced tea."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the quality of the food is very inconsistent.  I ordered steamed pot stickers and out came an item that looked identical to a crap ragoon except it was filled with spinach and chicken.  Another time myself and a date order an item.  We were brought a dish that was not even close to the menu description.  After discussing it a few minutes we called the wait staff over and they apologized and returned with the correct item.  

Most recently I ordered pad thai with a spice level of 1.  The dish was brought out and it looked rather soupy.  The server said \"next time get more spice and it will not be so sweet.\"  I thought it odd that she was making excuses for what she was bringing me.  Being not one to complain, I took a few bites and stopped.  If it doesn't look like pad thai, smell like pad thai or taste like pad thai, then it is not pad thai.  I called the server over and told her this was not similar to the dish I was accustomed to getting.  She said that \"it was tomato based and asked if I wanted 'authentic\" pad thai?'\"  I was confused because I had simply ordered pad thai with chicken with 1 on the spicy scale.\"  She readily took the dish back and brought out a second plate of \"authentic\" pad thai.  It looked just as soup and was a little greenish in color.  It tasted basically the same so I just gave up and covered the dish with my napkin.  The server was very pleasant about it but when they took the food away it was obvious it had not been touched and I wasn't offered to be comped so I just paid and left.  

I see all of the positive reviews here which confuses me because as I said early there is no consistency at all.  I think at times they serve what they want and realize the clientele won't know the difference. This is the only thai restaurant in town and the others are easily 30 miles away.  Months ago I had pad thai there that was good.

I doubt I will be back.  I have given them many chances and it is too expensive to  be disappointed in what is supposed to be a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month, and both times I wasn't impressed - and I'm honestly not the overly picky type.

My boyfriend and I ordered two separate dishes, but they were served with the same sauce/flavor - it wasn't what was advertised.  They used different vegetables than what the menu stated also.  

This was the first time I had a red/spicy sauce with Pad See-Ewe instead of a soy/brown sauce.  I didn't enjoy it.  The second time I was there I ordered yellow curry, but it tasted watered down and didn't have a lot of flavor to it.

If you have children, be warned that the kid meals come with a cheap juice bottle like you'd get at a convenience store.  I ordered water for my son instead.  

They also seem to be inconsistent.  Both times I was there, it was for dinner, and I ordered similar dinner items.  The first time we were given soup with our meal.  The second time they seemed to rush us, and didn't offer soup.  

I'm a big fan of Thai food in general, but out of all of the restaurants I've been to in the area (including Charlotte/Concord) - this is hands down the lowest on the list."}
{"text":"The Thai food is wonderful and their sushi is phenomenal.  Very creative and a wide variety of flavors.   I no longer live in Gastonia, but I drive back just for their sushi.  They have an amazingly polite staff, and quiet laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, & friendly people to top it off.  Waitress introduced use to the owner and her husband, who took the time to stop and talk even though they looked busy.  Food was honestly the best part of the visit, the friendly people & great customer service was just the cherry on the top."}
{"text":"Its a little over the top in decoration. I have had better sushi and thai in small less dressy places in the area."}
{"text":"The green curry and chili curry dishes were delectable. Thai House also had nice touches with the serene decor, prompt and cheery service, as well as attention to detail with little knotted staircase patterns on the drinking straws. The girlfriend and I agreed it was nice for date night."}
{"text":"Time: 3:00pm 
Me and my husband stopped by Thai House for lunch 10/14/17.... Lunch crowd was over already. Waitress was attentive but when we got our food....half of my stir fry noodle plate was hot and half was cold...then the spring rolls came out...one was hot and the other was cold. Therefore, I called the waitress to come over. She said she will take care of it. Comes back less then 5min later...ok, I thought they made me another a new plate. Came to find out it still has the hot pepper flakes and Sambal chili paste I put in in the first place....looked like they dumped my old/cold food onto a new clean plate. Took a bite of one piece of broccoli of 3 pieces...it was still cold...called waitress again, now she is frustrated. She took the food back to the kitchen...came back with the same food less one broccoli I ate earlier. Finally, waitress comes back for the third time...took my food back to the kitchen. Finally, food was hotter then earlier....I just gave up hope for these people. See, when you're in the restaurant business that's not how you serve customers. When you bring out cold food...you need to fix them a new hot plate, instead of microwaving their old food. I've eaten here before and never had this problem...expected the same quality from them. This was the WORST experience I've had. It tells me how much they care about customer service."}
{"text":"I was in the area to check out the planetarium and ran into this place. What luck! The restaurant is really nice with great service. Also, I really liked my dish. When it comes to Thai food, I usually get my usual faves but decided to venture out this time. I got the duck namprigpao. Yum!!! I'm gonna have to add this to my fave list."}
{"text":"Great Red Curry Chicken and Pad Thai, but evening prices are much more than lunch, with no added benefit.  No spring rolls or soup included.  Good, upscale atmosphere but poor value.  I prefer Thai Taste or Monsoon Thai in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Beyond Solid. Great Pad Woon Sen and lucky to find a Thai restaurant in Charlotte that has that. The hubs ADORES the basil chicken. It's some really great food. Not much on the menu you can go wrong with..."}
{"text":"I am not a Thai connoisseur, but eat lunch here regularly, occasionally dinner.  Food has been consistently good. My lunch favorite is the chicken curry (red or green), but I always ask for very mild spice.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, service is very good. Nice to not have to drive to Charlotte for  good Thai food."}
{"text":"wow.   what a surprise to find this place via a colleague.    very good menu selection and great service.   definitely will be back to explore more of the menu.  This had to be some of the best Thai food I have found in a long time."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was not very good. Almost sweet like it had ketchup in it. It lacked the smokiness of a good hot wok. Sent it back and had it taken off of Bill. Others in my party had red curry with tofu which they said was ok but nothing to write a review about. Curry powder was more sludge like than well blended in the coconut milk. 
Maybe they are catering to a crowd that has never had real Thai before?"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing special. I have had much better thai good at another Thai restaurant in area."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a green curry chicken and I believe it's kind of nice Thailand food, though it's not my favorite. I ordered a Pad Three King, and it's ok but not amazing. The pho ordered by my mother-in-law is horrible. Never tried it here, please. It's not a pho at all!!! Maybe it's not clever to order a pho in a Thailand restaurant, but I still have to say the pho is the worst one I've ever had in USA."}
{"text":"Very delicious thai food, one of my favorite Thai restaurant. The vegetable soup with tofu is my favorite. I've tried to ask if they can make red curry duck but they couldn't but no biggie. So I've decided on the beef salad."}
{"text":"My first time having Thai food and it was wonderful!  The atmosphere was beautiful and the staff was great.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp did it again! Our meal was one of the best we have ever had in a Thai Restaurant. The atmosphere was beautiful and romantic, and the wait staff were friendly and above par. We will return again and again"}
{"text":"Bland Food, Rude Hostess, Rude Waitress.

The food was particularly bland, very unusual for Thai food.  I'm not sure if an assumption was made that we are unaccustomed to eating Thai food, so it was \"dumbed down,\" but it was as if the basic ingredients had been thrown together without the spices that make Thai cuisine so incredibly unique and transcendent.

Our hostess was immediately rude and off-putting.  I certainly had the impression that we were a bother to her, that whatever was on her phone a moment prior was infinitely more interesting and of higher priority.  It was a bad start, and I should've taken her flippant approach to her job as a sign to leave before being seated; nevertheless, we were seated, and on a weeknight in which the restaurant seemed to be at maybe 15% capacity, we waited a very very long time for our waitress to arrive.

When she sauntered over, there was no greeting, no niceties whatsoever, simply asking for our drink orders right away, as if we were already wasting her time.  The food did not take incredibly long to arrive, and its incredibly surprising blandness was perhaps the result of hasty preparation.  I don't know, maybe the whole staff had something better to do that night, and perhaps the general resentment we sensed has some source in bad management.

We waited and waited and waited for our check to come, with the place still at vert low capacity.  I wondered at the paradox of the beautiful interior design of the place, the handcarved wood art adorning it, and the bordering-on-hateful food and service we experienced.

I eat A LOT of Thai food, and one interesting thing I've found is that generally, the less decorated a place is, the better the food is.  This was certainly the case here, in which a nice looking place yielded a terrible experience, all because of the attitude people who run it.  I certainly felt unwelcome."}
{"text":"This place is great. My favorite Thai dish is chicken masaman curry, but I always worry about trying it at different restaurants. Thai House did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The Green Bangkok Roll ROCKS! Love this place. Best sushi! And whatever that orange and green cream sauce is- OMG! yum! yum! Great service, nice atmosphere. Never had the Thai food but my girlfriend loves it. I eat here at least once a week but only for sushi."}
{"text":"Great food. Pretty atmosphere.  Excellent staff that works as a team. Recommend the soft shell crab in curry with potatoes and the Thai Namprigpaow with duck. Tom Kra soup was outstanding!!!!!  Tom yum soup was a bit too sour (too much lime) but it grows on you, spoon by spoon. Too much food to try the sweet sticky rice with mango for dessert. Next time!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Tucked in a rather non-descript location along Highway 74 (Franklin Blvd), this place is a favorite of mine.  Food is great, portions are just right, and the service is very good.  My wife is gluten/dairy free and has no trouble picking from the fresh and healthy menu."}
{"text":"Pretty much just like the other Thai house that is in Pineville. This particular location didn't seem to be on top of their game as far as service goes. Food was a little slow in coming and half of our group was served just about a full 10 minutes before the other half. In all fairness we did have a group of 13 people but they spread us out between two table and only had one server who was a bit overwhelmed it seemed. Beyond all of that the food was decent. I wouldn't particularly recommend this location to anyone who wants great Thai but if you are looking for a quick fix this is a ok spot."}
{"text":"Decided to try this on a weekday. There was a long line waiting when we walked in and there were only two servers! It took forever to get seated then finally someone came over to take our order.
I made the mistake of getting the steamed mussels and they reminded me of why I hate them!!! They were tasteless, rubbery and fishy! A far cry from the great mussels we had at Jia! 
I had the Thai eggplant krapraw under 'delightful dishes'! I had it with beef and it was delicious!!! There were a lot more green peppers and red peppers than I would have liked but the flavor was spot on!
Hubby had the Thai roast chicken. It was splendid!! It had flavor on its own but the sauce it came with was superb!!"}
{"text":"Came to the Thai House with a friend and I will say that we it was close to closing so I won't critique this place so much until I come again. 

The service was great and even though they was closing they treated us very good and didn't rush us. 
We had sushi and it was very average at best and they soda did have much fizz at all. 

I would recommend this place although it wasn't the best I think it has great potential."}
{"text":"Friendly service that everyone works on the floor is smiling and attentive. Despite the lack of competition in the immediate area at least 12 mile radius, they deliver a quality Thai food. This is a Thai restaurant. Sushi is less than average. I have given a 3 star because above average Thai and near button sushi."}
{"text":"The decor was fantastically elaborate. And for as fancy as it was, I was pleasantly surprised by the low prices. $9 for a lunch special, which included soup (brought to us before we even ordered), a spring roll, a large dish, and an orange wedge for desert. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Good service, nice ambience, excellent food and reasonable fans.

Like it a lot and will definitely be back, if in the area."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good. I had the tuna shrimp roll which is nice and crunchy.  I like their tuna nigiri, very fresh!

But my fave is the panang curry.  Such a unique flavor and feels like a healthy dish."}
{"text":"Delicious and well balanced Thai food. The richness of the coconut was well balanced with the heat of the curry."}
{"text":"A very nice, relaxing atmosphere and a friendly staff.  This is a great spot on a Friday or Saturday night if you want a great, relaxing meal without dealing with the lines at the steak restaurants in town.  I really enjoy their Red Curry - it's very good.  I'm so glad we have a good Thai food place in Gastonia."}
{"text":"I do my best to stop at Thai House any time I'm in Gastonia.   Their clear broth soup is the best I've had and I love their spring rolls.  Everything I've tried tastes fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and the ambiance beautiful, dark, and inviting, but with that said, the waitstaff couldn't have been more attentive!  We loved everything about this restaurant. We will be back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Okay, I originally wrote the review saying I wasn't wild about this restaurant; but that was before tonight!!  I decided to give it another chance, and man I was not disappointed!  We had great food, we didn't have to sit at a table that was right beside the kitchen door and the cook was spot on tonight!  I take back anything bad I said about Thai House; after tonight (and one very yummy, gooey plate of sticky rice and mango) I changed my tune!  This is one of the best restaurants in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"My wife & really enjoyed the food here.  We'll definitely be coming back. Who would have thought that a really decent Thai place was in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"This would have been an incredible surprise except for the recommendation of a co-worker.

I should start out by saying I am a Thai food nut, every since I first went to SE asia in late 80s.

This place was authentic and in the heart of Gastonia. Typical decor and ample seating.

I had a som tum salad for starters. Perfect mix of sweet, sour, salt and spice. The portion was huge!!

I followed that by an incredible fragrant and spicy green curry over jasmin rice with pork. It was wonderful to the nose and palate.

The best thing was the service. I should preface this by saying it was 630 pm on a week night, but I had 3 servers alternating. Incredibly friendly and attentive!!

and did I mention cold Singha beer? All this at prices that are easy on the pocket. Another new fave in the area!"}
{"text":"Overall this is a pretty good place. Solid drink menu as well as a full Thai menu with sushi as well. The appetizers and soup was very good. The pad thai and red curry was ok, wasn't the full flavored Thai dishes as we are used to but still pretty good. I'd definitely return here for the sushi though. Solid options and priced well. The staff was very friendly and quick with everything we needed."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my whole Thai House experience - the service was great (although our waitress said thank you more times than I could count!), the appetizer, steamed rolls were delicious and both my friend and I had more food than we could eat for our entree. If you are driving along Wilkinson/Franklin streets between Charlotte and Gastonia and you are hungry for Thai, I would definitely swing by here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. The pad Thai was very good,also fresh rolls! Oh and wow the sticky rice and mango,delish!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best in Gastonia! I would dare say the BEST In Meck county as well! Service was \"excellent\" - C.K. was wonderful she was extremely nice. I was cold when we sat down at our table. With out asking hot soup appeared in front of me! Food was \"WONDERFUL\" & seasoned just right. I had the smoked salmon roll (w/Soy paper) & my son had a huge portion of fried rice. He said it was the best he's had yet & yes He is a picky eater too!! We found our new place for sushi!! Thanks again for making our lunch SO enjoyable before saying bye & sending our youngest back to college.

{"text":"Been here on several occasions and must say I have definitely experienced better Thai food than Thai House.  I agree with a lot of other Yelpers that the service is very good and the atmosphere is pleasant, however I part ways with others when it comes to the food.  The kids plates were bland and sterile, no color and seemed like no flavor either.  My kids who are not picky eaters were not impressed in the slightest and that speaks volumes in my mind.

My wife and I had very similar experience when it came to the food.  Our appetizers, Squid and spring rolls were horrible and by horrible I mean dripping in fried oil with no flavor just greasy fingers and .My wife ordered the red chicken curry and I ordered the green chicken curry.  My expectations were extremely under met, I couldn't taste the \"spicy\" curry and the chicken was meh, whatever. 

I am sorry that I gave this place another chance but I've learned my lesson, Gastonia is not the place for real Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Thai House has an excellent atmosphere matched by outstanding customer service! The food is superb! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Got the pad see ew, it was extremely salty. Asked for a spice level 3 out of 5, it was more like a 1.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Portions are very small.  Paid $22 tonight for an appetizer and Pho noodles and was very disappointed.  Many other Thai food restaurants are much more generous with portions.

SIAM GARDEN THAI  is the best!

!!! Large Pho serving!!!"}
{"text":"The solid Thai place in Gastonia. Heat is less than you expect from a Thai place because they just don't think you're serious unless you have an Asian with you. Yes, I know that sounds weird, but I swear if I get full hot five star with my Asian friends I burn wonderfully. If I come here with my son, I'm asking for the spice tray and laddling on the hot sauce for some kick. I don't get why they do this because it nearly turned me off at first, but it's still good food. 

Everything is good here. My choice this trip was chicken pad woonsen. Spot on as always with a little extra spice added at the table. My son had the pad see-ewe with beef and loved it. In thier defence he is a kid so they probably turned my spice level down for his safety. We added the spring rolls, and really liked them. The tofu goes really well in these and makes the other flavors pop. Add a jasmine iced tea and you have a perfect meal. 

I'm a regular and will be for a long time."}
{"text":"Curry is good, noodle is good, I don't like the sushi here but over all it's a good restaurant. It's cheap and fast and taste good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat out a lot. Been to the Thai House over 30 times and the meal has always been good except for last night. My wife ordered the Thai bbq duck and when the order came out it was misleading. All the was duck was a few slices of breast meet and everything else was chicken. We cook duck several times a year and get duck when we dine out and know that duck does not have white meat and taste like chicken. They charged me the very high price for duck on the bill. If you were someone that never had duck before they would be pulling the wool over your eyes. TOO ME THIS IS JUST TO MUCH AND WE WILL NOT BE BACK AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THE THAI HOUSE ANYMORE."}
{"text":"I thought long and hard about whether to post this, as we've had much better experiences in the past, and the other locations are always delicious. In fact, I think it's some of the best Thai food in Charlotte. 

My husband and I went for a midweek date night, and the restaurant was uncrowded. That didn't stop us from waiting about 5 minutes at the door. There was one waitress visible and she was socializing with a table she was waiting on. We were clearly in her view, she just didn't care. Another couple came in behind us, and the husband commented on it as well. Finally someone came from the back to seat us. 

We got an appetizer and soup which were both delicious. We both ordered main dishes that we frequently eat. I honestly regret not sending them back, and giving them the chance to get them both right, but hindsight is 20/20. 

My husband's favorite Thai dish is Pad Krapow, and anyone who has eaten it knows how flavorful it is. It had a slight taste of Thai basil, and that was it. Additionally 90% of the dish was bell pepper, just a few pieces of meat. I know Thai food centers on vegetables, but this dish has never been prepared this way when he's ordered it before. There was an entire plate of flavorless vegetables left when he was done. There's only so many bell peppers one can eat. 

I ordered Pad Thai, spicy and Thai style. I consider Thai House to have some of the best Pad Thai and this was literally the worst Pad Thai I've ever eaten. Flavorless doesn't even begin to describe. No spice, noodles were mushy, what little there were. 70% of my plate was onion, green onion and bean sprouts. I took most of it to go and doctored it up myself. 

I think we'll visit the Pineville and University locations for a while, and give them a try later on. There are clearly some kinks this location needs to work through."}
{"text":"Friendly staff n food was amazing. 
Cool obvionce inside and would highly recommend this place on your spots to visit. 
Would defiantly visit again"}
{"text":"If you want FRESH and AWESOME food this place is the best Asian joint in Belmont. No lousy buffet food here! Unusual to feel obligated to tip after ordering at the counter but the service is so great you will find yourself leaving a tip. 

I love this place. Give this a shot and that buffet up the road a pass. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. Yes, it doesn't say much when you realize this is in Gastonia but this is as good as the Pineville location."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! highly recommend if your in the mood for some Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for what i thought would be a good lunch with similarities to the location i used to frequent in Pineville. I mean, i know that Gtown is definitely limited when it comes to decent food. Lets be honest here... they have really dropped the ball at this location.  During my visit the shrimp in my pineapple curry were obviously frozen and out of a bag. Some deveined some not. The level 5 that we ordered our items at had no heat at all. The plate of spices we requested couldn't even save this stuff. My friend found a rock/piece of concrete in her entree. When the sweet tea was then refilled with the wrong drink i decided to say something to the waitress. I showed the her the rock/whatever it was in the food, told her i was not happy with my dish and that we now had wrong drinks. She apologized, took all the food including my barely touched curry and brought the bill. The entree with the rock in it had been removed. I was still charged for everything else. I paid, left and wont be back. It sucks because i KNOW this restaurant can be better. Ive had better at Thai House. I have had dishes with shrimp and it hasn't been frozen and out of a bag. Not sure if they're cutting corners because of the location or what but this is not good Thai food. It's just not."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware! My daughter and I ordered our dishes with tofu. They came out with chicken. Sent it back, explaining we were vegetarian. They 'remade' our food. OK, it came back with tofu. Part way thru, though, I realize they just PICKED OUT the largest pieces of chicken and re- served it!!! Disgusting on so many levels. Eww ... realized I was chewing on poultry. Nausea ... and never again."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Bonus points for having duck as a lunch special.  I come to Gastonia a few times a year and this is one of the first restaurants that I would actually look forward to coming back to.  A bit slow on the drink refills, but otherwise a winner."}
{"text":"The food is really, really good.  The duck panang was excellent.  The beef panang was good also but the duck was better.  My only complaint was the service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Food was good; my dish (Kai Khua with tofu) was very comforting in a stir-try version. Flavored weren't too overpowering and the vegetables were cooked well for that evening balance of slightly crunchy and soft in texture. Tofu is cubed and fried and not over done. Overall, food was pretty satisfying. Amount given equaled with what you would pay for. Service on the other hand, could've been more welcoming. I felt rushed and as if our waitress was annoyed with us from the beginning of our seating. I would still come back, but now I know what to expect. I've had better experiences, but this place wasn't too shabby, just wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Why can't you give no stars? I was excited about eating here. The food honestly tasted like a tin can and it smelt like one too. I think it was the Pad Kee Mow. It was awful and I can eat just about anything. And it was expensive!! We spent $30+ for grossness. Trashed it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while on a road trip. Great food! Very attentive service! Sweet lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Wow that was the worst Thai food I've ever had.  We waited for 10minutes just to have someone ask what we wanted to drink.  We placed our full order. Our food came out but they forgot our daughters food.  The Chicken Pad Thai smelled like fish.  The noodles were mush and the chicken was tough.  My wife's curry was barely flavored water horrible as well. 

The place looked like it could have been a home run and something we'd drive out to visit, but that's not gonna happen. 

35 buck and we didn't eat a bit of it.  They never came out to check on it.  They just dropped off the check and moved on. Horrible"}
{"text":"I eaten here twice and was very satisfied with the taste, service and portion size. I will definitely be back and suggest you give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our go-to Thai on the West siiiiiide. Pad Thai is our favorite making it very difficult to venture out from there. Hold the egg for a vegan-friendly option. They typically have coupons available and tend to do the Groupon thing every so often. They are definitely in the Entertainment Book, for this location only. Perfect for me. A little discount action, a little deliciousness. Good day. If only someday they would seat me in the pimp booth."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place another chance. It's been off my list for a while because we had some bad experiences. Well I came here today and it's going to be my last time. The server was having difficulties with a table next to us and she rolled her eyes at us when she greeted us. I specifically heard her complain, out loud, several times about her duties. My water was left completely empty.

She was polite to our faces, but her terrible attitude overall and general demeanor was a turnoff. 

The Food

I had pad king and it was not good. I asked for it Thai hot and it had virtually no spice to it at all. There was virtually no flavor really. Green bell, red bell, onion, steak. The end. The bells were undercooked, the steak was overcooked and chewy. The sauce was very bland for Thai food. As I sat there eating it, I thought \"this reminds me of Thai food that someone would try to make at their house that doesn't know how to cook Thai food.\"

I've never had a good experience here. This was my third or fourth time after giving it over a year's time. If you want really good Thai food, go to Siam Garden in Charlotte on Arrowwood. Bangcock Ocha on 51 is better, Thai Taste is better, Bahn Thai is better, hell Thai House in University is significantly better. 

I don't know why this place can't get it together, but this was my last attempt at eating here. Stay away if you want good Thai food and a good experience."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, never disappointed by the spur of the moment choices I made to try something new and be adventurous! My experience has always been positive, and, as for the previous reviews regarding spice level, if you order a red curry mild, please don't expect spice, and don't give a 2 star rating for that reason. That's what the spice tray at each table is for. (Rant complete!) 

The appetizers are on point, the beef skewers are always tender, with the hoisin peanut sauce is a great complement to the salty well seasoned beef! The fried tofu is always fried to perfect crispness on the outside and delicate fluffiness on the inside! Any dish I have ordered has been cooked to order per my preferences.  If you are going to order the ever popular Pad Thai, you really should ask for it \"Thai Style\" which is a much better tasting tamarind based sauce, not that ketchupy crap you get when you order pad Thai at any Thai restaurant.

Love the staff here, they continue to impress with the level of friendly service, great tasting food, and hospitality. One of my to 5 favorite restaurants in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times: once shortly after it opened, and a couple of times since. The place seemed to have great promise, but was a bit uneven in execution. They seemed to have leveled out quite a bit, and it's mostly good. Sadly, they still don't make the spicy dishes spicy enough."}
{"text":"Ate here again yesterday with family and had a great lunch. Everything I said in my last review still holds true but I just figured I would update things. The red curry was quite delicious and very flavorful. The lunch menu was reasonably priced and had plenty of options available. Also, this place always has a really nice, calming atmosphere too. It is a great place to slip away too for a meal to relax and rejuvenate yourself."}
{"text":"Thai House is the only place to get excellent Thai food in Gastonia. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the staff are friendly and always smiling and the decor is amazing (you would never guess this from the outside and its location in a strip mall). The food is delicious and the portions are large. They will spice dishes according to your taste, and they have assorted spices to add that extra kick table-side (red pepper flakes, jalapeno sauce, Thai chili sauce). My recommendations are the Pad Keemow and the Pad Woonsen, as well as their more traditional curries and Pad Thai. They also have a full sushi bar. Mondays and Tuesdays are two for one sushi rolls for dinner. The prices are very reasonable (most items for lunch are $8-10) and their hot jasmine tea is both delicious and the perfect way to warm up on a cold day. I live in Gastonia, however I would be more willing to drive from Charlotte to here to have a wonderful meal than I would to drive to Charlotte for a meal (and there are many great places I enjoy in Charlotte). Whether you are a Gastonia local out about town, an out of towner shopping at Mary Jo's or just looking for a great place with great Thai inspired cuisine, then this us the place for you."}
{"text":"The food there is excellent.  Been to many Thai restaurants and this one is the by far the best. The food there is so flavorful, haven't came across anything on their menu that is bad.  The service was great, they were all very friendly.  I just love the decor,  it's very beautiful inside. This Lao girl will be going there from now on for her Thai food."}
{"text":"We happened to be in the Gas House for an event and Yelped this establishment.  Based on the high reviews, we hit it!

Very impressive for the area!  Food was above average, if not excellent.  My wife got Pad Thai Chicken and I went with the Pad Kee Mow (on the recommendation from server).  Awesome flavor and the plate was laid out very nice!

The restaurant is very well laid out, clean and comfortable.  Keep in mind the scale they gave us for hottness was 1 to 5, we both ordered a 3.  Not hot and spicy at all.  

Note:  I did not give it 5 stars for this reason - the servings were not what I am used to for a Thai place.  My wife and I eat Thai once a week in various joints all over Mecklenburg, we usually have to share a Pad Thai noodle dish!!!  The Thai House has a smaller serving, about half.  If your on a diet, or into small servings, then ignore this peeve of mine!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! We are from Houston and wanted some healthy thia food. This place hit the spot! We got an awesome appetizer with tofu, pad kee mow, and yellow curry. The service was great too! And I loved the music playing."}
{"text":"Great Thai food at an affordable price. I was craving some Thai food and looked around what's near me, and most of the restaurants are in Charlotte which is a little ways away. Thank god I found this place. Will def be coming back in the near future. My waitress was very nice and service was quick. If you're in the area, I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was not good at all it was too sweet and the color was red first time I seen a red pad Thai I smelled ketchup in it and it looked like spaghetti haha and if the large rice was a bowl of rice I wonder what the small rice is probably a spoon of rice I would def not recommend this place to anyone sorry"}
{"text":"First let me say that the service was impeccable. The servers were attentive and the cook came out with the food and cut up with me making quacking sounds as he served me duck. Super nice people. 

The food was middle of the road Thai food. The curry was a decent curry sauce and the veggies were fresh and cooked correctly. The duck was a bit over breaded for my taste and was almost ground. I am used to more of the Peking style duck with crispy (non-breaded) skin. 

The egg rolls were a touch soggy, but not so much that I did not eat all three. 

I would go back, but would probably try another dish."}
{"text":"I have always have a great experience here. 3/4 spice is perfect for heat and flavor. The fried tofu had the perfect consistency."}
{"text":"They don't serve sushi all the time, kind of shady looking place.  You should pass on this place and ignore all the fake reviews"}
{"text":"The best red curry ever! I get my red curry with chicken and I love it! I recently moved from buffalo ny to gastonia and I didn't think I would find a good Thai food place but they are deff just as good as the thai restaurants in ny. :) I was also pleased with the sushi it's so fresh and amazing !"}
{"text":"I used my Groupon purchased last night.  I was pleased with the ambiance, the service and the food.  I had several things:  seaweed salad, stuffed soft crab, jasmine tea and L2 entree for lunch.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant isn't just good \"for a restaurant in Gastonia.\" This is a really good restaurant. The location and outside would not give you a clue as to the ambiance and classy decor on the inside. It is a cool place to take the family or to head out on a date! But the way it looks only matters so much. The food is where it is at. 

Adults: For me, I love the Pad Thai. Just about every Thai restaurant I go to, this is what I get. I even posted a picture of it here on yelp. It is good. Really good. If you want it spicy, ask. If you want it REALLY spicy, ask for it to be \"Thai Hot\" and make sure they know you mean it. Oh man it's good. Kristina has tried a few other things on the menu and it always is well put together, cooked well, and the presentation is even nice.

KIDS EAT FREE Wednesday and Thursday with a paying adult.
Kids: One of the big worries at a place like this is our 3 year old. Sometimes new foods are hit or miss. Even worse is when the \"Kids menu\" provides second rate burgers or something of the sort. The mac & cheese was piping hot, and cheesy to the level of awesomeness. The fries were battered fries and the kids ate them all. The other kids menu item was sweet and sour chicken. It was fantastic.

The hosts are always there with a smile and a high degree of courtesy. Every time I come I've been treated as though they were waiting for me to get there... I've watched, it's like that with everyone :-)

NOTE: If you are in the mood for southern sweet tea, don't order tea from this menu. It is a great green tea that is sweet but it is not McAlister's southern sweet tea... 

Family all agrees that this place is one of the tops in our books. Thanks for the experience!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good food off the interstate during a long road trip. We found this place through Yelp and decided to give it a go. The fried spring rolls were actually good, but it hard to screw something up that's deep fried. My wife and I both ordered chicken pad Thai, and the problem with it is that there's way too much sauce and the sauce was sweet. It was so sweet that we kept joking that we accidentally ordered off the dessert menu. Also, it wasn't spicy at all. So if you go here, order some spring rolls and avoid the pad Thai."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday. The place wasn't that busy so we were seated right away. I got the sweet and sour chicken. It was good but everything was cold, chicken, veggies, sauce, and rice that came on side. My boyfriend got the pad Thai and had 3 tiny pieces of chicken in his dish. He said it had a tomato taste which wasn't traditional for pad Thai (at least his was hot). With it being a laid back kind of night I was hoping to sit around some and talk with my boyfriend before ordering plus that was the first time we had been there so we had no idea what to get, but our server must've had other plans. We both felt rushed to get drinks and to get our food order.....she also didn't know if they had soft drinks (coke and sprite) she had to ask someone. We had to tell her twice we were not ready to order just yet. Because of all of this we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"It is a peaceful oasis. 
The tea tastes like flowers and honey and the cup is always 2/3rds full of ice. It is perfect. I imagine it comes from a stream in a magical fairy land and they make a special trip to gather it each morning.
The music there sounds like the sound track for \"the calm after a great journey\" scenes in epic movies. I love it.  They are always nice to me.  They remember me and notice when I get a haircut.  I can go months without going and they still know me when I go in.  Not because I am such an outstanding customer--They are just that good. The ingredients are fresh. The food is flavorful. Everything I have tried has been very good. 
This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere,  quiet setting,  with a small bar and friendly staff.  
I usually go for the curry.  When I try to make it at home it's never quite right,  but theirs is the real deal- always perfect- and they'll tone down the spiciness for you if you can't take the heat. 
If curry isn't your thing,  try the knockout wraps for a delicious fresh vegan appetizer. 
While I'm a big fan of pho, I've never had theirs. But for the record they serve it! 
Last but not least,  dessert is always great.  I've had the mango sticky rice,  which is my all time favorite dessert and they do it justice."}
{"text":"Im not a huge thai fan but everything Ive had was delicious and the decor is super nice. Panang Duck is my favorite right now. Not crazy expensive either."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always feel like royalty when I'm there. Excellent waitstaff; they read the cues from patrons very well. I've been here 5 times and have never been disappointed. Love to have an ice cold Singha with my appetizers - spring rolls and deep fried tofu = yum! Great pad thai and excellent curries - the yellow is my personal favorite. Their hot jasmine tea is great. Yes, maybe a bit pricey but I think it's worth it. Lunch menu is a little cheaper. Great place to take people when they come to visit."}
{"text":"I've been here many times because our area lacks this type of cuisine, but the last time was a waste of time and money all due to the server.  On a Friday night a party of 3 walks in and the young girl didn't speak or greet us, just looked at us. I asked to be seated for 3. Drink orders came out wrong, she even brought back the same wrong beverage. App order was spring rolls. We wanted steamed, first on the menu, above the fried. We said \"spring rolls\" not realizing spring rolls would come out fried, but she never asked which type, so I'll take blame for not specifying. She didn't know any of the wines and looked at us like we should know the menu when asked. I requested no onions with pad Thai and dish came back with onions.... I never complained because she literally WATCHED me pick out the onions for about 15 minutes and never said anything about it. I was over it by then. I will say that the more seasoned servers have usually been good, but EVERY part of the meal was wrong."}
{"text":"Once I tasted the pad Thai I haven't been able to order anything else cause I love it soooo much. Sooooo good omg"}
{"text":"I was driving from Atlanta to DC and had a taste for Thai food. When I look up Thai food in the area I selected the restaurant with the best rating. I will concur with the rating. I absolutely enjoyed my meal, I had the Curry Duck and it was the best I ever had. The presentation was perfect it came in a little clay pot with several of these amazing fried duck balls in a Panang Curry sauce. I have never had duck curry prepared like this. My family all ate and enjoy their meal. The dinner was moderately priced we had 4 dishes, one appetizer and paid under $60.00 Trust me when I say I will definitely make this my got to stop the next time I driving to Atlanta."}
{"text":"My job requires occasional travel throughout the western piedmont and foothills of NC, so I enjoy the chance to explore the lunch scene outside the Queen City.

In route to Gastonia last week, I was surprised to find signage for Thai just outside of town.  My interest piqued, I pulled off Franklin Blvd (i.e. Highway 74) and was surprised to find Thai House in this relatively new strip mall.  

I instantly thought, is this related to the Thai House of Charlotte (located in Pineville and the University areas)?  Just one step in the door and this answer is an easy \"yes.\"  Servers dressed in brightly-colored, costumey outfits?  Check.  Elaborate wood work adorning the walls and bar area? Check.  Even the menu was noticeably the same, arriving in a spiral binding and full of laminated pages (to keep the sauce off, yeah).  Ahh, Thailand Disney-fied!  I'm just waiting for a motion-activated animatronic Buddah to laugh and dispense sage advice at the door.

That said.  Service here was most attentive, if not overbearingly so.  Like another reviewer, my \"team\" of servers thanked me every time they came to my table, even if they only thing that happened was a beverage refill.  Certainly better than no service, but at some point this gets a wee bit uncomfortable.

The food here is consistent, though highly Americanized, especially when it comes to spice and heat in their sauces.  I actually dislike their take on Pad Thai as the sauce is a bit too sweet and sour like.  I'd go with their curries or the Pad See Ew, both of which are well flavored and nicely sauteed.  As is typical of Asian fare in this area, you choose your dish and then pick your protein.  Veggie lovers: tofu is an option, or you can ask for just extra vegetables.  

Nothing adventuresome here, but certainly an acceptable lunch option when a more typical chain restaurant just won't do."}
{"text":"I had the red curry for lunch. Very good. I have 4 stars due to the small serving size. I use to having a doggy bag from other places but this was JUST ENOUGH to satisfy me. Good quality food and Relaxing atmosphere. I will definitely be back. I noticed on day Sunday everyone dressed casual aka flip flops or shorts they am seated them at the front tables by the door the others were seated after the bar in the nicer section. Just my observation."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant and the atmosphere is nice but when it comes to food I would give it a zero star... Let me just put it like this, I love leftovers but none of my food was boxed up this night. The soup was off, curry was off and even the roll tasted more fishy, even though it only had crab meat. Even the mint at the end tasted old and extra hard in spots. I gave the place two stars based on the service that was provided as the food would not even get a single star. If you have another choice take it."}
{"text":"I had a Bangin' early Mother's Day dinner with my mom at Thai House! 

Thai is one of my personal favorites and my mom had never eaten eat before which was just plain appalling to me. Almost as appalling as my mother being Mexican and her daughter not speaking Spanish! Gee.. well, all in due time.

Back to the task at hand: I chose the dishes that were easiest to pronounce and would also be a great introduction to this delectable cuisine: Pot Stickers, Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Jasmine Tea. 

The service was super friendly and attentive. The food was served family-style, hot, and with the right amount of spice. I may have overdrenched my brown rich with curry sauce which sent my mouth reeling but I just couldn't help myself! Pad Thai was ideal as was the creamy creamy Curry, both had fresh veggies and great texture.

This place would be great for any and all occasions, and did I mention the pillowy mints?

I shall return!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute pleasure. Wonderful food at a great price. Super nice wait staff.. I will definitely come back here again soon."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. I ordered thai bbq 1/2 duck and it was so bland and chewy. When I asked them to take it off the check they said ok but we are going to charge you for the rice and vegetables  i had only eaten a few bites. Seriously ..."}
{"text":"Would you go back?  In a bind.

Been to this location twice and have no major complaints.  The food was good, albeit not great.  My biggest sticking point, and I admit it's kinda petty, was that on both occasions I asked for spicy sauce on the side, and the waitress simply pointed out the little dish that sits at every table with sauce.  Look, if I wanted to pour spicy sauce that every prior occupant of my booth has had their fingers in, over my food, then I would go ahead and do that, but I really don't want to do that, so I'd much rather you bring me something that at least seems fresh, from the kitchen.

The \"decor\" is a little busy in this place, sort of what you might get if someone says \"let's grab everything that looks like it might be Thai or Asian-influenced and set it up as decoration\".  

But with all that aside, when short on dinner ideas, or when that urge for Thai food sets in on a weeknight...this place will do and I encourage you to give it a try."}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend this place! 
Looked it up here on Yelp and, although it was a 10 mile drive from where I'm staying and I was on the fence about having to go so far, it did not disappoint and was well worth the drive!
The food was fresh, tasted great, and was reasonably priced. The service was friendly and attentive. They also have sushi. 
I had Tako, and Hamachi sashimi (3pcs. each) as an appetizer, a small bowl of Tom Yum soup with shrimp, Eggplant with pork, and brown rice.
I'll definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Picked this restaurant on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  

The menu is really broad and includes sushi.

Being a vegetarian, I looked for all the meat free dishes and options.  This place is really good about calling out menu items that can be made with tofu and which items contained meat.  I found that a fresh experience in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on the way back to Charlotte.  I am a frequent customer at one of Thai House's Charlotte locations so I figured this would be just as good here.  

If you are looking for this place, it is in a newer shopping center down the street from Franklin Square.  Compared to their two Charlotte locations, this one is quite large.  There are the usual Thai House green booths in the front and additional seating in the back.   They also have a small bar in the front and this is the first location I've been to that has a sushi chef.  

The menu is the same here as with the other Thai House locations with the exception of the sushi.

Lately, I am more of a vegetairan/pescetarian but on this day I was already allowing myself to eat meat and I was craving a chicken dish that I love at their other locations, Pad Krapraw which is ground chicken mixed with veggies and basil in a light sauce.  Of course I ordered it extra spicy.  I also ordered the steamed spring rolls as an appetizer.

The spring rolls were the worst part of this experience.  I was expecting something along the lines of a Vietnamese spring roll but this was nothing like that.  It was tofu with cucumber wrapped up.  The wrapping seamed rubbery and it didn't hold its form so everything fell apart easily.  The best flavor of the roll was the cucumber.  

The meal on the other hand was spot on as I always enjoy it.  It could have had a bit more heat to it.

As far as service, it was excellent, not outstanding but they were friendly here.  I also enjoyed the thai dresses the wait staff were wearing.  

I can't say I will get to this restaurant often.  I think this was just a case of being in Gastonia and wanting something other than a national chain restaurant experience but it's nice to know Thai is now available here if I ever get stuck here again."}
{"text":"All I can tell you is I could LIVE on their Yum Neur.  It's in my top ten of restaurant dishes.  It's so strange because I see so many people herd to places like Cheddars and The Olive Garden in this city and I can't help but wonder why.  I've eaten at BOTH places and they don't even try; you get pre-cooked, bland, tasteless chain food there.  At least at Thai House you get FLAVOR!  As a matter of fact, a friend and I are heading that way on Friday for a little pre-birthday bash; nothing brings in another year like sushi and that DELICIOUS Yum Neur salad!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Thai expert but I sure do like this place. The decor is \"pretty\" and not tacky. The bamboo lining the booths gives a fresh look and the ornate wood work is exquisite. The food is great and the service attentive. If you want more spice there are spice trays they will give to you. I highly recommend the Thai House."}
{"text":"I quickly became a fan of pho from the first time I had it and Thai House does a great job with their pho! It is so satisfying. Spicy and delicious. My wife lives their Tom Kha. We both agree that this particular Thai House just does the best job with both of these dishes. We ordered sweet and sour chicken for my son and it is a bit of a departure from the s&s chicken I've seen anywhere else. The breading is a bit lighter. Not as puffy as one might ordinarily find, but my (6 year old) son says that it is his favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious food, big portions, small prices, great service!"}
{"text":"Not a favorite. They will change the veggies without telling you depending on what is in the kitchen. Small meat portion. Not generous  pretty annoying to me"}
{"text":"Love it.  Chicken pad Thai is always great.   My husband likes the sesame chicken.  Each time we've been there we have enjoyed the food and bring home leftovers due to the bountiful serving sizes"}
{"text":"Wow.  It was supposed to be Thai food and I had to ask pepper to add to my food and still it was amazingly bland.  My food tasted as if it was just boiled in plain unsalted water.  The service was good though and the restaurant was pretty and clean.  I ate here and wished I hadn't.  That's all.  Learn from my mistake.  I was truly shocked."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled upon this restaurant by accident, returning from Asheville to pick up a flight to DFW out of Charlotte.

Once in awhile, each of us discovers a wonderful dining surprise, one with perfect food, superlative staff, attractive surroundings.  Thai House is ours for 2012!  

Before you roll your eyes: I'm an airline pilot, wifey is an attorney who owns two companies.  I fly to Tokyo three times a month.  We travel extensively.  Three different friends own Thai restaurants, and I've written the menu for one of these.

To start with, the only other Thai restaurant in recent memory where the staff wore traditional outfits: Thai Square, in London.  Of course outfits don't make the restaurant, but it was a nice touch.

The food proved to be spot-on, as good as my old favorite, YaYa's, in Texas.   I wasn't able to perch on the kitchen counter at Thai House like I did at Ya Ya's -- not that I asked -- but my krapow had the same basil-infused delicacy, the chicken just as tender.  While I didn't have Tom Kah Gai at Thai House, the menu assures us that it has the full compliment of savory galanga root, as if often overlooked at American Thai restaurants.

I'll definitely go back, whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This really is the only place to get Thai food in Gastonia.  And it is so so great!  My husband and I love coming here. Everything there is so fresh and delicious, I wish we could eat here once a week!  Staff is SUPER friendly and attentive, which you usually have to drive to Charlotte to experience."}
{"text":"I must say me and my love are a fan of Thai house. We have ordered take out here numerous times.  Our food is always great and fresh. We have never ate in, take out is always our choice here. Whenever  I pick up my order, the staff is always curteous. 

Our go to meal here is the vegetarian basil fried rice spicy. I love it.

I would recommend this to anyone who has a taste for Thai food. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very good.  I have dined Here several times and am never disappointed. You have a choice of how spicy you want your food,  i like it hot so i order 4 on a 1 to 5 scale."}
{"text":"We were here for Saturday brunch menu, restaurant was quiet, personnel nice and helpful. But food was terrible, probably worst sweet and sour i ever saw. Thai ice coffee was different and sushi not even average. I would give it second chance but try something others recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
- Chicken Larb Salad is BANGING (Super weird name for sure, but it's amazing). Ask for lettuce wraps - like $1 extra - if you want to make lettuce wraps because it's about 92% meat and 8% shredded lettuce. 
- Tom Kha soup is so hardy and incredibly filling. It's warming, silky, and soothing. I love splitting a pot and an order or Pad Thai or Larb with someone. Or just getting the Pot and taking the rest home for later myself 
- Green Curry - Vegetarian or Shrimp is delicious. I'm usually a spicy red curry girl, but Thai House does Green Curry so well and I love eggplant that it works out perfectly!
- Finally, classic Pad Thai is flawless here. I like shrimp Pad Thai the best. But Chicken is a very close second."}
{"text":"This place was very good. We had the tempura rolls which weren't the most flavorful I have ever had of that roll but they were good. We both had number 41, my husband had it with chicken and I had it with duck. It was delicious. I almost went with chicken because duck wasn't available on the lunch version. I am glad I didn't, the chicken was good too but the duck was amazing! It was so flavorful and cooked perfect. Now I know why this place is rated high by so many people. I would not recommend the green apple sake unless you want someone incredibly sweet, they were out of what I wanted so I got that and it was like drinking syrup. I couldn't take one full drink of it. Great place, plan on going back."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and selection. I had the pad Tia ewe with chicken and it was fantastic...this coming from a guy from DC who frequents Thai restaurants. Great wait staff too!"}
{"text":"Their green curry is perfect. When I moved from Charlotte, I never expected to find good Thai food here. The staff is attentive and if you visit regularly, they remember your typical order. When you go, make sure to have the Sticky Rice w/ Mango. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Our first time trying Thai House. Was a very good experience. Waitress and staff were Johnny on the spot. Food was excellent. We will try it again. Thank you Thai House for a great evening."}
{"text":"This one is different from the one in Charlotte same owners but this one has sushi! This one has the fried tuna yum! Just wished they cut the cut into smaller portions. My mouth was literally too full to even chew lol. I got the pad three king that something was different and it was they use regular American green beans instead of the long Thai green beans which was a bummer I wanted the long green beans other that still good! Almost forgot my fiancé had the red curry and it was a bit sweeter than usual. But we ask for some fish sauce and sprinkled some in it which made it taste better."}
{"text":"The best papaya salad I have had anywhere hands down. So refreshing. Very nice and attentive service. Other dishes very tasty and authentic as well. And the carved booths and wall hangings are beautiful. Will definitely return if we are back in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Reasonable prices. Decor was beautiful. Ordered the Thai Sweet and Sour, vegetables were fresh and crunchy and chicken was perfectly fried."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp during a thundering storm - some of the best sushi and definitely the best sake I have ever had!  If i lived in the area, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I always love coming here! The food is always so good. The only problem tonight was that my order was wrong, but other than that, always delicious!"}
{"text":"They put ketchup in the pad Thai.  Need I say more?  The owner told me I have to ask for \"Thai\" pad Thai.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food around but it's good. Service is hit or miss. The other locations in Pineville and University are so much better."}
{"text":"We went back to have dinner again last night. The food was great and the service was excellent as always. The servers are friendly and helpful. We'll def go back to Thai house again soon!!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancée  have been there a few times and have had great service until today,the waitress brought us our drinks then we waited for over 15-20 minutes for her to come back and then decided to just get up and leave.The place only had a few customers and we could her people laughing and talking in the kitchen."}
{"text":"On our way to airport we stopped to have quick lunch.
Ordered the Mussels and when they arrived they were the largest mussels I have ever seen, seriously steroid version.

It was hard to choke down one I even tried to cut into pieces, just had horrible bitter watery taste.  We told our server we would like something else.

Decided on a couple sushi rolls which were nothing to brag about.  Then thought we are in a Thai restaurant lets order curry, that is what they do best.

We chose a red curry, the waitress was hard to understand we thought we ordered hot.  To our surprise, it arrives with those giant Mussels back in!!! We both laughed so hard, felt like scolded children, you will keep getting these Mussels until you finish!!!

Needless to say we paid the bill and left. 

Ok I admit do not eat a lot of Thai, although like a red curry and I enjoy spicy food."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places I'll eat out at in gastonia. The food is wonderful, especially for a vegetarian like me. The sushi is pretty good here from what what my roommate says. The only thing that could be better is that certain employees could be friendlier. Especially the hostess. I really only like getting served by the guy from New York (I think), the tall slender woman, and the one with the edgy short hair. They're great at making me feel welcome and relaxed, something that hard for me to do at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food with the highest quality ingredients and freshness. I recommend Thai House to anyone claiming to like Asian food and traveling by/or living in Gastonia, SC"}
{"text":"Stopped here while on a car trip. Not far off I85 great food and service. Diverse menu great quality and prices. 

The staff was fantastic and very attentive"}
{"text":"Beautiful quiet atmosphere, seamless service, and incredible food!!! I had the medium spicy Pad Thai.  Come here, you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Went to Thai House tonight  to celebrate our 40the anniversary. As always, the food was excellent and service was great. My favorite place to eat in Gastonia. I had the green curry with Jasmine rice and my hubby had the 3 kings with Jasmine rice. For an appetizer  we has the squid tempura. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The service was great until after we got our entree. The waitress was nowhere to be found. Me and my fiancé came during late lunch and it wasn't busy. I literally had to flag a different waitress to get a refill. Then the pot stickers tasted like dirt and the spinach inside of them had no seasoning but\"earth\". Then we order the Pad Thai and it was ok. The size of the shrimp was extremely tiny. I'm use to jumbo shrimp in my dish. They only reason I went to this place because I had a groupon. If I paid full price, I would've been extra piss. I had better service and food at Red Bowl."}
{"text":"Very delicious tom yum shrimp!!!!!!! And Pad!! Love the environment and server! Five star!!!!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Thai House in Gastonia was great. We frequent the one in University, but were on this side of town and decided to stop in. The Kai Khua was great and perfectly spicy! My husband loves the fried rice. The rice soup was to die for! We also had a sushi roll which was not bad. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Arrived just before dinner time. Upon entering I could smell something that was not pleasant. I was greeted and set. When I opened the menu it was filthy as though it had not been cleaned. The server brought me a water which had things floating in it. I had already made up my mind at this point to leave and then I notice one of the employees picking his nose in the corner. Yummy right. I never identified the stench either. I left and went to Booger King."}
{"text":"We really like coming here when we are in the area. They have good service. We've always enjoyed the food and it is really authentic Thai. The deco is also really nice."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our last visit was not very good. We split the pad thai and it did not taste right. In fact it made both of us queasy. The service was okay... took forever to get our food. Probably will try a different thai restaurant next time the cravings strike."}
{"text":"I was Gastonia on business and was looking for a good Thai restaurant close to my hotel.  I saw this one was given great reviews on Yelp so I decided to try it.  It did not disappoint.  I had the Chicken Pad Thai.  It was very flavorful. It came out quickly and was piping hot.  I was there for lunch so it came with soup and spring roll.  The soup came out immediately and was very good.  The spring roll came out with the meal.  The only negative item I had was the spring roll.  It did not taste like it was fully cooked and it was cold on the inside.  The staff are great.  If the spring roll would have been cooked properly I would have go en this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible. Not real or even close to good Thai food. The pad Thai and pad ke mow was mushy and noodles all broken up. I love pad Thai and this was the worst I've ever tried. We asked for it to be spicy but I'm assuming they forgot cause it wasn't spicy at all. And they brought out a dish of crushed pepper without us asking for it. 
 The best part of the whole thing was the water they gave us. We will never come back. The restaurant is nice inside but if your food isn't good then there isn't any point being a good restaurant at all. In all the Thai food here is horrible."}
