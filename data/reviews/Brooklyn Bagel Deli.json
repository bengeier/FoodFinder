{"text":"Bagels close to New York kind? They are advertised all the time but fail to measure up. This place is the closest to our hometown bagels. The flavored cream cheeses are a great addition even thoughI like traditional cream cheese the wife loves the flavors. Egg sandwiches in toasted bagel are good too nice stop in the am for a quick bite and coffee."}
{"text":"Always mess up my order! I don't know why they can't write it down so they get the order correct every time. This was my last bad experience I will be having there."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Unfortunately I moved out of the neighborhood, so my visits are less frequent, but when I want a delicious bagel sandwich, this is the place I go!! Friendly customer service all the time, great atmosphere, awesome food, reasonably priced. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Good lox and bagels, dirty dinning room and staff that needs a little more pep in their step. All in all if you have 20 minutes to kill and you don't mind sitting outside then I would recommend the traditonal."}
{"text":"I ordered a pastrami on an everything bagel.  The bagel was small and tasteless and the pastrami was sparse and not brisket.  They would not last a month in Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"Female worker with long black greasy stringy hair that was in her face, standing in the prep area took my order.She then went to register started to be a cashier. So I never got my order, watched others get their food before me.  I had to go up ask them to make it for me. When I explained to another female worker that they need a better ordering system she was totally dismissive, said they opened late. This was at 8:25 am and they open at 6:00 am. If they can handle a rush they should not be in business. All the workers their lack basic grooming & cleanliness that is standard for people handling food. I use to come here 1-2 times a week. Not anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been coming here for years and the food is great, my order was never messed up, and the staff is amazing! So welcoming and nice! My family and I love this Brooklyn bagel."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often, it makes decent bagels but I've eaten NYC Hot Bagels in brooklyn and this doesn't even compare.  But its an ok bagel place for sin city"}
{"text":"For a chain this is a great place, the owner Paula is always behind the counter, she truly cares about what her customers want. I would definitely recommend checking out this place."}
{"text":"If you haven't been by in a while, they have just done some updates on the outside of the store that look GREAT!!!! Totally different look and feel. There was even a different feel/vibe inside. The team working today was very focused and really working hard to meet customer needs.  :-)"}
{"text":"One of the worst things is to find a good place to eat only to have the place go out of business, but not in this case.  I've been going to Brooklyn for years so they are well established and consistent in the high quality of their food.  I especially go to get their morning wrap with bacon.  No thin strips, you get the real deal.  One of the best bkfst burritos in town. Good job guys."}
{"text":"I made a big mistake by having a grilled tuna sandwich here. It smelled like cat food and tasted gross. Bagels looked good though.  Restaurant overall didn't seem very clean. I was there at 11am and went to 2 tables before getting a clean one."}
{"text":"I have been going to this deli for the last 4 years and let me tell you, its probably my favorite place to go for breakfast.  The food is always delicious, and I feel the staff is very friendly.  It always a good start to your day when you come in, and the staff already knows what you want.  Everyone is super friendly, and will also get to know you.  Overall, a wonderful place to eat.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Why go to a chain when you can come here? Great bagels. Great spread. Great service. It felt very much like a local gem. Support small businesses and start your day here!"}
{"text":"I Love Brooklyn Bagel, they are so Friendly I feel like Family when I'm there. Everything is fresh, Bagels are melt in your mouth. Clean and Friendly.... They even have my cup of Iced Coffee ready when they see me coming. Thank You BB"}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever. I've never been treated this way at any worthy establishment. The employees are very rude except one., who is always accommodating and polite. But the rest of the staff sucks.  We went there like we do every Sunday , and today they were closing early so we ordered , ate and left our remaining items on table because a few minutes before another customer was going to throw their trash away and was told by another employee to not bother cause there wasn't a bag in the can cause they were cleaning up to close  . So when we leaving I told my husband not to pick up our trash cause there was no where to throw it ( mind you it was a small brown bag which we put our leftovers in). We left and as we were getting on the car some crazy deranged looking person opens the door and looks at me and screams BITCH. What? What just happened? I got out to see what happened and this unstable person opened the door and started screaming at us that I was a bitch because we didn't throw out our trash.  Are you joking you lunatic! I tried to explain why we didn't and she just was flipping out. So unprofessional so rude.  Let's just say we didn't throw our trash out just because we didn't!!  It's totally wrong, unprofessional and rude to open your back door and yell at a customer and yell at BITCH. Needless to say we will never go there again.  I'm actually glad cause their bagels suck but my husband liked going there. So Yay for me and Yay that you hire horrible unprofessional employees thank you Starbucks we will see you every Sunday from now on"}
{"text":"My favorite bagel shop. The staff is always amazing. The food is fresh and so great! They are not expensive, super friendly and food is served pretty quickly. We visit here on a regular basis and continue to return."}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast greeting/ service horrible ! Very bothered! Einstein bagel forever:) Will not come here again. Not worth the trouble. Made sure to post this though"}
{"text":"They've messed up 2/2 of my bagels. Like seriously I ordered a blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese and received a blueberry bagel with plain cream cheese. HOW DO YOU MESS THAT UP!! And then my girlfriend ordered one of their original sandwich bagel with avocado and guess what, no avocado... This place is a joke."}
{"text":"I go to this place approx 3x a week and never experienced bad service. True, a small staff but they've always been friendly and helpful. I love the food and I will continue going to Brooklyn Bagel. As I read the negative comments, it makes me giggle because I experience the opposite...every time! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Over priced, slow service, dry, flavorless bagels! Okay to try once in your life. They do have a big menu and many different options for you to try. I'm just not the type of person that would get scammed more than once!"}
{"text":"Went in for  a free iced coffee and the lady working the afternoon shift rudely told me that, it's only for the hot coffee. That is completely understandable , I had no problem getting hot coffee and I proceeded to tell her that I was misinformed by one of her associates and she put the two empty cups a few feet away from my face and said \" I'm getting the coffee for you..\" I have never been treated like a nuisance for her having to get me coffee i would have had hot , by the company ever . Was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bagel shop in town. They make their bagels and cream cheese are made fresh. Their bagel sandwiches use real eggs. It may take a few minutes longer than the chains, since it's fresh, but it's worth every minute. I drive from across town just to come here."}
{"text":"Good quality food and great help for the business guy on the go.  Phone order for 2 dozen bagels, in and out, no stress.  They always come through."}
{"text":"Terrible service, no gloves worn handeling food after touching money, the AC was not working and it was 100 degrees outside!  After managment was told about the unsanitary food handling they didn't even say we are sorry or offer and compensation.  They were angry we said we wanted differnt food.  I would now recommend this store to ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"Tables are weird sized and wobbly. Hang onto your coffee here! Love the nova lox sandwich! I have it on good authority the French toast rocks! Eggs are unappetizingly poorly blended but the bagels are superb."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for lunch.  I find the other reviews odd because we had a wonderful lunch.  The staff was friendly as well. I loved my sandwhich and my husband, who is someone pickier, loved his as well.  We also got a HUGE donut to take home for the kids & they loved it!!  The donut was like 7 inches big!  I would definitely go back to this place again, without a doubt."}
{"text":"The wife and I go here for three reasons  1- They open early 2- It is near by 3- Sometimes you just don't want food from Starbucks  With that being said, they get only three stars because they are just so inconsistent. Sometimes the order is spot on and the food taste delicious. The other times not a single thing is correct. If there were other options open before 8 we would probably be picking up from there. Being from NY, I really root for this place, but sometimes they just let me down."}
{"text":"So we don't come here very often but when we do I'm in the mood for a dang bagel! Most of the time they have blueberry which is my goto flavor but sometimes not... and the killer is it's not like I'm showing up at 11am when you should expect some of the stuff to be gone or still baking. The bagel-wiches are pretty good and the service is friendly but the bagels are not the biggest or the best."}
{"text":"Asked the woman what a kaiser roll was and she looked at me and said, \"Bread.\" Really? Good food, no-go on the customer service."}
{"text":"Located across from where I work, this place has been a life saver. Always get the Original with sausage, but I always switch up my bagel. Currently enjoying it on a Pretzel Bagel, the salt on top makes it easier for not adding extra salt on the egg itself. I wish they had pepper packets. Really quick and super nice. I usually add the Iced Mocha to my order. The staff is very friendly. There is a $5 minimum to use Credit Card."}
{"text":"This place is gross. Smells weird. And everyone that works there looks dirty. Also, they have a young boy probably around the age of 10 working back there making sandwiches and bringing them out to the customers??? Something isn't right here. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Im a breakfast sandwich kinda guy and this is BY FAR the worst place in Vegas to get a bagel sandwich or anything for that matter. Not sure how or why but the whole 3 person staff are all extremely rude. Im greeted with \"What do you want\"! Been there 3 times because its right by my house & every time Ive gone they have been rude and messed up my order. EVERY TIME! I'll never go there again. I would walk 5 miles to another bagel place before I would drive up the street to this place. Cant wait till they close it and replace it with an einstein or anything better."}
{"text":"I saved my bagel breakfast sandwich image in Pinterest with the description: A non-spicy jalapeño spread and egg breakfast bagel from Brooklyn Bagel Deli ... Pretty bland and pedestrian style bagel sandwich, however the service was pretty excellent and the bagel selection was awesome and drink selection was pretty decent. I'll give this place a second chance soon."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good, but for some reason the employees are off quite a bit....I sat on hold for 15 minutes this morning, as well as tried calling 3 times from my second line to place a Togo order @7 am this would not have been a b ig deal except that when I arrived the was no one in line....The employees had simply answered the phone, asked me to hold and forgot about me....when I arrived I had to inform the employees the phone was off the hook, which they had completely forgot about...This is just inexcusable incompetence considering the time of day and the rush most are in to go to work! As well as discovering at home they messed up my order!"}
{"text":"Love the service and food here! Thank you for always being on point!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in all of Las Vegas. I come from New Jersey and finding a great bagel is extremely difficult here but this place is spot on. They even carry salt bagels which are so hard to find! I recommend to everyone I know when they ask about bagels."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick breakfast during our move and found this place to be delightful. The people working there were super nice and helpful and the food was fabulous!  The ham on my breakfast bagel was sliced so thin you could see through it and the egg was not greasy - delish meal!  Coffee was good too."}
{"text":"This is place awesome. I have been going here for years and it just seems to get better and better. Always friendly! Bagels are fresh! Highly recommended, I would never eat Einstein's again after trying Brooklyn Bagel!"}
{"text":"Well I've been a consistent patron for over six years but that means watching things slowly go down both in customer service and quality... The staff behind the counter usually a woman with long brown hair is less than friendly and fails to listen, the cook preparing the bagels has a full beard and seems in poor hygiene making me uncomfortable with the handling of the bagels themselves and at some point the cheese was switched out for what I'm guessing is a cheaper more plastic version from walmart, overall I choose to drive to the Brooklyn bagel on south eastern ( where the original owner works) because it's cleaner friendlier and the food is just far better in quality and preparation. Sad to see this location going downhill."}
{"text":"BEC is BAE: bacon egg and cheese on a bagel is the classic weekend breakfast. Here at BBD, you can get your bagel plain, with schmear, or in various sandwiches. The Classic with bacon is not their best effort but it's an easy grab and go option.  Their lunch sandwiches fare a bit better for me, but I'm a sucker for the lox sando and usually end up getting that. If you're into spice, the Tijuana hot is a solid option with jalapeno cream cheese and pepper jack. The bagels themselves aren't the best in town, the dough doesn't quite have the right chew and other spots have a bit more flavor. Service is friendly and they score bonus points for patio seats.   TIP: Check the case by the register for NY seltzer, rainbow cookies, and other big apple favorites."}
{"text":"Love this place! The people are always so friendly and you get your food fast with very little wait time."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been a customer for almost eight years.  The bagels are the real deal; that is, they have the chewy crust, like real NYC bagels.  They are tasty, yummy, and never heavy.  All of the sandwiches and other treats are equally delicious.  The staff is fantastic.  Warm, personable, attentive, and very speedy.  It feels like a second home, except the food is really awesome, unlike what I make at home - LOL"}
{"text":"If I would have made this review last week I would have given it 2 1/2 stars, with the food being 3 stars and the service 2 stars. With that being said, as of today I am giving it one star and I would give it zero or negative stars. If you need more info please keep reading.   Today my wife and I decided to go there because we planned on a quick meal which they do provide. Upon arriving there was a hand written sign taped to the door saying they were closing at 2:00. This is earlier than usual, no doubt because of the Super Bowl. It was still 1:40 so I knew we would have enough time.   We ordered and sat down as usual without any problem. There were two tables with other people eating already. One table left at about 1:45 and the other table left at about 1:50. When the later table left they were told by one employee that they were cleaning up, there was no trash bag and to give her their trash.   We were ready to exit and there were no employees in sight. So we left the trash on the table because we had overheard about there not being a trash bag in the can. We got into our car and a woman came out the door and screamed \"You're a b***h!\" So my wife and I proceeded to get out of the car to see what the problem was.   This irate dirty looking woman was going on and on about us not throwing our trash out. Really?! Even if we had left our trash on the table for no reason at all this would still be a most uncalled for response. This woman thought her actions were just as said she was in charge, but I don't know if she is the owner or manager. She also suggested if we didn't like our treatment we should go on YELP, Yahoo or Google. Well that's exactly what I'm doing.   I would NEVER patronize this establishment again. My suggestions to others would be the same, especially if she is the owner. And if she is not the owner, she should be fired. There is no acceptable circumstances for her actions."}
{"text":"I visited the deli for the first time today. I ordered the chicken salad and mom ordered the lox sandwich. We were blown away at how delicious everything was. We live in the area and have been for quite awhile, and are currently kicking ourselves for not coming in sooner. If you haven't visited this place yet, you are missing out! Get yourself a \"real\" sandwich today!!!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Found myself here with my husband and two other friends one Sunday morning when it was my \"job\" to pick the breakfast place.  I sort of randomly picked this place (I didn't even know it existed) by saying, \"Oh, let's see, turn here, turn here.\"  It was a great choice!  I had the Philly Cheesesteak on a plain bagel (yes, after agonizing over the dozen or so bagel choices I ended up choosing plain - omg).  But it was delicious - the bagel was just the right amount of chewy without getting that 'exhausted jaw' halfway through. There was just enough meat and egg and cheese and onions to be satisfying.  If you're looking for a giant bagel sandwich with fixins worthy of a heart attack, go somewhere else.  My husband had the French toast which looked amazing and got a thumbs up and his agreement to come back with me again (his version of a 4 star rating).    Another friend had an omelet (I can't remember which one now) but it was an egg white only and looked very fluffy and fresh with a decent amount of \"stuff\" in it.  He liked it, but wished he had ordered it with whole eggs.    The service was good although there wasn't an abundance of smiles behind the counter but it was relatively quick for how busy they were.  I liked that there were many, many choices of beverages and little snacks.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, fast and of course local. Bagels come laden with cream cheese, twice the thin layer Einstein paints on theirs. Fun fact: I like lox spread, and theirs tastes great, but the bright pink shade of theirs always made me wonder a bit - until I watched them making it in-store one morning. Just a huge stainless-steel bowl full of whipped cream cheese and a ton of smoked salmon chunks being vigorously mixed together. The counter lady advised me they add food color only to keep track of what's what. So yep, the spreads are homemade."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a great bagel in the desert.  But maybe that's appropriate for a sparse water climate since one step in the bagel-making process is soaking the dough in boiling water.  So us desert-dwellers are left with a variety of corporate chain bakeries serving up bagels that are . . . well, good enough.   Once you accept that you can't always get what you want, Brooklyn Bagels is . . . well, good enough.  They offer a well-stocked selection of bagels (plain, everything, asiago, chocolate chip, etc.) and a wide-selection of cream cheese flavors (plain, fat free, honey, jalapeno, etc.).  It's hard to insult a well-stocked place.  But Brooklyn Bagels only gets two stars because it is so over-priced.  A simple bagel and cream cheese costs $3.  Seriously.  3 bucks.  And at the risk of becoming the old grumpy man of Yelp, talking about how much it cost way back when, $3 is at least $1 too much for a bagel and cream cheese.  Seriously, it's a simple, non-complicated baked treat ($2.04 at Dunkin Donuts).    But if you're looking for a quick over the counter breakfast place, you could definitely find worse.  They also offer a variety of egg dishes, breakfast wrap sandwiches and pancakes.  That's a nice touch."}
{"text":"I have only had the bagels here but they are real good.  They definitely have a distinct taste that sets them apart from other bagel places.  To me these bagels taste a bit saltier then some other chain places which I enjoy.  It may just be in my head though lol.  The bagels run larger then most bagel shops.  The prices are excellent.  I need to eventually try some of their other breakfast options they look amazing."}
{"text":"Check your to go orders this is second time in last two visits I got all the way home with the wrong order. The bagels are not bad but it you can't get a three bagel order right in a bagel restaurant there is an issue"}
{"text":"YUCK! Don't even waste your money or time!! Dirty tables, dirty environment, bad vibes. You feel like you are the biggest inconv, when you walk in!"}
{"text":"The REAL DEAL!!! BAGELS ARE AWESOME. I IF you are looking for Great bagels,friendly staff look no further. Order your breakfast/lunch sit down Wait a few minutes for the magic to happen and it is delivered to your table Wish I could give this 6 stars."}
{"text":"Constantly messing up orders becuase they refuse to write them down,the bacon is disgusting all fat and pathetic portions,ect ect. I put up with all this every once in a while becuase i wanted a bagel obviously, but this morning I went in and ordered 3 things and they made every single thing wrong and the chicken on one item was rancid and unedible. Do urself a favor and avoid dissapointment or food poisoning and go somewhere else. Management issues much? Disgraceful period!"}
{"text":"Every morning either me or my wife get bagels from here.  Lox is always fresh, food is always good.  Love it"}
{"text":"I couldn't help thinking that Brooklyn Bagel Deli was Einstein's long-lost cousin.  The menus are similar (although Brooklyn's is much smaller) and the interior design appeared to be a knockoff as well.  I enjoyed my sandwich very much but wasn't impressed by the crumbs on the tables or the dirty floor.  Hubby liked his bagel a lot, but was also less-than-enthusiastic about the subpar level of cleanliness.  I don't want to sound too harsh, but I do feel that eateries should be clean!"}
{"text":"this is a definite \"meh\" for me.  Stopped for a breakfast bagel sandwich for me and a pastrami bagel sandwich for him.  My bagel came topped with a single fried egg and a very thin piece of ham, plus a slice of cheese.  It was very meh - not much flavor and really not filling!  The pastrami bagel sandwich was better, but had a funky sauce of some sort.  Pastrami sandwich came with chips, but would've preferred the sandwich to be cheaper instead since I didn't want the chips."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! A good variety of breakfast options and lunch!! The jalapeño bagel breakfast sandwich was sooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"Amanda gave us amazing customer service this morning! She was extremely helpful since this was my hunnys first time there. She went as far as to show him how much cream cheese she was putting on his bagel because he told her other bagel places always put too much. The bagels are always fresh and they have quick service and good coffee. We'll definitely be back...probably tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"This is my new hidden gem! This is a true mom-and-pop place with friendly service and amazing food. The bagels are just ridiculously soft. Their sandwiches are to die for. Makes me feel like I'm in New York City. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Customer service was out right rude, not enough inventory. Bagels are ok but  it said one price online and another way higher when you get there. Their excuse was we haven't updated our system. Will never return there again"}
{"text":"BLT truly is stacked mountain high with BACON!! Get it on the cheddar cheese bagel."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the best bagel places in America, including the finest in New York. I am a local attorney in town and this wonderful Bagel place is right down the road. I love eating the lox there and it is superb! I recommend this location without reservation!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York and I don't understand the bad reviews of Brooklyn Bagel Deli. I work for a payroll company and we have an office across the street. The last time I visited this office I had breakfast and sometimes lunch at this place and I loved it. The bagels, cream cheese and even the coffee was awesome so I guess I don't understand why people give it bad reviews unless you were born and raised in Nevada and have never had a good bagel. It was the only decent place for breakfast on that entire street and I ate their every morning for 5 days. To anyone that knows a good bagel and is visiting the many businesses in this area from out of town, I say go for it."}
{"text":"Great bagels. I had a jalapeño bagel w/ jalapeño cream cheese. Fire! But bangin! The coffee was also pretty good."}
{"text":"I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the deli. I ordered the Lil Italy and it was horrible, so bad that I took 2 bites and had to toss it out.  The sandwich was completely drenched in Italian dressing and it was impossible to hold and the meats were very slimy and tasted bad."}
{"text":"called sunday at 2:35pm to order dozen bagels for monday to take advantage of their monday special.  Girl answers phone, says hold on (not even, please give me a second will be right with you), so I waited and waited and listened as the phone must have been next to register.  Only heard girl tell one customer $12.79 and that was it, so I thought she would pick up on me. NO. Next thing i'm listening is her talking to the other help and this continues till 3:02 at which time someone hangs up the phone. (yes I held on that hold time after all i'm married 35 years so i have patience). I call back and guess what, it rings about 10 times and then beeps. I hang up, and call again and again it beeps, this time though i leave message just incase this is a tape (but i doubt it), for mondays order. Lets see what happens on monday...Get this, if you go on monday you buy 6 and get 3 free but if you buy 12 you DON'T get 6 free you only get 3 free. Does that make sense...."}
{"text":"First yelp review, but had to say how great this deli is! Bagels and fresh made cream cheese always delicious, veggies fresh, service fantastic and quick. I always order a pretty complicated sandwich in the morning and they get it right every time!"}
{"text":"WARNING!! HEALTH HAZARD!! Wow! Filthy dirty rude staff and filthy dirty place all together! I really can't believe what just happened. Ok, so, I walk in to get a bagel (which btw are subpar at best). I ask for a bagel with cream cheese! That's it! 20 min wait lol!   The staff was so rude and unwelcoming, especially there useless goateed, pony tailed guy with his hairy blubber belly sticking out of his filthy dirty shirt, he actually, right in front of me dropped a lid off a cream cheese container, it fell on he floor cheese side down and he bent over to pick it up and put it back on the container! It just fell on the floor! Omg! I was flawed! Not only could I not believe he did that but I also couldn't believe that this waste of a person bent over and showed the crack of his filthy A**!   As I walked out I told them I will never be back and they responded! Good we don't want you back! No joke Brooklyn Bagels is a disaster and sickly place, it's only a matter of time they go out of business! I will be calling the healthy department on them for a full investigation! Boy did they mess with the wrong guy. Don't believe any of the good review and please don't waste your time at this pig pit of a place they have the nerve to attach the word Brooklyn to! It should be called, the Brooklyn Dump.   Honestly I was sick to my stomach watching the dirt bag crew of filth walking around. They can't clean themselves why would they keep the place clean. Rude and disgusting!"}
{"text":"They have Chocolate Chip Cream Cheese right now!!!!! RUN and get some because it's good!!!!! Like really good!!! They also have Pumpkin, totally trying that next!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I can count on good food, fast service and a courteous staff. Their wraps are incredible and my wife is a huge fan of their egg bagels and coffee. Apparently the new ownership has really turned things around. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! They have amazing food! Their bagels are perfect! I live in mountains edge and drive all the way over here just for a bagel! The owner is also very sweet! Very friendly and gave me some ideas on what to do with my bagels! Thanks, I can't wait to try it out! So everyone looking for a bagel spot definitely come check these guys out! You won't be disappointed!!!! Now I'm going to go enjoy my everything bagel with cream cheese"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for lunch and took it to go. The lady was very friendly and she made my sandwich correctly. It was so good! And i don't think they're overpriced- i got the California Turkey (or something like that) a bag of chips and a drink for $7.50. They have Tastykakes and Wise potato chips. Mmm, Mmm, Mmm."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel place. Whether you want their bacon/egg/cheese breakfast bagel or just a bagel with cream cheese - this place is fast, friendly, cheap and really, really good. They are so friendly, the place was clean and I got my bagel fix, I will be back and back and back!"}
{"text":"The location and appearance was pleasing enough for me to give it a try, always looking for good breakfast  spots. Bottom line: 1. Employee appearance was lousy, lacked pride in oneself. Shirt was filthy from wiping hands on it, come on, use the sink. It was 6am! Really! 2. Employee was bothered by having to fix my order. 3. 2nd employee walks in from outside and handles my food, no washing hands? Yikes!  i don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Brooklyn Bagels is a all around good alternative to Einstein if your not fortunate enough to have one close by.  The stores are usual smaller than most Einstein's and offer a lot less selection wise.  The bagels are good not great but then again it's hard for someone from the East coast to really enjoy a bagel or a donut out west."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  great bagels. Friendly atmosphere. We come here almost every morning for breakfast and we will continue to come back."}
{"text":"The bagels here are overpriced and mediocre.  But, it's in the neighborhood so we stop by occasionally due to proximity.  The bagels are essentially round bread instead of bagels.    They do seem to provide some community activities.  A large banner outside advertises chess for kids every Friday evening.  So, I appreciate that.    Brooklyn Bagel Deli is there when you want bagels and aren't too finicky about the quality.  It's along the lines of Big Apple Bagels and other equivalent pseudo-bagel joints.  But, my experiences have been that staff is friendly and well, it's better than nothing when the lazy-weekend bagel craving hits."}
{"text":"This is my Go-To place for breakfast. Tasty bagels and they are quick. I usually get the lox sandwich bagel... the lox has good flavor... not fishy and just the right amount of smoky-ness. The husband usually gets the Original on Everything.... eggs, sausage and cheese all on a fantastic bagel. Their bagels are not dough-y but are big and filling."}
{"text":"Well to start, the lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful..  The entire place turned me off a bit, just seemed a little unorganized and maybe not totally clean.  The bagels themselves were delicious. However the salmon on my sandwich was uncooked which I guess I didn't realize that's how it came. My husbands Philly cheesesteak sandwich was not amazing. And the French toast bagel had about a pound of cream cheese and not in a good way.   Overall let's say I'm sticking to Einstein bagel."}
{"text":"For a \"bagel\" shop, their bagels are pretty bland and rock hard. My favorite bagel is cinnamon raisin w/ strawberry shmear... Well, they failed this combo with a half toasted, unfresh bagel, with a poorly executed shmear spread that doesn't taste like strawberry at all... decided to additionally try a Blueberry shmear... and it tasted like cough medicine.  I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"This place is very \"meh\". I was expecting more; if you have a place you go to already for bagels, stick with that. The bagels were just alright, and they put a crap load of cream cheese on them. It was really busy when I went it, so maybe that explains why my bagel was not warm when it was supposed to be \"toasted\""}
{"text":"Maybe I caught this place on an off day, but the bagels I bought first thing (7am) in the morning seemed like they were baked the night before and not fresh. It was crowded and the only employees were two guys behind the counter, and they seemed really rushed. I didn't expect extra customer service, but they were nice enough. I felt kinda sorry for them.  I had to pick up a dozen for a work meeting and I made my selection and they were placed in a brown bag and handed to me. Done.  Okay, that's what I came in for, but I needed a few plates and napkins as I was headed to a work meeting. Nothing like that is offered here. Good thing we keep a few extra paper plates around the office, otherwise I be serving bagels on paper towels from the break room. Einstein Bagels is a much better option. If you need bagels for a meeting, this is not the place to grab some. And they bagels tasted just okay, nothing great. Maybe next time I'll just get donuts."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town!! The Original is the best with bacon., and they fry a real egg, which is way better than some places that put that scrabbled crap. They make their own bagels and they taste 100 time better than that Einstein crap. The staff is always friendly. Always have a great experience."}
{"text":"Love this Brooklyn Bagel. Super friendly staff consistently. The food is always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Bagels are one of my favorite things to eat. Ever. My East Coast self is used to having an amazing bagel shop on every other corner and being able to cure my hangovers with an amazing breakfast sandwich. Moving out here I was missing that part of my life for quite a while. I explored multiple bagel shops and just could not find one that could rival what I was used to back home. Until one day a friend suggested this place and I must say I am impressed. Although it's not a New York bagel, it's the best I've found here in Vegas. I have returned to Brooklyn Bagel time and time again and I will continue to return time and time again. Amazing breakfast sandwiches and pretty great iced coffee. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My gf and I LOVE Brooklyn bagel,  the staff is very kind and welcoming, the bagel sandwiches though good, are not my favorite, what really impressed us is their pastrami sandwich(on sourdough) and the rueben (also chose sourdough) was EXCEPTIONAL. Generous portion of tender meat, full of flavor on tasty toasted bread.  A Lot of people complain about service and cleanliness on here which I honestly don't understand. It's a great environment and when you treat the staff nice, they are nice back.  It's a two way street to me.  We appreciate them, they appreciate us. Thank you Brooklyn bagel!"}
{"text":"Coming from NY, I was hard pressed to find a perfect bagel...until I found Brooklyn Bagel...not only is the bagel authentic,  they are delicious.  The staff  go above and beyond in friendliness which makes it a perfect breakfast/lunch stop."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. Horrible communication between the guy taking the order and the lady cashiering. My order was made incorrectly, I was given attitude for requesting it to be fixed, and the cashier attacked me for not ordering correctly and ended up kicking me out of the establishment for defending myself.  This was only my second time here, SORRY for not knowing that the guy taking the order isn't going to relay to the cashier specifics of my order. SORRY I'm not going to stand there and be attacked by restaurant employees. How embarrassing.   I can definitely say I will NEVER go back to this place, EVER."}
{"text":"This place makes edible magic that is absolutely fantastic.  I've eaten here countless times and each time I finish my breakfast sandwich I look forward to the next time I can come back to get another.  The staff is wonderful here.  The food is amazing.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  Do yourself a favor and stop reading.  Just go here and enjoy."}
{"text":"We eat here waaaay too much to admit. The employees are great and have been there forever. They know our order and are always friendly and attentive. It's like going over to your friend's house for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, and easy breakfast spot! One of my friends recommended this place because they make the best bagel sandwiches. I probably go here once a week. The bagels are fresh, and there are tons of combinations to satisfy even the most picky eaters.   Drinks - they have everything from juices to soda to milk to coffee. They coffee is hot and strong. A small cup will hold you over.   Food - I am sometimes a creature of habit. I usually order the lox bagel sandwich on an Asiago bagel. It is HUGE! They hook it up and give you lots of toppings.   Perfect for a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"In the mood for a bagel and was in the area of \"The Brooklyn Bagel Deli.\" Meandered my way in looking for a nice little hold me over meal.  The lady at the counter was very pleasant and even guided me over to the proper place to order my food, as I was apparently lost and trying to order at the pay window.  Lol thank you to my wonderful bagel guide for putting my back on track lol.  I eventually ordered the California Club on an everything bagel, salt and vinegar chips with a 20oz drink to ensure it all went down properly.  To my delighted surprise the total came in just south of $10.00. WHOA   There was plenty of seating in various size table options, a TV, and local radio stations played throughout the place. My food arrived in no time which was also a pleasant surprise. The sandwich was very nicely put together with plenty of turkey and bacon and loads of flavor.  Nothing over the top amazing but definitely exactly what I was in the mood for.  The chips and drink finished of the meal nicely, and I was just the right amount of full.  While not a five star experience \"The Brooklyn Bagel Deli\" is doing it right, and when I'm in the area and the bagel fix is in need of being subsided; I will meandering my way in again.  Hopefully to the right line this time."}
{"text":"Brooklyn Bagel $4.30 for a 7 oz tub of cream cheese? Really? I ordered a dozen bagels and asked for 2 containers of cream cheese. My total was $18.32. I was in a hurry for work and didn't notice until later how much cream cheese was. What a ripoff! Both containers of cream cheese were about as much as the dozen bagels. Next time I will stick with Panera Bread just down the street...a dozen bagels w/ cream chees is only $12.99 plus the bagels there are soooo much better. Fail."}
{"text":"Visiting from Nanakuli Hawaii.  Place was great!   Food was fresh made to order,  tasty and staff was very friendly and courteous!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best bagels I have ever had! Will be a regular customer!  My wife and I both got bagel sandwiches,  I go what I think is a tijuana hot and she got an original with bacon. Both incredible.   Their fresh cream cheese is also amazing with many flavors"}
{"text":"They charge $3.50 cents for a side of 2 small shriveled up pieces of bacon. I am from NY & I am a Chef here in Vegas. For them to label themselves as \"Brooklyn\" bagels is an insult to NY. First off their bagels are small and have no puff to them or flavor. Their bagels are a 5/10. The pancakes are good but the price of bacon is an outrage. And the staff looks like they're all ex-drug addicts. Some have missing teeth and look homeless."}
{"text":"Excellent Bagels! Great service! Family owned!  They have great breakfast combinations, good coffee and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, great service.  Best bagel shop in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hard to get decent bagels in these parts. Also thought it was a Jewish deli which it was not. The breakfast looked decent but I am basing review solely on the bagels. Got 1.5 dozen and 3 smears for work. They were good but not amazingly incredible as I was hoping for. But again, for LV above par.   Guy behind the counter seemed put off assisting people. The guy who rang me out was extremely friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"Best lox bagel on earth. Very nice customer service at 7am. I must say I love smoked salmon. This had to be the best melt in your mouth lox ever."}
{"text":"Always quick. Always remembered when im around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is the second time I arrived from Durango and 215 to find them closed.  They do not CLOSE at 4.  They CLOSE at 3!  Other than their bagels were amazing the last time I came."}
{"text":"These are the closest things to NY bagels I have found out here in Vegas. I miss stopping at deli's for egg sandwiches on the weekends back home- but this place is a pretty good substitute. Everyone in there is super helpful and polite. They've never gotten my order wrong, and its always clean."}
{"text":"If you want that authentic \"feels like I'm not in Las Vegas\" type of bagel joint then this is your place.  The workers here are very genuine and and kind. Great at their job. The people who eat here create a vibe that really makes you feel like waking up at 6:00 am to get a bagel is definitely worth it. It's not often you see local places like this in Las Vegas, especially places that really give great quality food and service . Hugely recommend!! Great Lox!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I stopped by for lunch and am not normally a bagel sandwich person (not a good bread:filling ratio) but I was pleasantly surprised by this sandwich today. I got there kind of late in the day so they were out of a few varieties of bagels, but the Everything bagel for my sandwich was just right. They also have fresh cream cheeses that I will be checking out in the future.   The service was really friendly, but the woman ahead of me ordered her bagel to go and I ordered mine to stay, and the woman flipped the two around. Not a big deal, but still a slight error.   Definitely will be back, particularly to try the breakfast offerings or just a plain bagel!"}
{"text":"I can't remember why I gave it 4 stars. I come here regularly and have been here 3 days in a row so clearly I am a fan! Friendly staff who remember their locals :)"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in NY and when i first walked into Brooklyn Bagel it brought me back home! Love this place! Best bagels outside of NY!"}
{"text":"The bagels are good, but I take them home and cream cheese them myself. They always seemed a little short staffed on Saturdays and I get a little nervous as just because you have gloves on does not mean it is sanitary to hold frozen sausage and then reach in the bagel bins for someone else..that type of thing could be improved, but they bagels are always fresh.."}
{"text":"5 star customer service? No way! I'm sorry it takes me a couple minutes to look over your menu, but there is no one else in the restaurant... so am I really that much of a hindrance? I still tipped you, and you really want to give me that much of an attitude bagel man? Not even a \"have a nice day.\" Your sandwiches aren't even that good."}
{"text":"Wow, was just there last week and was so sad to see you gone. We just moved here a few months ago and you were one of 3 in the Vegas area that had \"real\" NY bagels. Yes, only a newyorker would know. You had a few challenged workers and ran out of product but I'm so bummed. I heard that you ended up with a slumlord that hiked your rent. I'm hoping that you find a new location as there are quite a few and we'll follow! Please say you'll open elsewhere?"}
{"text":"I needed a Starbucks boost before work, and spotted Brooklyn Bagel Deli in the same shopping center. Since my tummy was a little rumbly, and my coffee stop was potentially going to make me a few minutes late for work, I decided to get a dozen bagels for my co-workers.   A dozen assorted bagels and a thing of plain cream cheese set me back around $13.  I asked if they could be sliced, one employee said they could but apparently did not relay the information to the employee that actually bagged my bagels as they were not sliced.   The bagels themselves were fine other then the lack of slicing. Not exceptional though. I will probably go to an Einstein's next time instead of back here..."}
{"text":"The tables are always filthy and sometimes the staff seem like they can't be bothered to deal with you, but the bagels are pretty tasty and they definitely soothe my bagel jones when I'm having cravings."}
{"text":"Good food. Very nice service. We will be stopping here again. We tried their breakfast wrap and sandwich. They were very good. Want to come back and try much next."}
{"text":"I am so sick of this place. food is at best average. Too expensive for cream cheese that you get very little of. But the worst of it is, the service! What are the thinking!  They older guy (manager ?)  is a rude jerk. Unfriendly sad little man who should try another line of work as he has NO people skills! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Sandwich spot near the corporate area in Green Valley.  You can pick your bagel then pick toppings or one of the choices on the menu. They have breakfast and lunch items. The bagel combo comes with a side and a pickle.  Decent price and decent taste."}
{"text":"Second time coming to the Brooklyn bagel Deli and the food is delicious! First time I went I got a California club sandwich and a breakfast bagel. And now I'm here again getting a Denver bowl and it is very delicious!"}
{"text":"It only took me three years to get into this place and I loved it. My husband comes here for lunch once and in awhile and said I needed to give it a try since I love bagels.  The menu has some many lunch options that can be ordered as a wrap or on bread or bagel. There are plenty of breakfast options as well and they aren't limited to bagels. I love that sandwiches come with the option of chips, potato salad, or macaroni salad. Most places just offer basic chips so I love that they have more options. If chips are your thing they have plenty of different flavors. I don't know if I've seen a better drink selection anywhere else. In addition to fountain drinks they also have iced tea, coffee, bottled sodas, juices, and waters. The bottled juices offered the largest selection of the beverages.    The employees were friendly and prepared our order in a timely manner. They were nice about answering questions about the menu and offering suggestions. My only critique of my visit would be that the tables and chairs could have used a clean up. We probably arrived at the end of the Sunday rush before they had a chance to clean up, but there weren't any clean tables during our visit.  I had the Santa Fe on an asiago bagel. The jalapeno cream cheese had great heat and flavor. The turkey was piled on as high as they could go without making it difficult to eat. There was a nice amount of lettuce and tomato, but it was neatly located at the bottom so that the sandwich was easy to eat. The bagel was very good and had great texture. I loved the potato salad and the side portion was the perfect amount."}
{"text":"We have been there twice and the food has been pretty good both times. Each time we have to tell them to put on gloves. Last time we went, we watched them use dirty hands to get bagels for the two customers ahead of us. Come on guys, use tongs to get bagels from the display- not dirty hands. We have never seen them wash their hands and consistently go between cash handling and food prep.  Dining room is fairly dirty and they never seem very happy about wearing gloves. Making excuses etc.  We would come much more frequently if they had attention to cleanliness and food safety."}
{"text":"This place has good bagels but the worst customer service ever. I go up to order a sandwich an this uninterested girl with purple/gray hair comes up n I said hi how r u an she didn't even have the courtesy to respond very rude if u r that unhappy then I would not do service work as your nasty face will scare customers away like me"}
{"text":"So today I woke up around 9:30 and kind of felt like eating a bagel, though I usually don't eat breakfast (I know). I tried to stave it off but after a friend was coming over with Starbucks I decided to grab bagels to go with our coffee. She cancelled on me, but it was too late: I Yelped \"bagels\" and this place popped up and I was committed, plus it's super close by.  The inside of the joint was a little small but nothing too cramped. I tried to read through the menu but the case of bagels calling my name totally distracted me. I was torn between the cheddar and asiago bagels, but settled on the reliable cheddar; I was in the mood for something savory to pair with veggie smear or lox. But they do have a seasonal pumpkin bagel and matching cream cheese if you've been bitten by the Pumpkin Flavored Everything Bug.  The guy at the counter was nice and whatnot; he reminded me of the regular menu and asked if I wanted my bagel warmed and toasted (duh!). After I ordered I went to the other side of the counter where I told another dude what I ordered, added an iced coffee to it and paid. He let me put the amount of ice I wanted in my own coffee, which was amazing. I hate ice and Starbucks literally fills their cups with 2/3rds of ice, only to have an uber watered down, sweaty drink. I only waited for like 5 minutes and was on my way home. If you're planning on eating here, I would maybe reconsider because it looked like all the tables were full.  I went home and my iced coffee was delicious- super yummy and I'm really satisfied I didn't go to Starbucks next door because this was way cheaper and better. And I don't even like coffee (just the occasional sweetened, iced coffee)! I got the french vanilla flavor. My bagel! It was in a little brown bag, wrapped up like a present of goodness. At first I was like \"they forgot my cream cheese!\" but actually they cut the bagel in two halves and the cream cheese was already in the bagel, generously too, if I might add. Damn that was a good bagel. My stomach is telling me not to finish it because I am so full, but the remaining half is calling my name.  If you're in the area and want a cheap, good bagel, this is the place! Super quick, affordable service and excellent offerings! I might have to wake up sooner to come back here..."}
{"text":"A cup of Starbuck's sure goes good with a bagel. When I patronize the Pebble Marketplace Starbuck's in the morning, I prefer to compliment my cup of coffee with a Brooklyn Bagel Deli bagel with lox spread. Why not? Brooklyn Bagel Deli a few restaurants close to Starbuck's. And their bagels are superior to Starbuck's.     Just like a bagel deli in Brooklyn, parking can be an exercise in stress management. The Pebble Marketplace is one of those shopping centers where it is less stressful parking further than being blocked in at a nearer parking space if you get one. I prefer to park near the Bank of America.      Whenever I visit the Brooklyn Bagel Deli, it is customarily engrossed with people. I order the Bagel at the closer end of the counter, pay at the far end, and wait a few minutes for the bagel.       The Brooklyn Bagel Deli is a decent size with a sufficient amount of tables. But in my case it doesn't matter, nor does it matter that they have coffee because I am bringing my bagel a few feet away to Starbuck's where I will share it with a coffee at the outside patio if the weather is nice.       As far as the bagel, it might taste more like a bagel from Brooklyn, Indiana than Brooklyn, NY. It does not have that special taste that a New York bagel or even Bagel Cafe has. Their bagel tastes similar to one served in a chain like Einstein Brothers which could be in Brooklyn, Indiana. And that's a good thing. I like Einstein Bagels. And I liked the poppy seed and sesame seed bagels with lox spread, which is called salmon spread at Einstein Brothers. It seems that here they give more lox spread.       The unique thing about reviewing this Brooklyn Bagel Deli is that in my situation, it is part of a morning Starbuck's experience. The substance is the bagel with lox spread and the liquid is the Starbuck's beverage. In conclusion I could say that in Pebble Marketplace the best part of waking up is Starbuck's in your cup with a Brooklyn Deli bagel in your mouth."}
{"text":"I previously reviewed this deli when it was under prior ownership and cannot say much has improved in the interim. On entering we found a small line up of people ordering, but only a few tables occupied.  Based on our short stay, most of their business was for takeout. My wife ordered what turned out to be a mediocre tasting coffee and a (smallish) toasted cinnamon bagel that we shared.  The bagel was just okay.  None of the unoccupied tables had been recently bused and none of the employees seemed to care. A rating of 2.5 would be appropriate."}
{"text":"There's something special when a simple thing like a warm bagel can get your day going. I've passed by this place numerous of times and finally decided to check this place out. So not only do they serve bagels, but they have sandwiches, omelettes, pancakes, and French toast. They also do those bundle carryout-jug of coffee to go and a box of a dozen bagels. Good to know when the group needs a good hearty start with a cup of Joe.   What I also like about this place is that they have East Coast goodies like Boyle Heights Sodas in the glass bottle, Joe's Black and White cookies ( from New Jersey ), New York Seltzer,  and little Italian Rainbow cake bites to go. Am I from the East Coast? No, but a place with the name Brooklyn in it better have some East Coast delights in it. The black and white cookies are a definite must try. It was in the section with the sodas and drinks so I was worried that it would be hard. However, the cookie was more like a cross between a cake and cookies. Not crumbly like a hard cookie and not too soft. It was awesome. The white part was more like a vanilla frosting and the chocolate part was not too sweet. Great with coffee or tea. The Italian Rainbow cake bites are prepackaged and I was worried they would be stale and crumbly, but they were moist and had a taste of almond/vanilla. There are layers of green, pink and yellow  and are covered in chocolate. Just the right size for something sweet after a savory bagel.The workers there are also very friendly and efficient. I have ordered several different bagel sandwiches there and each one has been really good. My favorite would be the pork roll, egg, and cheese on an Asiago bagel. It's not too heavy and not too messy. Ususlly, I'm a simple bagel and cream cheese person, but their flavor combos have been solid so I keep trying different things on their menu. They are open early and close in the later afternoon, so check the hours before you head down there. Otherwise, this is a great spot to grab a good breakfast to get your day going."}
{"text":"We love love love this place! we have been coming here multiple times a month for the last year and a half and they treat us so well. We always come with our dog Thor and we have the best experience. As a Long Island transplant, I can definitely say the bagels are fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with high hopes. I love a good bagel.   First thing I noticed was the high prices $2.99 for a bagel with schmear? I don't mind paying for a product as long as its good.  I put my order in and look for a place to sit down. All of the tables are dirty. There was an employee sitting down. He didn't even look around and see the dirty tables? Where's the pride?  As I look around, I notice all of the employees are wearing their street clothes. No uniform, or shirt that says Brooklyn Bagel. One employee was wearing basketball shorts!  I order coffee, he hands me a Styrofoam cup. Who still uses Styrofoam???? I go to put creamer and sweetener in my coffee. All of the coffee condiments are in pumps. All of them are clogged because they are never cleaned. I had to press hard to get it to pump, it was trickling out, all the time I am hoping it doesn't unclog and explode all over me.  I'm waiting, waiting, and waiting. People that came after me got their food. The guy looks at me and has an epiphany moment and realizes he forgot about my order  I already paid or else I would have left. I sit down and he approaches me and asks me what I ordered again. If it's busy, write it down!  I ordered the breakfast sandwich with a jalapeño cheddar bagel. It was good but not that good.  They have a decent product, but a filthy store and employees with no pride and a clear lack of management is an uphill battle to overcome.  They have nothing on Einstein bagels. They have better service, coffee and their stores are clean."}
{"text":"Love this place!    It doesn't have the nicest interior but the food is great.  I haven't tried anything that I haven't liked.  They have crazy fresh bagels and handmade cream cheese.    I always come over while on lunch break and they are very fast.  Typically I have my food in less than five minutes."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time as i was in this shopping center. Bring from NYC I know bagels. Had a everything bagel and lox. 5 star food. What I did not like was the deferred maintenance on some of the chairs. just covered with duct tape. looks very run down in those areas. but I definitely would return"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5 star review, but not 3.  I went around 8 AM on a Thursday.  So, prime time for people on their way to work.  It was pretty crowded, and they only had 2 employees working.  As a result, orders took awhile.  I don't blame the guys working, they were doing the best they could.  But, the management should make sure they have help at peak times.  I had the spicy bagel, I can't recall it's name.  I think it's the Tijuana.  But, the cream cheese was not as spicy as advertised, nor was the jalapeno cheddar bagel.  Also, it was not toasted, which I did ask for.  But, I chalk this up to how busy the crew was.  I had the breakfast potatoes, which were done with diced onions and no discernible seasoning.  They required a LOT of salt, pepper, and hot sauce to give them flavor.  Also, a few of the potatoes were not completely cooked, and crunchy when bitten.  I think this dish has potential, but execution was way off.  All in all, I would probably return if I'm in the area, but I won't make a special trip.  I would like to try lunch, so I imagine we'll do that at some point."}
{"text":"I love me a bagel with cream cheese. I've passed this place for years and when my husband started a job close to Brooklyn Bagel I had the perfect excuse to stop in.  They have so many kinds of bagels. I was surprised to find low carb bagels too! They are very tasty you can't even tell the difference. I've tried their cheddar cheese bagel as well and WOW! It's so delicious! You can really taste the cheese in it. I also have become completely addicted to their homemade scallion cream cheese. It has chucks of garlic and scallions all through the double whipped cream cheese. I've also enjoyed their lox bagel. It comes piled high with smoked salmon, red onion and tomatoes. It comes with a side of your choice. Just a tip... If you hate miracle whip like I do stay away from the macorni salad.  Overall if you dig bagels and cream cheese and are in this area this is the place to stop!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time and ordered the lox bagel sandwich. It was good although they were a bit skimpy on the lox...come on man! I was surprised they offered pancakes and omelettes so I most likely come back to try those out."}
{"text":"I love bagels! It is impossible to make a bagel I do not like so I cannot complain about the food. The place was a mess! The people doing the cooking did not look much cleaner either. Then they must have given me some one else's order. When I got back to my office it was all wrong. The prices were also very high for what you are getting."}
{"text":"We decided to have one of our many recruiters meetings here.  Too bad it was the same day as the big storm that hit Vegas.    One thing I liked about this place was that there was ample seating.  Whether a booth or table, they had it and available.  I love the selection of bagels they have.  Any kind of flavor you can think out.  This day, I decided to get the breakfast wrap instead of a bagel as I'm trying to watch my figure LOL.  I chose to have bacon in there and the wrap was a spinach wrap.    The coffee was not that good.  We were originally supposed to go to Starbucks but it was so busy, we settled for BBD.  Since I was hoping for Starbucks coffee, I think having the BBD coffee was a little let down.  The wrap though, was a completely different story.  It was packed with egg, cheese and bacon.  I seriously didn't want this experience to end.  The cheese was oozing out and the best part, it was a light meal overall!  One thing I was worried about though, was the front door.  Looked like there was a lot of leaks going on and the water was coming in the restaurant.  I would definitely say to check the roof with the property management or the next time we have a storm come through, this location will definitely be under water!"}
{"text":"I moved to Henderson over 2 years ago  and the biggest thing I miss from the west side is a good bagel. As it is impossible to find a bagel as good as the bagel cafe on Buffalo I found Brooklyn bagel. For a year the bagels were acceptable, nowhere near bagel cafe but I could live with it. However the last 6 months the bagels have changed and after today I definitely will never go back. The bagels now are more like bialys, they are flat and dry with no flavor. I don't know if they changed the recipe but they are getting no rise. A Bagel should have a nice light crisp to the outside and the inside be soft and a a little chewy. Not these anymore, just dry and flat. I will have to go to the South Point now as The Del Mar Deli is owned by the bagel cafe for a good bagel."}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker and I am giving this place high marks!  I would be happy to give 5 stars just for the cream cheese with FRESH chives in it, so tasty!  The onion bagel had an authentic flavor to it even if, as other east coasters have noted, the consistency isn't quite right. A true NY bagel has a pretty thick and crisp outside and therefore doesn't need to be toasted. But I had this one fresh and not toasted and I really enjoyed it.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Best bagels I've had in a long time, although I came at lunch and ordered 2 bagel sandwiches and it was $15! I can spend less and get more at other sandwich places...which was my only reason for giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went over today and the apparently have closed. Everything has been emptied out of the space. I will miss them."}
{"text":"The main reason I give one star is because of the quality and taste of the bagels and shmear. Anyone who says that these bagels are good in one of these reviews should go to Einsteins and try anything that they have, I promise you will never want to come here again. The place looked sort of dumpy but kept cleanish. The employees seemed okay, not much of an interaction besides the guy running my debit card playing the register like a beat drum the whole time he was waiting for the card machine to finish."}
{"text":"Ask a New Yorker... this is the ONLY place in Henderson to get a great bagel. They have a real grill so they don't microwave your eggs and bacon like Einsteins. The bagels are made fresh and are amazing.  I travel 20 minutes every Saturday morning just to get my morning breakfast sandwich and it is worth it.  The service is also so warm and friendly.  Highly recommend. If you haven't been there you are missing out!!!"}
{"text":"We come here every weekend! The staff here is amazing. Feel like it came straight from NYC! This location is not owned by the same owners as the others here in Vegas. By far one of our favorite casual breakfast spots in Vegas!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I wasn't in the mood for a full breakfast at The Cracked Egg so going across the way for an egg sandwich made perfect sense. I'd been meaning to check out this bagel store.  But I was hoping for one of those authentic Brooklyn Bagel places - those great big delicious bagels NY is known for, good prices, quick service.  This place only sort of delivered.    The service was quick but not necessarily friendly.  I'm a morning person and breakfast makes me happy.  C'mon lady.  How about a smile?  The woman at the counter didn't crack one once.    The prices weren't bad but they weren't Brooklyn bagel store prices.  There are a lot of things NY is known to be expensive for... but luckily bagels aren't one of them.  There isn't a cheaper or simpler, more satisfying meal for your money than something involving a bagel in NY.  Paid almost 5 bucks for an egg and cheese on a bagel here, which isn't the worst I've paid in this region.  But that leads me to authenticity...  The bagels are kind of small.  Those Wise NY deli chips and the black and whites kind of remind me of back home.  And the place doesn't feel as \"chain-y\" as Einstein.  I like the dining room.  It's clean and spacious.  There are nice tables outside.    It was a nice little breakfast and I'd go back if I'm in the mood for a bagel.  I just wish it reminded me more of the real deal."}
{"text":"Favorite bagel place in town. We come here every Sunday. LOVE the food and the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"$3.23 for ONE bagel and cream cheese !!! I think that is too high, I was told the price for cream cheese keeps going up.  I know the bulk rate is cheaper than in the supermarket.  Taking advantage of the public !!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here once or twice a week for about 7 years, I've always had wonderful service and great food. The staff is always friendly and upbeat. Always my go to place for breakfast or brunch. They never disappoint me! Thank you Brooklyn bagel for always being a place I can count on!"}
{"text":"I have had many meals here everything is al,ways great.  Service is great.  Place is spotless.  The owner is in there working hard.  She is a great lady out to please.  Her help is great too.  Teamwork is what this place is.  I look forward to the next time I go which will probably be Saturday.                              I am adding another comment.  I just stopped in for. A sandwich to go.  Everyone that worked there was cordial and wonderful staff.  Saw the owner and she was so fantastic.  Thanked me for my buisness.  Alway s spotless in there.  It busy time of day also.  If you haven't tried it you must.  Breakfast or lunch.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, always make you feel welcome.  Awesome bagels. Would recommend this place to everyone that likes bagels."}
{"text":"First time here.  It's always a good sign when there is a line at 730am.  I tried the Nova Lox Sandwich.. Delicious.  Everything bagel with cream cheese, nova lox, onions, tomato and capers. Comes with a good dill and a side of either potato or macaroni salad.  Add a large black coffee and I couldn't ask for more.  Possibly found my new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé visited NYC last year and fell in love with rainbow bagels they were so good, now I know there's really nothing too special about them since it's just food coloring but we loved them. We were hunting for breakfast one day and I saw that this place did rainbow bagels. We went and came to find out they only do the rainbow bagels when it's cooler outside because it has to do with the proofing of the dough or something. So we were a little disappointed but still decided to eat here cause we love bagels! I got the steak and egg bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and it was very good (though we went later in the afternoon the bagels were still pretty fresh tasting. I stole some cream cheese from my fiances lox bagel sandwich and put it on mine and it elevated the flavor nicely helped it not be so dry. She got the lox bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel and it was also pretty good. I'd def recommend this place for your bagel fix. They also have some nice beverage options and they also have black and white cookies one of my absolute favorites! They're joeys B n' W's shipped in from jersey. Check em out if you're craving a bagel!"}
{"text":"Horrible service- I bought 9 dozen bagels, filled a frequent card up and they refused to accept it for the free dozen.  They told me to go to eastern even though most bagels were purchased there"}
{"text":"A perfect bagel for this Jersey girl ! Very friendly staff ,great service. Good breakfast variety , lots of bagel flavors and cream cheese spreads."}
{"text":"The Lox sandwich is the only thing that brings me back, it's Delish! Service is a hit or miss and place could use some updating (booths, chairs and trashes)"}
{"text":"Upgrading Brooklyn to a 5-star rating! As you can see by my 150+ check-in's I seriously heart this bagel shop. I consistently receive outstanding customer service. Everyone is always smiling and they take the time to ask how my day is going. Right as I walk in (and it doesn't matter who is behind the counter) they'll get my order started in a jiffy; I don't even have to say a peep. This for me is huge because I am always stopping here on my way into work and I'm in a hurry.  The restaurant is always clean, they have TVs hanging on the wall for you to watch the news in the morning, they sell newspapers if reading is your thing and they have large, comfy booths for you to sit in. Their cream cheese to-go is hand packed (which they have a large selection of flavors - think salmon, strawberry, cheddar bacon, veggie & more) and they have a very large selection of beverages & snacks. My daughter loves picking up a Belly Washer and a Go-Gurt to go with her chocolate chip bagel :)  They have a Monday Madness special running right now - buy 6 bagels and get 3 free. You can't beat that!   If you are currently frequenting other bagel shops, I challenge you to try Brooklyn, just one time. I did many years ago and now I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"We buy bagels for our sales meetings twice monthly here. Jordan, who knows good food, says they are the best. I'm beginning to agree the bagels and cream cheese are better than Einstein's Bagels - and I didn't think that was possible. I just tried the Cheddar Bagel with Cheddar Bacon Cream Cheese. OMG. And the Vegetable Cream Cheese has nice chunks of vegetables. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I am not much of a breakfast person.. but I found the California Club and It is delicious .. the staff is friendly and know my order when I come in.. I come in at least once a week for my craving.. they also have the best Jalapeño cream cheese.. been eating here for over 3 years.."}
{"text":"After craving a good ole NY sesame bagel with lox and cream cheese this place sounded good on Yelp so it seemed like a no brainer.... not so much:( I wasn't impressed with their $8 bagel with cream cheese and lox. The cream cheese had decent flavor but the lox was not too flavorful and they were rather cheap with it. The customer service is great though."}
{"text":"If you're short on time, this place is great for a quick lunch... Always fast and friendly. Try the Tijuana Hot on the jalapeño bagel, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"went there on Sunday morning for the first time.  Bagels were great.  Coffee on the other hand was not great.  Not a lot of options to choose from,  no organics or any descriptions on what to choose from.  One machine had a out of order sign.  we all like a great coffee to go with these great bagels...  bring in a better coffee and ill be happy to pay a higher price.."}
