{"text":"Pretty good for an airport restaurant! It's owned by his host, which is a good and bad thing. Seems like pretty decent quality control, but the food was pretty bland, definitely from a chain. If you are stuck having to eat in an airport it's on the better end! I had the jerk burger and my wife had the Cobb salad. The burger was cooked pretty well"}
{"text":"There are just two differences between Rum Bar & Grill and Burger King, BK has good food for the buck, and Rum Bar & Grill has a bar.  Just had the Coconut Mango Chicken Salad and one 9oz glass of Sonoma Chardonnay. My food came to just under $13 and there were more wilted greens on my plate than a field in Ireland after a really bad storm.  And for the money charged, I had the UN-pleasure of eating with deeply discounted plastic cutlery.  You know...the kind you get at an old school block party back in the 70's.    My glass of wine totaled just over $20, but at least it was delivered in a carafe.  Seriously, $20 would have bought me a bottle of Sonoma Coutre at Walmart.    I get it.  I am at the airport and business travelers tend to be less sensitive.  But...seriously???   I am giving Rum Bar & Grill two stars because my Server was on top of her game.  She was attentive, friendly and quick.  It just isn't her fault the final product sucked.    If you find yourself in terminal E at the Charlotte airport I suggest stopping to eat at the grab n go across for Rum Bar & Grill and then walking over for a beer.    I'm done!!!"}
{"text":"On a layover to France at the Charlotte airport, and I couldn't resist the hip, inviting decore.  I was convinced to get a a $3 double rum and coke, and I ordered the chicken fingers and chips.  The drink was absolutely weak (double? No free pour here!).  The chicken was good, but $10 was a bit too steep e en for airport food.  I would advise sticking to shots."}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good for airport food :) Had the jerk chicken bowl and it tasted good. The price seems a bit high for the amount of food that you get but that is probably due to being located at an airport."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but scant!!! I got the omelet that came with breakfast potatoes. I promise you there were literally 5 pieces of potatoes (slightly smaller than steak fries). Good thing I'm on weight watchers because I would've made a fuss. My travel buddies got an order of pineapple pancakes. 3 pancakes came with 3 strips of bacon. The bottom pancake was the only one that contained pieces of pineapple. Overall the pancakes are nothing to shout about."}
{"text":"Drinks were lame even with extra pour. Burger came out on a McDonald's bun and chicken tacos tasted like they were in the fryer 10mins too long. Bartender was nice and it was in my terminal."}
{"text":"Nearly $16 for a Bloody Mary that tastes like bath soap is outrageous. The food was nothing special either. Pick another place to eat if you're stuck in CLT on a layover (the Mexican place between terminal C and D)"}
{"text":"Solid service. Mediocre fare. Incessant steel drums. The nachos were typical but still appetizing. We each got a salad which came out to be disappointing but still edible.   The sweet tea is really sweet."}
{"text":"Ordered a wine off the menu. Sorry ran out but we have this substitute at twice the price So I ordered a spirit again on the printed menu Answer \"Don't know why that's on there we have never had it.     They did have ice water no lemon, gave me time to read reviews so luckily I can't try to  describe the food.       If they had it !    Can't fairly rate the service, but the management is beyond poor"}
{"text":"What a waste of money, low grade food with super low service. Bad restaurant in a peime locaton. I travel through charlotte a lot, this ia the worst restaurant yhat i have ever visited in. Do not go"}
{"text":"Should have read other reviews before eating here. Got the Mahi mahi plate to go, was so bad that I ended up trashing it at the gate. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Ate there this week. First, it took forever to even be recognized. Then the Mahi Mahi had no taste, the rice and beans were crunchy. They brought two sauces that still did not do it. I would not recommend wasting your time here. Please find someplace in the airport to eat."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you anything about the food (nothing on the menu is Puerto Rican) as I waited 45 minutes for a burger that never arrived. Since I was drinking water I just left. Sevice is terrible the waitress checked on me after the 40 minute mark. Service that slow shouldn't be in an airport."}
{"text":"I didn't know that seat yourself really meant no service.   The service is just about nonexistent. Not a place if you are in a hurry to catch a flight."}
{"text":"Nachos with jerk chicken were fine,  but a smaller portion than you're used to. Good for new years resolutions I suppose.   The poor rating is for how a waitress (not mine) treated an old guy. He got a sandwich from the restaurant's take out counter,  then sat down to eat it. He left the bag on the table and started to leave. The waitress yelled at him to take the bag to a trash can on the concourse.  He said it was from her restaurant. She yelled again.  I was embarrassed for the old guy and she certainly disrupted other diners."}
{"text":"Great wings..menu looks delicious ..looking forward to trying the cuban sandwich on the way back through here..friendly and helpful bartender"}
{"text":"Ordered the honey rum Shrimp bowl and it was ok at best! But the price of 15.99 plus 2 bucks for the guacamole comes to a total of 18.00 dollars. I would give the food 2 stars at best.... Drinks were a 3 or a 4 stars tho!"}
{"text":"This place was conveniently located right near our gate at the airport.  This is a bacardi-themed restaurant that serves up some quick takes on Cuban cuisine.  Since I had to run, I ordered a Cuban sandwich and a bloody mary.  They offered a double shot for just $3 more so I took them up on their offer.  The food took a little while to come out and was ok.  I think they nuked the sandwich though because by the time I got to the end, the bread was hard as a rock.  Not bad, overall."}
{"text":"Server was on his game but bartender needs to resign. Her standards and attitude need some additional adjustments or maybe she needs some refresher training on how to clean glasses and how to serve wine. My glass was dirty and had not been dried. Also, lots of drama within the staff...females. The guys were staying busy."}
{"text":"I hit these guys the day after the worst snow storm in a decade to come through Charlotte. The staff had spent the previous night at the airport and was exhausted. I got the nachos, which were terrible. However, my waitress got it taken off my bill without me even asking for it.  The wait staff was amazing! Will definitely go there again even if it's in a concourse I hardly ever visit."}
{"text":"Place looked decent for an older airport like Charlotte from the menu, wasn't busy at all on a Sunday morning. We sat ourselves, waitress came over within a couple minutes. First off and I dont want to be rude but she smelled funky....just a really heavy body odor smell. That alone should've been a tip. We ordered immediately, Cuban sandwich and a salad...then waited....and waited...and finally we saw the food come up.... And waited....and waited as it was passed by numerous waitresses. After waiting a total of 25-30 mins and seeing our food sitting for 15 of that we decided to just get up and leave. We didn't even get stopped nor asked what was wrong and I didn't feel like having to explain the situation. Overall go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Super expensive! $13 for a Pi√±a Colada. WTF?!?  I guess that's what I get for ordering something like this at an airport. It was tasty. But not worth the price. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very expensive for an airport restaurant. I got the honey shrimp bowl. Delicious food. Still not worth the money. Prices weren't listed."}
{"text":"We stopped by Rum Bar & Grill during a recent layover in Charlotte, NC. I was absolutely starving, so was willing to eat anywhere. Rum Bar was conveniently located right across from our gate, so thought it was our best best for quick food during our short layover. My fiance ordered a gin and tonic. The first one was supposed to be a double and the second one was supposed to be a single - each one was made by a different person. The single was apparently stronger than the double. I ordered the chicken tacos and french fries. The food was okay - I've had better airport food. The service was slow and sub-par. If ever in this terminal again, I'll definitely eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite before my flight, I ordered a barbecue pork sandwich and a Sam Adams, then was faced with the question \"would you like a shot of liquor with you beer?\"  Uhhhhhh... For real? Are we all grownups here, or are we hiding in my parents' basement with a bottle of scotch that you nicked from your grandfather's liquor cabinet? It is 1 pm. Baring serious dependence issues, we do not need to do shots at lunchtime. Maybe that's the shtick here, but I'm not a fan.  And then my sandwich took like 25 minutes. Normally I'd be cool with that, but at an airport you know people are on a pretty tight schedule. I was going to be all upset about this, but the pork was delicious and my anger waned."}
{"text":"It's a small menu, but it's still a decent selection. However, if you have a small menu you should make sure to have the things in stock. I came in ordered a mojito (a signature drink of theirs) and a shrimp bowl. They tell me they are out of shrimp then after waiting 10 minutes and they run out of stuff for mojitos. They get two stars instead of one because the server was at least nice. ?"}
{"text":"Popped in while waiting on my flight back to Newport News.  Kinda cozy spot out of the hustle and bustle of the rest of the airport.  A few flat screens to catch up on \"whatever\" is showing.  Horseshoe bar seats plenty.  Bartender was friendly.  Food and drinks available.  Six or seven drafts for those like me that like to take a brew from the tap.  Menu seemed to follow the tropical flair - I didn't eat anything, so no comment there.  Overall a nice place to relax while you wait for that boarding announcement."}
{"text":"Service was definitely sub par - sat for more than 5 min without a server coming over. I could have gotten a better tasting burger and fries at Burger King for 1/2 the price. Won't come back here."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Charlotte, and decided to try this spot.  It was late and I was hungry, and they were closest to our gate. We didn't expect much, but boy were we in for a suprise.  I don't know how Cuban it is, but I had the chicken mojito, which was delicious!  I don't eat black beans, but I cleaned my plate.  The drinks were just okay.  We got something the waitress suggested, but I'd try something else next time.  I wish we had one of these close to home, because I would be there every week."}
{"text":"BLUF: this place is as bad as the ratings.   After a LONG international flight, we stopped at this place because frankly, Sushi was the only other choice outside of pre-wrapped sandwiches.   The Cesar salad was plain and the chicken tasted like something out of a bag (Cold).  Their wings, were horrible. The temperature was hot, but the wings were crispy like they had been fried and had sauce pour over them. The ranch that went along with them was tasteless and watery. Lastly, the water tasted like something out of the water hose.  The only reason they got 1 star was because of presentation and because the app won't let you rate them zero. Strongly recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mediocre rum burger, not awesome fries and flat soda pop...the wait staff was on island time...slow but friendly. One redeeming factor is the waiter gave is a to go soda."}
{"text":"Service was indifferent. I got chicken tenders, which were anything but tender.   I asked for an extra barbecue sauce. By the time I was delivered the sauce, I was almost done eating. One of the three chicken tenders, one was good but the other two were burnt.   The beer on tap was good. That's the only redeeming quality of this place , which time I will specifically avoid the next time I am in this airport."}
{"text":"Worst Mojito ever and $14! Ordered nachos with Jamaican jerk chicken too. Sounded great but they were not!"}
{"text":"The Mojitos were decent, but the bar food left much to be desired. It's a nice spot to wait for your flight, but you won't be impressed by the food even when considering the low airport standards."}
{"text":"The original Rum Bar located in Charlotte international airport was a pleasant stop for dinner in between flights. We shared the Cubano sandwich and the crispy chicken tacos. Both were slightly above average, and served quick. Decent selection of beers and liqueurs to choose from. Waiting staff was courteous enough. May come back."}
{"text":"It was a delicious flavor. Well balance between the mustard and mayonnaise, which is seems to be very hard for some restaurants to achieve the balance. The pork tenderloin tasted delicious. The fries were amazing as well. I also had a Lim√≥n Mojito, which I have ordered in many places in the US. Maybe is the Bacardi Lim√≥n that sets it apart from others in this restaurant. Overall, I will return to this spot when I come through CLT airport."}
{"text":"Not great. The bar is upscale. Nice atmosphere and televisions - good place to wait for a flight. However the drink prices are a joke! I had a mediocre mojito that ended up being 13.99! (No prices on the menu). Blue moon ended up being 7. Not really impressed with this place. No idea about the food but the drink prices are enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"We walked in and sat ourselves, which the sign stated to do. Someone said they would be with us. We waited, nothing, decided to leave and go somewhere else. Upon seeing us leave they said it would only be ten minutes for a drink.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Chicken was not jerk chicken and was very tough to eat ... Seasoned fries are more like cold fries with no seasoning ... And I already feel sick from eating here. Do not eat here before a flight unless you have iron stomach."}
{"text":"When I'm stuck in an airport it helps to find a place to eat that doesnt remind me that I'm in an airport.  And a bar at an airport really helps.  The service here is really snappy, which is a must for travelers trying to make their next connection.  I had the cuban, it was ok, didnt like the fries.  They are those twice fried french fries."}
{"text":"Portion was small considering the price. I ordered the \"island omelette\" with breakfast potatoes. I expected the omelette to be stuffed and a pile of potatoes. Nope! Weak little omelette  next to maybe 6 tiny potato turds. Lastly, my tiny shot of orange juice cost an extra $4! At least they played classic reggae music."}
{"text":"The only thing I really enjoyed was the music.  Food was overpriced for the quality I experienced.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"So you're at the airport and obviously there's limited options. If I were you I'd skip this place and find something else.   Food: Food was very average to below average. Fries were stale. Chicken tacos ehh, jerk burger was ok. Also it's way overpriced but hey you're stuck.   Service/decor: Average at best here too. Find somewhere else honestly."}
{"text":"Had 2 Margaritas.. were perfectly made but the downside was the price. $15 per margarita is expensive but again this is airport location. If it were $10 per drink then I think I would have given at leadt 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. The food was excellent and prices were ok. Will eat here again for sure. Saw several small kids and they appeared to be having fun too."}
{"text":"Would have given 1 but service was good. Boxed burger that was supposed to have Avocado on it but had a smattering of green guar gum based avocado goo. Menu is dishonest so buyer beware. Burger cool....Bun dried out but fries hot. Humph."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour at an airport for food. Shouldn't need much more reason for 1-star than that. The details: nothing complicated about our order, average amount of customers, waitress barely checked on us and showed zero urgency when we said we were boarding soon, manager we spoke to gave zero shits. Left $0.01 tip on an overpriced bill for average at best food. We arrived in plenty of time for a sit down meal given our layover. Airport robbery, usually when I get fucked the other party pays for dinner."}
{"text":"Twenty bucks for a pork & rice \"bowl\" and a bottle of iced tea. Gross mushy rice, topped with passable squash, zucchini and carrots then made impassible slopped in tomato sauce they call \"sofrito.\" Ok, sure. Then finished with cubed chunks of what they call pork tenderloin. Glorified high school cafeteria food disguised in well-it-ought-to-be-good prices.   Skip, skip, skip. Plenty of other places to eat in CLT."}
{"text":"I had a layover and considered the admiral's lounge just to get recharged and relax a bit.  I decided the Rum bar looked like fun so I tried it.  The service and the food was outstanding!  The waiter brought me a drink that wasn't on the menu and I absolutely loved it- a \"rum runner\".  I enjoyed the shrimp and veggie lettuce wraps as an appetizer then the corn tortilla grilled veggie tacos as a meal with the spicy rice.  Everything came hot and in good size portions.  I will definitely visit again.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Undecided about two options (sandwich Cubano or burger), ended up having the Rum burger because they had no Cubano!! Well, it was my luck.  When food showed up, it was not hot like if it was just cooked. Weird...however I decided to eat it as it was, I mean, it was not cold either. Fries were like the ones you get in McDonalds...as soon as they get cold, they get hard or with no taste. The burger was well prepared and tasty.  The soda was not properly carbonated. Go figure...maybe it was me. Service was good and I liked the pods they have for you to call your server when you need it.  Average place...the only reason I chose it (in spite of the 2.5 stars) was because it was in front of my gate and (very convenient) chargers in the table."}
{"text":"Small drinks, stale nachos, little flies.    There must be a better place.  I wish I checked yelp before I sat down.  Stay away  I will say that the service and bartender was fine."}
{"text":"This was airport food so nothing too exciting.  Had the chicken fingers and fries.  Both were fine but again nothing special as chicken fingers and fries are pretty basic.  Husband had chicken tacos and said they were good...plenty filling with just one but served as 2.  Mother in law's fries were cold when they came out so she said something and waiter brought hot fresh fries within minutes.  She had mahi mahi tacos and said they were good.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Getting breakfast here before I head to Jamaica. And if I wasn't having a mimosa. I wouldn't have woosaa the way I did. The server/bartender was not great with her customer service. The water to drink didn't seem clean. I opted to get my own water bottle. My pineapple pancakes was not good. Tasted raw. And have bits of pineapple but doesn't taste like it. I'm not sure if they knew that it's guarantee money since there's only a few restaurants in Concourse C/D. So customer service was not their priorities. But honestly I wish they would be more on top of things. All the wait staffs are very nonchalant. Stand around being chatty., while some customers are waiting to be serve and order to place. But now I know. I will dodge this place next time I'm at the airport!"}
{"text":"I always come here, not for food though.  6.49 for a large beer and $3 for shot with it.   Good place to get tuned up before the flight.  There is a better selection for food down by gate B"}
{"text":"Food was just ok... Not impressed at all. I was dying to have a good Cuban sandwich, but again I was not impressed. I asked the waitress if the mojito chicken was spice (for my daughtet) and she said no... Well I love spice food... And that's was pretty spicy!! And the mojito... Don't order that...13.59 and worse mojito I have had in my life!! Not coming back :("}
{"text":"I'm here at 9:30 pm in between flights. It's seat yourself,  I sat while a waitress just kept walking by me for about 10 minutes. I finally caught her attention and it seemed to bother her. Another waitress came over and I finally got a drink. I ordered  a jerk chicken  sandwich, terrible. No sauce, taste  like dried up chicken, no flavor. No jerk sauce. If you are pressed for time ,sit at the bar probably a better experience."}
{"text":"OK food, terrible service. It's a \"seat yourself\" restaurant,  so it took awhile to flag someone down to let them know we were even there. We quickly asked for waters and said we were ready to order but he insisted on getting the waters first. After about 15 minutes of watching him stand around joking with other waiters, he finally got the waters and took our order. The food actually came out really fast. The chicken jerk sandwich is just plain chicken with cheese and a tomato. There's nothing \"jerk\" about it, but still a decent sandwich for airport food."}
{"text":"Well cooked black beans were a surprise. We like black beans, but many restaurants under-cook them. I had the chicken mojito, prepared fresh, and it was well spiced and excellent, an under-used phrase at airports. My wife had the Cuban sandwich which was very good."}
{"text":"Dear god this place is horrific! I order wings and the came out raw the fries were cold this was after waiting 45 minutes. After no apologies or explanation and an additional 45 minutes later second order came out cooked but cold. I pray I don't get sick on my flight. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!!!!"}
{"text":"A nice little oasis at the Charlotte airport. The seating area is blessed with high ceilings and copious natural light, which might not work on a very sunny day but was perfect for my slightly overcast visit. To start with, my mojito made me very happy. Loads of fresh mint, used to great advantage.  I had a salad with a piece of skirt steak on top and it was much better than it should have been. This is real food from a real kitchen. Sure, the plastic cutlery is a drag (airport security), but I'd be surprised if you could do much better than this while at the airport in Charlotte.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Ripped off $15 for a bowl of dry chicken and disgusting rice.   I wish I could pull off a dine and ditch here but I'm a much better person than that.   I'm about to go to the super nice wine spot and get some smoked salmon that's actually worth the price.   Oh btw, that green basil in your glass, I saw the bartender clean her ear with her finger then continue to put basil in your glass"}
{"text":"I had a layover and decided to try Rum Bar & Grill.   I was glad I did!  There were a lot of different mojitos on the menu and I was about to order the Peach, but thought of the sugar and decided against it.  I got a Dirty Martini instead and it was good...Rum Bar didn't have Blue Cheese stuffed olives, but I wasn't expecting much anyway in the airport so not a big deal!  I had the Salmon Salad (the actual name of the salad was Lime-something Salmon Salad).  It was EXCELLENT.  It came out with a very nice-sized piece of perfectly cooked salmon.  VERY FRESH. Good flavor.    I will stop in Rum Bar every time I am in Charlotte International.  I almost hope I have a layover (Well, maybe that's going a little too far!)."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch and a few drinks while we were waiting for our flight. First, the place was packed and they had one poor girl (Stephanie) running herself ragged trying to keep up with everyone. For some reason they were out of a ton of stuff to make a lot of their drinks and dishes. If it weren't for Stephanie and her amazing service this place would have easily gotten a two or three star. Even though she was obviously slammed and working on her own for the most part, she held it down!   So restaurant itself: (3 stars) food was good but they were out of almost everything so it took a few tries to get something we wanted. My Bloody Mary was also bland.   Waitress Stephanie: 5 stars"}
{"text":"Horrific! Pre-existing unhappy starving and angry customers should have been a good enough sign. However we were too tired and hungry to drag ourselves to another place. Long story short not the place you want to eat if you have a flight to catch. They take LONG.   We ordered fish tacos and wings. Fish tacos were so-so. The wings... If only I had captured the sad look on my husband's face. It said it all."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this seat yourself spot while on a lengthier-than-planned layover in the CLT. I had a hankering for some light nibbles. My server was sweet, attentive and kept rather busy. I ordered the Cobb salad which came with jerk chicken and the cilantro lime vinaigrette. As a cilantro lover, I was a little disappointed that the dressing was lighter on the cilantro side, and I could certainly have done without the abundance of giant iceberg lettuce leaves, but the portion size was filling and the jerk chicken was well prepared. Had I been hungrier I would've opted for the wings or one of the burgers--both items went by and looked and smelled absolutely delicious. Next time.  Now to the important bits. Rum.  They have a nice variety of mojitos, and true to airport decorum the rum is poured quite generously. A couple more and I really could've put the lay in layover.  Good service and food in terminal D. Check 'em out if you're in the mood for a li'l island feel while landlocked in the airport."}
{"text":"Food is average, place is empty but trashed. Like nobody who works here has any interest in cleaning up anything. It's gross and nasty. Staff appears bored so it's not like they're slammed."}
{"text":"Wow, worst food ever. Worst service ever! Had about an hour to kill before my flight last week. Decided to grab a burger from the take out area of Rum Bar and the cashier suggested we sit in the dining room and we would be served. Nothing could be further from the truth. We decided to split an overpriced Grande Cheeseburger and fries. The service was extremely slow. The place wasn't busy at all and I saw other customers come in, sit, and wait at least 10 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged them. I decided to get a drink at the bar. That was an $8.00 mistake! A shot of Smirnoff for $8.00? I asked for a Coke and the bartender gave me something that looked and tasted like watered down, flat Pepsi. She was not very friendly, either. At least give me a kiss before you screw me! But, back to the burger. We waited forever! All the while we can hear our waitress in the back laughing it up with the cook, who should be cooking our food! Our flight was leaving in 15 minutes, so I flagged down the waitress and asked for the food to go since we were running out of time. I asked for a well-done burger, but this thing was burnt!! The fries were overcooked as well. Thankfully, I had grabbed several ketchup packets which were needed to choke this crappy food down.  If I hadn't been short on time I would have gotten my money back and found a better place to eat. I realize I was in the airport, but this food sucked even on an airport level!!!!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Wow...haven't had service this bad in awhile.  You would think at an airport they would be sensitive to your possible schedule.  That would be a no.  Waited 10 mins at a table finally gave up and went to the bar.  This is after seeing 5 people laughing by the register and me pushing on the little call button. If management cares they can check the time stamp of this posting since I'm sitting here at the bar still ...smh"}
{"text":"This is a cool little grille! Everything smells, feels, and tastes really fresh. It's touted as Cuban but don't get your hopes up. It's as much Cuban as Chipotle is Mexican. It's good though. The service is very hospitable, the food is far beyond what you would expect from an airport restaurant. The \"rum bar\" is really just good old Captain & Bacardi Rum but hey if it was two fancy you might forget you have to catch a flight!   If you eat here I reccomended both the calamari and the shrimp ajo!"}
{"text":"Food was so so. Drinks are expensive! I will pass on this place next time I'm at CLT. Fast, friendly service, however."}
{"text":"Overpriced even for the airport with mediocre food (at best). I ordered one of the rice bowls with mixed veggies, Guac, and an egg. The egg was half raw still, the quac wasn't fresh (it's the kind you get from a pouch and it tasted off), and the rice was like an Uncle Ben's kit. I've made better at home (and I'm a terrible cook, so that says something). Wait staff was friendly and fast, which is why it got over 1*"}
{"text":"Came here on the way to Philly Airport. Was excited to eat my food until I sat down and was told because I ordered from the takeout part of the Resturant that I could not sit in the Resturant part of the Resturant. I spoke to the manager and he says they are not supposed to do that and he would talk to her. I won't be returning . I hate poor customer service . I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT and spend money at the same place.   Even if the food turns out to be the best that I've had , I won't be returning ."}
{"text":"Had a few minutes before a flight out of a D gate and was starving from missing lunch so stopped by here to grab a jerk chicken bowl to go. What a mess! First, the order plus a bottle of water added up to $20. I expect airport prices to be high, so I just crossed my fingers that the food was actually palatable. Every single ingredient in the dish was bland--the chicken, the vegetables, the sauces they smothered everything in--and the rice and beans were an overcooked mush. I couldn't even finish it. Never again."}
{"text":"Excellent pallamillo steak salad with local beer. Stick at Clt we spent a lovely two hours here  Best at the airport."}
{"text":"Worst place I ever ate I HIGHLY recommend to avoid this place at all costs. The food is microwaved and the alcohol is the price of a meal. I waited almost half an hour for microwaved food. Food was stale and cold when I got it. Just the alcohol was 14$... I got one plate of fish tacos and I regret it so much thank god I will never be going here again. If your hungry fight your hunger this is not a good location to eat."}
{"text":"The food and mojitos were ok - not great - just ok.  My beef is with the customer service.  I left my phone behind when I got on the plane.  Yep, my fault, my bad. As soon as I realized what I had done (which wasn't for a few hours after landing at my destination) - and as soon as I could get access to a phone and the internet (less than 10 hours total) - I contacted the airport.  I left multiple messages on the \"Lost and Found\" phone line for HMS Host - including the exact location (I had my receipt with table location, server name and time of payment all on it).    Look - they post the lost and found phone number on the Charlotte Airport website:  http://www.cltairport.com/VisitorServices/Pages/LostandFound.aspx  But don't bother calling it, because you will get voicemail - every time - regardless of what time of day you call.    Additionally, you will not even receive the courtesy of a response.  Hey - HMS Host/Casa Bacardi - you either found my phone or you didn't - it's my fault because I left it behind - but GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE COURTESY OF A RESPONSE.   After 3 days (calling multiple times a day) and not getting a response, I even went to the HMS Host website and left a message on their \"customer service\" site on their page.   Very poor customer service.  Worthless lost and found phone line.  It's my fault that I left my phone - but that has to happen periodically, right?  After all, they set up a phone number for that circumstance - yet no one returns the calls.  Isn't that the whole point of having a voicemail system?  Why bother taking the calls if you aren't going to return them??  I'm slightly heartbroken because I had pictures on that phone from my trip to Puerto Rico that had not yet been backed up onto the cloud - but, hey - calling people back who have taken their time to eat at your restaurant and then contact you (multiple times) is really hard."}
{"text":"Music is festive & tropical and the decor is modern, clean, bright & spacious! Menu is simple & uncluttered however the drink menu is expansive with plenty of \"ideas\" if you can't think of a drink to fit your mood! They have about 5 salads to choose from all around $12. Cuban style sandwiches $10 served with fries. They have burgers as well. Entrees are $15 & include steak, salmon, chicken etc.   Service was good.  Cocktails are $12!!  My Cuban sandwich was good!"}
{"text":"We really liked the waiter, fast and very friendly. However, we ordered their specialty rum bowl with rice and beans. Guess what? Out of rice!! No joke!!"}
{"text":"The Shrimp Ajo and Chicken Mojito looked surprisingly similar - the beds of rice, beans and toppings of mango salsa were identical. The only thing that changed was the protein.   The shrimp was well spiced and garlicky, although had no noticeable sauce as advertised in the menu. The marinated chicken was tender and tasty. Biggest complaint about the food was the plastic flatware. Hard to believe this is a regulation because this is an airport property, we eat in airports regularly with metal silverware.  Our biggest disappointment were the drinks. My Patron Margarita was extremely rough for Patron. (I find it very hard to believe it WAS Patron.) Our server's comment when I complained? \"Well, it's Silver.\" (OK...) $15 for the margarita, $14 for the O-tini (their own conconction) and I walked away without the slightest of buzzes. I smell a watered down rat..."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets such poor reviews; it's well deserved.   This restaurant is in an airport, so many people are in a bit of a hurry, and the whole process took way too long. I was seated five minutes before anyone stopped over to take an order.  After I did, three times the waitress had to try to put an order in just to come back and say \"bad news\" we're also out of that meat.  There should be better ordering, improved communication when they're out of something so I don't spend 10 minutes waiting to place an order just to have the waitress disappear for five minutes and then come back and have the process start again (three times!)  I finally ordered the burger and moved on with my life.  The order took another 15 minutes to arrive. The beans and rice were tasty, and the burger was pretty good (jerk burger.  If I was in a pinch, I'd eat there again, but only in a pinch.   One drink and a burger was $30, airports are notoriously overpriced so I was not surprised, but I was not satisfied with any part of my experience, except the waitress was pleasant even after all the headaches. Kudos to her, she's the only reason this is a two star rating."}
{"text":"I got a salad to go for the plane.  Lots of lettuce and one hunk of steak.  Ehhh... not the best, not the worst."}
{"text":"Rum Bar & Grill reminds me of eating at the Marriott in Saint Thomas. The food is good, yet very average in that \"I could make this better\" way. Still I'd recommend going here to hang during longer layovers. You'll sit under a skylight, surrounded by tropical plants and palm trees and eat to lame but festive island music. I forgot I was in an airport!  Order the Ajo Shimp and Mojito for a meal that won't leave you feeling full and gross. A three-star rating for airport dining, four stars **** for drinks!"}
{"text":"Not good if you're looking for what they advertise. But for standard airport food close to terminal D, you'll be ok."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Had the fish tacos and fries. Fries were old and  fish had no flavor. I ordered fizzy water and was charged 3.29....wow!  Wld not do again."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Food - underwhelming at best.  They were out of corn tortillas. I found this out after I had ordered and forgot to specify corn. I went over to correct my order and was told they were out which is why I was not given a choice. Would have liked to know this before I ordered...I asked for them to leave out the tortillas and received the most pathetic looking piece of fish in the world - small and flavorless. My drink was slammed down on my table with no eye contact from the server, and now I am waiting way too long for my bill.  Update: they gave me a 10% discount,  still 2 stars though,  but I appreciate the gesture."}
{"text":"Service is okay and food is below average and pricey. Shrimp bowl had very small shrimp and drink came out slowly and incorrectly, server made up for it by bringing the correct item (for free) which was nice. Overall drinks were 7/10 but food was 2/10. However, it took 15+ minutes after I was done eating to bring the bill. Try other choices when at CLT."}
{"text":"First time here ! Visiting from LA with my boyfriend and had time since we are transit, decided to get some drinks on the way back to home .Awesome place , Tony and Michele are great!  They provide us with welcoming and friendly customer service which is on the top.   We ordered Rum Runner and it's delicious, and Honey Rum Shrimp , Chicken Caesar salad with French fries !   Great food and the best customer service.  Happy to be here.   I'll take this memories with me to Los Angeles.   I will highly recommend this place to everyone who is traveling:).  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Great service but mediocre food. I had the jerk chicken bowl that was in dire need of seasoning. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Airport food.........it is good here and the drinks are plentiful (and over priced), but when you need a meal and/or drink...I'd go here if you have time between connections."}
{"text":"Normally never had time to watch any while travelling. This rare chance of having 30 min. Got me wonder around. Avoid avoid. The lady told me of 10 min waiting for burgers so I did Der jerked chicken  bowl. It took 9 min!!!. See the photos I took 5 bites and done. Each bite was $4.00."}
{"text":"It's an airport I know but you can get a good meal ...... just not at this place.  The chicken tacos are horrible, the fries I'm sure are form yesterday: service? Pretty bad"}
{"text":"Being a rum bar, you would think they know how to make a mojito. Unfortunately, this was the worst one I have ever had. Absolutely terrible, when I sen it back, they made me another one and it was just as bad. Should have just went to the pinkberry across the terminal..."}
{"text":"Pomegranate martini while waiting for my flight? Yes please. And nothing on the menu I can eat? Whatevs, I'll snack on some super unhealthy fries.  The server I had was pretty cool. Definitely an accommodating dude. Despite the bustling people outside of the dining area, I was able to actually kick back for an hour and read/people watch."}
{"text":"Coconut mango chicken was a disaster and the ship cocktail did not taste fresh and the grand melon mojito tasted like a jelly rancher in a bad way,  I should have gone with the Cuban sandwich it looked better not that the menu had any pictures of the shitty food . .  . Skip this place"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars because they deserve it. Had a flight out if D Concourse and was super early. Spent 2 hours chilling to the sounds of steel drums and enjoyed a nice meal. I had the honey rum salmon salad and LOVED it. I am always nervous about ordering salmon in a restaurant because unless it is fresh, it is gross. No middle ground there. My waiter recommended it and I was thrilled to enjoy a delicious, healthy(ish) dinner before my flight. I had a margarita, too, (actually, I had three). They were nicely balanced and went down too well. :)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here after a red eye. I'm sure almost anything tastes good at that point right?   I got the yogurt and fruit and my mom got the egg scramble w/o bacon or chorizo along with a very pricey double shot of tequila.  Average food."}
{"text":"I just had wine at Rum Bar so I'm not able to rate the food. The wine was okay, nothing wonderful. The service was a little slow but he was very friendly and attentive so they get 3 stars. I'll try the food next time and rate that."}
{"text":"Service was great my man was under staffed and still was extremely helpful in his service. Was prompt and the altitude project bottle came to us cold! Great stop off."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, the service was excellent. The waitress, Kelly, promptly brought me a refill on my Diet Coke without me even asking.  It just magically appeared. That will get five stars out of me every single time.  I had the island omelette, it was tasty and hit the spot for an early morning breakfast. The cumin-lime crema is a nice subtle touch. There could've been a few more potatoes with the omelette, but really, I don't need them!"}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service. We ordered a Sofrito pork bowl and Cobb salad, both were very good. Way better than I'd hoped for in an airport restaurant! Bravo!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the Cuban sandwich. The meat needed more flavor. It was kind of bland. The bread on the sandwich was the best part. It was over priced."}
{"text":"Absolutely aweful!  I wanted a hot, full meal without having to walk a mile to the next terminal.  I ordered the jerk chicken sandwich with rice and beans.  The chicken was not jerk, just plain ole grilled chicken.  The meal was supposed to be cooked to order but it was luke warm.  The bread for the sanwich had the rubbery texture of bread that had been microwaved too long. The chicken was also rubbery. All in all, it was a miserable mess that had been thrown together. Never again!  I ended up having to buy some trail mix to sustain me on a 5 hour flight."}
{"text":"Good quick fast food to eat on the run. I was impressed to see how quickly they were able to turn the tables over. Hundreds of passengers but at lest they were quick about the service and they smiled even while people were not very nice. The food was good, we were in a time crunch and let the waiter know and he took care of us quickly. Overall if you need a quick bite just stop in and it will be ok."}
{"text":"I really appreciated the service we received from Edem. We arrived 2 minutes after the 10:00 am cut off for the breakfast menu but he hurried right over to see if we were going to want to order from it so he could still get our order into the kitchen. We were content to order from the lunch/dinner selection so we settled in to make our choices.  For an airport restaurant the menu offers a fairly diverse fare so we were enthused about eating there as we awaited our boarding call. It is for this reason, & Edem's excellent representation, that it gets 3 (rather than 2) stars.  I made the mistake of ordering the Cubano. I love cubanos. I've had \"to die for\" cubanos made for me by Cubans in the Keys & sadly, they've ruined me for all but the very best cubanos that are available. So, the fact I wasn't impressed with theirs is perhaps as much the fault of my lofty expectations as it is their very lackluster execution of it (but I swear it was very lackluster). The fries weren't terribly well prepared either, but it's possible I got the first batch out of the fryer on the day & it wasn't fully heated up when they dropped them. My wife ordered the Grilled Mahi Tacos & must've liked them because she didn't offer to share!  If we have a long enough layover in Charlotte that we find ourselves looking for a meal we'll be happy to return to the Rum Bar (did I mention I LOVE rum - but not at 10:02 am) and I'll just have to resist the urge to order a cubano."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service fair.   I finished my meal before the waiter came back to ask if I needed a refill on my drink, and they were not busy at all.   I'll go somewhere else next time I fly thru this airport."}
{"text":"Drinks are good... Wait time is fast to have your drinks made at a PREMIUM PRICE (Slightly cheaper than drinks on Flight in mid-air) LOL! Service can be hit or miss, Ive witnessed some being served slightly longer than expected, but I guess if you explain that you have a flight to catch in the next 15min (show boarding pass) and have to be at the Gate ASAP, please say so, and you'll be served ASAP, as the bar wants your business....  But do expect a delay on having your meal served on a full house (can't rush on making a perfect meal if you're running late) or you won't be happy if its undercooked or overly cooked. Wanted to get a meal since Im starved, but I dont have the patience to seat and wait while in a rush to catch my departing gate.... SO I just grabbed and ordered an adult beverage on site.   Rum & Coke Please! chug chug chug.... Thank you."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst, most overrated and overpriced eateries in the entire airport. The food was bad, soup was cold and our frumpy waitress had a very bad attitude. Do yourself a favor and go to Bad Daddys on concourse C."}
{"text":"Hot food & quick service! I had the Cubano & fries. The sandwich wasn't special, but it was hot! The fries were pretty good, just overly salted. The bar tenders are pretty busy, so make sure to say something or you will get looked over."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience. Convenient to my gate and has seating that provides access to electrical outlets so one can charge their various devices. That's a bonus in an airport establishment and is really why they are getting the fourth star. The service was okay and the food was okay. The restaurant itself is a bit crowded with lots of tables, which is good for ensuring they can serve as many people as possible but not great for trying to make your way to a table with luggage in tow."}
{"text":"Food was just par. My burger was over cooked, fries were hot though. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"It was a bit better than average for airport food.  I did carry out - plenty of sandwiches for around $10 each, all including french fries.  I ordered the cuban sandwich - roast pork, ham, swiss, pickle, mayo & mustard on bread, then pressed.  The pork was a bit fatty, but otherwise, not shabby.  The fries were rushed, I believe.  It was like they almost had them cooked properly and took them out about 30 seconds too early.  Boo.  Oh well, salt fixes just about anything.  The gal who took my order at the carry out counter was very friendly & promised me that my order would be up in 8 minutes...mine only took about 5.  It was obviously fresh off the grill.  So, it was just a kind of yum, but for an airport, not too shabby, I suppose."}
{"text":"We had a delayed flight on US Airways (surprise right??) and we decided to stop in here for a meal.  There are no outlets, so don't even ask. Our server was very nice and attentive, but I came here for the food. Ugh, I guess I shouldn't have expected much because it is in an airport. The chicken tenders I got were so heavily coated and fried that I couldn't even taste chicken. I ate a little because I was hungry but I just couldn't continue. I knew I was ordering chicken strips, but wow, they were pretty darn bad.  Also, there is a lot of natural light in here because of the windows, but that also makes it warmer that is really comfortable.   If I am stuck in this airport again, I'll walk a little further and look for some different food that maybe has a little taste."}
{"text":"Airporr bar/restaurant at Charlotte Airport, CLT.   Loud unnerving music and overpriced drinks. Turned around and went for sushi, like one of the Yelp reviews advised.  Inattentive service."}
{"text":"Coconut Mango Wings are great! I was traveling for work so I couldn't try a mojito but they looked like the real deal!!!!"}
{"text":"Fine for an airport restaurant.  Nice place to sit down for a minute, if you have the time.  Service is a little lacking - seemed overwhelmed.  But the food came out quickly.  I had the Jerk Chicken Cobb Salad with the ranch dressing.  It was really good - and pretty spicy (I think that was the Ranch dressing).  I thought at first it was missing the promised guacamole - but it's under the wedges of lettuce."}
{"text":"Slow night. Service slow. Tap ran out. Saw 2 other customers leave due to no service. Another guy came up to the bar and said he's been waiting 10 minutes with no service. I waited long enough where I could only get a beer and not food. Had a 10:45 flight. Fly out of clt all the time. I'll stick treating in b or c wings."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Rum Bar to kick off the last two hours of our lay over in Charlotte on our way to Jamaica, i mean rum just sounded appropriate, duh!  Nice big bar, with lots of seats and a few TVs to get your sports fix. All the food looked great, we didn't have any but I would recommend it anyway. Service was nice, and the people watching, or should I say listening was great! I love it when people from Boston talk out their ass about they sports teams, dumb asses!  Have fun!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and would go again if  waiting on a flight.  Food is above average and beer selection is decent.  Staff is friendly and let's you talk or work."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst airport food ever! Rubber eggs, flat tasteless omelette, cold toast., just awful"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to get a quick bite to eat before boarding. It's definitely not a quick place, I waited 20 minutes for a chorizo bowl. The chorizo bowl consisted. of veggies with beef in ketchup, chili oil and cumin. It was sooo salty. Service was terrible. I ordered fish tacos, first entree that I said and the cashier didn't hear it. We waited for it, asked the cashier how long it was going to take and she had an attitude and said we never ordered it. The man that ordered after us chimed in and said he heard us. I asked how long it would take to make fish tacos and she said 15 mins... We left. She had no remorse at all about not getting our order correct. Just move on when you see this place... you're better off going to the food court and getting fast food."}
{"text":"Perhaps a good place for a drink, but the food was positively dreadful even by airport food standards. Split chicken fingers and fries with my son. Food was dry and bland. I found the server to be borderline rude despite the place being empty. Prices were really high although you have to expect that at an airport. Wish I would have walked a little further to a more local establishment."}
{"text":"Awful. Nearly inedible... even for airport food.  Don't push the \"prompt service\" button on the table. The waitress said that they ignore it.  Keep walking."}
{"text":"In a lay-over at the airport I needed some food and most places had a long line up. The Rum Bar had a few seats open, so I hopped right in!  Sat down and the waiter staff was very kind and on the spot with me (Belial I think, ask for him? Tell him he is now famous due to my review ;) lol )  I got the rum burger and a coke. I was going to have a local beer, but state law says not before noon. :( boo. The burger was ok, nothing to brag about. But the coke! MMMMMmmm with ice. I know... low standards.  Generally A-OK place,definitely recommend sitting down if you need to eat and relax during a lay-over."}
{"text":"WHY DOES HMS HOST AND THIER ATTEMPT AT AIRPORT FOOD HAVE TO BE SO BAD!!??  There's NOTHING Cuban about this place, and if you tried serving the crap they call Cuban or Jamaican food, to Cubans or Jamaicans, you get banned from those countries for life!!  Seriously, why....? This place serves muddled flavorless slop for premium prices. Why do the millions of daily travelers accept this terrible standard? And worse, PAY FOR IT??  Jerk chicken bowl with over medium egg....that's what this dish is supposed to be. Looks and tastes like I imagine what is served in prisons..  I pray every day for whoever the politician is that's related to HMS Host management to retire so someone decent can be awarded these airport food contracts...  Don't be fooled by the 1 Star rating, they're a ZERO at best.."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this location. Stopped here during a layover at Charlotte and was excited to have a Jamaican Jerk Chicken sandwich with some seasoned fries.    The tomato had more flavor that the chicken and the kick was there was no JAMAICAN JERK taste to the sandwich. The fries were mostly just regular fries with a few of them dripped in seasoning.  The environment was great, love the music (Caribbean/beach like) and big open area.  No one is over one another.  Just disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"This is for the Rum Bar Express. The staff are unprofessional and unorganized. They forgot my order and the order for the woman behind me. Took about 20 minutes to get my shrimp bowl. The lady behind me asked for a refund bc she couldn't wait longer. They spent more time chatting with other airport employees than taking/making orders. The kitchen staff looked like they were diligent. Cashiers, definitely need more training. Don't recommend if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Well this place was a huge disappointment. Today, it wasn't crowded so I decided to come in.  I ordered the crunchy chicken taco and it was overly cooked to achieve the crunchiness I guess... it was flavorless, the taco was cold, the whole thing was cold. The fries was eh. I am glad I tried it so I know not to come back. Maybe the drinks are better but I didn't try that.  Service was ok.  Don't eat here. Get some sushi across the way, some Chic Fil a or something else or wait til you get home. It's not worth it.  I might have to get some candy to overcome this taste. Can't wait to go to my hotel and brush my teeth."}
{"text":"Once again I'm at Charlotte Douglas Airport waiting for my delayed American Airline flight to board.  I've got time on my side so I checked out some of the eats in terminal D! Rum Bar & Grill caught my eye and my nostrils so I'm waiting to order.  The patrons look happy eating here and the food from what I can see looks yummy.  Nice selections on the menu and the burgers are right up my alley; cooked to order and piping hot!   10 minutes later and it figures, my food is about to come out and we're boarding now so I have to take my food on the run!"}
{"text":"It's bright, there is wine, I'm waiting for my plane to Rhody, it will do. The bartender is not the friendliest, barely a smile from either of them, but I do like meeting new people, people that are traveling. So that's cool. I'm going to get off my phone and start being social."}
{"text":"It is a fun and welcoming place, but the food was disappointing. My burger was not at all as I asked, and dripped in grease. There was a puddle on my plate before I was even half-way through. That would have all been fine (I was really hungry and went ahead and ate anyway), but the meat itself had no taste. I wish I had checked the reviews before. Still, I give it two stars because the waiter was efficient"}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work. This morning was the 3rd time I've sat at this place for 20-30+ minutes, pushed the prompt service button, and no one ever came, again. If you have a bit, take yourself to another place in a different concourse."}
{"text":"Worse chicken tacos I've eaten in my life, even for airport food. Shredded mozzarella straight ouf of the bag. Ewww. But very kind waiter. On the positive side it was the only sit down restaurant or bar at CLT with plugs that I found. But the airport is there to blame."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  For a place named Bacardi Rum Bar I expected a better drink selection and better grades of rum.  Took a while before our waitress took our orders ( we only had drinks) and we had to hunt someone down to get our check."}
{"text":"Airport food.  I've been here before.  The service is iffy.  Not very friendly but efficient for the most part.  The food is ok.  Edible, filling, a bit pricey but that's airport food for you.  It's here if you want something warm.  I like the fact that I can sit here and relax for a few minutes before going to my gate."}
{"text":"Rum Bar is a Bacardi restaurant concept licensed in this case by FHM. I had a Cuban sandwich on 2/9 while waiting for my flight to BOS. I didn't expect much, but the sandwich I got was great. At $10.49 it was a value considering that wet, 2-day-old ham and cheese subs at airport newstands can cost $8. The ham was smokey and not overly sweet. The roast pork was moist and rich. The bread was crunchy outside, chewy inside, and authentic. I'm accustomed to sandwich Cubanos with Swiss cheese. This had what I'm fairly sure was Fontina, but it worked. The menu was extensive and included a wide variety of entrees, such as a marinated flank steak,  and salads; all well-priced. The decor' was hip. It had a nighclub feel. Rum Bar has some great cocktails, too. Oddly, drink prices aren't printed on the menu. This was a warning sign. I was on a potential employer's expense account and didn't want to spend $15 on a cocktail. Anyway, if you're at CLT and hungry, I highly recommend Rum Bar."}
{"text":"I ordered the food for pick up and decided to eat. As soon as I sat the waiter came to me and told me that I could sit but take out sit across the restaurant. So Fing insulting to mention that to a customer,  when  most of the tables were empty anyway. I would never to there again with the staff so insulting. Manager seems nice after I spoke to him but didn't seem that he even spoke to her(waiter). I don't know why they don't teach them before putting them to serve people"}
{"text":"First off, I don't expect a great meal in an airport. That being said this may have been the worst meal I have had in a long, long time. All I ordered was soup and a caeser salad. The soup was nasty. Some sort of tomato based tortilla soup that tasted like canned tomatoes. The caesar salad had Italian dressing!!! What a bunch of crap"}
{"text":"This place was busy and looked like it had possibilities.  They really tout their Bacardi Rum lineage too.  My spouse and ordered different Rum Bowls. I had the sofrito pork bowl and she had the jerk chicken.  I also added the optional fried egg on top of mine.  Both came with beans and rice.  The portions are certainly generous.  That's where the good news ends though.  Both dishes had a sauce base of a thick, bland flavorless tomato sauce.  It was like something straight out of a can.  I added tons of hot sauce to no avail.   No heat, spice or flavor to be found in both.  To add insult to injury, the egg was fried hard and burnt.  The server was also MIA.  Take my advice, fly on by...."}
