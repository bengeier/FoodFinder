{"text":"Very loud, service is very slow and food is just ok.  Went with a group of girls and we couldn't even order dessert because it was impossible to get our server to take our order.  Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

Our waitress looked stressed and tired. She was abrupt and rude and when we tried to develop a rapport with her she blew us off.
I would not WASTE your time here.
We literally were so disappointed we asked the manager for our bill...paid it...and then the waitress ran after us like we dined and dashed...nope...just unimpressed with the atmosphere and your \"service\"
Do better.

Happy Holidays."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friend's birthday. Service was slow, and food was ok. Overpriced for what you get. Our server (short, red dyed hair) was incredibly rude and did not acknowledge nor apologized for taking food orders so late- an hour after she took our drink orders. She didn't smile and looked annoyed the entire time. Overall, did not have a good experience and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here! Shared the brussel sprouts, seared tuna and a salmon board with a friend. The salmon board was delicious! It's definitely something a lot of restaurants are missing. Our service was even better. I can't remember his name, but he went through all of the drink specials and recommended a great malbec  (which was 1/2 price because it was before a flames game). Really happy we went to the Mission, and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went to The Mission on a Saturday evening with high expectations because of mostly good reviews. It's good that I made reservations for 7 because we had about half an hour of moderate noise inside. The place was full by 8pm and quite noisy so it's hard to have a decent conversation with your companion without having to shout which I totally hate. We ordered the roasted brussel sprouts which was very tasty and we really enjoyed a lot. I had the fried chicken, and as a fried chicken aficionado I was very disappointed with my dish. The chicken was under seasoned, the gravy was bland and I could make better biscuits than what they had. My companion had the tomahawk pork and although it was tasty it was on the salty side. Believe me, I like salt but that was way too salty. It's sad when the highlight of your dinner was the appetizer. The cocktails were okay and reasonably priced. Our server was nice and prompt but lacked sincerity with all her usual spiels like \"great choice\", \"how's the first couple of bites?\", \"you made an excellent choice!\" I mean come on, all my choices are really that great?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed several small dishes and a few oysters. 
Wine by the glass list was okay."}
{"text":"When Mission first opened they were opened for lunch. I'm not sure if that market just wasn't there for them, because now I believe they are only open from 3 or 4pm onwards. 

When I did come here for lunch I had a beet salad with chicken, it was actually quite good. The other time I came for drinks... the place was packed and very very loud. I didn't enjoy it. Also, they made my drink wrong...

I hear it's the place to go for happy hour, so maybe I'll check it out sometime soon."}
{"text":"Came for poutine left knowing I'm going back. The lobster poutine was divine, the orange cheesecake was delicious, and their happy hour prices are on point. Our server was unreal, so friendly and very helpful. I felt very welcomed and the food was amazing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Friendly staff, amazing food and great drinks. Welcoming hang out on trendy 4th Street. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Service was mediocre. Extremely loud. Not vegetarian-friendly, the only two main dishes that have that appear veggie have fish sauce. May go back for drinks but not dinner."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. We've only ever been for happy hour on Saturdays, because it's the best in the city (in our opinion.) Everything we've had has been amazing- especially the beef tartare and the brussell sprouts. The wine selection is also great; most of the time, the wines available on HH are not the best, but that isn't the case here. Plus, they do wicked cocktails too that are included that are always made really well. The only downside is, the service sometimes seems a little...lacking? Like, not all there? Not sure, maybe two off days in a row, but slightly strange. Anyway, nothing big enough to worry about, the food and drinks are spot on."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant on 4th. Had several small plates - tuna , Brussel sprouts, lobster tortellini. Yum!"}
{"text":"Kind of a strange place.  Great food.  1/2 price wine Tuesdays.  But an odd vibe with people and waitstaff coming and going.  I'd probably go back but only because of the location."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails, great food and good atmosphere.  A bit pricey tho."}
{"text":"The mission, can't seem to figure out if they are casual dining, fine dining or a pub or what. The crowd is the old Ed hardy Bunch of over muscle juice monkeys that are more about drinking - can't hear a thing. Got food before drinks, wrong dishes, under done and over done steaks... Extremely small sharing dishes (cream shrimp that was a whole giant sharing dish of cream and only found 3 shrimp)... When we complained to the manager about the food he brought us shots! If you can't fix the problems just make sure your patrons are too drunk to notice them."}
{"text":"The food tasted like it was purchased in the frozen food aisle at Costco and defrosted two days earlier; the crowd is obnoxious and of dubious character. Lots of loud brodudes who are under the impression that yager  bombs are still socially acceptable after college."}
{"text":"I stopped in at The Mission for a networking event, definitely, a pub type vibe, pretty dark but they have a nice skylight and great private room near the front that is perfect for events and larger parties. 

We enjoyed bubbles (they have half-price bottle nights), charcuterie, brussel sprouts, and chicken skewers. The brussel sprouts were definitely a favourite, they were so flavourful and decadent. I also really enjoyed the chicken skewers they were super flavourful and juicy. I would be very interested in coming back and trying more of the menu.

They also have parking right in front, just a few stalls but definitely helps if you can snag one instead of having to find street parking."}
{"text":"Douche baggery central. Wow. Just, wow. I attempted to eat dinner here, but ultimately decided to take advantage of the Mac's next door. Their taquitos were on sale. Delicious."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour! Sooooo much cheaper. Their pork taco and brussel sprouts are super yum!! Sunday afternoons they have jam sessions with local talent. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group for a birthday party.  We tried a variety of cocktails (Moscow Mule, Old fashioned, Yuzu sour) and they were all pretty good.  I tried the ginger beer and I found it way too sweet; I prefer Lazy Mutt.  Food: We tried the albacore tuna crudo which was pretty refreshing because of the yuzu vinaigrette. The brussel sprouts were a popular item based on the reviews; they were very flavourful due to the machego cheese and maple vinaigrette.  The halibut was not cooked (middle was still raw) so we had to send it back; they cooked us a new piece but this time it was overcooked and dry. We tried two of the skewers not realizing it was $10 for one skewer with rice; they were alright but nothing memorable. The fried chicken was just okay; the gravy was a bit salty for my taste.  The chicken wings were seasoned perfectly.  My favourite dish of the night was the double cut striploin for two; it was cooked perfectly and the meat was seasoned well and very juicy; however for $59, we would have just went to a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Unbelievably noisy in the restaurant, we could barely talk amongst our group. I am not sure why but I suspect it is because of all the hard surfaces including the ceiling, it reflected all the sounds back. The food was just okay not good enough to make up for the noise. Crossed off the list of places to revisit."}
{"text":"Met my daughter there to celebrate my birthday. First time there and I was impressed. Service was excellent and the food delicious. Roasted Brussels Sprouts were incredibly flavorful and very unique. Could of had more. Small plates are full of variety and offer some unique flavors. Wine list is good and offers a nice variety. Ambience is great, intimate but not quiet. The place was packed when we went, a good sign they got something good going on down there. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It's very loud, totally busy but the food is pretty good! We ordered a couple of bottles of wine, and I do think that's the point here at this establishment, and a few dishes to share. I think this was the old \"Candela\" which was quieter, more \"classy\" lol ..the tables were closer to the floor. Here, at The Mission, the tables are mostly raised, lounge-like. There is still the large bar. 

It's lively, the alcohol and loud music gives the place a \"looser\" more \"social\" vibe and since I was surrounded with lovely company and people I've known for years, it was a great and fun night. It's that typical busy weekend place where everyone's kind of checking each other out. 

So if you're with someone you want to have a real and connecting, lasting, philosophical conversation with ... don't come here. 

The food was very good though. The elk Carpaccio was delectable, a mixture of textures and great flavor, held it's own over the red merlot. The skewer we ordered was beef, and it was so good, melted in our mouths. Great tasting and well cooked rice too! Also the Brussels sprouts kale Caesar salad was great. Really good. Big toasted croutons and a great amount of super saucy salad (ask perhaps for light on the dressing if you're being conscious of your waistline). 

All in all, a happy fun night with good music since the DJ was on point pretty much throughout, a great mixture of old school dance/r&b/rap music which is what we're into as a group generally.

Oh, and .. take a taxi home if you happen to close the place down at 3 a.m."}
{"text":"Good food! Will have to come back to check out some more dishes as we were in a hurry the first time around. Would come back for sure!"}
