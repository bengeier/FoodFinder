{"text":"Worst!! Fries were greasy and the fish if you can it fish was gross! Find a better fish and chip place. Staff was super rude as well."}
{"text":"This place was the best fish n chips in the west end, period. I've gone here for 28 years, same great food, same great service back then. Nowadays, ownership has changed and quality has tanked. Nothing special, just an ordinary fish and chips place."}
{"text":"Very rude service encouraged by the owner. You might call him \"Fish Nazi\". Avoid this place. It's also located in a bad/unsafe neighbourhood. Most customers are 70+, probably because decor is from the 60's. This place is empty most of the time."}
{"text":"first fish and chips place i've ever been too and i've been making this my repeated spot! I've been taking people to try this place and they agree it's the best ever!"}
{"text":"Been going here since years always a good place but not tonight after a hectic day my husband and my in laws and I went there for dinner walked in around 6:40 as my in laws went to the counter to order the lady working there was very rude as they told her we would be dining in she started yelling customers like to walk in at seven and she threw her pen and paper into the desk made us feel very uncomfortable she was yelling as she was taking are order and slamming dishes she was extremely rude we Dident even want to eat are food after that she made it very loud and clear that she was not happy because we was there before it closed yet the place was packed with customers! Horrible service i did not deserve that even though the food was good I'm probably not going to go there for a while I definitely recommend this place if you're looking to get yelled at! Oh I also forgot to mention she rushed to give us are bill before we got threw eating if that's not poor service then I don't know what is!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and was starving.  Found this local mom and pop shop on yelp which totally hit the spot.  The decor is very nostalgic, a small town restaurant as you go on a camping trip.  The food was good when we went, and you cannot beat the value you get vis-a-vis the price.  My only comment to make this place great and 5 stars is if they made their own tartar sauce.  They have specials of the day, which if you sit in they charge a bit more.  Definitely worth stopping by though!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Nothing but great fish and chips. Big portions, great taste at unbelievable prices.  Great service, a Weston Village icon."}
{"text":"Review on the Run  Local fish and chip place out in the west end.  Family run business.  Fish was nicely done.  Service was great.  For whatever reason the fries were awful.  Super soggy.  I have a feeling the precooked (blanched) them way to earlier and for too long.  At least that's my experience as a former fry guy.  The owner was friendly, but super talkative.  I was alone and he joined me for a long talk about politics.   Conclusion: Eat Here?  I'll give it another try.. maybe."}
{"text":"The batter was thick which I like in a deep fried fish with good fries. The only thing I didn't like was that the tarter sauce came in individual packets. So I ripped through 5 or 6 of those packets for enough tarter sauce. Over all, small little treasure in toronto."}
{"text":"It depends on the day you go! Some days the fries are delicious and on point, some days it tastes like super old oil.   The fish isn't the cheapest but all my coworkers love it! Even if you ask for just the fish they throw some fries in for you.  Their poutine is not authentic but delicious none the less. They also have cherry coke.  Another thing dependent on the day you go is service...sometimes the woman behind the counter is super grumpy, some days she jokes. More so the grumpy side but her co-workers are most nice...it's like a flip of the coin for lunch.  Not worth my time unless I'm really craving some fries!"}
{"text":"We came here since we were in the area and craving fish and chips. We ordered the halibut and chips. The fish was really greasy that you can see the oil in a pool on the plate. The fries were crispy but nothing special.. Just your normal frozen fries. The tartar sauce comes in packages and you have to request lemon slices from them, it doesn't come already on the plate. For the price ($11.75 for the fish and chips and $14.75 for the fish and chips plus drink and coleslaw) I wouldn't come back here. You can better for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a family oriented store that always seems to have steady business whenever I am there.  There are family take out specials, and also daily specials for takeout or seniors.  They serve halibut, cod, big roughy (and probably some other fish i cant remember).  They also have battered shrimp skewers.  Fish was hot and crispy when served (especially hot for take out).  When dining in its all you can eat fries (not that i ever had to ask for seconds).  Tartar sauce is the packet kind (but that's the kind i like).  Only issue i had was the gravy. I ordered the poutine one and the gravy was so salty that i couldn't finish it (it was really big as well).  Nice and clean, good service. Good value."}
{"text":"Funny, Review on the Run (1 year later)  I have to agree the owner was friendly, nice man but super talkative.  He talked to you about politics he talked to me about muslims taking over; I hear he is supposidly religious too; that's kind of hypocritical and totally sacrilegious. As for the food its ok halibut and chips; you found the fries soggy; I found his batter soggy as soon as the vinegar hit it ... not a very good tasting batter (in my opinion); Chubbies on Islington at Rexdale Blvd they have way better batter on their halibut and tons of good chips ... I usually can only handle 1/2 a chip ... the service there is awesome (Chinese) working for the owner."}
{"text":"I live right in the neighbourhood, and this place is the place to go when I crave fish and chips. I always get the daily special, number one which is the three piece fish and chips for $5 and it fills me right up. It does have an oily and greasy after taste but for the way the food is made I couldn't complain. I've brought my boyfriend here many times and he loves it and craves for it all the time. I also brought my close girl friend here as well as she has heard that this place is good, I took her, and she fell in love from the first bite of her poutine, she loved her entire meal and has a new found love of this place. The store is very unique and feels very at home when you dine in from the decor, a place that doesn't fit nor match the neighbourhood it resides in.  Overall a great place to dine in or take out, even call in take out as well."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Golden Crisp Fish 'n Chips.  I ordered a large slice of halibut and chips.  I don't eat a lot of deep-fried fish (or much fish at all) or chips so thought it would be a nice change.  My meal was cooked-to-order and didn't take long.  The fries were  good.  The fish was okay.  I found the batter a bit too greasy.  It's a good spot if you are craving traditional fish 'n chips!"}
{"text":"This place is half-decent. I do agree with the other reviews.. The fries are soggy and greasy. The fish isn't bad.. Some days they're amazing, others not so much. If you're around the area and only have $5 bucks in your pocket.. It'll get you the Alaskan strips and chips.. Not for a cheap bite.   All in all.. It's definitely not the best fish and chips restaurant in Toronto and it's definitely not the worse"}
{"text":"I grew up in this area so I've eaten a lot from Golden Crisp. Great fish (I've never heard anyone dislike it), soggy fries (I've gotten used to it over the years).   This place is an icon for this area, as it's been around for so long. I haven't been here for a while, but the last time I went, a young teenager seemed to be the only one working there (she waited on us and cooked the food).   This place is usually filled with seniors, but is empty otherwise. I get weird vibes when I walk in. Kinda funny, considering how much I've eaten there.   Family run service that seems to be going downhill, I hate to admit."}
{"text":"The halibut was delicious. Gotta go large  Fries golden crisp. Service is friendly and prompt. Definitely coming back again."}
