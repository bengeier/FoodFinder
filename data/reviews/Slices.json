{"text":"During my \"Mill Avenue Years\", Slices was always a great way to cap off the night after everything else had closed.  Pretty good pizza, especially for people from Boston, but mostly location and hours of operation.  Slices is the Filibertos of pizza for me."}
{"text":"Those of you who have lived in the northeast and miss the pizza should try Slices. It's a great little place serving fantastic New York/Jersey-style pizza by the slice. They do enough business that the slices are pretty fresh.  The price is reasonable, especially since the slices are pretty large (two would make a meal for most adults). The selection and creativity of the pizzas is pretty impressive, too. 

There's no table-side service here.  You go to the front, order, pay, find a table, and wait for them to call your order."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing although the space is very small. It seems to be family owned which is a neat factor. There's really not a lot of space for a line even, the tables are setup to where you might be in the way of the line to be served. The menu selection is great, lots of pizza toppings to choose from and it also includes calzones, desserts and drinks. I only give it 4 stars because the space is so small."}
{"text":"Slices is good for a East Coast pizza fix. Nice thin slices, heated to crunchy after you select from a bank of pre-made pizzas. Cheap, quick eats for lunch!"}
{"text":"Very crispy thin slices that have terrific toppings.  Yes, the pizza is pre-made and on display under glass on the counter (9-10 different varieties at lunch) but they give it a couple of minutes in the oven before they serve it to you.

The key to this place I think is to get there when they open or after they start making their dinner pizzas.  Fresh and hot is best.

I really like this place.  Its simple, good and the value is pretty decent for the size of the slice.

I really enjoy any of their pesto pizzas and greek pizzas.  Very good."}
{"text":"Fast tasty cheap. Parking is rough. Public parking lot on East side will save you from ticket stress risking leaving it in the circle. Bike is perfect."}
{"text":"I had a heart-attack express slice with bacon, ham and sausage and it was damned tasty.   My only problem with the place was that it was hot as fucking Africa inside and it forced the wife and I to eat outside.   When it's cooler by a mile to eat outside in Phoenix, you know a place is in serious need of A/C."}
{"text":"it gets the job done. 

fast . kind of pricy for what you get. 

but its open late and thats all thats all that matters sometimes. 



better the gus's"}
{"text":"Slices is the best pizza in the valley. This one is near the theatre in the food court area. Cute little spot, best place for a quick bite to eat. They also have one of those new coke machines with all the flavors."}
{"text":"Legit pizza. Owner is a chill guy, too. I always get the Supreme and it never disappoints. If you're ever in Dilworth, check it out"}
{"text":"Quick and budget friendly for small eaters like me.
This is the place I stuff my face in between breaks from work.

bacon, cheddar and potato pizza is my fav.
+ jones creme soda (my fav creme flav soda)
= my ideal meal.

I had this every day, and I work 5 days a week lol.
Still not sick of it yet.

Staff is fast and usually friendly.

One of the employees Carlos provides good customer service and is very courteous."}
{"text":"Love their variety of pizzas.  If you can't decide you can grab a few different slices with their lunch specials.   My daughter's favorite pizza."}
{"text":"I had friends tell me they tried to order from Slices a few weeks ago and that they called multiple times but no one answered the phone. None the less, they are close by and have some pretty good pizza and wings deals so I decided to give it a whirl myself. I called three times with no answer or voice mail pickup. I needed to run some errands so I decided to go by in person and they were closed. Perhaps they're closed on Sundays and the hours here on Yelp are incorrect, but I can't say for sure since they haven't posted their hours on their door."}
{"text":"Considering location... This is the best in Tempe. Great selection. Best place to get a meal after the bars.

They keep it interesting with the slices they offer."}
{"text":"Way better than 414! Last weekend they had some really awesome specialty pizza slices available at good prices.  They make them fresh and don't just reheat old pieces."}
{"text":"Great Pizza & they're open late !! 
I was mixing sound nearby at Tempe's Geek's night out festival & the manager generously provided me & my crew with 2 free pizza's & drinks for promoting them at the event!! The pizza was great NY style thin crust &  very tasty!

I highly recommend them, my crew & I eat there often after shows & the hook up today was much appreciated !"}
{"text":"I enjoy their pizza. Nice big slices. I like the \"crispyness\" on the bottom of the slice,   Today we got the Pepperoni/ Sausage and the BBQ Chicken. Slices were huge so one slice each was enough to fill us up.

I'm giving them 4 stars because I enjoy the pizza. My head today wanted to give them 2 stars for service but my heart couldn't.   Service was slow. One girl was working register and getting slices until suddenly a girl emerged from the back. She immediately put her hand up to her mouth and stood there dumbfounded \"Which way did they go, which way did they go?\"  Where were the usual server boys  today?"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Being from nyc it is difficult to find good pizza in charlotte.  Slices is the only place to meet that standard.  I recommend this place to everyone.  Great food and great prices."}
{"text":"Huge pieces of heaven. Super greasy but that's part of the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Tried calling the other day to order some pizzas from here for the first time. Was skeptical when I read the Yelp reviews, but decided to give them a chance because everyone has different tastes. Well, unfortunately one of the reviews I read was spot on when they said slices is never open during their posted hours. I called at 11am when they said it opened, got a recording saying the magic jack customer you have dialed is not excepting calls at this time. Called at 11:30am, same. Called at noon, same. Really, REALLY glad I didn't just go ordering online like I saw one person who reviewed on Yelp did, she ordered online and they weren't open like they were supposed to be but yet, it charged her card immediately and had to go through the bank to reverse the transaction. This place is a joke from what I've experienced and from what I've read. I don't get how places like this stay in business whenever they're actually even open, which who knows when that is because their hours they post aren't accurate. Better off spending a little more money for one of their competitors."}
{"text":"Mill Ave has a variety of different foods but working here forces me to grab something quick. Slices is great because its right around the corner and just about as fast as Jimmy Johns which gets old after several days of the same sandwich. Slices offers rather large portions of pizza for a great price. The place isn't the biggest or fanciest looking but it makes up for it by offering many different styles of pizza. The late hours also make this an ideal place for drunk nights on MIll, which happens often."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the great taste and quality of the food! I tried the ziti and you get A LOT of food for the price. The staff is always kind and helpful and the delivery time is great! Try the desserts as well.. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, but horrible customer service. I ordered a slice of pizza and a drink. While I was waiting for my pizza, I went to fill up my drink. I tried to fill my cup with ice and nothing was coming out. I tell the girl at the counter there is no ice in the machine, and with an attitude she tells me to hold the ice lever down for a minute or so, so I did and still nothing. I ask for a refund and she calls another girl over and says (again with an attitude) \"she wants a refund because there's no ice in the machine.\" The other girl hands me my change and walks away."}
{"text":"Courteous service, fast delivery and great pizza! Literally the best cannolis my friend and I have ever had."}
{"text":"Over the past few months this business is going downhill. This Sunday night was horrible. There was spilled soda all over the floor. The pizza was burnt. There is tagging all over the bathroom. The poor girl behind the counter tonight couldn't even help a customer who stated he paid online. She said she didn't know how to verify that! 

We didn't expect a 5 star place for pizza but seriously get a fresh coat of paint for that place and better staff!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that there are several Slices restaurants in the Valley. The one on Mill is by far the best. They have the most amazing and original selection of pizza.  No matter what you pick, it will be good.  If your favorite isn't available when you walk in, no problem! They will make it for you! If you are looking for a slice of heaven, you MUST try the salad pizza.  No, its not lettuce on crust!  It is simply the most unbelievable creation that includes artichokes, red pepper, and spinach.  It is great by itself, but ask for them to put balsamic dressing on top.  The balsamic takes it from being amazing to last meal quality :-)"}
{"text":"4 stars for what it is - cheap pizza. And cheap pizza is good pizza. And this is some of the best cheap pizza I've had around the university area. I'm down here a few times a month, whenever I don't have a full hour for lunch. The line moves pretty fast, even in the middle of the lunch rush, and there's a pretty good selection. For vegetarians, there are usually at least 3 or 4 veggie options other than just plain cheese - but not right when they open at eleven.

Eating inside can be fine or annoying depending what they're playing on the TV, which varies quite a bit, anything from Spike TV's MXC (hilarious) to Barney (extremely disturbing - seriously, have you ever sat and watched one of these shows? Some freaky-deaky shit!!) and everything in between."}
{"text":"I usually go here about 1:45- 2:15 a.m. Fridays or Saturdays during the school year to watch people fight., the pizza tastes like cardboard, and the crust will cut the roof of your mouth. Also there ranch tastes weird..."}
{"text":"Large variety of specialty pizzas served by the slice. Small patio area right on Mill for your dining pleasure. Good option for a quick lunch on Mill."}
{"text":"Great Tasting pizza!  Small cafe type and can get very busy with a wait. But definitely worth the wait. If you like gooey East Coast style pizza you will love slices!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to try their pizza and the staff was friendly. Ended up getting their special for any 2 slices (with any toppings, pictures to be posted) which was a good deal. Slices were enormous, not too greasy, and very tasty with an excellent crust and fresh ingredients. Great local place that is now my go to for pizza in the area and I think they deliver too. Seems to be mainly take out with not much seating."}
{"text":"The pizza was good and priced well for a big slice. I had one issue with not knowing how long the pizza had been sitting out, but since many establishments do that, I figured it was okay. The problem was with the staff. While we were eating there, we noticed three employees and all were on their cell phones. One guy was talking on cell phone, while leaning over the pizza, probably spitting on the food while he was talking. It was enough to gross me out and not go back."}
{"text":"Being from Boston myself, this is one of the few places on the west coast that reminds me of the pizza back home. GREAT pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Massachusetts, and I went to UMass Amherst. My favorite pizza place out there was a little gem called Antonio's. I suspect the guys from Slices are familiar with the place. This is a loving replica of Antonio's. UMass Alumni need to check out this pizza place. It will bring back memories of Antonio's. I've been many times and never had a bad slice."}
{"text":"Not good, everyone on here is most likely related to the owners. I would rather heat up a Tostinos frozen pizza than eat at slices."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just to write this review. I ordered the potato bacon, it might as well should have been called the Starch and Flavorless. A little bit of salt and some basic 4th grade home-ec knowledge could have made this bland bread isoscelese semi-edible. A hybrid between eating an uncooked potatoe and stale week old cut of bacon, this pizza lacked anything that could be considered.... Well....pizza

Super pissed"}
{"text":"I love this place, its great to curve pizza cravings without having to order a whole pizza and its great when you are with a group and they can't agree on what type of pizza to order, here they can get whatever they want.. 

Bad news first.. Depending on the time of day the pizza can be tough.. it isn't made to order.. they make all the pies in advance then when you order they throw a slice back into the oven to reheat, which isn't bad.. but when you go in late at night or between rushes you can sometimes end up with a pizza that is tough.. 

Over then that! I still love the there pizza, The white pizza is the best it has a light butter taste, pesto, tomatoes, and wonderful cheese.. can't get enough. The classic pepperoni is great and they have it with a bunch of other options; with mushrooms; sausage; black olive; etc.. They also have a huge mixtures of pizza's that you don't normally see, such as a greek theme with artichokes, mixture of olives, feta, and more goodness.. They also have chicken bqq and just a bunch of stuff.. 

I love it because it tastes good, its cheap, and you can get basically whatever you could possibly ask for on a slice.. and its great hangover  food or to wrap up a night of drinking.."}
{"text":"Good pizza and salad.  Delivery to my downtown hotel was courteous and quick.

Supreme pizza has good crust, the right amount of sauce and decent toppings.

Greek salad...really good and huge.HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place if visiting Charlotte"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick slice on the run or a late night on Mill Ave. They have a good variety of flavors and nice, friendly staff."}
{"text":"New owners???  The crust is 1/2 in thick. My kids are used to the 1/8 in crust. Nothing like the Slices we are used to for the past 10 years."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Since Luigi's closed on East Blvd, I have been looking for someplace nearby that knows how to make a decent pizza. I ordered plain cheese- no extras. It tasted no better than the frozen kind. The sauce tasted like it came directly out of a jar. No distinct flavor from herbs or spices.The  cheese wasn't good either, it didn't have that gooey/stretchy consistency you get with NY style pizza. It was more like low fat/low quality cheese. The crust was the only part they got right. Just the right amount of crispness. I truly hope they can improve on their product, it's a shame not to.Who doesn't like pizza???"}
{"text":"Started coming here the first week it opened, it is good east coast style pizza.  Great crust, fantastic toppings (eggplant!).  Nice owners, good niche off Mill Ave.  Never had a bad slice, it is a bit expensive though!"}
{"text":"Lukewarm pizza under heating lamps that is dried out and extremely overpriced!


Honestly I wonder if half these reviewers tried it sober if their opinions would be different."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced. $3+ for a slice is ridiculous. Filling up the cups all the way with ice and then adding the soda? Cheap. Pies left out the whole day and reheated slices for 90 seconds? Not fresh.

BUT! The location is super convenient and there isn't really a competitive alternative close by. Just around the corner from Brickyard so great for Engineering students to grab a slice. Awesome selection of pies.

If you do go here, be very specific about what you want. \"No ice\" or \"Very little ice\" if you're getting a drink, \"Make it crispy\" if you want a crispy slice or \"Don't overdo it\" if you don't. The employees are really nice, but if you're picky about pizza (and price!) you might not enjoy this place that much. You're really paying for convenience over quality IMHO."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here.  Lots of choices, and ready in just 2 minutes (the pizzas are made ahead of time, and then the slice you order is heated back up in the big oven when you order it, whihc I don't mind).  Always crisp and tasty.  Pretty good deal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Free pizza brought to us to try it out, pizza is AMAZING but have tried to order twice now with no success. The hours on the flyers are different than hours online and no one ever answers the phone. It is too bad because the pizza is really good."}
{"text":"So be warned, this place only has pizza to eat, nothing else. But the pizza is great! New York style, thin crust which is my preference. And if you don't want it too greasy avoid adding meats to it. Just stick with cheese."}
{"text":"I ordered a carry out pizza on Yelp at 1230 on a Thursday. And when I went to pick it up, they were closed???!?"}
{"text":"Whether you're stumbling down Mill Avenue late night after an evening of drinking or hungry at lunch time slices is always a good call."}
{"text":"It seems like highway robbery to buy 4 pieces of pizza and two drinks for 17+ dollars throw in the tip and it amounts to 20. So I got a half a pizza for more than most places sell a whole."}
{"text":"I don't know about all the New York vs Boston pizza that I see written here.  But I do know that Slices has great pizza (definitely the best in the Mill District) at extremely cheap prices."}
{"text":"Pretty dirty environment (after all, it IS Tempe) and awkward, crammed seating arrangement. The pizza is really over priced...$3.25 for a slice of thin cheese pizza? Come on now. Also, it sits out on a platter for hours and when you order it, they heat it up for you. I wouldn't mind that, except for it sits out in the open air, and almost every time I see flies roaming around the kitchen vicinity. Not sure I will ever eat here again-- I don't like the potential of fly poop on my extremely expensive mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"I asked the kid behind the counter what the \"daily deal\"was and he looked at the wall to check. He said a movie ticket stub or a student ID. I asked will a military ID be ok and he bit his lip and looked up as if I asked him a complex math problem. He replied with a no. I said I'll have a slice thank you. I know it's small but the fact that the kid had to think about it was rather embarrassing and pretty insulting. I won't be back and I hope they change their shitty college kid staff that's lazy and has terrible customer service. Who knows when they washed their hands last."}
{"text":"The way that Slices pizza operates is interesting. They have the pizza out on round pizza trays so that customers can see the different pizza options. However, once you order the pizza slice, they take the slice and put it into the oven to heat it up for you. I like these pizza slices because they are thin and crispy once they come out of the oven. The one I really like has pesto, mushroom, and chicken on it. They also have a student deal for students, which is two slices of pizza and a drink."}
{"text":"Delicious, New England-style pizza right in the heart of Tempe Marketplace. 

We took advantage of the movie stub ticket deal and got 2 slices and a soda for $7. My husband had the BBQ chicken and I had the pepperoni & sausage--both were delicious and we were happy they reheated our slices so they were hot! Fast service, decent prices, and tasty pizza. My only wish was that they had a low table in there so we didn't have to sit on bar stools."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great location, never takes long to get my food. A little over-priced but that's not uncommon with pizza places."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza i have ever had i really love this place i brought my girlfriend here and this is her first time here and she loved it too you giys should open up more locations around the world so people dont miss out on this unique place."}
{"text":"It's not as good as the best pizza you can get in NYC, but SLICES makes the ONLY authentic NYC style pizza I've been able to find in Arizona (and that includes NYPD which I think is pathetic). Actually originating from Boston, Slices makes the thin crispy and delicious NYC style crust with abundant delicious ingredients. I drove half an hour each way to get their pies. If you're sick and tired of Venezia's, give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good pizza in a pinch. Perfect for satisfying the appetite that you build up from shopping and walking around. It's quick, decent priced and portions are large. It's great on the toppings, the thin crust and, oh yeah, the grease too. But what kind of pizza fix would it be without the grease? 

While we won't be going out of our way to pick up pizza at Slices we know it's a good go to place when we're out and about at Desert Ridge and in the mood for some pizza. 

Take note that there isn't much space to sit inside but there's plenty of tables outside in the shopping center which is better for people watching anyhow!"}
{"text":"Look- sometimes when you're on Mill Avenue at 2:30am and you've had a couple of drinks, you just want some pizza. Sometimes, you just want to grab something quick and easy for lunch. Are you cheap? Good news, Slices is too!

I'll keep this one short. Slices hits the spot when I'm expecting cheap, quick pizza. Tastes even better when you've had a few beverages.

Bums me out when they over-crisp my crust though. Contrary to popular belief, it's not that enjoyable to bite into a slice of charred Pesto Tomato Pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Pizza wasn't hot. Cheese was burned. Ordered jalapeño on side and was cooked on pizza  
Most aggravating was ordered and paid for garlic sauce we didn't get. 
No parm cheese or red flakes in box to try to make taste better.  
Salad was ok but over priced and was given one fork?? No napkins. 
If you are drunk or late night young and don't care order but if you actually enjoy good pizza and want nice dinner COMPLETELY avoid Slices!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price. I've always ordered Slices through Postmates because they've had it on demand often. It's on mill so if you're on campus looking for a late night slice, this is the place! My favorite thing about the pizza from here is the slice size. Humongous! The cheese pizza beats any other, or maybe that's just a personal preference. The pepperoni slice is pretty basic. They have deals through Hooked and Student Insider if you're looking to save!"}
{"text":"For a by the slice pizza place, this is really good. Look beyond the traditional cheese, pepperoni, and other 1 toppings. Salad, bruschetta, potato bacon, tomato pesto, chicken pesto, white pizza. Those are some of my favorites. Pizzas are fresh because there is quick turnover. 1 is a good small meal, 2 would be quite filling."}
{"text":"Although I've earned the \"Duchess\" badge here, I'm not a huge fan. Is anyone?  Slices is the perfect \"Drunk/Sober up\" type of pizza. I can't imagine anyone stopping in for pizza here before the 10pm.  I tried quite a few ... Regular Pepperoni, Cheese, Veggie and Buffalo Chicken pizza.  All only okay.  They're less than $3 a slice .. Nice but still! During my last visit I dined with 1 teenager and a child.  They both thought the pizza was okay .. in fact when I asked what they thought about it they both just shrugged there shoulders.  Kids LOVE pizza don't they ... Slices ... not so much."}
{"text":"Their pizza was actually great but I'm giving them one star because they swapped my calzone with someone else's calzone. Normally this isn't an issue but I had cut a bite off the one I received and found out it was the wrong one. The guy then brought my correct calzone, took the one I had eaten from and went over to the people whose calzone it was. He asked them if he could cut the end off and give it to them. If they are willing to do this in front of the customers, what do they do behind the scenes? The funny/weird part was that the other customer actually said it was ok to lop off a piece of their calzone and they took it anyway because they were under time restraints!!! Amazing! I'll never come back here again, that is a completely unprofessional and disgusting way to run a business."}
{"text":"I absolutely love slices. Always good vegetarian selections and fast good service. I wish there was one closer to me:)"}
{"text":"A solid slice of greasy thin-crust pizza with a nice sauce (tasted like BBQ sauce and pizza sauce mixed) - busy with locals - no ambiance, except for outdoor dining option.

Note: Tempe had a lot of what they call \"gutter punks\" - drugged out suburban panhandlers. I didn't expect it."}
{"text":"Not the greatest pizza ever but it was good enough.

Also- they never answer the phone/ it never works? Not sure how to reach them to order"}
{"text":"A new place opened on Park Road in Dilworth.  Pizza was great.  I ordered a margarita pizza and loved it.  Crispy crust and really good flavor.  They offer carry out and delivery but it isn't a sit dine in place.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick stop to fuel up. One slice usually does the trick for me. Nice variety of slices most of the time."}
{"text":"They make real New York pizza. If you're the New England, New York or Jersey and you're home sick - please come here.  You get to meet people from back home."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. I received an email that my order was canceled. I tried calling repeatedly over and over and no one is answering. I'm furious!!! I called during normal business hours and cannot reach anyone. I emailed as well but I suspect that won't be answered. I called again and someone picked up and then hung up. This is bullshit and now I have to wait 3-7 business days to get my refund. I'm going to make sure everyone I know hears about this terrible service, or lack thereof."}
{"text":"Convenient when shopping in Desert Ridge Marketplace, however, the pizza was just AWFUL. There was too much of the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza (who uses cornmeal on the pizza anyway?) and the slice was cold when they took it out of the oven.

I would not go back for this pizza."}
{"text":"Called 5 consecutive times during operating hours, beginning at 5:15PM and nobody picked up the phone. The phone continued to ring, never hitting an answering machine.

Terrible service - how do they expect to get business if they don't pick up their phones?

We will be taking our money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Best pie in Tempe. Always fast. Corn meal on crust gives elite crunch. Delivery would be a big bonus. Might eat every day."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long day of shopping...had a slice of pep...very good. Service was quick and friendly. Great soft drink selection also."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!  It's only good if you're drunk and Jack in the Box is too crowded. Pizza sits all day and is dried out plus with tax almost $4 for a slice of pizza is a joke.  The staff is rude and don't even speak english.  So many better pizza places in Tempe and way better restaurants on Mill."}
{"text":"Slices is amazing! The place is kinda small but their pizza is SO GOOD! I always get the Pineapple pizza and love it. They have different types of pizza on some days like one time they had the baked potato pizza and it was delicious. Don't forget to ask for ranch!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"pizza by the slice\" place in AZ.

They always have a nice array of different pizzas out there.

I usually end up with a something simple like a slice of pepperoni & jalapenos.

This is as close as you get to a \"big city\" pizza joint in AZ.

Haven't tried it yet?  Do yourself a favor and make your way over to Slices and grab a bite."}
{"text":"Quick...easy...good price. Digging the chicken parm...the kid is happy with the cheese. The guy behind the counter hasn't cracked a smile once since we have been here. Lol"}
{"text":"Great local pizza place!, Their wings are AWESOME, they looked like they deep fat fried them and coated with BBQ it a tender tasty treat.  I will return...."}
{"text":"This can't just be good drunk food for ridiculously affordable prices because i came her during college for lunch and dinner and for \"Only Meal\" as in, the only meal i can afford and have time to consume. HUGE generous slices. i love the tomato pesto pizza!
I think every Slices is either owned or operated or both, by a Brazilian. i only say this because at every location, falam portugues. 
Well that little Portuguese-speaking man did a rather heroic thing last Saturday: stopped a fight that erupted not 2 minutes after we got our pizza and made our way outside to eat it. i don't know the details. Charisma is always the one who can spot a good fight and sees the best part while the rest of us watch the clean-up, unfulfilled. Some big body-builder type punched this tall skinny guy in a nerd sweater. i kept hearing something about a snapple and an arizona ice tea. someone got hit over the head with one and started swinging(?) allegedly..."}
{"text":"Excellent place for pizza. Sauce is great, crust has a good crunch. Variety of different pizzas to choose from. Wish there was one closer. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"3.6/5 Stars - Not bad, usually don't like weird pizza toppings but the potato pizza & chicken Caesar pizza are pretty good. Cornmeal crust takes a little getting used to but not a bad change of pace. Not sure if I actually consider this pizza but would eat here again."}
{"text":"Can you really dislike Slices? You have 53 drunk people wanting pizza and they deliver and deliver it in good time. Probably not the best pizza in town, but good."}
{"text":"I work in the area and enjoy the pizza. Big slices and good variety. However, I have stopped coming here since they instituted a \"cash only\" policy. I'm a modern adult, and do not carry cash."}
{"text":"Pizza was unimpressive and my slice was cold. The pizzas that they had out looked  as if they've been there for quite some time. As soon as you walk in there was an unpleasant smell that made my son want to leave. But we were hungry so we just chose to sit outside. We are not planning on returning to this establishment anytime soon."}
{"text":"Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Have plenty if by the slice options. My favorites are the chicken pesto and BBQ chicken. The BBQ chicken is a bit smokier than one might expect for BBQ. The flavor is in the meat not the sauce. I've been coming here since it was Axis and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in charlotte that I have found so far.  Cheap pizza by the slice specials, and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Is Slices pizza something I would travel across the globe for? No. But I love their pepperoni and cheese, hot out of the oven and crisp on the bottom. Add some red chili flakes and parm? It's lovely.

And yes, I get a thrill out of holding the slice up and letting the grease drip onto the paper plate before taking that first bite. If you're going to be naughty and eat pizza, I say, do it right."}
{"text":"Bunch of shady people work here! aweful service! the lady didnt have gloves on while serving the pizza and I know clearly she had just touched the register. We all know how much germs pass thru that!!!"}
{"text":"Curious what happens when you combine random cuisine with a pizza?  Slices Pizza basically.

You would be surprised how well a salad can be contained a top a pizza.   I never eat salads, so getting the chicken salad pizza was a bit out of my comfort zone.  The pizza was a good mix of chicken chunks and ranch.  The salad was just there.  Do not get the Greek salad, as a meat eater, I need some animal on my food.  The Greek salad pizza just didn't have any distinct flavors to enjoy.

The gyro pizza is kind of odd, get it if you're feeling a bit more adventurous then Hawaiian.  The slices are pretty large, but if you're hungry make sure to get two.  

Stop by if you need a quick bite of some Frankenstein pizza and be pleasantly surprised with the results."}
{"text":"Don't let the unkempt look deceive you, their pizza is pretty amazing. The fact that the price is pretty cheap is just an added bonus. Compared to other places in the area, its a steal for good food. When you don't feel like paying 10 bucks for a meal that would otherwise cost half that, Slices is great.

I couldn't decide between three or four stars because of how dirty the eating area looks. However, I give them the benefit of the doubt for having really good pizza and pretty friendly staff - at least anytime I've ever been there. Its small and homely inside but for me it adds to the atmosphere. 

Oh and its conveniently located next to a Palm Reader and the Hippie Gypsy..."}
{"text":"Slice's is my spot! 
Their potato bacon, chicken mushroom pesto, and pesto are my favorites! The slices are huge and the flaovr is yummy. My 2 year old is a picky eater. He eats their left overs cold! I am a huge fan of good crust, they have it. This is the ONLY thin crust pizza I like... A lot!
I'm SO happy they are closer to my home!"}
{"text":"Decent slice for a fair price. Not gonna win any awards, but it was a foldable slice and they had many choices available, but no indication on how long those pizza pies were sitting out in the open world. Some of the slices looked like they were on death's doorstep.
  No lunch specials either, but all slices are between $2.75 and $3.25. My choice today was on the upper end and it was the unusual provolone slice. I think it just had a piece of prov with some tomatoes instead of mozzarella. It needed a good dose of garlic, black pepper and parmesan, but finally the flavors came out. We clearly do not live in NY and the pizza quality in Phoenix (at least NY style) reflects this opinion. 
    Plus get your AC fixed. At 110 outside, it may have only been 99 inside. Tables should be wiped also more often."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this small place while doing my laundry nearby at The Wash House.  I nearly missed it because walking on the sidewalk you can barely see any signage.  They made me some of the most fantastic pizza ever.  I wish I had known about slices sooner.  The staff was very friendly and attentive and I'm pretty sure the owner made the pizza.  Today their promotion was $10 for a pie.  Their pizza easily beats out  everyone around and for $10 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I went in at 9:35pm and asked for either a calzone or cheese slice and they said they were out of both and wasn't making anything else for the rest of the night. All they had was slices with meat on them. I'm a vegetarian. What kind of pizzaria doesn't have cheese slices a half an hour before they close? I was craving this place too after seeing a movie. After this horrible first experience I am never coming here again."}
{"text":"Any place with a boisterous Bostonian as an owner and Red Sox memorabilia plastered on the walls automatically makes me a fan. The fact that their pizza is delicious makes me an even bigger fan. All these people who say the counter service is rude have obviously never been to Boston, and cannot appreciate the assholeic nature of its inhabitants. I mean, do you really think the people who are taking your order really give a shit about how you're doing? I don't. Anyway, I ordered 8 pizzas for the office the other day and tried 3 different kinds, yes I can slaughter an ungodly amount of pizza, and I don't care about the repercussions. Call me a fat kid if you want.. The crust is perfection. The cheese, oh god, the cheese is a mouthgasm, the toppings are all fresh and delicious and the slices are HUGE. They also sell em by the slice @ $3.25, but considering what I just said, its totally fair. They have a potato, bacon and cheese kind that I am dying to try, and since lunch is in an hour and its a 45 second walk away, I'm probably going to go satisfy my craving... 

and then some... 

My only complaint is that they don't deliver.. but other than that, its wicked pissah."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. Went to nori spent $72. Walked across to Slices- spent $2. Asked for half of a slice (to be healthy). Girl said, \"no.\" Told her she could charge me whatever it costs and throw the other half away. Grudgingly, she said, \"ok.\"

Kind of awkward, but ultimately she served it with a smile, and it was delicious. Next time I will skip Nori, and go straight there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been ordering from this place for over a year.  We always get an assortment of chicken wings delivered and it is always good and delivered quickly."}
{"text":"There is a status quo with by the slice pizza joints that is far exceeded by Slices.  They make a gajillion different types of pizza and the crust is perfect.  the options are plenty and the quality of pizza is very good, especially considering the pizzas are sitting there waiting to be eaten.

Yes, it's true that this place is busy with college kids, and there was a day (sadly long passed) when that wouldn't have bothered me, but on the whole it is a really solid place to eat for lunch or dinner.  If you're in the mood for pizza you will not regret going here."}
{"text":"Nothing has changed about this place and it's been...ahem...a few years since I've been here. I used to work on Mill Ave. (before it went corporate) and we used to stop by Slices after the bars closed.

This is was the first places where I had a pizza without pepperoni and LOVED it.  I only order the Salad pizza here and even after years, it is still just as good.

Slices slices are full big and the taste delicious!  If you have a craving for pizza, Slices has a topping for everyone!"}
{"text":"Just tried Slices for the first time last night and it's definitely about the size and unique flavors here! Even the soda fountain was loaded up on selections. I ordered a slice of chicken pesto, my son ordered a slice of chicken bacon barbecue and a supreme. Mine was pretty tasty but once I took a bite of my son's chicken bacon barbecue I had food envy, hate when that happens! Now I know what to order when we come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Supreme for pick-up. 19\" size was beyond belief. Here on vacation in Marriott timeshare and the box barely fit in the fridge. Pizza was nice. Thin crust and plenty of toppings, though they could have done a better job at slicing it up. 

Only issue is the place is hard to find in the desert ridge plaza. Tucked into a little \"alley\" that had other restaurants near the AMC theater. Used the car GPS and could not find. Asked a store employee and he pointed to the location."}
{"text":"Here at Slices now, went up to the counter to order and the man standing there pretended like I did not exist. Finally, he looked over and asked me what I wanted. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza. He was extremely rude and the slice was mediocre for $3 each. Don't come here, there are plenty of good, less expensive pizza places to go to where you can get some decent customer service."}
{"text":"This place is cool...went on a Saturday night which was not the best idea considering there were people everywhere partying. Anyhoo parked and got to the door and 2 semi-drunk guys swung the door open so hard I felt the air on my head...which literally pissed me off because they looked at me like I was in the way after they almost hit me. So I \"accidentally\" bumped into one of the guys knocking his pizza on his shirt. When they were about to say something smart they noticed the big buff guy behind me ready to hand out beat downs...yes yes that is my man hahahaha. Sooooo the line wasn't really long and it took less than 5 minutes to get our slices which is was really good because we parked in public parking and it's free if you are there less than an hour. So not only did we get good slices but we got to look around for a bit and didn't even have to pay for parking. :) I give this place 4 stars out of 5 because the crowds around and in front of the place on Saturday nights is huge, the place is extremely small and cramped, cops everywhere, people just randomly walking in front of your car while your trying to drive...people bumping into you, almost hitting you with doors, basically if you dont like drunk people just go on a week night."}
{"text":"Went to Slices after the ASU game on Saturday and despite being packed with guests they were pretty awesome. Line moved quick and efficiently, the staff was friendly and the pizza was great. Definitely would go again. Only down side was that it is a smaller venue so finding seating was difficult and with that many guests they ran out of certain selection slices so if you wanted those you'd have to wait. Otherwise great place."}
{"text":"Simple pizza joint  quick and in expensive.   I had a slice of pepperoni and black olive and my husband had the chicken pesto.  Both were excellent.  Good place to go if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but amazing service. People couldn't be nicer, got two quick slices of the peperoni and their homemade ranch."}
{"text":"This reminds me of the pizza joints that I used to frequent in NY and NJ - small, extremely casual, with a good variety of  pizzas ready to be sampled, especially if you are in the mood for trying more than one kind. Because the pizzas are already cooked and are in full view, it's easy to make a choice - or choices. As in the pizzerias that crowd the northeastern seaboard, the pizzas here are mainly thin-crust and you get your order fast because the slices chosen just need to be heated up. I went here to try their cauliflower-crust pizza, which I ordered with a topping of pepperoni. It was decent and satisfying, and it's quite amazing that the cauliflower crust had almost the same texture and flavor as a regular wheat crust. Definitely a place I would visit again for  pizza meal or snack during my next visit to the Desert Ridge Marketplace."}
{"text":"I'm familiar w desert ridge I lived in Arizona for 2 years in the area w my uncle his wife and my cousins we came here today to walk around and grab a small lunch my aunt chose this place and I was excited and then quickly disappointed. The staff was rude the second we walked in the door not friendly whatsoever, the pizza looked good I chose the margarita looking one w the cheese and basil. The man at the register asked if we wanted it on plates or boxed up he gave the slices to us on plates. Not a big deal but why ask if you aren't going to listen, we went outside to sit and eat the pizza wasn't great mediocre at best. My sister went in for seconds and they boxed it up even tho she said on a plate and the second piece that I was eating (because I was starving) had a short black hair on it which most people probably wouldn't have seen, it was tucked under some cheese. Repulsive, not going back, do not recommend... all around very disappointing experience it's hard to mess up pizza"}
{"text":"This place had had amazing pizza and I don't say that about many places thus place had exceptional food! And now that they added desserts wings and breadsticks it's even better"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a quick slice of pizza or more. Just keep in mind that the interior is not very big so it's definitely geared towards more of a take-out place. With that being said I do enjoy their pizza here and they have a bunch of slices on display. The prices are very reasonable for what you get as well. I find myself coming here fairly often whenever I head to Tempe Marketplace simply because it's very convenient and the pizza slices come out of the oven in less than a few minutes."}
{"text":"Outside of musical tastes, I'm not sure there is a question (besides maybe religion) that elicits a stronger response than, what type of pizza do you like?

I recently saw the results of a national survey that had Pizza Hut at the top of the Pizza Food Chain.  I almost lost my lunch.  I really shouldn't read (or drive) while I'm eating. I guess someone finally figured out how to train monkeys to answer surveys.

Many times we fall hostage to the Pizza that is closest to our current proximity.  Glad I didn't have to find a wife this way.  Desert Ridge is a great outdoor mall, cool, boutique shops and eateries-perfect for a sunny January afternoon lunch and sunshine. I was ready to try something new at the frequent haunt.

Slices.  As in a slice of pizza. Two or more if you're hungry and I typically am.  First time in and I was satisfied although not overwhelmed with the pizza.  Had two slices of their combo.  Size of each slice was very generous, I probably didn't need the second slice but I also shouldn't second guess myself :) The combo had sausage, pepperoni, peppers, and probably a few too many mushrooms (and I like mushrooms).  

The pizza is par-baked so they need to throw it in the oven to re-warm them.  Each slice wasn't foldable enough for my taste and it may be due to the par-cooking and re-heating as the crust is really pretty thin.  I found both the crust and the sauce tasty enough and will definitely be back in the future although I believe there is room for improvement.  The service, btw, was great."}
{"text":"They offer delicious pizza and a variety of drinks for an okay price. I personally love heading here for a quick bite to eat. The atmosphere is very casual and the place is usually pretty cramped and crowded. My favorite pizza to get is the veggie so I can feel like I'm being somewhat healthy. ;)"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Tempe since 1998. They have great specialty pizzas.  Some of my favorites: chicken parm, cheese & tomato, and plain cheese.  Many of my friends love the baked potato but I haven't tried that one.  There's also bbq chicken, taco, and more. The guys who opened this place are from Boston and it's a true East coast pizza place. I try to get there every time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Unlike previous reviews, my service experience was flawless.  They answered the phone on the 3rd ring, got my order correct, and I was out the door when I arrived for p/u about 15 minutes later.  The wings were good--very Buffalo style--with traditional hot sauce and little to no breading.  I did not care for the pizza, however.  I felt the crust was dry, the sauce just OK, and the toppings sparse.  I also prefer canned mushrooms on my pizza vs. the uncooked ones (not everyone agrees), and they were chopped so fine the flavor was lost."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a decent price, with horrible counter service. A Ctrl-F search of the word \"rude\" on this place's Yelp page will show 4 results, which doesn't surprise me the least.

Make that 5 results now."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza & lemonade, somewhat rude service. 

The pizza was honestly some of the best I have had in awhile. The prices are somewhat high and according to the server a cheese slice is the same price as a slice of buffalo chicken; weird. Overall Slices is a rocking place to grab a quick bite before a baseball game or a trip to Casino Arizona. 

I recommend the Spicy Chicken & the Chicken Parm pizza's, off the hook!"}
{"text":"Pizza, and a full menu. The Pizza is made the way it should be! It also seems like everyone eating & working there are all one big happy family. Very impressed and happy to share with everyone in & around the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I rate the pizza 6/10. Pretty big slices, but 2 cheese slices and a drink just under $8, get out of here with that. Light sauce and bland. Skimpy on the cheese."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Charlotte 3 months ago and have desperately been searching for a GOOD pizza place. Not average, not cool because of the beer on tap, we want some freakin good pie. Look no further! The ingredients were great, and the crust was crunchy and fluffy at the same time. Great sauce/cheese ratio and a great price.

The couple that owns it are really cool too, and other than the Ohio State stuff littering the walls, this is hands down the best 'za in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza plus they're open late! Slices is definitely the place to go whether its 2am or you just want a quick bite. It's a bit on the pricey side for single slices but they are pretty big. I looove the white pizza! They have a lot of interesting flavors like potato pizza. I really like that their crust is softer than most other places, so it doesn't feel like gnawing on a piece of dry cardboard.
Not too much indoor seating so it's probably not ideal for large groups, but it's not like it takes too long to finish a slice of pizza. Definitely worth a stop by!"}
{"text":"Pizza quality never disappoints.  However, servers need to tie their hair back... same memory of the location by Mill Avenue.  Basic hygiene, please!"}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews on here, I feel obligated to point out that Slices is not just a no-atmosphere semi-okay pizza joint that's close to your office; it's also the best late-night hangover preventative on (okay, technically near) Mill Avenue.  Once the bars close on any Friday or Saturday night, there's a line out the door.  The pesto chicken pizza is amazing (I've had it while sober too).  Other people I know are loyal to the potato skin pizza - slices of potato, melted cheddar cheese, bacon- you get the idea.  Whether you just want basic cheese and pepperoni or something with a little more pizazz, Slices is sure to have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Slices is a great place to pick up a quick bite to eat when you are visiting Desert Ridge.   I had a slice of the BBQ Chicken pizza and a slice of Hawaiian.  Both were very good!   That is just 2 of the wide variety of pizza options they provide.  The staff is friendly and they toss your slices in the oven for a couple minutes to make sure it is warm for you too.

The only downfall is a lack of seating, but that can be remedied by the abundance of outdoor seating right outside the front door.  The inside was a little warm, but they had 2 industrial fans going full boar so it wasn't too miserable on this hot August night..."}
{"text":"I am proud to say that we finished a whole 19\" pizza to ourselves!! We stopped by Dessert Ridge - and I thought we had eaten at every place in there....but the smell of pizza is like music to the ears!
Seating is limited in this place - there are only a few tables.
Beware that salt was not on the table - its GARLIC powder!
There were about 8 different pizza varieties on display - we had the pepperoni and cheese - classic.
They win high regards for their crust!"}
{"text":"Used to like this joint years ago. Not sure if there is new owners or management, but the quality is not what it once was.  Over all flavor is fair. The dough is fair and they seem to be skimping on the cheese. The last 3 times  it has been the same. I guess it is a trend. One star for good selection, one star for quality and one star for price equals 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I'd call it Philly/NJ style, as the crust was rather doughy and not thin but on the thinner side. I ordered a slice of margarita, and it was delicious. Sauce was mild, and the mozz slices were a great compliment. There were at least 8 pizzas to choose from, and probably more options that I didn't see. The options were very varied and I think there was something there for everyone. They also have one of those soda machines where you can customize everything. 

The place is small and kind of cozy. There are one or two small tables, and then one long table that seats like 20 people. There is plentiful outdoor seating outside around fireplaces and the water feature for kids. 

I noted at least two dessert options, but it's close to cold stone and other locations if you're looking for more dessert options. 

Nice place! I'd def go again."}
{"text":"I love how late they are open. Perfect for a quick piece of pizza after a wild night on Mill. Workers are very friendly and efficient. I wish the space was bigger because it gets very crowded in there."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Slices after I googled a place to get pizza by the slice in Charlotte (I was craving it). As soon as we walked in, it felt like being in New York City with the decorations and the employees. I got two slices of pizza and a drink for $5 (a steal- the slices were HUGE) and my fiancé got wings. We weren't originally planning on staying because they only have a counter to sit at, but after talking with Anthony at the cash register, we wanted to stay and hang out with him and the owner. They were a lot of fun and the food was delicious, we can't wait to make this a regular spot for us for a cheap and great date night."}
{"text":"Decent pizza at a good price for a quick bite while in desert ridge.  It isn't going to win any prizes for best pizza but not a bad choice for something affordable while in this part of town."}
{"text":"Quite good place for slice. They don't ferment their dough so it is lacking in some flavor, but their toppings are spot on and generous. Their prices are super reasonable and this is a fun place to come. We had a slice of pepperoni and one of cheese and also a slice of their potato ricotta which was the best of the lot.

The bathrooms were very clean and the pace was easy to get to and the service was 5/5.We will be back."}
{"text":"Easy place to grab a quick bite, however for what it is, very basic and over priced."}
{"text":"I really don't like pizza. 

Now before you look at me like I just told you I don't accept Jesus Christ as Lord or I killed my first born... (for some reason I get this reaction every time I say I don't like pizza. Seriously, what is it with the world and their love affair with pizza!?) 

Anyways. I've had pizza in New York, Chicago, and in Boston. I think I'm pretty damn schooled on pizza. I just plain don't like it.

That being said, I've always had one rule. I don't like pizza unless it's Slices. Back in the day everyone knew the only way to get me to eat pizza was to venture to Mill Ave and pick me up something from Slices. Looking back I can't remember what it was about slices that made me claim it as the only pizza I'll eat but it was probably the fact that they would make me an artichoke heart and feta cheese pizza. l think the trick to get me to like pizza is to fool me by making it not taste like pizza

Today I went to Slices for the first time in years. (since I'm not a fan of pizza in general) 

When you're ordering a single slice you shouldn't ever expect it to be fresh and hot. They do put it in the oven for a few minutes though to get it that fresh feeling. The selection of premade slices was kind of small compared to the Mill location but they did have one that caught my eye. A pizza with nothing but vegetables. There wasn't even any cheese or sauce! I felt like I was in heaven. My heart was pounding. Could it be!?

The pizza itself was really great but I'm not sure if I can even call it a pizza. I feel like I'm cheating. Bread + hot vegetables = pizza??? My brother got pepperoni and mushroom and my grandpa got sausage. They both said that it was really good pizza that was totally worth 3 bucks a slice.

Anyways the service was pretty good but the seating was horrible. They only have a bar and one table along with some outside seating. Hello! We live in Arizona. Nobody wants to eat outside in the heat or be cramped at a bar next to strangers. They lose a star for that because seriously when you're in a high traffic location like Tempe Marketplace you need to have better places for people to sit. We're tired from shopping and it's hot outside!!

All in all, I think my opinion is still the same. I hate pizza but love Slices."}
{"text":"Their pizzas taste great, but last time I went in, they didn't have my favorite pizza. The supreme one :/ definitely disappointed. But other than that, the place us delish."}
{"text":"When did this get so expensive? It seems like the quality has dipped and the prices have gone up? With all the competition around, y'all better get it together, because it's too late for me.."}
{"text":"It's overpriced pizza, for anything with more then 1 topping your looking at over $3 a slice. 2 slices and tap water for $7 w tax. Don't get me wrong its not the taste that bugs me its the price. Its good pizza, lots of flavor and they have different slices to pick from, potato, bbq chicken, pepperoni, sausage, cheese even. The best deal is if you can get everyone to agree on a whole pizza pie.The staff is less then friendly, they just ring you up take your cash or card and off you go...heck i didn't even get the total or a receipt for that matter. Had to look at my credit card online to see how much it really was... but for some reason its packed every time so that tells you right there the pizza is good i guess. The inside is a little small and crowded and not good for group lunches."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by Slices 30 minutes before they were about to close and scored a whole pizza for $6. I thought that was a steal considering all the specialty slices they offer. The girls who worked there said they were trying to get rid of the pizza because they hate to throw away leftovers. We were excited to try some slices of pizza we normally wouldn't order like bbq chicken, pesto, and potato/bacon pizza. The potato/bacon pizza dipped in ranch was my favorite out of the three that I tried. I wouldn't brag about the pizza at Slices but I wouldn't knock it either."}
{"text":"Best pizza on earth. I live in Vegas, we have a few decent pizza spots out here, but ever since eating at this place about 3 years ago I dream about their pizza. 

If you read my past reviews, you'll know I have a philosophy for good pizza. Basically, if you do it right you don't have to resort to theatrics when making pizza. I have the same philosophy for bangin too, but that's a different topic. 

I've had the cheese, I've had the meat lovers and I've had the hawaiian. All legit, very fresh and the crust is delicious. 

They have yoohoo and ibc cream soda and of coke products are always a huge plus. 

Sadly, I can't see myself making my way back to Tempe to go to slices anytime soon, but it'll happen."}
{"text":"Slices is a great place to go for either great pizza slices or the entire pie. I love to grab a quick slice right after a movie. Nate is great and the entire staff are very efficient and friendly"}
{"text":"Ordered online.  Tried to call to verify that the order was received, but all it did was take me to a magic jack voice mail service.  I must have called ten times in an hour.  They took the money out of my bank account instantly though.  Guess I have to call my bank and reverse transaction.  Warning: do not order online.  Should have ordered from Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Slices pizza.

Pros: Friendly service, good selection of flavors, multiple pies on hand for a speedy meal on the go.  Chocolate Chip (more like chocolate chunk) cookies were excellent.

Cons:  The restroom has little more than mood lighting above the sink (please replace the ceiling bulbs!). The pizza toppings had little flavor and I wasn't advised of all the mushrooms (which I don't care for) hidden underneath the pesto sauce.  A sign indoors offers a discount when you show your Harkins ticket stub.  Great if you dine after the movie, but a downer if your schedule is in the reverse (and don't feel like making an extra trip to the ticket counter.)

Overall, not a bad place for a quick bite, though not a destination place."}
{"text":"Great food ~ ALWAYS FRESH when you walk in
FRIENDLY STAFF ~ main reason why I keep coming back! Absolutely love Joe & the Slices Crew!!
Nice location ~ Easy for me to get to from work & home. Best of all worlds!
PRICE ~ there's always specials, deals and Free Delivery available. Definitely get the most bang for my buck no matter what l order. I'm full & satisfied every single visit. 

Can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner!!"}
{"text":"So I came to get a simple pepperoni and sausage pizza. Nothing crazy right? Well this dude with a hat places the slice into the oven and i sit waiting for my ONE slice. The place was not busy only 3 other people were there, who were already done eating. After 10 minutes of waiting I asked how long it takes to heat up the pizza and he checks all the ovens to see where the pizza was. He must have burned it since he had to reheat another slice. Those entire ten minutes of waiting was just him on his phone not doing his job. He completely forgot about my order even after making obvious eye contact. This place is a joke and people who work here are not competent enough to even heat up a slice of pizza. He must not really care about this job but he works in food service. How hard is it to heat up one slice! I understand this is college town with lots of kids but there's still people who expect a decent amount of service. And I won't be coming back to this hole again. Thanks a lot to your employers!"}
{"text":"We ordered veggie & pepperoni which were both superb! The staff here is amazing! I had a difficult time making up my mind and they gave me an excellent deal for no reason. Super sweet guys! I might have to make this place my regular cheat day Wednesday! Keep up the awesome job!"}
{"text":"This place has some bomb late night pizza. My spot every time I come out to Tempe to drink."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. I had pepperoni and sausage. I almost left because Service is a bit slow. I'm glad I waited, but if there's more then two people in line, I probably won't wait."}
{"text":"If your looking for a slice and you want it quick than this is a good place.  I was born and raised in queens NY and I know NY Style pizza.  This is a good try but not exactly there. 

 First off they claim to be a NY Pizza joint but everything on the walls is boston.  Secondly and more importantly I lived in NY for 22 years and ate pizza a few times a week, never in all that time eating NY pizza did I have a pizza place use cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza.  It was always flour.  I'm not saying that the pizza was bad because of the cornmeal but it would be better without that cornmeal taste that comes with every bite.  

The service is ok but the employees always look like they would rather be someplace else.  Like I said before if you want  a quick slice while on or near mill, check it out."}
{"text":"I was walking around my usual haunt and I noticed that Slices had opened up shop near the movie theatre.

Some people may be familiar with the slices on 6th St. and Mill.  I have always wanted to try this place, but it always seems to be closed.

I ordered a slice of the chicken pesto pizza and a coke.  The pizza was crisp and delicious.  The feta gave it an awesome zip.

My only complaint was that it was kind of dirty.  I was brushing parmesean cheese off everything I sat on the counter, and my pants since it was on the seats as well.

I will still be going back.  That spicy chicken pizza looked to good to pass up."}
{"text":"The Greek Salad Pizza Slice is The Bomb!  If you love artichokes, this is the one.  The slice is full packed of artichokes. feta cheese, olives, and tomatoes.  The ingredients are super fresh.  I haven't seen ingredients this fresh on a pizza in ages.  By far, the healthiest pizza slice I've eaten in the US.  Normally pizza crust and/or the pizza is full soggy of grease and fat at most pizza places.  Not here.  Crust felt and tasted light and good and what's more, after eating here, I felt good and not slow, sluggish, which I cannot say for 99% of pizza places out there."}
{"text":"Just ok.  The selection was adequate but not impressive. I didn't see any vegetarian pizza options. The place was crowded and dirty. The trash can was full and nearly overflowing. All empty tables were dirty and unwiped. The pizza was ok, nothing to write home about. One slice (one topping) was $3.49, fair I guess. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"In the pizza wars of Tempe/Phoenix, AZ, supposedly the word is Slices is where it is AT in terms of authentic pizza.

After climbing the A mountain, me and some guys needed to re-fuel fast (on fucking ST PATTYS night, none the less, on MILL ave) and I threw in my towel about pizza. The inside was like any other quickie pizza place with some high tables and counter seating. The selection, considering how busy the place got, was actually looking a little too congealed in my opinion. I went for the pesto and tomato slice and it wasnt too oily. They had all the extras handy right there (garlic, red pepper, etc). There was a LOT of cheese on this slice-but it didnt really have much flavour to it. Just kind of rubbery and chewey. The pesto sauce was light on garlic heavy on basil (so none of those horrifying garlic burps occured later) but pretty non-descrept. There wasnt a whole lot of tomato sauce on my slice, which is fine cause I dont like the cheese slip-sliding all over the place cause of too much cause-but it could have used a bit more just b/c the crust was so thin and DRY it actually hurt to swallow. I had to kill my big bottle of water just to get this puppy down my throat. I didnt even bother with the crust. 

The pizza wasn't disgusting, but I wouldnt ever go out of my way to come here-only under the above kinda circumstances would I consider ordering a slice here.

In the Pizza Wars, I am totally a Gus's lady."}
{"text":"Thee best za in town. Hands down! 
Love to go here and sober up after a night of debauchery on mill.
A little pricey for a large but it's worth every dime. The shop on mill is the only one to go to. The rest let their pizza sit all day why mill slices is always pumping them out.
Only bad thing about this slices, is the cocky college students always trying to fight you when your in line. 
Go at your own risk from 12-2am. Other than that it's awesome."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience at Gus's NY Pizza Lounge (http://www.yelp.com/biz/guss-ny-pizza-lounge-scottsdale) in Scottsdale after a recent evening of drunken debauchery, and while I was hopeful that Slices Pizza wouldn't let me down quite as much? It did. 

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?

So you've just emerged from the Mill Ave. club scene having no doubt made various mistakes of any and every kind, and more than anything in the world, you require sustenance. Well, you're not only in good company, but Slices is one of the few places thats both walkable and open as far as Pizza is concerned, so you trot on in, hopefully with a recently found temporary companion in tow that won't have you questioning your choices in life come morning. As far as service? It's pretty straight forward. You walk in, you wait in line, and you're given some lamp-warmed pizza from someone who probably won't judge you to the extent that the normal human being should. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Yikes. I was in no state of mind to take a photo, but $3.55 got me a what was a pretty standard sized piece of pizza (Pepperoni Jalapeno in this case). You can see pics from other users on here, but needless to say, that's not even close to being worth it. $3.55? That's a king's fortune at any drive-thru window even at this hour. If we were looking at top of the line authentic New York pie? Sure, but we're not. No Star Granted.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Blech. Again, Gus's wasn't good, but I dished out a star here because they had a unique gyro flavor. Slices doesn't have a unique gyro flavor, and thus I can't really think of a single good thing about my meal there. The pizza was greasy, the crust too soft, the cheese and toppings essentially tasteless, and the portion of toppings weak. It didn't make me sick, so I suppose that's a positive. No Stars Granted.

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I've had better. Way better, and that's the definition of two stars. I probably won't be back. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"I was taken here by a friend and seriously loved it. It was a saturday night so it was stupid busy and lots of annoying people. But I can't hate on the actual pizza or service. I had a pepperoni and black olive slice and it wasn't soggy or anything like other pizza-by-the slice places. The slices are huge. The toppings are fresh and the sauce is good. It made me happy that they put the slices back into the oven once you order it to keep it hot and crispy.  For a quick slice of pizza, this place is yum."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the experience.  Good selection, decent prices, and quick service.

I tried two interesting options: chicken pesto pizza and baked potato pizza.  Enjoyed both a lot."}
{"text":"Slices is the kind of place that people go to for lunch because it's close.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  But the quality of the food is really secondary to the location.  If you like people-watching, you can stare at the freaks on Mill Ave while you nibble on some pizza.  It's also near to ASU, so if you're stuck on campus without a car, this is a good option.

The food itself is pretty average.  Slices has some really creative pizza ideas- pesto with feta cheese, loaded baked potato, and enchilada are some of the more odd varieties.   Unfortunately, their creativity is hampered by their practice of pre-making all the pizza.   

The pizza is always ready-made.  Slices seems to use the same sort of half-prepared method that Sbarro in your mall's food court used to.  They cook it almost to the point of being hot and then let it sit until someone orders a slice.  Then, the slice goes into the oven so that it's oven-fresh temperature if not oven-fresh tasting when you get it.

This place gets busy and seating is limited, so avoid busy hours if you're unwilling/unable to stand or find seating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Slices is probably by far one of the best pizza places to just grab a quick slice of pizza while shopping. Honestly can say slices is better than pizza hut or  papa johns. Lastly, the pizza slices are huge and very fulfilling for just a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick *slice* of pizza they didn't have any ready...so ordered a chicken Philly instead. Subpar. I'll go back only to try the pizza hopefully it's worth it..."}
{"text":"Being from New York it's been hard finding a good slice of pizza (it's been 15 yrs). When I'm just getting a slice of pizza I just want cheese. Hands down the best slice of cheese pizza in Arizona(comparable to ny). They offer so many more options that cater to everyone. Always fresh. Do yourself a favor and hit up Slices. Reminds me of a corner pizza place in ny, just tucked into a mall."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a slice of your favorite pizza for a couple bucks.  Can't go wrong with options like that!"}
{"text":"Dear Slices Pizza,

Thank you for offering a yelp check in discount!  Also, your baked potato bacon pizza is just as good as my beloved Georgios in East Lansing Michiagn.  Thank you for using russet not red skin potatos.  The only things you were missing was a sour cream topper.  Your Gyro pizza is also the bomb, very similar to my Georgios.  I was only in town for three days, but you are one of the reasons I will make the 2 hour trip to Tempe any day.  You are delicious....my only regret, is not eating more of you.  I really appreciate your thin crispness...Parting is such sweet sorrow.

Till we meet again,

Christy R."}
{"text":"Good for what it is - it's not gourmet but it has personality. I love all the choices ready to go and it's a great stop before the movies. Not for a first date or anything... but if you've been dating a long time and are going to see Tron because your boyfriend played that trump card when you wanted to go see Black Swan/The Fighter/NOT Tron, and you just want something to take out your aggression on, a slice of tomato ricotta or bbq chicken will do just fine."}
{"text":"We order regularly from Slices via DoorDash and have always enjoyed our food. This past time DoorDash was delaying our delivery so the owner, Joel, took it upon himself to personally deliver our food instead so it wouldn't get cold and even followed up to make sure everything was to our liking. That kind of customer service is hard to find nowadays. The food was hot and fresh, their pizzas are only $10 for 14\", the mozzarella sticks are the most underrated in charlotte and the fried dough is my favorite! Can't say enough nice things about this place! Thanks, Joel!"}
{"text":"Bad service edible pizza. Lazy staff got everything but chicken and crust wrong on my pizza! Duh  Before they took over I ate at this location every time I was at Tempe Marketplace.  Sad face, last time here.  Until they sell it to someone else.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for friends to show up to go to the movies and I was starving and wanted pizza, I walked by Slices and boy was I happy I did!  They have many different types of pizza's being sold by the slice.  They heat your slice up and make the crust have a nice toasted crunch. I ordered the veggie and it was very delish!  Glad to have found this little pizza heaven, will be back to visit it again!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place

They must have sold out


Way different....not even the same employees anymore



Placed my order for a single pizza

45 min later...isnt even started...not even an apology

Seriously...SCREW businesses like this!!!   Boycott these scumbag!!!


How u gonna take someomes money for food and not do a DAMN thing..

If you own this business....Go jump off a bridge!!!"}
{"text":"Slices consistantly satisfies my cravings for pizza. I've been to different locations, but the Mill Ave location is by far my favorite of the bunch. It's not the best pizza out there, but I give them props for variety."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Super quick, and priced well. They have a variety of options that you can purchase by the slice, and you can purchase by the pie. The veggie slice was delicious! Most places short you on the vegetables, but they didn't here!! Definitely excellent pizza for $3 a slice."}
{"text":"Crazy good pizza at 1:00 am! Thin crust deliciousness! Little hole in the wall charm welcomes everyone!"}
{"text":"Can't believe there are some one star ratings for Slices. The pizza is great and the Owner is a super nice guy, although he is an Ohio State fan.  Prices are reasonable and I guarantee you will appreciate not going to Fuel Pizza. Try the dough balls, pretty solid."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a fluke and a long day. We got served cold pizza and the girl behind the counter could care less.  Once the slice was served hot the sauce was a bit too sweet and the slice was missing an important ingredient - CHEESE.  Well I guess they must be doing something right as some people seem to love them."}
{"text":"Love their White Pizza.  Their two slices and a soda combo, great value.  And extreemly delicious! 

The place is quite small indoors, but in a pinch you can sit out doors and people watch or take it to go."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast service. Good pizza slices and pies. Friendly faces and warm welcomes. This is a really good place to sate your pizza cravings fast."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. Their pizza is shit. It sits out all day and is very dry. I bet some of those pizzas are a few days old. Nothing there is fresh. And when you \"order\" a pizza slice they just give you an old nasty dry piece of pizza thats been sitting out all day. I will never be back. I rather go to nypd pizza. Hell even dominos and pizza hut has better pizzas than this shit hole."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I love their unique types of pizza like the baked potato, and the taco pizza. My fav is still bbq or cheese. So don't change slices, don't change for anyone your a strong independent pizza shop and you don't need no man!"}
{"text":"I'm from the North East, so I understand that most pizza in North Carolina will disappoint me. This pizza is shockingly bad. The crust was burnt, but still soft and incredibly chewy? The cheese wasn't melty or stretch away from the pizza at all. The sauce-nonexistent. I gave it two stars because the ranch that came with the standard frozen jalapeño poppers was very good."}
{"text":"So good! We stop here every year for a few slices before or after our spring training trips. Delicious slices of pizza toasted up hot for you. Usually they have about six to eight different options ready. Great grab and go pizza on the way home from the bars on Mill too!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick pizza fix, Slices is the place to be.  They have a variety of pre-made pizzas to choose from, and the slices are generous.  I had the pepperoni and mushroom (yes, I am a creature of habit) and while it was not amazing, it was better than I expected and good for what it was - pre-made pizza that was reheated.  The guys working behind the counter are fast and friendly and really kept the line moving.  I recommend enjoying your pizza outside, since the space is pretty cramped and can get a little warm.  Maybe I will appreciate this more in the winter!?  Good for when you want to grab lunch or a bite before a movie."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago where we love our pizza. Since i've been in Phoenix I have tasted a lot of terrible pizzas, or as I call them \"hot circles of garbage\".

Slices is one of the few pizza joints that serve great pizza at low prices."}
{"text":"I have to upgrade a star, because for a SLICE place this is it!

I devoured 3 Slices of the Chicken Pesto, OMG that tang from the feta cheese was so damn good, it needed more if you asked me, I also picked off the chicken not that it was bad I just preferred it without (see pics)

Yum Yum!

Also a tip= I like to ask for my slice extra crisp!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm here at least once a week, sometimes twice. I work on Mill so it's great to stop by and get the BBQ chicken pizza for my lunch/dinner. Tables could use some cleaning more often, but it's still a great place to eat! Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Horrible cold crispy burned pizza. Feel bad that I fed this to my toddler. Pizza is good just bad that it's sitting out."}
{"text":"Overall good, large variety HUGE slices of pizza and reasonable prices. Good and friendly service. We tried the Veggie and Ham & Pineapple slices! Tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here for some pizza before a movie. When I checked in, a check-in offer came up offering 10% off your order. When I tried using the offer, I was told that they don't have any offers like that and wouldn't give me 10% off. 
Bummed out 
Pizza was great thought! Had pepperoni with jalapeños!"}
{"text":"I just need somebody, anybody, to come pick me up from my pizza-less home right now and take me to get a slice (or two!) at Slices. The slices of pizza here are huge, and at a good price. They have a large selection, but I usually keep it simple with a cheese slice, and it always hits the spot. Don't expect some glamorous restaurant. It's very small and a little dingy with a TV on usually playing some kind of sports. It is a quick, cheap, and easy option for those of us who just can't get their acts together. Long live Slices!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is certainly unique.  I ordered a strange potato-bacon pizza, and it was pretty bad.  Probably because of the toppings I chose.  However, everything else seems to fit a pizza dandily.  The crust was chewy and crispy and the pizza sauce worked very well with the dough.  A nice little place in Mill, and I can see why college kids would love this place, but for the general public, don't bother.   You can get better pizza elsewhere.  Good, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"LOVE.

Perfect for a quick slice at noon or 2am. 

Great variety of toppings."}
{"text":"What is with the guy working there? He is seriously pissed-off every-time I go in. Actually last time I was there I walked out because he was yelling at one of the workers and it made me want to cry. I wish she would have walked out too. The time before that he was rude, not just rude, but a complete jerk to the people in front of me, what an a-hole. 

2 stars because it is downstairs from my work, and it's cheap and if one of my co-workers goes to get a slice they always have my hawaiian pie."}
{"text":"Pretty freaking good for a hole in the wall on Mill Ave. I have been coming here for quite some time, and the pizza is consistently delicious. They have a good variety of pizzas, and the slices are quite large. One slice does it for me, and I LOVE pizza. I would consider the atmosphere somewhat dingy and lonely if you happen to be here when it's slow, but I don't mind staying for a minute while I eat a slice of pizza with my fiance. I prefer the outdoor seating if it's nice outside, though. All around great pizza at a good price."}
{"text":"Closed at 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon, what's up with that? No hours posted in the window. I would suggest that you call ahead before coming over."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed picking up a slice at Desert Ridge slices - the kids love  it, and I'm a fan of the NYC triangle slice too. Plus, I pick up all my weekly magazine reads in their shop as well."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's because I was starving, but I really enjoyed my slice here. It was particularly tasty, crisp, and the right amount of sauce and cheese (not too much). I liked the seasoned crust bottom, unlike some other reviewers. For some reason, I always like root beer with my pizza, and my craving was satisfied.

What I didn't like: not much seating, Speed channel playing, styrofoam cups with instructions not to refill more than twice. I wouldn't anyway."}
{"text":"Location is great - Tempe downtown. They are definitely one of the cheaper places in that neighborhood. Nothing fancy, just pizza by the slice, different varieties. 
Like: variety, quality, taste
Dislike: Customer service (non-existent), too small"}
{"text":"I like this pizza. Have had it a few times and although it is not NYC or NJ, it is passable. And we are picky. Where else can you eat for less that $3 before you hit the theater? Place is clean, fast and friendly. Will go back again next movie night."}
{"text":"I live in the area, and want to support my local restaurants. I have eaten tons of NYC pizza and this place is the real deal. Great wings as well. Go try then out, you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that I frequent this place. The pizza is definitely the reason I choose here over others. Everything is hand made. The only draw backs is that it's a small mom and pop shop. The tables inside only seat 2 per table, so this is not the place I would come when I'm out with a group of friends. Being on Mill Ave, you would think they would have more space because of all of the college business they can bring in."}
{"text":"I love slices! I found them when I was attending ASU :). What I really love is the chicken Cesar salad slices. This location would have gotten a 5 star but I gave a 4 (which is great still mind you) because they don't make the Chicken Cesar at this location. Great service. Love it. Awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Having been here on one occasion before and being completely satisfied with their service and product, I was expecting similar results as I stepped into Slices for the second time. My expectations were met with utter disappointment. I walked into an oven of a restaurant and immediately broke into a sweat. Then, to make matters worse, I was greeted with a blank stare by the two less than enthusiastic employees working in the front. \"What do you want?\" Was the first words out of the employees mouth and with a smile I asked for their last piece of potato pizza. I walked over to the counter to pay and a different woman (I'm assuming she was the manager because she was the only one in a red shirt) said \"What did you get\". I kindly said \"Slice of potato pizza\" and her response was a mumbled jumbled mess of numbers. \"What?\" I kindly responded. \"$3.51!!!\" She said with a glare. I handed her 4 dollars and as I waited for my change I asked for a water cup. She did nothing short of throw the cup at my chest but I caught it with a puzzled expression. Long story short, I give this review 3 stars based on my previous great experience and the acceptable quality of pizza. The service I received today was downright unacceptable and disappointing as a fellow food service worker myself. I may return to Slices, but only if the Nektar across the way is closed."}
{"text":"Yummy slices...no pun intended. 

So grab a slice, when the movie night ended.  

Or share a slice with your date. 

All and all, slices is great  ... SLICES!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza joint ever they have amazing service and you're in and out in just one min the staff are super friendly and helpful to their customers, overall this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"THIS IS ANTONIO'S FROM AMHERST MASSACHUSETTS.   as a UMASS graduate i was amazed to see our local pizza place out here when i moved here in 1997.  The pictures on the wall are of the UMASS location.  Antonio's sold the recipe to some grads who took it to arizona and brought the north east flavor to the desert.  

This is real NY style pizza.  The bbq chicken is my favorite.  chicken, bacon and bbq sauce turn a pizza snack into a pizza meal.  Lines are long but service is so quick it moves nicely.  Best place in Arizona to get real pizza!"}
{"text":"Slices began its journey in Massachusetts. In Amherst,  next to umass (my Alma mater) there was a pizza joint called Antonio's. In the late 90s they sold their recipe to some guys to open a new pizza place in Tempe called 'Slices'. The rest is history. The large picture on the wall is of college kids eating right outside of Antonio's in Amherst. It was taken in the 90's..notice the bikes in the pics have no suspension. Wasn't a thing back then. I have eaten at Antonio's from 1992 to 1997 and Slices from 1998 to present. Always consistent and my favorite by far is the BBQ chicken. It's super popular so they are out of it at times but if you see it try it."}
{"text":"Exactly what I needed when I wanted a quick snack. Looks can be deceiving, but pizza had great flavor and crust was baked in cornmeal. Added an extra dimension to the entire slice. A little pricy for a single slice, but nonetheless was tasty."}
{"text":"Huge selection of unique pizzas that all taste great. If youre on mill avenue and want a good slice of pizza be sure to stop by here. plus its open after the bars close!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings, great price! I will definitely add this to the top of my \"best pizza joints in NC\" list, and trust me, being from NY, it's not a long list! They don't skimp on the toppings and my kids loved the honey BBQ wings. They have a pretty diverse menu so you'll be sure to find something you like. I'd love to go back and give a few of their specialty pizzas a try!"}
{"text":"A perfectly adequate spot to grab a quick slice (go figure) of pizza.  It's not great, but certainly not bad.  There's a huge variety that's always ready to heat up and be served.  I like grabbing a bite from slices when I'm about to go to a movie, or just looking to fill my stomach up for cheap while shopping at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Do not order the Italian sub, the meat is NASTY. The ham almost looked like spam and the pizza sauce was bland. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Place around the corner from my office. Walk in craving some wings. Have to watch carbs due to family susceptible to diabetes. Ordered my wings plain with blue cheese. Think they were ready in less than ten minutes. Spoke to the owner. Suggested next time to try some baked mesquite wings. Sound delicious. Super friendly. Having some phone issues so he apologized profusely. Great guy. Wings were good. Will take him up in the suggestion next time. I like places like this. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good quick lunch spot.  Multiple options to choose from so you are guaranteed to find something.

Slices are fairly large and I can get by with one slice but i splurge for two.   They average about 3.50 per slice which a little high but still tasty.

The place is quite small but gives off the kind of vibe you would find in an east coast pizza shop.

Check it out."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good but not warm. Turn up the heat on that oven and I'm sure it would be fabulous!"}
{"text":"Honestly, you're here to get pizza after a fun night where you've got the munchies. The pizza tastes amazing because you're starving. But really the pizza is just ok. There's nothing special. I give them props for dealing with the drunk hoards of people that stop by at night but otherwise just a regular pizza joint that's near a college. 
If you're craving and it's late, go here over the other place next door.
If you want pizza and it's not in the am, head down the street and you'll find some better pizza locales."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to AZ, I came to this Slices for the first time in YEARS after going to the bars on Mill for the first time in YEARS. When I was younger I made the usual late night drunken stops here, but my family even used to get carryout here (when we weren't drunk) because the pizza is pretty decent anyway you look at it. It's not the best out there, but decent enough. 

There's not really much to say about the place. It's small, there's always several varieties available by the slice, and it's cheap. The main reason I'm bumping this place from three to four stars is because, like I said, the pizza isn't that bad even when you're sober. It is better when you're drunk though..."}
{"text":"First off, am I mistaken that Slices was here when Tempe Marketplace first opened, then closed, and apparently re-opened? Or am I imaging things and it's always been there? Okay, moving on...

Slices has pretty solid pizza. there's a good variety to choose from by the slice. I like the cheese to sauce ratio, and I like the crust. It's thinner, but still dense which I like. 

This location is small (which is understandable), and I have to say, the staff isn't all that friendly. They have daily specials, and I was thinking of getting a calzone since they were $2 off on Tuesday, but when I asked what kind they have the guy behind the counter said to me \"you know they take 20 minutes to make\" in kind of an annoyed tone so I didn't bother. I just got a slice of pizza w/tomato  & ricotta, which was good. 

At the end of the day, this is a good option for a quick, cheap lunch if you're shopping at Tempe Marketplace. 

Also, if you check in on the yelp app, you get 10% off your order :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a slice recently and was reminded how much I enjoy this. I used to work closer to Tempe and frequented this location regularly. A slice or two always hit the spot. Now I work further away and rarely get back here. Another huge boost with me is they deliver to World of Beer, which I am frequently in attendance. It is just across the street, but that extra service is well worth it! They have a wide variety of pizzas, and all of them are good. This is a great fast, cheap option in Tempe."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all, their pizza is good. That being said, the quality of the pizza only matters if you can get it. On more than one occasion, we have called and the phone just rang and rang. Either that, or they would answer and hang up.

Slices uses good ingredients, tasty crust, and they have hands-down the best meat lovers pizza we've ever had. Not wanting to give up on the flavors we've known and loved,  we decided to place an online order. 45 minutes later, they up and canceled our order.

When you want pizza, you don't have 45 minutes to be strung around like that. If they hire more staff and improve their service, we'll try it again. Until then, poor business practices have lost Slices our business."}
{"text":"My First experience here was not the best. It was busy and I wanted to order a large pizza. I had the yelp coupon for 10% off and the girl did not know how to do 10%  off and looked to me for help and guidance. I didn't know what to tell her. So I ended up getting 15% off. When our pizza was ready no one brought it out to us like they had told me they would do because they were too busy. Good thing they have a great location or I'm not sure this place would make it!! Decent food but horrible customer service! They need to hire more than two people on the weekends!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  My husband and I love this place.  We went to the location in Tempe Marketplace on our very first date, but I kinda like this one better.  

The view is amazing from the shop.  Customer service is good and quick.  Pizza is mmm good.  Love it!

Place is small, but we manage to squeeze in."}
{"text":"I have been eating slices since college on mIll. I love there choices. You can pretty much find any kind of pizza you want. I love the big ol slices you get. The thin crust is crispy too. I hate when its flimsy or soggy. Not here. 

The price is pretty reasonable for 3.25 per slice. What you get is worth it."}
{"text":"Solid pizza! Great wings and even th3 salad was super fresh and we'll done. Nice work!  I'll order a again for sure. Great Dilworth pizza delivery"}
{"text":"A staple of Mill Ave. for years, Slices is the place to go when it's 2am, the bar has kicked you out, and you're still too drunk off of cheap well vodka to drive (or stumble) home just yet. Expect a crowd of like minded individuals, all of whom are hungry, and most of whom are at least a little beligerant. There's always potential for a couple dbags to get into a fight, so there may be some entertainment provided. Great for people watching, but unfortunately their pizza is pretty weak. Thin slices that sit out for way too long, only to be briefly reheated and served up slightly stale, usually very greasy. They do have some great toppings, their chicken has always proved pretty decent, and as a few other mentioned, they've got a good pesto option as well. All in all though, even when I am drunk here at 2am, I find the overall quality of the food to be sub-par. As for the service, well, if you had to deal with as many obnoxious, drunk college students as these guys did, you'd be in a hurry to rush as many assholes out the door as possible too."}
{"text":"You know, maybe I am a diva or I just expect too much.  But when I get the worst possible service known to anybody, I don't care how good your pizza tastes.
I go to Slices from time to time to get my pizza fix.  I always thought that they have great pizza and I love the different varieties that they have.  But I may never go back...ever...

So I am in line waiting to be served.  (And when I say waiting, I mean at least 5 minutes with one girl staring at me while she is putting together boxes. )  Finally this guy came up and asked me what I wanted and I said the Tomato Basil and then asked him what pizzas just came out of the oven.  He told me and I said that I would also like a piece of Pepperoni and Mushroom.  

I get to the counter and there is only the tomato basil waiting for me.  The girl (who loves her boxes) looked at me and I told her that I also ordered a Pepperoni and Mushroom.  She asked the guy and he said \"I don't remember anything\"  Ok, whatever.  So he gets a slice.  While I am waiting for that to warm, I told the girl that this was to go.  I am not kidding you she handed me a box and told me to put my pizza in the box.  (The two guys before got theirs boxed for them)  This place, especially the counter, is very small and I don't think it would hurt her to do some customer service and box my pizza.  

I am now irritated writing this review."}
{"text":"New owners, horrible service and pizza was disgusting, cheese wasn't melted , soggy , ordered the veggie pizza, definitely don't know what p."}
{"text":"It's hard not to like Slices. It's the perfect place to end a night on Mill (or to stop by in between bars for a quick bite). Is it be the best pizza on earth? No,but they don't try to be that. Slices is an unassuming pizza joint that gives you exactly what you want: decently good pizza when you're too drunk to leave Mill Ave. This pizza place gets an extra star for dealing with the throngs of drunken fools that bum rush this place after 2am on the weekends."}
{"text":"I didn't like it. The pizza wasn't very good and was bland. Typical cooked pizza sitting around with stale crust waiting to get re-heated.  By the time I purchased four slices and drinks, I should have taken the family to a sit-down restaurant. The staff wasn't helpful or friendly. It seemed they wanted me to hurry up so they could get back to standing around with frowns on their faces."}
{"text":"I just noticed today that this new pizza joint opened the neighborhood, and it happened to be a night when we didn't feel like cooking, so what the heck? Let's give it a shot, despite a couple negative Yelp reviews. We got the large pizza, 12 wings, and a 2 liter soda deal for $19.99 - not a bad deal at all, especially with free delivery!

I wouldn't necessarily call the pizza NYC style, but it was still delicious. For NYC pizzas, I have my favorite places in Charlotte as the go-to, and those will remain my favorites for. NYC style after eating here. But what Slices does offer is a great pizza with fresh ingredients and a unique taste to the sauce that I can't quite put my hands on, but loved it. Strangely enough, kind of like the same way that I loved Donato's when it was in the same location - something different, but in a good way. It's not NYC by my definition, but it is delicious!

The wings were really fantastic, especially from a place that specializes in pizza. Huge wings with a ton of meat - crispy and not slimy like most pizza places' wings are. And the hot buffalo sauce was just right - not too crazy hot, but still a decent kick for those who like spice. If you are used to getting crappy wings with your pizza from a place that should probably just stick to making pizza (like any of the major chains), then you need to check out the wings at Slices. Definitely credible.

From the pics online, the subs look pretty awesome, too...looking forward to trying one soon!"}
{"text":"Ok I typically make it a habit to not criticizing others reviews but I can't help myself here. 

There are a few reviews who state it is expensive.. I don't consider $3 for a one topping slice pricey.. What cheapo world are these people living in?
There are a few reviews who bash the ambiance. What are you looking for? It is an order at the counter pizza joint.
And finally the reviews who complain the guy is rude.. He is from Boston and takes your order, he probably takes over 100 counter orders in an hour.. What do you want a hug? 

I've been frequenting this place for over 10 years and I say 4 stars for what it is - Individual slices with tons of variety, great for when you're in a lunch rush or ending a booze fest."}
{"text":"The employees were unintelligent. Pizza was originally served cold and overpriced. The crust seemed like it came from a frozen package. Overall pizza was alright, but this place isn't great"}
{"text":"Really big slices of pizza. That's all that can describe this place. 

Actually, I have eaten at this place for years and I have tried various types of pizza. So far, no matter how strange the toppings, I have enjoyed them. Slices is my go to on Mill everytime I am there. 

So, as you can tell from the name, this place sells slices of pizza. You can get whole pizzas or calzones as well, but the main thing is slices of pizza. 

This is a really good place to get a quick bite. Everyday, they have different kinds of pizza. Of course, they have the classics like cheese and pepperoni everyday. But I would encourage noobs and vets to try different toppings. For example, I tried teriyaki chicken pizza and chicken Caesar salad pizza. Both were decent. 

When you go in, you will be treated by the chill employees. Just tell them what slice(s) you want. Then they will get you what you want, throw it in the oven or maximum deliciousness then serve it to you. 

I go here often and would probably never stop. One of the best places in Tempe really."}
{"text":"Nothing overly spectacular to see here. Folks from New York seem to really like this place, I'm from Chicago so I'm partial to deep dish but these guys do flat pizza pretty well I must admit. Many different unique flavors, including some with pesto, potatoes, and mint among many other ingredients--check out the menu, pretty creative stuff.

Rodd and Stephen are the owners (I think) and I've heard that they live right on top of the restaurant so that they never lose sight of their focus and industry. That's pretty cool in my book, but I'd hate to smell like New York pizza all day..."}
{"text":"I am not in the area that much and generally dont like to order a giant pizza so when I get a chance this is where I go to fill my pizza craving without overdoing it.

The staff is always nice and quick.

Their pizza is not greasy, great sizes and always fresh.
They also always have at least 1 sometimes 2-3 vegetarian options which is great. 

To the guy below complaining about a kid behind the counter not as quick as he would want... Perhaps he was new? Like you have been perfect at everything you have done. Get a grip and lay off. He is working so I wouldn't exactly call him lazy."}
{"text":"After Grubhub proceeded to mess up my order and then cancel it, after waiting 2 1/2 hours for my food that had been ready 2 hours ago, the owner was nice enough to cook the food fresh himself and drive it to my apartment at 11 pm at night. Such a wonderful man. I am so appreciative of him. Will definitely be ordering from him again, but will use their own delivery service again."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!  This place is great for a quick takeout for lunch.  I always get the meat lovers pizza here and it's always great."}
{"text":"Slices is a great place if you're in a pinch and want a quick lunch at a decent price. I wish they had more of a vegetarian selection but other than that it's a fine place for Pizza on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"This place is such a guilty pleasure. The pizza is good but it's like a certain craving for a certain type of pizza. You know? Like being drunk on Mill Ave and suddenly realizing \"OH MY GOD! I'm SOOOO hungry! I need Slices!\" Ha...I mean, I'm assuming that SOME people feel that way. I've NEVER been that person myself. ;-)

But seriously, I don't think they ever close so pizza whenever you want! Major plus. They have tons to choose from (last time I was there they had baked potato...um YUM!) and it's cheap and quick. What more could you want? No, it's not fancy, yes the pizza is greasy but does it hit the spot? You bet it does!"}
{"text":"I almost wept when I saw they had opened a Slices at this end of town.   I don't know what makes this pizza so wonderful, but it's delicious.  Try the veggie or white pizza... I hear the potato bacon is good too.

The downside:
The place is usually wicked hot inside.  I dunno if they are trying to save a couple bucks and not run the A/C but those ovens make it warm!  Just grab your slices and go sit outside in the foodcourt area instead."}
{"text":"Slices is good late night pre or post bar pizza.  Pizzas a pre-cooked and on display for your choosing.  Pick a slice or two and they toss them in the oven for a few minutes and serve them up fairly warm.  If you want it hot hot tell them and they'll do it.  While this isn't the best pizza in the world, it certainly is appreciated after a night of boozin.  If you're looking for a gourmet pie try another spot."}
{"text":"Really think this is the best pizza in the area...beats all the others such as barros, rosatis, and the dominos..pizza hut, etc. Bummed out that I never see any discounts...but so good."}
{"text":"Great pizza Awesome wings!!! Yes it is a hit or miss when they are open but since Ohio State  Football season is over they should be open more!  GO Bucks!!"}
{"text":"Really great find.  Everything is super fresh.  NY style pizza.  Try the Chicken Spinach Alfredo pizza.  The stromboli was excellent as well.  Seating is limited, but the owner has plans to expand soon.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I was in Tempe, AZ during 2008 and was having a great time on Mill Ave.  I was getting so hungry and I've seen some people eating some HUGE pizza slices.  So, I stopped one of these hungry people and asked where they got the slices.  They told me where to go.

Funny is that when I was walking there and was almost there, there was some drunk girl lying her face on a table.  All of a sudden, she just fell and the table came crashing down and everyone was like... OH SH*T!  I held my laughter and went into Slices.

Mmmmmmmmm!  OH MY!  So awesome looking pizzas!  I got 2 pepperoni slices and waited for my cab.  I finished those 2 slices within 2 mins.  I had them stacked on eachother and folded them, just like how John Travolta ate his in Saturday Night Fever.

JUST SO GOOD!

I gave this review 4/5 stars since the pizza was darn good, but not the best, and the service was very speedy.  I'm DEFINITELY coming back again when I'm doin my Mill Ave rounds =D"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, the service was alright!!!

Slices has some really good pizza but they're correct when they call it Slices, cause you might not want to order a whole pizza, cause you might end up waiting way too long! 

In general, this place is a good place to get a bite to eat whenever you're craving a slice of pizza. Definitely great to get after coming from a bar or something from mill avenue.  The thin crust is best to eat right away, if you have leftovers, you'll have to heat it up again for it to be tasty. 

I've had good and bad customer service at this place. If you're there only for a slice, it's definitely a lot easier to be helped. But when I came to order a whole pizza for pick up, they told me to give them 20 minutes. I came 25 minutes later, and they still said, give me 15 more minutes. Kinda bad service when I already planned ahead for a bigger order. 

But overall, other than Grimaldi's, this place has good pizza. 

Tips:
Get the potato pizza, it's the best type! 
The bbq chicken and buffalo chicken were awesome. 

The pineapple \"Hawaiian\" pizza sucked. The ham is deli ham and not that flavorful, also the pineapples were too thick of cuts. 

If you order a whole pizza, you can order half and half! You can get a lot more options. 

Students get a discount."}
{"text":"This place is great when you don't have time to waste refueling before/during/after having a night on the town. The slices are large enough to be satisfying while not putting you in a food coma. They're also delicious--they know how to do specialties like BBQ Chicken quite well. 

You can get in and out in five minutes, including face-stuffing time. If I'm on mill and anyone complains about being hungry, I'm rushing them through here."}
{"text":"Love the pizza variety
Inside is small and pretty filthy.
fair prices.
usually someone asks for money while I'm there.
the other locations are much nicer."}
{"text":"Good, quick, cheap.  Marked down only because of the permanent hackey sack pack in front."}
{"text":"No better slice of cheese pizza in town. But only go for the cheese--the rest is just pizza. 

Eat it right out of the oven with a sprinkle of salt, another of garlic powder and an accompanying Jones soda."}
{"text":"Completely inappropriate staff. Cussing up a storm at the basketball game on tv and had no respect for paying customers eating in the small area. Would not recommend bringing your family.... it was a very uncomfortable situation. Never going back."}
{"text":"Wow it's so sad to see how far downhill Slices has gone. This used to be such a great place. Lately it's dirty, the help is rude and the pies all look like they've been made days ago. It's a shame because it was so good in the past and is in such a convenient location in Desert Ridge. I hope they get their act together and return to their former standards."}
{"text":"Okay, the pizza itself was good, not anything spectacular, but decent.  However I doubt we'd be coming back to this place.  How does this place pass it's health inspection?  The ceiling tiles are all rotted, the air conditioner is loud and coated in grease/dust, and behind the counter, the floors are black, everything looks filthy.  

But I guess that's what you get, it's cheap, it's fast, it's pizza."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing. My friend and I both got the \"buffalo chicken\" pizza which was just a piece of cheese pizza with no sauce and pieces of chicken that didnt taste at all like buffalo sauce. We ate about half and threw the rest out, not a good lunch at ALL. Would definitely not reccomend."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The price per slice isnt bad at all, and they probably have 40 different pizza concoctions to select from.  It gets an A+ from me!"}
{"text":"Slices poops all over other mall pizza places like Sbarro.  Excellent selection, probably upwards of 20 pizza options.  

Oh, and who eats plain old boring cheese pizza?"}
{"text":"Such an underrated pizza place on mill! Talk about the perfect slice of cheese pizza.. Used to eat at this place every week freshman year, I've moved onto Spinellis but now that I'm writing this review all the memories are flowing back. We shall meet again Slices."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a good slice of pizza.  Situated right across the Cine-Capri at Tempe Marketplace, this joint has some great varieties of pizza.  Good old pepperoni for me, but it was very good.  And they had Cherry Pepsi which is always worth an extra star.  Cleanliness is a bit to be desired since a lot of people go in and out and it appears to be understaffed.  I will be back again as it's good food and the prices are just right."}
{"text":"With all of the pizza choices in the area, I can't understand why someone would choose Slices.

They serve a huge variety of different pizzas, but they are all sitting out cold, so every time you order a slice, you are getting what amounts to pizza leftovers.  You know, the pizza that is still in your fridge from the night before?  Good, but not as good as when it was fresh.

I don't get the crust.  It is similar to the crust used at Peter Piper Pizza from childhood.  Tasteless and gritty from the corn meal, and dry from sitting out in the open air.

I know there are a lot of differing opinions regarding pizza crust, but if you are in the camp that actually eats the crust, this is not the place for you.

For what you get, it seems a little over priced.  You can also order a whole pie fresh, but it seems a tad expensive for the quality.  I'd rather drive 2 miles to Southern and Mill for Venezia's Pizza.  Hell, take the bus to Venezias.  The 66 goes straight there from Slices."}
{"text":"Hours say they are open until 11pm, but we went in at 10:30 and they only had two types of pizza available. The employees were apathetic, and didn't even consider trying to make another type pizza for the multiple patrons looking for a slice. There were 5 people ahead of us, and they all wanted something different than what was there. Worst customer service I have ever received."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ chicken pizza, highly recommend Slices.  Great locally owed business."}
{"text":"I had a feeling it wouldn't be good, it was actually great and I wanted another slice but decided against spending $4 on another slice. Next time I will just order a pie instead of single slices because your going to end up paying basically $10 for a couple of slices and drink which is pretty darn close to the cost of a pie. None the less, like I said the pizza was exceptionally great."}
{"text":"I ordered Slices from DoorDash since they were offering free delivery. My usual go-to is Hawthornes but I was feeling brave and decided to try something new. The small specialty pizzas are 14 inches(!) and only $10 which is an awesome deal. The white pizza wasn't quite as good as Hawthornes but it was close enough to be ordered again. My boyfriend enjoyed the cheeseburger pizza and the fried pickles were pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"We were desperate to find a place to eat at 10:30 at night...  

Location - Off Mills Avenue near all the bars.
Price - A bit pricey for being in college town.
Clientele - Mainly college kids, young.
Service - Shitty and rude.  
Decor - Three or four bar tables and seating against the wall. One tv on ESPN.  Menu on chalkboard and tons of pizza that were already baked and ready to serve.
Food - Awful.  Thin slices weren't crispy, thick crust was on foccacia bread.  Cheese didn't string out. Decent amount of toppings on each slice. Pizza just sat in my stomach although I generally eat this late and don't have this problem."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the pizza was great! I've only ordered slices, not a whole pie. The meat lovers was better than most places I've been. Very affordable and the pretty quick too. I also tried the cinnamon and sugar dough pieces. Nice value! This place is carry out only."}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly dirty!  It is run down and filthy.  It wasn't bad when it first opened, but it is obviously run by someone who either doesn't give a shit, or is a dirty person themselves and doesn't have any experience.  If it is a corporate store, they should just sell the company to someone who knows what they are doing.  If it is a franchisee, the store should be taken back by corporate.  The guys working there didn't wash their hands after coming back in from smoking outside either.  They just stepped right back in behind the counter and started serving pizza.  Ridiculous!!!  We won't ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Moved here from long island, NY about a month ago an have tried maaaany pizza places, as I consider myself a true pizzahead.  Slices has blown away the other places in the area that I have tried.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Has this for dinner last night and I was pretty pleased with my meal. 
I had the vegetable slice, and as far as taste goes it was pretty awesome, especially for a 3$ large slice of pizza. Was definitely impressed especially since they were reheating each slice. 
The service was quick and was sure to ask questions regarding drinks and other items. 
The value was pretty spot on, however I was disappointed I couldn't use my college ID to get the discount for the two pizza slices and a drink special. I wish it would just be for all college students. 
All in all it is a pretty cheap place to get an above average slice of pizza with friendly service and a nice atmosphere to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is crowded, but best after midnight and a lot of beers on Mill. Get adventurous and try different types, they have quite a few types.

You a dude? Get 2 slices! Trust me on this. Their food isn't bad, it's average pizza. For the walks home after the bars close, this pizza in 12 stars of delicious pizza heaven."}
{"text":"This traditional pizza by the slice joint is just that. Good classic pizza and salads. Service is quick and prices are reasonable. The floor plan is a tad small. Its good for a quick lunch but I would not recommend to bring the entire crew. Perfect if you are just passing by or just want a quick bite."}
{"text":"I am not a huge slices fan, but let me start by saying I know a lot of people who are. I've gone in for a slice at lunch and each time find that the pizza is a bit cold and has been sitting there for a while - doesn't look that great. The location is crowded and waiting in line is uncomfortable. Also, not that they can control this, but I want to gag walking to and from because I have to pass by Hippie Gypsy and that nasty incense smell makes me loose my appetite. Let me conclude by saying the pizza is not all that bad though."}
{"text":"As a transplant from New York, I can tell you this pizza does not fill the void. The pizza is blandish but after the bars let out it seems to get the job done for me and my friends so it is definitely bearable! It is an unfair advantage to compare it to back home but I have had a lot worse pizza out here that is for sure so I would not count this one out. I will how ever rely on spinados for my sober pizza cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously so delicious. The pizza is pre-cooked and left out so you can pick whatever you want, then reheated. Sounds gross, but don't underestimate it. Super crunchy, thin crust heaven. 
The service here isn't all that great, but the food is good enough to compensate."}
{"text":"I work down the street from Desert Ridge so I end up eating there a lot.  Slices is the cheapest and tastiest place over there.  I've only tried the margherita pizza and the pepperoni, but they were both delish."}
{"text":"This place used to suck, but it looks like they got some new staff members who are a little bit more friendly. Old employees used to be very vulgar and rude, but there's two girls who work here now that actually engage in conversation with the customers, they just seem kinda shy. The food quality has improved too, every time I've come here there's been new additions to the menu and everything tastes really good."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!

This place could not be worse. 

First off, it is Never open, ever! They have the most bizarre hours. 

But then on this magical Friday (after months of trying) they were actually open for dinner hours. Hooray!!! And once they were finally open they refused to Honor the Groupon that I had been attempting to use for Months!!! I wouldn't have bothered trying to follow up with these purveyors of shit on a plate if i hadn't already paid for a Groupon. Thanks for wasting my time And money!

Now.... let's get to the food... IT SUCKED!!!!  

The\"salad\" - I think they get the left over rooty iceberg butts from Food Lion's prepared salads and then ineffectively try to pass it off as something edible. Horribleness!

The wings - so over cooked. Inedible husks. Kinda like cracklings with bones... and then dipped it in a combo of pig feces and Frank's red hot.

The \"Neopolitan\" pizza. Soggy, greasy, crap. If I had just crawled out of a Nazi death camp I would consider eating it. Otherwise, Hell No!!! My toilet paper after a greasy Thai curry shit likely has a better texture. 

I'd much rather order from Dominos across the street. And I hate Dominos. 

F this place. F the management. F the food.

Postscript: 
I'm writing this while seated upon my throne. I have been here for some time as my intestines continue to cramp and erupt. I have been here so long that my legs have fallen asleep. While I enjoy slinging a little mud every now and then, I am not currently enjoying these liquified anal eruptions. Not one bit! Thanks for the poopy experience Slices! Maybe I'll bag some of my Slices induced excrement and leave it on your doorstep so that you can experience it as well! 

Have a nice day!"}

{"text":"I went here last night with the BF cuz it was 10 pm and we hadn't eaten anything yet. The pizza is not flavorful, it's greasy and it wasn't heated up enough. If I wanted reheated flavorless pizza, I can make a frozen one at home and it would be much less expensive. Plus the place feels grungy and dirty. I used to like this place 5 years ago.... but sorry slices, not my thing anymore."}
{"text":"Slices pizza is decent at best. Not all pizzas are created equal. However, not all pizzas are offered till 3am. That being said, slices is a great option for late night snacking. If you have 5 bucks, slices might just be the cure to your late night hunger."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from this location. The first time the pizza was good, maybe 4 out of 5, but the second time it was undercooked and the fresh mozzarella barely melted. Would not order from again."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza I've ever had in my entire life, I could eat a Large order by myself if I wanted to and then some.
I always stop by here after I'm done shopping or before a movie. A delicious quick fix when I'm hungry, and they have quite variety of pizza! I think I've tried 'em all!  

The female servers there don't seem to happy to be serving but the awesome pizza make up for their 'meh' attitude. :)"}
{"text":"As far as going somewhere for just a slice of pizza, this place is okay.  Not great though.  I don't care for all the little crumbs/dots/seasoning/whatever it is on the bottom of the crust.  I have to constantly brush it off.

The price isn't bad for a huge slice of pizza.  The wait isn't too long either.  However, it is always SO HOT inside there.  I won't even sit in there to eat because it makes me feel sick!  I'd rather sit outside in the heat at least with misters and a breeze sometimes than sit in that place.  It's like an oven!"}
{"text":"Rating a 4 because it's just such a great slice of pizza. Inexpensive and delicious. 

That man in my previous post was at it again, but seemed to be firing people(yes people, more than one, I think he threatened 2 people while I was inside). I'm not sure what the issue is, but the fountains directly outside are great to enjoy your pizza at. 

Go to slices to get pizza, it's too good to resist(I like the cheese and meatball, and sometimes when I'm feeling spunky I like the pepperoni bacon with ranch) YUM!

My pizza gets better every time I go"}
{"text":"It's hard being a NYer and trying to find decent pizza up in here.  
Had a date tonight.  He's fairly new to the area and lives in *gasp* Gilbert.  So, we picked something in the middle.  I suggested Mill Ave, because at least we could mock people as we wandered around.
It was chaos.  Did all the douchebags leave Scottsdale for the night?  The answer is...YES.
So, we wanted something to eat and both agreed on pizza.  This was street food, as we wanted to walk around some more.  Saw the slices that people were eating and we both said \"Now THAT'S a NY pizza slice!
Cheap, fast and fun service.  The place was packed because of some football game going on.  Whatever.
All I know, is that you're supposed to have a slice of pizza that you have to fold in half to eat so the grease drips down your elbow.  Slices came through."}
{"text":"Exactly what Kristopher V. said. If you are drunk, get pizza here. If you are in a hurry, get pizza here. If you want good pizza but don't want to spend too much money, get pizza here.

I was always a fan of how inexpensive and fast they are, and honestly if you are really just jonesing for that easy slice, then this is a good spot. I actually think their pizza is quite taste for being fast food. The crust isn't very thick (which I enjoy), and there isn't an overload of sauce or cheese. They warm it up for you and have it ready shortly. 

Side note: there will likely NOT be a place for you to sit inside, as there are very very few tables."}
{"text":"I originally loved Slices when they were a newer brand, but I feel like they haven't done a great job of keeping up in the market.

Their employees are never friendly, the pizza is inconsistent, but if you do get a good one heated to the proper temperature, you're going to love it.

I wish it was like it used to be when it was always the same high quality pizza rather than feeling like a greasy quick pizza joint like it does now."}
{"text":"As a poor college student who loves pizza, Slices is a good place to go!  Most of the time, they run the ASU student special [two slices and a drink for $6] which is great for those of us who have dire needs like books, school supplies, or want to shop at American Eagle Outfitters.  XD

They have a good selection of pizza [chicken pesto = fave!] and their calzones are delicious.  Sure, the place is a little dirty and seating is extremely limited.  Regardless, I love this place!  If only they had bigger plates..."}
{"text":"Relatively fast sliceof pizza if you're in a rush, but if you're at Desert Ridge you probably have enough time to sit down for a custom made pizza at California Pizza Kitchen, BJ's, Yardhouse, Rock Bottom, or one of the several other places here that make better pizza.

There's virtually no seating inside and this place is a disaster on Friday/Saturday nights.  You better hope the person in front of you doesn't take that last slice of the pizza you want in the window."}
{"text":"Only been to this joint once while I was in Tempe. I got the chicken caesar slice and a philly cheese steak slice. Chicken caesar sent my taste buds to the moon, but the philly cheese steak was a big miss. Needless to say they have about 30 different types pizza slices for about 3 bucks a piece. Fresh rotations daily as well. If you are walking Mill ave and want a quick bite to eat or a tasty late night snack, don't hesitate to venture into this casual looking joint. Keep Eating, Cheers!"}
{"text":"Was up in the area and despite friends telling me not to bother with this place, I decided to give it a try. I really wish I would've listened to them and will not be going back. The employees weren't really friendly, barely spoke any English and when I asked for the slice to go, it was almost an inconvenience for them to do so. They heated up the slice for a few seconds in the oven and it was maybe room temperature when I ate it a couple minutes later. The sauce was really bland and didn't have any flavor at all. I've never had such a bland slice of pizza and the price for what you get is ridiculous. I'm not sure what to rate lower, the pizza or the service."}
{"text":"this place is fine. If you need some quick pizza before you catch a movie, it will do. If you're looking for a great place to grab a slice of NY Style pizza, it's alotta hype. service is good, pizza is mediocre. The crust is usually hard and slightly dried. If I hadn't had pizza for a week, it'll do."}
{"text":"GROSS!!!! Not only did I have a giant pubic hair on my pizza....Also, they only have high chair stool seats to sit on while eating...DISGUSTING amount of visible chewed gum stuck under the table. Pizza has gone down hill since switching owners. Bathroom was GROSS and graffitied. Can't imagine how dirty the kitchen is......my pictures don't lie!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! If you like thin crust this is the place to stop. I haven't had pizza like this in years.  Loved it.  Ate outside. It was a nice little place to take a break and grab a bite to eat.  Pizza is sold by the slice.  Slices are very large but also very thin crust."}
{"text":"We love this place! This place is not a place one would go to for a dining experience, it's a place you eat a slice of pizza for lunch or take it home. We are a family of 5 so we usually order pizza to go. I would say best pizza in town."}
{"text":"You really can never go wrong with this place.  With the plethora of options for pizza slices, there's always a slice one desires!  And throwing it in their oven for a few minutes makes it perfect.  You also get free refills from their cool Coke machine."}
