{"text":"For an Indian who craves good Indian food, it is not always easy to find in Pittsburgh. The Mintt is probably my favorite place to get Indian food in Pittsbugh, second only to Udupi in Monroeville.

I've eaten here three times- once a proper off the menu dinner, and twice at the weekend buffet lunch.

Pros: The food is excellent. If you want to try something other than the standard vegetable-in-cream-sauce type food, Mintt is your place. The chef is from Hyderabad, I believe, and he brings that flair to some of the more unusual dishes they serve.

For our sit down dinner, we had the whole eggplants in the sesame sauce, and they were a revelation. Indo-chinese vegetable manchurian is a specialty of mine, and I can safely say that Mintt's is finger-licking good.

Off the buffets, we really enjoyed the paav bhaji- spicy curried mashed potatoes with buttered, toasted bread, a street side snack which is not a common find. Same goes for the tava vegetables this time- very nicely done. The desserts are good and not watered down.

Cons: It's your standard ethnic restaurant, in that service can be spotty, and the buffet table may not be properly stocked with the right kind of dishes. The chai, while excellent in flavor, has been lukewarm both times. 

For the sake of the food, though, I would gladly overlook these little hiccups and return to Mintt each time."}
{"text":"Good butter paneer. Malai kofta used to be good but was markedly different (in a bad way) last time we ordered it. I like it better than Namaste and Tamarind."}
{"text":"Very small portions for the price. Mediocre curries -- the chicken tikka masala and malai kofta were pretty disappointing. Gave +1 star bc the staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food in Pitts if you want to eat chicken and meat. Biriyani is better than most of the restaurants in USA. I will go there any day."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food.  Samosas are to die for.  Service acceptable and friendly.  Chicken vindaloo a big hit.  I was too full for dessert, but the had a lot of cakes on display.  Tough getting turned around on Banksville Road.  You will need to u-turn to head south."}
{"text":"Taste of the food is getting wost day by day. I went to buffet this Saturday and i see some flies in buffet area, I informed management and their response in too bad. Please avoid MINTT. Try something else."}
{"text":"After my initial review I decided to give this place another try and have been to mintt multiple times after that. The food is very good and the management and staff were very good . the buffet is large and the food is very tasty with the right amount of spice. Will definetly go again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have gone to, and the best in Pittsburgh in .  
The service is great, the staff is accommodating.   food was good"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners and they explained the menu well to my husband and myself. I have never tried Indian food but I am a fan now and thanks to the owners for explaining the menu so detailed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the best I have had in Pittsburgh so far. We got their Chicken 65 and Paneer Chili for appetizers, which were very very well prepared. For entree we got their Lamb Kadai,Butter Chicken, Palak Paneer and Channa Masala. I am usually not a fan of lamb at all, but I really enjoyed theirs. We got spice level 5 for everything. Some dishes were spicer than others, but all within reason, with a good kick to them. The staff is very friendly as well. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Service, Quality of food and cleanliness of the restaurant, my reasons for giving 5 stars. Feedback based on weekend lunch buffet($10.99) & food take out. 

Most Indian food joints don't give importance to the service, this place had multiple folks taking time to ensure best service was provided. There were 4 people assisting patrons, during my course of lunch I was greeted by each one of them atleast once. 

Food, where do I begin. South Indian Snacks: Masala Dosa, Vada, Idli, sambar, chutney - 3 kinds & Papdi chat. All hot and tasty. Appetizer: Tandoori chicken. 
Chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, 2 vegetables. Chicken biryani was the best, they had a variation of it which I haven't eaten before. Very well done & presented colorfully. 

Dessert: orange mouse, payasam (dal & saboodana)
Ended the course with a cup of hot tea. 

Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The staff was courteous;but highly inefficient. Clear lack of communication resulted in our food getting delayed. Even the food quality was not very good. Malai kofta was like rubber and paneer was too creamy and drenched in artificial color. Disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate at The Mintt for my mom's birthday. We had the sezchuan (sp?) chicken, which was very spicy but delicious; the mango chicken, which was great without being fruity; the chicken fried rice which was much better than your typical Chinese restaurant fried rice; and I had the Tandoori chicken, which was not what I expected, having never eaten it before, but delicious none the less. 

The service was fantastic. The waitstaff worked as a team to keep all patrons happy in the relatively busy restaurant (Saturday night, between 7:30 and 9). Our water glasses were always full and the waiter was fantastic, asking us about our preferred heat levels and explaining everything that we had questions about. He suggested types of bread and brought us a large sample of a delicious coconut-sweet bread. He also brought two different types of cake over when he heard it was my mom's birthday! The bill was under $60 before tip which I think is great for 4 people. I was prepared to pay much more for the quality of food and the great service. The four of us agreed we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had ordered take away from this resturant.
I was charged 1.49 $ for extra rice and the little box in which they packed rice was half filled .

Felt like I was cheated... never ordered any thing here since then."}
{"text":"The food here has always been really good. It's a shame that I probably won't be eating it again.

We like to get our Indian food as takeout. (I definitely prefer stuffing myself silly with mutter paneer and naan in the privacy of my own home while wearing sweatpants.) We have now ordered takeout from here 4-5 times and not once have we received the correct food. There are always at least two incorrect entrees and the food is always packaged in a way that the containers burst all over the bag before we can get them home. I mean, I like trying new things, but I like to decide on my own accord when I'm going to try them.

Tamarind doesn't make their stuff as spicy as I like the way that Mintt does, but when I order from there, I don't have to cross my fingers that I'll like the mystery entrees that wind up in the bag. So, I guess back to Tamarind we go!"}
{"text":"For a city with a sizable Indian population, Pittsburgh's Indian restaurant scene can be pretty hit or miss.  After reading a very good review of Mintt in the City Paper, I decided to give it a go.  After missing it on the first pass (look for the red awning of a Verizon store), Belle and I settled in to what seems to be a converted garage--keep that in mind for winter months if you have thin skin.  It's still a new place and the decor is pretty minimal.  Being a converted space, the place has a slight cavernous feel to if there aren't too many other diners there, but that changes considerably once the place fills up, but not a romantic first date kind of place.

The menu itself is pretty extensive, which is both a blessing and a curse.  I'm always a little suspect of places that have massive menus since I generally don't trust that the cook has THAT many knock out recipes in his/her repertoire.  Still, the menu was a good mix of expected dishes and relatively obscure ones.  We started out with Chicken 55, a fried chicken appetizer that's a take on street food.  Very good--the chicken was moist without being greasy and nicely spiced.  I ordered biryani and Belle ordered lamb curry.  She said \"6\" when asked how spicy she wanted her curry.  My biryani was fantastic--fragrant, flavorful, whatever you may be looking for in a biryani was in it.  The curry was pretty bland.  Others have commented on how spicy food at Mintt is, so I'm wondering if you actually have to say you want it spicy to get it spicy--otherwise you get the \"adjusted for the Pittsburgh palate\" level of spice.

Still, an excellent meal.  Service was good, although I noticed that once the place filled up, the newer tables experienced slight delays (although nothing I would consider egregious)."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place. The service is so charming and consistently pleasant and efficient. I LOVE the buffet. They will custom cook dosas for you. The good is perfectly spiced and the selection is very good. Great cheap eats too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Had a variety of north, south Indian, and Hakka Chinese( Indian Chinese - Gobi Manchurian...) food.  Very tasty.  Loved the service."}
{"text":"Absolute disappointment.  

My wife and I are avid Indian Food Fans and when we found out that there was an Indian restaurant near our new house we got excited!  We've missed Karma and Kabobeesh in Philly so much we were dying for some decent Indian.

We ordered 1 Chicken Tikka Masala (Indian hot), 1 Goat Kurma (Normal), 1 Rosemary Naan, 1 Garlic Naan, and 1 order of Samosa.

The Good:  The Samosa's and the Naan was good.

The Bad:
Goat Kurma:  Was mostly bone.  There was very little goat meat on those bones.  No heat or flavoring to the Goat, It tasted exactly like Patak's Spicy Sensations Fragrant Korma.  Which we have at home. 

Chicken Tikka Masala:  Used the same sauce as the Goat Kurma.  There was no heat at all.  Very little chicken.

Cost:  Expensive considering the lack of quality and quantity.  


Take away,  Save yourself the time and money and make it yourself,  They are using canned sauces and charging a lot of money for small portions.  There is an Indian Supermarket the next block over so you can get all the ingredients there, along with the same sauces and do it yourself.  I'm sure there is better Indian Restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I usually love this place - my boyfriend and. Get takeout from there all the time. Tonight we ordered our usual meals (allo gobi masala and chicken tikka masala) - which are usually mild in spice - and they were through the roof spicy. I usually can handle a lot of spice, but even for me, this was too much. My boyfriend who doesn't prefer spice couldn't even eat his meal. I don't think we will be ordering again anytime soon. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that the samosas were good as usual."}
{"text":"After visiting a majority of the Indian places in Pittsburgh over the years I can easily say this is one of my new favorites. On occasion the heat is a bit too spicy, but I will forgive them that in lieu of some of the best Biryanis, Masalas, etc. Out of 3 visits I haven't had one bad experience otherwise."}
{"text":"There was no food left during buffet and extremely rude and unorganized staff. Waste of money and time"}
{"text":"Miserable take away service! 1.5 hour wait time and eventually been given a completely wrong order! Not a resident of pittsburgh so it was just my first visit to this restaurant. Least the staff could be polite in the wait time!"}
{"text":"I have had great food from here.  Their tamarind chutney needs improvement. Needs to be strained out so it's not straight seasoning/herb. 
Speaking of seasoning and herb. The chicken tikka masala must have been seasoned with an open fist of cumin. How am I supposed to eat this. My order just came so please feel free to check the time and tell the chef a pinch is more than enough. 

It's been more than a couple times. I'll likely be trying other Indian restaurants unless they m eating at the restaurant. You guys have put out decent food.  Just not often enough specifically when I feel like you guys just take the butter chicken off your buffet line and add seasoning."}
{"text":"Mintt is the best of my choice among other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Vegetable Manchurian and Biryani i like most here."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I was surprised to see such mixed reviews as I had a great experience. My husband and I stopped in on a whim for a late dinner. For it being so late (8:30 pm), the place had a decent crowd and many came in for take out too. The space was bigger than I thought and looked like it used to be a garage or something. It's not heavily decorated but that's not what we were there for. 

We had a very friendly server. I'm not well-versed in Indian cuisine so I asked him what his favorite vegetarian dish was and he immediately pointed to the Vegetable Jalfrezi and that's what I got (with mild spice). The hubby got Fish Tikka Masala with plain naan. Oh my word. The best Indian food I've had in my life! Seriously. The Vegetable Jalfrezi smelled sweet of spices and although it was rather spicy, it was so tasty atop the rice. The veggies were perfectly cooked in a sweet, earthy and spicy sauce. Oh, and let me tell you about the rice. The basmati rice was so moist and piping hot when it came out to us. Usually at other places I've tried, the rice has been rather dry. Not here! The tikka masala was really creamy and it reminded me of a bisque soup. It made for a wonderful dip with the naan. Salmon was used as the fish and it wasn't all too fishy and surprisingly went well with the creamy tikka masala sauce. 

Because the food was so darn delicious, I will definitely be back to try more dishes here (and hopefully become more versed in Indian cuisine)!"}
{"text":"Finally I found a Good and authentic Southern Indian Cuisine in Pittsburgh ( after Udpi ) for non vegetarian food. I have tried TAMARIND at Cranberry ( 2/10) and Greentree ( 3/10) . The food is never consistent and tasted awful. But at MINT .. Food was fresh and delicious and service was great . The owner took good care of us and were very helpful in explaining the curries which were new to me. Taj Mahal owner lady is also very helpful . I miss this service at Tamarind and India Garden as the waiters are only good to take orders and bring food to table. The owners at Indian Garden and Tamarind don't even talk to American Customers . Mint is a bit far for me , but for good food, wont mind travelling . I tried Pickle chicken and Cauliflower ( Indo Chinese appetizer ) . My wife as always ordered Chicken Tikki Masala and she said its THE BEST in Pittsburgh with fresh cream and Tomato sauce and spices. The chicken was well marinated in spices and could feel the spice in every bite. Tamarind and Indian Garden just bake the chicken in oven with no spice .. feel like eating boiled and tasteless chicken.  we need another Mint in Cranberry area as Tamarind is only there to fill Tummy with no taste ."}
{"text":"Great find in the middle of nowhere Banksville Road.  I'd just about given up on Indian food in the Burgh (except for Taj Majal up on McKnight Road... but who is going to drive there on a regular basis?) and my friend pulled me back in.  This place has all three of my trinity of cream based chickeny goodness favorites - Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, and Butter Chicken.  In a pinch, I always get one of these three.  This time, I got the Chicken Korma and the Lamb Saag.  

Both were delicious, and spice-y in a way that I hadn't had before (i.e., not spicy as in hot, but spicy as in lots of interesting spices).  We contemplated one of the many naan choices, but ultimately decided to skip the carbs.  In retrospect, I wish we had gotten some, because the sauces here were great.

I also got a mango lassi, which was spiked with cardamon, which I wasn't used to, but still tasty.  Just a heads up.

In sum, a good find that I will go to again should I ever find myself up over thataway."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Mintt so I can't speak to the service and aesthetics of the restaurant.

I am obsessed with the naan from The Mintt. The curry in my butter chicken was also delicious. The chicken is where I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, The Mintt uses high-quality chicken. It tasted like it was cut up chicken breasts tossed in the curry I ordered rather than chicken left simmering in curry for a few hours to soak up the spices and flavors, though. I was disappointed, especially since this was my first experience ordering Indian food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Meal Description:  Rubber chicken placed in bowl of Campbell's tomato soup, no Mango Lassi, two spoons (no fork), butter naan and garlic naan (unable to differentiate), level of satisfaction = none."}
{"text":"Ordered an eggless cake from their 'bakery' section- and it was awesome. We wanted the cake to be of a normal design without too much flowery stuff- and it was perfect - not too ordinary and not too designy. Tasted awesome too. I would have loved not to interact with those part time waiters who turn up on weekends to help. They have no clue what they are talking about and sound as they are the CEOs of some IT companies who happened to do some 'welfare' activity. He took his own sweet time to pack the cake- didnt know where the boxes were, etc."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet on a Friday. Very disappointing selection for vegetarians. There was just Dal, sambar, rasam, beetroot sabzi, carrot rice (literally rice with some carrot slices and a few spices)  and veg pakoras. Literally nothing to eat with Naan apart from dal. 

Maybe I came in on a wrong day. Please call ahead and ask for the menu for the day before going. 

Had many expectations of this place. Maybe all the recommendations was for a la carte. Buffet was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"My coworker and I go here when we are craving good Indian food. The dishes are a bit heavy on the oil (but I feel that this goes for most Indian restaurants). The service is also a bit slow sometimes.The taste is pretty authentic though. Wish this place was in PIttsburgh and delivered to the city."}
{"text":"My belly is full and I am so happy right now. I ordered delivery from Mintt and I couldn't have been more pleased with my food and the service.

I've been craving Indian food for months - to the point that I'd bought a pre-made jar of sauce at the grocery store and made some myself. But it just wasn't the same. Especially because there is no way to replicate true naan and samosas (the frozen ones never stand up to the real thing).

Tonight I bit the bullet and placed at order for what seemed like an immense amount of food. An order of Samosas, Garlic Naan, Gobi Mandarian (a cauliflower appetizer), the Special Biryani rice dish with chicken and Chicken Tandoori. I had read a ton of reviews and was wary of not getting enough rice or having small portions, so I veered on the side of caution by getting plenty. I shouldn't have been worried  

There was SO MUCH FOOD! Not only did I get everything in my order, but there were also three separate chutney dips in a rainbow of colors, plus a side of plain white basmati rice and a sample four oz. container of some kind of chickpea and onion curry. I had to try it all so I am thoroughly stuffed.

Let's talk about the food. I've only ever ordered plain naan, and clearly I have been missing out. The Garlic Naan was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and I moaned when I took a bite of it. I devoured one of the Samosas, and it was everything I'd been dreaming of. Crunchy and gently fried, with a soft potato filling with all the right seasonings. The Special Biryani looked just like the pictures on their website, and it was so pretty that if I hadn't been so hungry I would have stopped and taken a photo of it. It came with a whole hard-boiled egg on top. The rice was light and fluffy and the chicken, hidden at the bottom of the bowl, was tender. 

The Chicken Tandoori was perfect - roasted with a deep red layer of spices without being dry. The six pieces were displayed beautifully with fresh, steamed slices of onions and peppers scattered throughout. The chickpea dish was, I think, Chenna Masala, and it was delicious, even though I only had room by this point for a couple of bites. It was mellow and I can't wait to eat it tomorrow for lunch over some basmati rice. One of the dips was large and white and I think it was the cucumber-based raita. Then there was a bright spring green dip that was a mint chutney. Lastly there was a dark red dip that I think was a date chutney, as it had a fruity flavor. I could tell the dips were all homemade as opposed to corporate, storebought style chutneys.

The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the Gobi Mandarian dish, and that was not because there was anything wrong with the food, but because it was a chili base and tasted too much like General Tso's for my taste. It didn't match the rest of the flavors on my plate so I put it aside. Which, of course, now I realize it was supposed to taste Chinese - \"Mandarian\"...duh!

I've been to Mintt only once before, on a Saturday afternoon when they had a buffet-only set-up and tons of families that looked like they'd just come from church. I just wanted take-out that day, and the buffet was confusing and disorienting and I couldn't figure out what anything was. The food was generally good, though I didn't like everything I randomly picked out, but I put together things wrong in my containers and the men behind the counter were baffled by it. I also couldn't get samosas, which is what I had been craving that day in the first place. Overall, it was a weird experience that scared me off of the place for months.

I'm so glad I came back and tried delivery on a weeknight with them. I was immensely satisfied and thrilled with my order and now I can't wait to try eating out at the restaurant with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and it's always what I would consider just ok. Nothing stand out or especially good, just fair to average with far fewer options that other local places like Taj Mahal. I'll come here for the lunch buffet if it's convenient and I'm really craving Indian, otherwise I bypass."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The staff is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make you happy. Lots of smiles and thank yous, which I love.

The food is consistently excellent. Just wish they had buffets in the evening once in awhile. Other than that, try this place and you'll be a repeat customer for life."}
{"text":"Worst experience !!!! The Kadai chicken with spice level 10 tastes sweet and it isn't any spicy...terribly disappointed"}
{"text":"Just love this place... New management taking Absolute care on quality of food... If u r Biryani lover, u must try Goat biryani here.... I just fell in love with goat biryani at this place also good is Chicken fried rice, chilli chicken dry... Super like this place :)"}
{"text":"I'm struggling with writing this review, as sometimes individual dishes here can be quite good. I've had the buffet here 4 times, and each time there have been issues. Today was no different. I'm a big fan of rasam, the spicy South Indian soup, and, while the rasam here is delicious, it's never, ever hot. Again today, lukeworm soup. Last time I complained, but today I thought \"why bother?\", as it appears they didn't learn anything from the last time. When I went to dish it out, there were no soup cups or bowls there, only the little saucers that they serve their chutney and pickles in, and teacups for the nonexistent chai. When I asked the woman there for a larger bowl, she went to the kitchen and brought some out, but the owner, who was overseeing this exchange in his micro-managey way, stopped her and then brought me one of these little saucers to serve myself some soup in. Really, it's like a thimbleful. So ok, annoying, but not a deal breaker. On the buffet there is a meat section and a vegetarian section, and there are always interesting dishes available that you might not find at other Indian restaurants. Today they had goat curry and chicken biryani. I like their goat curry, but the chicken biryani was too spicy. I also don't really like meat in a stew to be served on the bone, and both of these were...it's just too damn hard to eat. I like spicy food, but they go overboard with the cayenne here. I'm seeing from some of the other reviews that this chef is from Tamarind, and now I understand, as Tamarind uses too much cayenne also. Better Indian chefs rely less on cayenne and more on fresh green chiles and an array of dried chiles to spice their food. It shows a lack of creativity and subtlety that this guy just dumps cayenne all over everything. Lots of the dishes have this problem, even the toor dal, which should never be hot...you lose all of the other delicious flavors. There was a Northern Indian veggie dish on the buffet today that would have been good but for the overwhelming preponderence of garam masala, which effectively wiped out the taste of every other ingredient in the stew. The one bright spot on the buffet today was a delicious vegetable upma. Upma is a sort of cereal made with rava or semolina, often eaten for breakfast in Southern India. When it shows up on a buffet, it says comfort food to me, and this one was good; flecked with whole cumin and mustard seeds, with broccoli and carrots that were done to perfection. But for that I might have gone hungry. The folks from Tamarind also took over one of the only other good Indian restaurants in the area when they bought the place in Cranberry. I can't remember the name of it then, but now it's Taste of India. It was a great restaurant before they bought it...now the food is like at all of their other restaurants. If you do go to Mintt, don't show up just as they open. They'll let you in the door, but then ask you to wait while they finish setting up the buffet. That chai tea never did make an appearance today, so they're not ready for business when they open their doors. None of these things alone would stop me from going there, but, taken all together, they equal a very poor dining experience. One of the reviewers here mentioned that the Indian food scene here in Pittburgh has been rather spotty. I'd say it still is."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad eating experience but it is certainly not the best. The goat biryani was not that great, the tangari kabab was cold. The chaats and the gajar ka halwa were good."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best of all the Indian buffets , in Pittsburgh ...
The current owners took over from the original owners who in my opinion kind of mis-managed the place when it first opened ... it was too formal, too posh ..
The new owners have toned all that formality down and made it approchable and fun with nice colorful decor and etc.
The Saturday buffet is extra special with more dishes put on the buffet ...
The tandoori chicken is among the best i've ever had .  The chicken chettinai (not sure the spelling) is amazing .
***pro-tip - go on Saturday. Most variety of dishes and food seems to always be a couple clicks better than the rest of the week...***"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch buffet 01/10/2016

Appetizer - Grilled hariyali chicken was delicious
Vegetarian food: Most of the dishes were good
Non-Vegetarian food:  Average and not impressive

Caution:  They will charge 18% gratuity automatically in your bill and will not even disclose.  They charge this irrespective of the group size.   I'm not impressed with the service either.  Plates were never cleared in time and have to wait so long and call someone to clear it.   If they want 18% then they should have good service."}
{"text":"This was I believe my first visit to a Indian cuisine type of place. I think The Mintt was a great starting point for me. I went with a friend from work named Tanmoy and it's a Indian tradition to buy lunch for a first time guest at a Indian restaurant. Yes!! So I are for free!

Ok, I admit it was a buffet and I was guessing at dishes. No idea but it was fun to try. I know one was Curry chicken and there was this red chicken too, some rices....I'm a novice!! I ate two plates and I really enjoyed the experience. The staff was very attentive, hot, zesty food. What else can you ask for? The cost is reasonable even though I went for free. I'm going to say....I'm going back!"}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Very delicious buffets and try the mint spl biryani..its yummy."}
{"text":"The mintt service was fast. However, our meals had a lot to be desired. My husband and I got different dishes but the sauces seemed to be the same and the lamb had a lot of bones."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend Buffet over Dine in, especially the weekend buffet. The dine-in was quite ordinary. Felt like everything was floating in tomato soup. On the contrary Weekend Buffet had lot of tasteful choices, ranging from Upidi Sambar to Mint Chilli Chutney. A special mention for the Dosa's (Indian rice crepes), Dosa's are made to order and are delightfully tasteful."}
{"text":"Started off with the chilli chicken and the andhra pepper chicken fry. Awesome food. And then the lamb biryani was pretty good, and just as we started to enjoy the food, the experience started going downhill. 

First the dal makhni. Was as bland as you can get. No salt, no spices, no whatsoever spices, despite asking for a spice rating of 7/10 for the dal.
Mistake no.1 forgiven. 
Ordered a paratha(a bread) and as we were eating it, we find a piece of polythene cooked along with the bread. Disgusting. We mentioned that to the waitress and she apologises and tries to talk to the chef. Apparently the chef has disappeared, so she tells the manager, who cares two hoots about our complaint. Is this how you'd treat a customer? 
This attitude of the restaurant's management is absolutely shocking and I have to admit that though some of the dishes at the restaurant are absolutely fantastic, the service is absolutely pathetic and deplorable. It ruins the whole experience of eating out in a restaurant. 
Coupled with the sad devil may care attitude of the management, I'm afraid that I will not be going back to this place any time soon. 

For a restaurant that has opened up recently and looking for patronage from customers, I'm sorry to say that, they are horrible. 
I wish they would atleast learn to respect a customer and acknowledge their mistakes."}
{"text":"Like I said don't care about the service we had here the biryiani is too good. But since our bad experiences we have been back many times and everything has been great. Our food has come super fast they always are super friendly when we come in and always remember what we are going to order. Must have just caught them on off days. Definitely go get the biryani I swear someone's grandma is back there making it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I'm in the area for work and have time to eat a buffet. You must like Indian cuisine, don't kid yourself if you don't."}
{"text":"My husband I both loved the Tandoori chicken and the Vindaloo. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the things I usually love about Indian food which is huge portions and paneer. I'm a vegetarian so its always exciting when I have a lot of options. This restaurant is new to grub hub and I was super excited to find Indian that delivered in Brookline. Their menu is huge with lots of options. It's unclear on the menu what comes with the meal. After reading other reviews we commented to add rice. Rice and Naan does NOT come with the meals like other Indian restaurants.

I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala which is my go to as well as garlic naan. As soon as I saw it I could tell it wasn't the right color and was pretty bland. And the paneer was pretty soft whereas paneer is usually firmer. Garlic Naan was fine no complaints.

Boyfriend got the Goat Curry and he pretty quickly found bones in his meal. He said he liked the sauce but he had to stop eating out of fear of chomping on some bones :(

Pretty disappointed. Small portion sizes. Meals don't come with naan or rice and then there's the whole bones thing. Also the containers were leaking. We probably won't order here again"}
{"text":"Its been more than 40 minutes we are waiting and waiting for starters only no one would care weather you got food or not 
Very bad service and silly reasons for their delay"}
{"text":"Always great food. The buffet is amazing too. Try the Kerala Chicken, Lamb Curry, or the Chicken 65."}
{"text":"If you want to try some true Indian cuisine but not some Americanized food, this is a go to place. I see lots of people talking about spice levels but this has to accommodate people who eat no spice from different nationalities to people who eat a lot of spice. So please do think when you pick a spice level, I'd suggest to be conservative if you are not used to spicy food."}
{"text":"I would like to preface this review by telling my audience I'm a huge fan of two things: good Indian Food and timely service. As I came in with my family on new years eve, I was impressed with the ambiance and it wasn't too crowded. We got a good seat and waited to place orders. My father suggested we try the spicy wings as an appetizer, followed by a spicy fish dish for him, a noodle plate for my brother and spicy lamb curry for myself. After no time the waiter brought out a plate, placed it on the middle of the table and told us to enjoy. Assuming they were the spicy wings, we plated ourselves and noticed that there was no bone in these wings. Interesting... now, as we ate the \"wings\" we were all a bit confused. They did not taste like chicken one bit! Ten minutes later they brought out the wings only for us to realize that the first dish was my fathers fish. It was odd they brought that dish first but we shrugged it off and enjoyed the wings. They had a robust taste but were extremely dry. 10 minutes later they brought my brothers noodles, and 10 minutes after that I got my curry. By this point I was full from the dishes already brought out and had no room for the curry. I was disappointed in the order the food was taken to us and to me that reflects poorly on the service. As we were leaving I realized they had reviews in the main atrium from almost 10 years ago. Personally, I would rather see what they are doing now compared to work from a decade past. Please work on the service times, there is great potential for what seems like was a once thriving restaurant."}
{"text":"My son, husband and I ate at Mintt last night and it was a wonderful experience. The naan was cooked to perfection and the samosas were literally the best samosas I've ever had in my life. We also had a house specialty appetizer of a delightful medley of some kind of fried fruits and vegetables in a sauce with nuts (sorry, don't know the name) and it too was very yummy. All of our main dishes were great, just the right size for a satisfying dinner. There wasn't a single thing we ate that we didn't love. We had dined at Mintt once before about two months ago and while the food was great, the service needed improvement, but last night was perfect. Our waiter (who might have been the owner) was extremely attentive and helpful and the table bussers were pleasant and unobtrusive. From start to finish it was a lovely, delicious dining experience and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Worst experience with restaurant dining ever.  They served bad fish for the fish tikka masala.  I should have called the health department."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Saturday night.  The place was busy, always a good sign in my opinion.  Our group had a special evening plan and we held it at the restaurant.  We were treated very well.  The staff was very helpful and attentive.  The owner even came to our table to help us learn about many of the dishes.  A few of our group were not familiar with the cuisine, and were unsure of what to get. Management was very helpful in suggesting appropriate menu items for those in our party that wanted either less spicy or more spicy dishes.  

Several spicy dishes were ordered at a spice level of 7, and I felt that they got the right amount of heat.

The restaurant was also mindful of the special needs of one guest who had nut allergies, as many of the dishes contain some nut or other allergen, and they were very helpful in identifying which dishes he could eat.

Everyone in our party really enjoyed our food.

I'm not sure exactly what all was ordered, because we let the more experienced member of our group order for us.  Both meat and vegetarian dishes were ordered, and there was a wide variety and everything was very good.  

I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yo I just came from an event catered by these ppl.  The naan was not warmed, the veggies were overcooked and the cream-based sauces were bland and lacking spice.  Sorry, no good criticism for this culinary experience.  Well, maybe one - they didn't screw up the rice.

Perhaps they do it better in smaller batches like at the restaurant.  I'm open to trying it, though not unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"We made an unplanned stop for a late dinner on the way home around a little bit after 8pm. We were immediately seated along the wall with some free Pappar (crunchy tortilla like chips) and water.

Besides indian dish, they had some indo-chinese dishes on the menu which I personally did not care for. We ordered the Lamb Kadai and a chicken Biryani along with some naan. The Lamb Kadai was good but the chicken Biryani wasn't quite what we expected. It wasn't bad - Let's just say, I've had better at other places. Also, the server forgot to bring the yogurt thing that usually comes with the Biryani. However, another server brought us that mid way through our meal. 

Overall, a decent visit. I would definitely give another shot. Besides that minor hiccup with the yogurt thing - the service overall was pretty good."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner on Tuesday.  It is BYOB, which is my favorite!  Brought some beers, which went well with the spicy food I ordered.  It is a large place, but was not that busy at 6 on a Tuesday.  Had a few starters...but star of the night was the black Dal Makhani that I ordered.  It was delicious!  The Naan was great too!  My friend had the Paneer Tika Masala.  It was amazing as well.  We ate so much we didnt have anything to bring home for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! you order $60 worth of food and they give you the wrong order and the peanut masala!!! It doesn't have any peanuts because they literally forgot! :D wow"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times so far. Most recently I ordered the samosa, butter chicken, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken. The food always tastes good."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have had in Pittsburgh. A few of my favorite things are the Aloo Palak, garlic naan, and vegetable Manchurian. However, there are so many other delicious options to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Mintt. The food was good, but not outstanding. The restaurant looks nice on the inside and the servers are nice."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant, with a very kind staff. 
We had two cakes made for children's birthdays and both were unbelievably incredible and so very special."}
{"text":"Good spread on their weekend buffet. The place is crowded most of the time. That speaks a lot about their food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Prior to this visit I was on the fence about Indian food.  I had been to several places, and was never impressed. However, the most recent which was shut down for health code violations, so I was willing to give Indian food another chance.  So glad I did!  The butter chicken was so good, so...so good.  The other dishes were great too, but I went back for butter chicken 3 times.  The lunch buffet is priced well too (~$10, I think).  Excited to make this a regular rotation on our lunch circuit."}
{"text":"Hosted a private event in their semi private room. I would NOT recommend this place for a formal party or event. The private party room is filthy and in desperate need of a make over. Poor lighting, banged up walls, smelly carpet. totally embarrassing to host 30 people in a space that was so poorly maintained. (my bad, i picked it on the recommendation of someone and did not preview the space in advance of my event).
Overall the food is mediocre at 2.5 stars. Naan is very good. Chicken tikka is well made. Stick to the tandoori items, vs the curries which are quite oily. Staff was accommodating but if you chose this place for an event for 20 people or more, triple check arrangements/ reservation with the manager - because they are not reliable and stay clear of the private room."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant looking at the reviews. I am a vegetarian and Ordered for an egg biryani while I was eating all of a sudden saw a small meat peaces in egg biryani. Please be careful for what you are eating."}
{"text":"I went here for the buffet. I felt the quality of the food was pretty low compared to other Indian buffets I have eaten at in Pittsburgh. One of the chicken dishes had cold chicken because the flame burned out. It was so cold, that I thought maybe it was some chilled chicken dish that I have never had before. I asked the server and no, it wasn't supposed to be cold. Thought the naan bread was not that great tasting either. Also, every Indian buffet I have ever been to either had tikka masala, buttered chicken, or chicken korma in the buffet line. They had none of these varieties. 

Overall, not impressed.
Service was good though.

{"text":"Well, my boyfriend was talking to the owner of the Indian Grocery on Greentree Rd and he explained that there was a new Indian restaurant opening up on Banksville with the chef from Tamarind behind the wheel. Needless we had to try it. 

I must say that it didn't excite me. The food was just adequate. I ordered something that I normally don't order (I'm a Mali Kofta girl) and it is a pretty popular item I'm sure. I've had better at the Days Inn down the road. That's pretty sad. The boy had soup and something else and just wasn't a fan. 

I think we'll be going back to Tamarind."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken biriyani. Tasted like chicken curry rice. Finally worst taste. I don't prefer this Restaurant next time onwards."}
{"text":"First time visiting Mintt tonight. I had Butter Chicken and Butter Naan.  The Service was wonderful and the Food was Delicious. The Restaurant is nicely decorated and  the background music complimented the decor. I will definitely be back. They made a new customer today."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, the atmosphere is surprisingly luxe.  Considering I was coming in from a strip mall parking lot, I was surprised when I saw the jewel-toned walls and white tablecloths.  Pleasantly surprised!

The menu is so big it's a little overwhelming.  They have it split up into Indo-Manchurian, South Indian, and a few other categories like veggie, lamb, chicken, etc.

I came with two other people and we ordered samosas, two kinds of naan (rosemary and regular), chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and an eggplant curry dish.

The naan and samosas were delicious.  The guys loved their chicken dishes, but my eggplant entree was a little short on eggplant and was pretty much a bowl full of sauce.  Hot, delicious curry sauce--so I still ate most of it anyway, just scooping it up with the naan. 

We also shared a bottle of wine.  It's BYOB with no corkage fee, so that's a definite plus.  The minus is that they are slooooooooooow with water.  Come on, people!  I ordered an \"8\" on the spice scale!

They were also painfully slow in bringing the check.  Like, so slow that we were about to walk up to the counter to pay because we thought that was the way to be able to leave.  We got to the restaurant at 7:15, were done eating in an hour, and didn't leave until after 9.  What?!  It's kind of a laissez-faire waiting style, similar to what you'd expect in a French cafe.  Not what I'd expect from a full-service restaurant in Pittsburgh though.

Bottom line--atmosphere: great, food: good, service: the worst.  Give it a try if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great food. One of the better Indian restaurants i've been to in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I ordered many things and came away very disappointed. I eat out at least 300 days of the year. I never cook. So I know what good indian food is and this isn't it. 

I ordered gobi manchurian, gobi paratha, kheema with peas,mint chicken biryani, amritsari fish, chicken 555. 

Half of these were a carry out and half was dine in. 

It lacks flavor, heat, they use chili powder and not spices to add heat. 
The sauces are the same in most dishes. 
It just doesn't seem to leave you satisfied. 
You chew and ingest. But do not enjoy the food. Lack of flavor and taste is appalling. 

Cafe Delhi in carnegie does a much better job than this place."}
{"text":"Taste was good, however-  
Butter chicken- all sauce- soup like, barely any chicken in it. 
Garlic and onion naan for take out, were packed together. Sloppy.
Insufficient amount of rice for two orders. I can see watching food cost on chicken, but on the rice???? Seriously guys- get your act together, cant afford to lose customers nowadays."}
{"text":"A colleague had a spare takeaway box of the Chicken Biryani with mango halwa and yogurt from here, which he very kindly shared with us, and refused to take payment for, so I have no idea as to cost or what the restaurant looks like, so this review is strictly on that one dish and accompaniments.

So the takeaway box was layered in such a way that the chicken pieces were placed at the bottom and then the rice was on top of the meat and there was a hard boiled egg, raw onions, slice of lemon and cilantro included in the box as well.

I liked the taste of the rice, but it wasn't massively spectacular or special in any way and I also didn't eat any of the chicken or mix it on with the rice. The virulently red coloring of the chicken scared me off from trying it, as I have previously found that I'm allergic to that red colouring. However my friend who ate it said the chicken was super spicy and she ate it with the yogurt to calm the burn down.

While I was indifferent about the biryani rice, I really really loved the mango halwa. I've never had this kind of a halwa before, and it was a revelation. The Mango flavour really shown thru (I reckon it was a can of Alphonso mango pulp) and when mixed with the semolina made into the halwa, it was wonderfully light and flavorful. My plan is to try and recreate it at home, and so totally recommend this dessert!

{"text":"We eat at a lot of Indian buffets for lunch and we think this is a really, good one.  The weekday lunch buffet is $7.99 (I think) and includes tea.  Lots of options, really tasty.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I have a friend who is all about Indian food and she wanted to come check this place out so of course I was game. There were three of us and when we got there around 6pm-ish there was one other couple dining. We were promptly greeted, seated, and watered. I looked over the menu and asked my friend for recommendations. She told me to pick a meat first so I went for chicken. I got chicken kurma and chickened out on the spiciness with a 1. Whomp whomp. My friend went for an 8 out of 10 while the other went for a 4ish for level of spiciness.

All three of us ordered samosa individually and the funny part was one of the gentlemen working there came up to us and wanted to make sure we knew each order came with two big ones filled with potato. We laughed and confirmed we wanted individual orders so we could take some to go. He was right. We got the samosa and there were two big ones wrapped up with a side of chickpeas and something else mixed in. The best way for me to describe the samosa in dumbed down terms is potatoes wrapped up in a fried tortilla-looking pastry. It was perfectly spicy - not too much and not too little. All three of us also ordered mango lassi, which is a mango flavored yogurt drink. It was room temperature and I wasn't expecting that (never had it before). The flavor was smooth.

My friend said her 8 out of 10 spicy level was weak for her dish, but then again, she's like master of spicy. I really loved my dish with yellow kind of curry and varies different flavors. My chicken was great. We got a bowl of rice to share and an order of garlic naan, which I loved. Each one of us had leftovers. The food was really satisfying and tasty. More people ended up filing in before we left so that was a good sign. The service was fantastic - attentive and kind. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful! Best is gutti vankaya eggplant curry and mango kulfi. They don't have few things which was on the menu. But I would recommend to all"}
{"text":"Indian DH and I took a few family members the other night.  I had been a few times, it was everyone else's first.  It's pretty good- the menu is probably too big to do any one thing well (they cover the entire continent rather than North or South as our favorite places tend to do).  The food is consistent, nothing is out of this world but I haven't had anything I didn't like.  I wish they'd spice things up more- it doesn't seem to matter whether we ordered a 4 or an 8, it was all about the same.  

Love it for lunch, very friendly staff, it's not my top Indian place in Pittsburgh but it's ideal for an introduction to the cuisine and we'll definitely bring friends here again."}
{"text":"Had the worst food ever today! 
We walked into the restaurant and got ourselves a table. The person taking the order looked heartbroken and took our order in sadness. In 10 minutes our appetizer arrived, it was a cold plate of chilli chicken, seemed like it was just out of the freezer and was served thawed. We turned that in and got a little warmer plate which was just edible. Then arrived the yuckiest main course of my life, we had ordered all our food at spice level 8 , but in real the food was super sweet and was filled with cream, so much so that it almost choked us and made it hard to swallow. The poor server came up to our table for a feedback and we told him how unhappy we were. He said he would try to fix it and went away.  
Enter-a  lady with a fake accent ,she had a stinky attitude and she assured that all creamy food was sweet and walked away.Is this the service they provide? Wonder if they treat all the customers this way? or is it just Indians? They seriously served us crap.I can challenge this lady and the chef to cook chicken tikka masala at a spice level they desire. We also ordered an andhra chicken curry too which turned out stale and we could see the water separate from the onion gravy. Gross!! Is'nt it?? I would never go back to this restaurant and waste money. Hope i am alive tomorrow after eating the food. I already feel sick in my stomach! All the people in our group feel sick!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mutter Paneer, my usual dish when I visit a new Indian restaurant.  The dish was great, spiced to an adequate level for the \"7\" that I ordered.  My husband ordered the vegetable korma which had a great spicy sweetness and met the expectations of a spice level of \"6\". The service was exceptional and far exceeded the expected based on previous reviews of this restaurant.  Prices were fair and location near to our house cannot be beat. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent. I am giving two stars because they should be four...meaning if they paid attention to consistency they could be good. They don't and that is really disappointing. Having potential and not living up to jt is a huge fail. 

I have had lunch when dishes were fresh. I have had lunches where the food was slop and seemed baked under hot lamps. This flux is unacceptable. Expect more from a place that purports to be a finessed Indian dining experience. Shouldn't have airport food days:)"}
{"text":"Don't let the plain looking interior turn you off. It's definitely not your typical fancy restaurant but the food was absolutely delicious. We went for the lunch buffet and you just can't beat a lunch buffet for under $10 and to top it off the selections included 3 vegan friendly options so I was pleasantly surprised . My none vegan family tried all the other dishes and there wasn't a single one they didn't like! I'm surprised to see the ratings are low because I try a ton of indian restaurants and this certainly was a great choice"}
{"text":"The place was freezing yesterday.  The plates were cold making the food cold.  I've eaten here a few times and have had about enough now.  They refuse to put small bowls out for the soup.  They took the cups off the buffet years ago so you couldn't use those and are using styrofoam for the tea.  Shame on you!  Lazy and wasteful.  How many trips am I supposed to make to the buffet for some rasam.  It's ridiculous and thoughtless.

The food is mostly very tasty and well prepared.  My problem lies with the amount of cayenne they put in EVERY dish.  ALL OF THEM.  I eat at hundreds of Indian restaurants all over the country and NONE except Tamarind in the Pittsburgh area are hotter. I would like to slowly enjoy my food not gulp it down quickly.  I like spicy but this is ridiculous.  

The service has ranged from rude to ok here and the assortment of buffet items used to better. It's too bad.  I would come here more often.  I was at one of their places and they even made the raita hot.  Clueless."}
{"text":"Really good food! I don't ever care for indian food that was not made by either my mother or myself so my rating, I would think, counts for something. We've been to two events catered by Mintt and though no event can go without any flaws the food was pretty on point for the most part! The manchurian and samosa chat was out of this world and the mango lassi, though not sweet enough for my taste, was cold and refreshing. There was a live dosa station, which everyone really liked but I didn't try because I don't like dosas. But it looked cool? Anyway, good food and maybe we'll try the restaurant one day."}
{"text":"Really good weekend lunch buffet ($11)!     I've been trying lots of Indian buffets in the area and they've all been very predictable and very weakly spiced.   This buffet goes beyond the typical chicken tikka masala, Chana masala etc and gives you lots of non typical buffet items.   It was very flavorful, spicier than most of the Indian buffets around here but by no means tear producing.    After so many disappointing Indian buffets in apittsburgh, I'm going to stick with Mintt."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh.  Delicious buffet, and well priced."}
{"text":"What to write about this review. Outsider to Pittsburgh, I am disappointed what this city has to offer.  The long unorganized wait time complimented to left over insufficient food in the buffet. The guy at the dosa counter was such asshole that made Uninterested faces when I asked for a dosa. Horrible horrible experience... This place is done for me. Overall a cheap dirty experience."}
{"text":"I went there with my book club last week. The food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the sesame naan which I had never had before that night.

Overall a fun budget- friendly night!"}

others of my experience, in part through the beauty of Yelp!  Let the Indian food diner beware The Mintt!"}
{"text":"Samosa was delightful. Garlic and onion naan was fresh, tasty, fantastic. Mango lassi had a pleasant smooth yogurt taste that was pleasingly different from other places I have tried. Lamb curry and Chicken Kendai dishes were not \"10\" spicy as requested, were similar in taste, but were satisfying. I will try them again. I would like to see how their buffet is..."}
{"text":"Note #1: Tuesday-Friday they are closed in the afternoon between 2:30 and 5. On weekends the same occurs between 3 and 5. This is due to the restaurant's transition between lunch and dinner. I wasn't able to convey that when I added the hours to the listing. 

Note #2: The Mintt's menu consists of \"South Indian, North Indian, and Indo Chinese\" fare.

Dad was owed a double birthday/belated Father's Day dinner and wanted Indian food as he is wont to do. Wanting to trying a place other than Namaste (I will still stand by them) for farts 'n chuckles, he decided on The Mintt.

Man, the Banksville Road Restaurant Ramayana is underway, isn't it? Watch out for Rama's arrows! 

In all earnestness, Dad and the rest of the family were more than happy with our takeout dinner, finding that it matched culinary wits with neighboring Namaste superbly. 

Each time we order Indian takeout, a side-splitting game of \"What's What?\" occurs, and you'd better believe we try each other's dish. We usually each pick something, get it home, and engage in a feeding frenzy until the innately filling nature of Indian food (that's been my experience) begins to get the better of us. Here's what made up our meal...

Chicken 65 ('Deep fried boneless chicken in spicy ginger, garlic,
red chili and ground black pepper marinade.')

Chicken Biryani

Handi Goat ('Goat cooked with ground meat, spices and fresh
herbs.')

Lamb Curry

Chicken Curry

Tandoori Combination Grill

Lasani Gobi ('Deep fried battered cauliflower florets tossed with
fresh garlic, chili and green onion.')

Garlic Naan (they have about 15 types of bread, but we played it safe, going with Dad's favorite)

Aside from the somewhat dry Tandoori chicken (something that doesn't usually hold up well in transit), everything was up the the standards we've become accustomed to when it comes to Indian fare; tender, flavorful, fiery. However, the Chicken Biryani came with a twist: Cinnamon! And it worked wonderfully for me. 

The sleeper dish for me was the Lasani Gobi in that it made me enjoy cauliflower, something I couldn't get excited about even when it was deep fried and served at a bar. I guess all it took was some garlic, chilis, and green onions to win me over. 

Goat is...interesting. Yes, it was new to me. Mintt serves it on the bone. It's basically a less supple lamb to my teeth and palate. 

The Mintt's Chicken 65 makes typical chicken tenders passe. The duo of curry dishes were a little \"darker\" (not sure if there's a better descriptor)  in flavor than Namaste's. Their naan was as pliable, blistered, and tasty as they come. 

I couldn't give a winged pickle about authenticity and haven't the free-time or funds to travel to India to find out about it. Good is good, and we all found that our meal from The Mintt was rathergood like those legendary viking kittens from the intrawebs!

{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday evening and it was not crowded at all. We started off with the chicken 65 and chilli chicken. Both were nice and fresh and were yummy. I was a fan of the chilli chicken as it had a nice sauce on it. For dinner, we had the chicken biriyani, lamb rojan josh, and the tandoori mixed platter. The chicken biriyani was very subpar. It did not seem fresh and seemed as if it had been sitting a while. I could not even eat the chicken in the dish. The lamb rojan josh was ok. There was way too much gravy and the flavor was very concentrated making it not very enjoyable. The tandoori platter had mixed reviews. Some items were good like the salmon but others were dry such as the chicken. At the end of our meal, we both concluded that there is much better Indian food available in Pittsburgh. Honestly, will probably not be back."}
{"text":"I can just say one word, \"extremely over-rated\". The food is kinda okay and eatable but not great. I heard that people here are pretty inconsistent. My friend told that, food was tastier last time, but not now."}
{"text":"i consider myself adventurous when it comes to food. i'll try most foods at least once before i pass judgement. so when the gals of the carlynton cougars ladies lunch said let's try mintt, i was like, alright, finally, somewhere new & exciting! we meet every 4-6 weeks, & they're pretty much a \"meat & potatoes\" group. we end up at same couple of places. aaaahhhh!!!
i checked the menu online to see what i was in for. it was a busy morning of menu & looking up words i had no idea what they meant. the menu was huge! i made myself a \"cheat sheet\" so i could converse somewhat intelligently!
from the outside it looks nice-no walls, all glass, & the sun shining on them made it look quite inviting. once inside though, it was dark, dreary. it was painted black & had very bad lighting. the host(?) took us to a table, plopped down glasses & a pitcher of water, & left. we sat..... finally, the host came close enough for me to flag him down. annoyed, he came over. i only got out-could we have some menus. buffet he said, & left. we wanted some pop, iced tea, nope. so off we went to the buffet.
1 of the pet peeves i have about food is a buffet! i don't care how many \"snot guards\" there are, it is not enough!!! this place was filled with ALOT of kids getting their own food! oh heck no! there is no guard against them! oh, i was becoming more excited as i approached the line! so it's dark, feels dirty & germy, & there are only 5-7 signs with food names on them. all the other dishes were crap shoots on what it was! & none of it was what i had written down! almost everything had a sauce on it. i did try several things, but honestly, i was not impressed. the flavor profiles seemed off to me. if that's what indian food tastes like, well then, i doubt i will give it another try. plus, the \"staff\" was kind of rude & well, not helpful. some of the girls eventually found the pop in a case, underneath, behind.....do they not want to make a sale?"}
{"text":"Worst Indian I have ever had which was confusing since it was recommended. Spices and naan was flavorless. Service was horrible. I will never return again."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. We enjoyed our meal fully. The paneer tikka masala was very good and the shrimp biryani was as well. We ordered the garlic naan was good but I must admit I definitely prefer the naan from India Garden in Oakland. Theirs is much bigger and seems more authentic with the big crispy bubbles and then the soft chewy center also. All in all good place. 3 and a half stars if I could give a half."}
{"text":"Decent place to enjoy Indian food. Though the ambience is below ordinary the food tasted okay. We ordered veg thali, masala chai, onion naan and vegetable Hakka noodles. Immediately we were served with tea and complimentary papad with mint and tamarind chutney. The tea was average and can be avoided. The noodles were too much oily at the bottom of the bowl for my liking otherwise they tasted good. The sambhar was sweet in the thali, but mix veg was delicious, naan was soft and onion naan was also good. The paneer tikka makhni was oddly sweet. The biryani, plain rice, papad, salad, rasmalai, raita were all good. I didn't like the mix veg pakoda though. Mostly the flavors were closer to a South Indian cuisine. Overall with a decent service this place can be visited again for South Indian flavors or to have a good meal."}
{"text":"My brother told me about this new Indian restaurant that just opened it's doors on Banksville road - home to a slew of other Indian shops.  I was eager to try it out, as rumor is the restaurant is owned by the former head chef at Tamarind.  I have always loved the food at Tamarind, so I thought i would give this place a try.

Food: Delicious, and fairly priced.  They have a very good range of food (North Indian, South Indian, and Indo-Chinese).  Their Indo-Chinese is to die for.  I ordered their Veg Hakka noodles, it's was very spicy and flavorful.  We also tried the Veg Manchurian, a different take on the typical Gobi Manchurian.  It's quite soft in the center, but a welcome change.  I've been there twice, and both times as I was happily satisfied each time.  They also have different types of Indo-Chinese dishes, and North Indian dishes that I haven't seen elsewhere. 

Give this new Indian restaurant a try - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place really is one of the best Indian places in Pittsburgh, definitely in the south hills. It doesn't look like much, but service is awesome, food is even better."}
{"text":"This place has comparitively more south Indian flavours when compared to other Indian restaurants. I come here often for buffet and I like the variety of food they offer in both vegetarian and meat categories. After eating at many Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, I can say without a doubt that this place offers the best chicken biryani. If you are craving for some authentic biryani, I strongly suggest this place. 

They also offer masala dosa for buffet which is a good deal for the amount for the amount of money you pay for the buffet. I think I should also mention other  tasty items like mango lassi and appetizers like manchurian, chilli chicken, chicken 65 and chicken tandoori among many other tasty dishes. 

If you are ordering biryani from the menu, my suggestion would be mintt special biryani over regular biryani."}
