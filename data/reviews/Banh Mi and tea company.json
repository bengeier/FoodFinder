{"text":"This is the best bubble tea I've ever had. And the food is so fresh. I'm officially a loyal customer"}
{"text":"I really dig the bahn mi fusion concept. Their sandwich menu is half traditional bahn mi and half fusion. I'm a fan of the Philly. The traditional grilled pork was pretty awesome as well and the housemade aoli for the sandwiches was on point. Prices seem high for a bahn mi ($5.50) but they don't seem to skimp on any of the ingredients so its not unreasonable.  The drink menu is pretty extensive. I wasn't disappointed with my avocado smoothie. I'm psyched to try out some of their other stuff.  Service is friendly but can be a little slow when busy but I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was so glad to hear that a bubble tea place was opening up near me and I was not disappointed with this place. I love their green tea and honey dew flavored bubble teas! My boyfriend is a fan of avocado and liked that they used fresh avocados to make his bubble tea instead of using powder like some other places. The decor is also pleasant - very nice and clean. Parking is limited, so I try to go during slow hours."}
{"text":"Finally a place in Charlotte with legit Taro bubble tea!  I didn't get boba with my tea so can't attest to the quality of their boba, but the flavor of taro was right with just right amount of sweetness. The drink got a bit too icy towards the end but it's not a deal breaker.  There are more than 10 different Banh Mi on the menu, both traditional and non traditional ones. I ordered B9, the one with grilled marinaded pork. The bread was fresh and not as hard as a baguette. The pork was juicy, and veggies very fresh. It could use a little more aioli but I am pretty happy with my choice. Where else can you get a $5 sandwich with no processed meat and fresh veggies?  The place is clean and enticing. Parking may be a little tight during lunch rush.  I will be back to try more stuff on the menu, and hang out for a bit. They have lattes too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Banh Mi! I have tried all them from the menu! The special, Hawaiian, Korean, and Philly are my favorites! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"FOOD - 4 stars My picky eaters liked their popcorn chicken. One of the better ones I've had. Their bread wasn't perfectly crispy, but overall, I enjoyed their Korean banh mi.  BOBA - 2 stars Their black milk tea didn't taste like black tea, and their boba was too hard. Their milk tea, which is usually $1-2 cheaper than other boba drinks, cost as much as their smoothie.  I might come back for just the food next time. The food and drinks took much longer to prepare than most banh mi restaurants, but the workers were all very nice. Parking was also somewhat difficult."}
{"text":"I tried Banh Mi for the first time today and was very pleased with the food and service.  I got the Philly and loved the flavors. I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Crispy and yet Chewy! Savory, Salty & a little bit Sweet... mmm! I'm super addicted...  NO SHAME THO! I'm in the area often for work and I take full advantage of the ChowNow app to preorder my Banh Mi's to make it fast to pop in and out. The parking lot is a HOT mess.. but it's worth the hassle because their Cha Lua and their \"Speciality\" are my absolute favorite! I do prefer Le's Banh Mi thit nuong and xiu mai tho. I'm not sure what Banh Mi and tea does to marinate their pork or season their meatballs but it's just not very flavorful. The bread and other ingredients overpower the meat in my opinion. However, to each his own and I am a happy, satisfied customer at least once a week if not more - thank you for existing Banh Mi & Tea! Cam On Rat nhieu vi lam Banh mi rat ngon cho em! Haha"}
{"text":"We were next door at discount tires waiting for our car to be serviced and decided to try this place out. We had the lemongrass tofu sandwich and a taro bubble tea- both very good! The prices were very fair- 5$ for the sandwich and 4.95$ for the bubble tea. The service was prompt and the cashier who took our order was very friendly. Highly recommend this place for a quick bite"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out yesterday and loved it!  The sandwiches were fresh and the flavors were spot on. We ordered the Korean Banh Mi, the Banh Mi Thit Nuong and the Banh Mi Xiu Mai. We were luke warm on the Xiu Mai (meatballs) but the other two were delicious. I ordered online using ChowNow and it was easy and the food was ready right on time. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend going to Banh Mi. The food is amazing and it's so fresh.  They definitely take their time with the preparation. The restaurant is very clean. The staff very nice. The owner Tim very friendly and made sure the food was to our satisfaction.  If you're in the area make it a point to stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and flavorful, highly recommend.  Not heavy eating, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot food for the price. I can can get the same sandwich in Atlanta for $2.50. Also, I'm still hungry.  On a positive note, the sandwiches are delicious."}
{"text":"I didn't go inside so I can't comment on any of the interior but the sandwiches were awesome! I had the lemongrass tofu banh mi and my husband had the korean. Both were very good though this was our first banh mi experience. Very reasonably priced as well. The fruit tea was tasty as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! Possibly eat here once a week! Service is friendly and they have the best bubble tea. They never disappoint"}
{"text":"Clean. Fresh. Delicious. Some of the best Banh mi's around. Lots of options of tea combinations to try as well. Refreshing.  Came in from out of town out of all the places to eat this is my second lunch in 2 days here."}
{"text":"I recommend Bang Mi 100%. the people are nice and the food is fabulous....much better than Subway! ENJOY!!!!"}
{"text":"I think their sandwiches have gotten better and better each time I've gone back. I do wish they had a bit more of the aioli by default but you can customize your sandwiches as they're made to order so that's def a plus. My go to is always the grilled pork. It's healthy and fresh...can't go wrong with that! Def go check them out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great to have a banh mi restaurant on this side of town. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is great!  I still enjoy making a trip to Le's sandwich & cafe near sugar creek for a great traditional banh mi for a great price. But if I didn't want to make the trek and was craving it I'd come back. It seems like the boba tea is the real star! Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Loved everything I have had here so far. I think they have the best spring rolls this side of town. The sandwiches are all really good too. I am still working through each flavor! Cant wait to try them all."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch or carry out spot, love the summer rolls and Korean BBQ sandwich, service is quick, great value"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service all of the employees took the time to explain each item provided. We had the traditional Banh Mi was eye popping cooked to order and fresh."}
{"text":"Food and service is great. I try something new every time I visit. Haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious Bubble Tea. Definitely be back for the scrumptious looking sandwiches."}
{"text":"I work across the street from here and it became an office favorite on day 1!! The sandwiches are amazing, and the staff is really great about allowing everyone to play around with ingredients. Having bubble tea so close to me every day is extremely dangerous but I love it. I could be wrong but I think they use real fruit in them. They taste better than most I've had. The surprise favorite for me is the fruit infused tea. It's amazing and I highly recommend it. My absolute favorite sandwich is the Korean Bahn mi, it's so delicious and fresh. My coworker told me it was his favorite until he had the Philly Bahn mi so that's next on my list to try. Also, and the is secondary to the food, the decor inside is on point!"}
{"text":"Great place for Banh Mi.  I like that they have pate in their banh mi and their aioli goes well with the sandwich.  Overall, a casual and clean environment for dining with decent parking.  Good bubble tea.  Also has kid seating which is great."}
{"text":"My cousin and I went here for lunch. Wasn't hard to find only issue was that there wasn't a lot of parking. The food was tasty. My cousin had the B7. The \"Korean\" Bánh Mì. I had the B6. The \"Philly\" Bánh Mì. I haven't tried anything than the original Bánh Mì. I'm glad I went out of my comfort zone."}
{"text":"It's my first time visiting there. I had a hot green tea with some little bite bubbles, and it's tora flavor (purple color). I like it, first, not too sweet; second, little bubbles make easier to chew, I don't feel too much stuffing in my belly. Will be back soon to try their Banh mi. As far as I know they have some classics and some non traditional sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food and the best bubble tea in the Queen city!"}
{"text":"Hello banh mi sammiches! Banh mi sammiches have a special place in my heart and I was so excited to find that A. Charlotte has a wide selection of Vietnamese restaurants B. Charlotte has a wide selection of Vietnamese restaurants that serve banh mis. The Banh Mi and tea company is a very modern and trendy looking restaurant with lots of variations on the traditional banh mi such as the banh mi burger, vegetarian tofu options,  a korean version, etc. I got the traditional sammich and was pleased with it. The only critique I could offer is that though it had plenty of meat, I wish they had more vegetables. The reason why I love banh mis so much is because of how fresh it is and how clean I feel eating it. I also ordered the summer rolls and was less impressed with it. The dipping sauce was great but I thought the ingredients were lacking- again, not enough vegetables. The rolls were sort of limp because of how few ingredients were in there."}
{"text":"I'm kind of torn between my review on this company. They've always offered me the best service and have never messed up on an order. Their drinks are good and their ticket times don't take any longer than 10 minutes IF that.  My only issue is that I had eaten there twice before and both times ordered their Lemon Zest Tofu sandwich; being vegan that was my only option so I ordered it and had them hold the aioli(butter sauce). *there was nothing on the menu that said they did anything to their tofu, so I assumed it was just normal tofu*  After a month or so of not having been to the little shop, I go in to order my sandwich. I end up having a conversation with the cashier who then informs me that their tofu isn't vegan and is actually marinated in oyster sauce. I haven't been back since but the girl said I wasn't the only one who has come in looking for vegetarian/ vegan options and they weren't able to accommodate. (she did say they would be adding more items to the menu tailored towards different diets)"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the flavors, freshness and service. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich with extra cilantro and jalapeños yummy yum yum. I could delight on this divine creation daily but I'll push it out to a weekly stop."}
{"text":"Banh Mi and Tea is a little shop and what they are known for is what they do well. From a referral we checked this place out. We just got the normal default combination. They have fusion and also traditional banh mi which to me I thought was a little crazy, but I can definitely see why they did this and needed to branch out and be able to accommodate a wide variety of people.  The banh mis were tasty and I definitely recommend you to check this place out if you're looking for a good Banh Mi to go, or if you don't want to cook dinner. I'm a sucker for sandwiches and burgers, but for banh mi, the thought of low carb lifestyle goes out the window. They also have bubble tea, but I didn't try it out. I think it'll be something to try out next time, but I'm skeptical about that. The banh mi is where it's at though and that's what I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I realized how close this spot was to my job. I ordered the Thai satay chicken banh mi and the passion fruit infused tea and it was absolutely delightful. Restaurant was so clean and had good energy, along with superb customer service. I am extremely tempted to order a take home banh Mi for dinner. Needless to say I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of banh mi and they make them real good here.  Only banh mi sandwich I've had in Charlotte that compares is Crispy Banh Mi on South Blvd.  I will be making this a regular destination."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch got the pork sandwich, the xa xiu. We wanted the bbq pork and I think that's what this was? What we got was not what bbq pork usually is. It was not as sweet or flavorful as it usually is and the color was not as red. That aside it looked like a pretty typical Banh mi sad which with the baguette, pickled veggies, some mayo butter sauce.   The baguette was longer and thinner than I'm used to but it was easier to eat so that's ok. The bread was not toasted and it was not super buttery which was pretty sad since that adds a lot of flavor usually. The vegetables were also not as pickled as I'm used to but that might just be because the demographic they're serving is different. The butter sauce was also a little lacking in flavor. Overall I was not pleased with the bahn mi and probably wouldn't get it again.   We also got the popcorn chicken and asked to have it spicy. They don't do it spicy usually but upon our request they added some cayenne powder and it was great.   Bahn mi was 5.5 and popcorn chicken was $3 or $4. Took us a little time to get our food but that might be because they were cooking the chicken fresh. I've seen complaints about the parking but I'm not really sure why. They had two reserved parking spaces but there were quite a lot of other spaces in the same parking lot and more in the parking lot right next to it.   My rating is actually maybe a star higher than I would otherwise have rated them but I love seeing more Asian restaurants in the area and they are a family owned small business so I would like to support them."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, and it did not disappoint. Banh Mi's where great, bubble tea was great, also tried the nachos and they were awesome. Food is good and inexpensive, what a little gem."}
{"text":"Love this place food is so good price is spot on. Will be back.. have been back welcome and good luck"}
{"text":"You can get both traditional and fusion banh mi. Since I will always stick to the classics, I got the banh mi thit nuong. The pork was well flavored and grilled. The bread was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside.   The che ba mau wasn't too sweet. If you haven't had Vietnamese desserts before, they add a lot of cruched ice in the dessert."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited Bánh Mì and Tea Company for the first time last weekend and it was fantastic! I ordered the lemongrass tofu bánh mì and a taro bubble tea. I thought it was great that the restaurant offered several options for vegetarians.  While I was looking at the add-ons for the bubble tea, I asked the cashier what \"grass jelly\" was, since I had never tried it or even seen it on a menu before, and she very kindly brought me over a spoonful to taste it. I wound up ordering it.  Everyone who works there is very welcoming, the service is really fast, and the food is reasonably priced and delicious.  I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, the sandwich is already good, but not the tea or the popcorn chicken. I guess it depends on the flavor of the tea you get, thai tea is pretty good, but the rest are just so so. Popcorn chicken is pretty dry and really small pieces compare to other place I've been to. Service is always friendly and the place looks clean. Parking is a challenge unless you get lucky. I had one time parked in the garage on the other side. Overall, its an ok place to hangout and have a little snack."}
{"text":"I am very familiar with banh mi and this is one of the best.  I have been to ones in California and Chicago.  We had grilled pork, spam and eggs, and Korean BBQ.  We had green tea with fruits and che ba mau.  The food and drinks are delicious.  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Got banh mi dac biet, banh mi thit nuoung, banh mi cha trung, and 2 order of calamari for $35.  Near hotel we were staying by. If you order online or text, 10%.  Parents ate here for lunch too"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food, big portion, clean restaurant. Had leftovers. Just only wish they had more variety of spicy sauces."}
{"text":"I just love this new place! Been eating there almost everyday! My favorite is the the bulgogi sandwich with lychee tea. But today I try the tofu sandwich and love it just as much!!"}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of Crispy Banh Mi, so I was really excited when I saw this place because it's so much closer to my house. Unfortunately it's not as good but the atmosphere is a lot nicer. I got the Korean banh mi which was good and my boyfriend got the philly banh mi but he didn't like it at all. Then the nacho appetizer was good but for the price and the amount of meat that was on them? Not worth it."}
{"text":"First I thought the sandwiches were overpriced but holy geezus the buns were stuffed with meat!  But do you think you guys can add fried quail to the menu? (Wink)"}
{"text":"FINALLY A PLACE THAT DOES BOBA RIGHT.  Not sure if this owner is straight up from California, but this small shack knows their s***! I'm afraid to say that the Asian Corner Banh Mi joint will have some pretty legit competition.  I literally ordered one thing off each section of their menu...and oh boyyy, a place that finally sells boba tea that is not powdered!   Their Banh Mi's are on point and their baguette is the perfect length coupled with their delicious home-style pate. Spring rolls were bomb, which comes with their savory/sweet fish sauce on the side.   Y'all need to check this place out...shouting out to all those avid BOBA and BANH MI lovers."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience at Banh Mi. I didn't have an authentic Banh mi sandwich but I did enjoy the tofu summer roll with the amazing peanut sauce. I will however make a suggestion to the chef on my behalf and on behalf of others who enjoy vegan options. If you all could offer More vegan options in your sandwiches that would be great! Maybe a sweet and sour tofu Banh mi? Idk that maybe far fetched but it's an idea! LoL!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by this hot and new spot. Love the fact that it's in my neck of the woods. The place is super clean and the man that helped me seemed very nice. We didn't interact much but he was polite and I watched him with other customers and he was very nice to them all.   Banh Mi is something I wished I had in my life sooner than a few years ago when I tasted Le's Banh Mi. Their sandwiches are the standard to which all others in charlotte are to be compared to.  I ordered two sandwiches. The #9 and #11. I will say this, the #9 was freaking amazing. Neck and neck with Le's in my opinion. The flavor was so good. My only criticism is that it could have used more jalapeños. But man, what a good ass sandwich.  Now the #11 was a disappointment. Not sure what I was expecting. The pork was cold, I guess that's how it comes. I was expecting another hot sandwich. Just through me off. Maybe the menu should specify hot and cold sandwiches. If I may offer some advice. I'm definitely going back though."}
{"text":"The banh mi here was so good and really packed a kick! Every piece of the sandwich  (I got the B9) was delicious and complimented the other elements well.   The food: The meat itself had good flavor and the pickled carrots and jalapenos offered the right amount of salt and spice. The best part: they didn't burn the bread. It was perfectly crisp and not overdone at all.   The atmosphere: bright, clean, and trendy. I loved their decor from the quirky animal paintings to the ingredients sign above the condiments. You can tell they put a lot of thought into their decor.   Customer Service: The cashier was really nice even having to put up with me changing my drink order. She was knowledgeable about the product and very friendly.  Drink: I took off the one star because the thai tea I got was just ok. I wish there was a half star option because I don't think this deserves a full star off but I couldn't justify giving 5. It was good but a little bland and not as sweet as I normally like it. That is a personal preference though so if you don't like sweet, you will probably be okay."}
{"text":"Just decent bubble tea flavors, boba consistently cooked to good texture but not sweetened.  Will return for food next time"}
{"text":"Wow, way to go This-part-of-town! Authentic, delicious and affordable, this place is a cant miss for lunch or a Healthy, Quick dinner. Got the lemongrass tofu Banh mi and can't wait for my next. The summer rolls were on point - for fans of Lang Van, you've found a southwest option to dazzle your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, and surprisingly affordable. I live in walking distance and often find myself there for lunch as a result!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Banh Mi and tea place. So hard to find good Vietnamese food in Charlotte. It's atmosphere and decode is very modern.  I had the egg rolls, nam noung, and the grilled pork Banh Mi ... everything was great! Will come back another time if I am around this side of town."}
{"text":"In my poor efforts to avoid bread, my inner cravings got the best of me. Normally, I go to Crispy Banh Mi off South Blvd, however today I choose to try a new restaurant closer to me.   A small breakfast restaurant once stood here, thank goodness they're gone! Muahahaha!!! Banh Mi and Tea is the perfect addition to Arysley town. I've seen this area grow tremendously since 2007. Many businesses have come and gone.    I placed an order for two sandwiches (B9) which comes with Grilled marinated pork, pickled carrots, daikons, cucumber, jalapeños, cilantro, and housemade aioli. The aioli is delish! The perfect amount was applied to both my orders. My husband is not a fan of jalapeños ( they were gracious enough to remove them). When I unwrapped my to-go order I noticed my sandwich was covered with jalapeños, sliced thinner than paper. No joke! I was expecting my sandwich to be super spicy, but it wasn't. The thin jalapeños were mild and delicious! Would you believe the bread doesn't take up 60% of the Sandwich lol. The bread is nice and thin and has that satisfying crunch in every bite!   This restaurant is easy to locate. The parking lot isn't big, I came during lunch hour and it wasn't busy. I found a spot up front. I'm happy to report this restaurant has clean floors and tables. The staff is nice and prices are afforable.   I look forward to enjoying more food from here."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. It's a nice place even though the space is small. I tried oolong milk tea and my husband tried coffee milk tea. Both of them were too much tea and less sweet. It will be better if you can make it more milk and sweet. About the coffee milk tea, I couldn't taste much coffee, only the taste of tea. I also tried the \"korean\" banh mi. I can tell it was good but a little bit sweet. I rated 5 star because you guys have true milk tea and banh mi is my favorite food. I will comeback and try milk tea again"}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. It was OK.   Summer rolls barely had any noodles and had zero pork in it! Called to talk to the manager, who denied making such a roll, and claimed more lettuce equals healthier roll...?! Just a disappointment. Not what other yelp photos or menu description showed.   Banh Mi was fine. Egg rolls were over cooked so they unfortunately were overwhelmed by oil flavor. Coconut dessert drink was fine too. Though we were told the Che Thai didn't have coconut milk (even though the menu says so??)   Overall, I would eat again if it was the most convenient option but definitely not my first choice in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim to get a sandwich to go. It was as amazing and so fresh. I did a double take when I saw the price. They could charge so much more but I'll take it! Stopped in a few days later on the way to airport just to get another sandwich!  Staff is friendly and place is clean!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"**A lot of the items on the menu contain pork so the pickings are slim if u don't eat pork** THE JALAPENOS ARE SLICED PERFECTLY~ thin enough to give your sandwich a light kick without overpowering the other flavors such as the cucumber & carrot. I arrived about 2:30~~ after the lunch rush hour. No line & the staff immediately waits on you. My wait time was roughly 8-10 minutes ~ I ordered the Bulgogi Nachos, The Bánh Mì Burger & a lychee infuses tea. The dining area is so freaking cute!!!! My food was EXCELLENT! Perfect sized burger & the fact that it wasn't greasy, sloppy & heavy allowed me to enjoy the entire sandwich without feeling \"stuffed\". I definitely recommend trying the nachos. Dee-freaking-lush-US!!!! It's the perfect size if ur alone BUT enough to share. I'm NOT a fan of Siracha BUT that Siracha ketchup paired well with the burger."}
{"text":"I love the milk teas with boba and the b-7 is so flavorful and hearty. I enjoy the decor as well as the customer service. If you can, call ahead and order and pick it up and go because the plaza only gives them 2 assigned parking spots unfortunately. I wonder if they deliver? Hmmmmm, that would be a plus especially with the limited parking."}
{"text":"Wonderful bang mi here. I ordered b9 pork and it was incredibly simple and flavorful. Impossible to beat that price, too! The sandwich is filling, but isn't going to make you feel Gross afterwords. Friendly staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian bahn mi and iVietnamese iced coffee.  Tofu was perfectly cooked and crispy and the veggies were fresh , mayo was good to balance everything.  Glad to have veggie option as I don't eat pork."}
{"text":"We are regulars and enjoy the service and food quality. The whole menu is delicious! We typically order the Thai tea or tarot bubble tea and sandwiches (roasted pork, Korean beef, or a traditional banh mi). All very good."}
{"text":"LOVE! first time having a banh mi  and bubble tea was here. I have had the traditional chicken one and the korean bbq one. Very filling, fresh, and nice little kick. I crave this place."}
{"text":"I love Bahn Mi and Tea! A couple \"annoyances\" won't keep me away, but I do look forward to seeing consistency improvements as I continue to dine here.  Dined in once and to go twice (in a 7 day period...lol).   I'm currently pregnant and opting out of pate- so I'm trying the fusions until I can try the traditional later! So far they are all amazing! My second Philly included some green pepper the first one didn't, both were great! The Korean was tasty- always made to order w/o cilantro. I order a black tea milk tea each time- with and without bubbles.   Today my non- bubble tea came with bubbles. They fixed this by pouring it into a new cup and replacing the volume lost with ice. I was disappointed but needed to leave for a meeting. My photo shows how a $4 beverage was mostly ice :(. The other two were not like this at all.  This time I also sought extra aoli (mayonase) but there is a $0.50 up charge for an extra swipe of mayo. They called to verify before making my order and I declined- very pleased that they called to check though!  It ended up not being needed, by I am still shocked at the fee. A small cup to go, I understand- nothing is free, but I'm unfamiliar with extra charges for heavy mayo on a sandwich.   Over all- so happy to have this restaurant in the steel creek area and will continue to visit- it's really good... I hope to see more value in my tea in the future and can't wait to try more from the menu!  I even had dreams about bahn mis after my first visit... I'm sure pregnancy related, but it clearly was impactful on my taste buds!"}
{"text":"Appearance is very welcoming ! We've gotten the Che Thai, fried calamari and a Green tea milk tea with boba pearls. Che Thai is refreshing and da bomb with coconut milk but overfilled with ice, fried calamari is $5 but little portion, Green milk tea was average but wasn't as sweet and boba was small. Overall! This place just opened so they have a lot of room to make progress and improve! I'm looking forward to it!  Good job!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I was craving a sandwich and I have never had Bahn Mi before and I picked the best place for my first time. I went for the Bánh Mì Thit Nuong and it was amazing!!!! So good can't wait to try all the other ones. I also ordered online"}
{"text":"Had the Korean Banh Mi and it was delicious!! The parking is a kind of a pain in the butt, so I parked in the 15min or less space for takeout. To my surprise, the sandwich was still fresh and the bread crisp after driving back to to office. I can't wait to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"First meal in Charlotte and what a treat!! This is a cute cafe style Vietnamese sandwich establishment. We tried the fruit infused tea made with greentea and lots of real fruit and basil seeds. So refreshing and delicious- an absolute try! We also tried their chicken satay and salmon banh mi which was also delicious and very well made."}
{"text":"We drive 20 minutes just to eat here. We got the tarp bubble tea and oolong milk tea. The taro bubble tea is the best I've ever had. You can choose small or large boba. I chose small just because I'd never had it before and i think it was the right choice. Delightful! I ordered the Korean Banh mi with bulgogi beef and it was so delicious. My husband ordered the marinated pork banh  mi and said it was good as well. Overall super delicious. We will totally be back."}
{"text":"Honestly me and a work buddy came here because Crispy Bahn Mi was closed on Monday so we rolled the dice.   What a hidden gem. It's an easy tie now, but you can't really compare as this places has their own flare. I ordered the Bahn Mi Special and the Green Tea Bubble Tea. The sandwich was amazing,  the house aoli was fire and a great compliment and the multiple pork deli meats reminded me of growing up in a polish community. The bubble tea was my first time trying milk tea and I was impressed.   The sandwich could have used a sprig more of cilantro and a couple more jalapeno slices to balance the flavor buy I'd order it again as is. The tea could have used a little more caffeine but was great. Beware as the \"bubbles\" are high in calories so that little shake-esque drink can add up to 1000+ calories.  Fire."}
{"text":"Met a colleague here for lunch the other week, and I found it pretty tasty.  I had never tried Banh Mi, so I was a little confused when I started looking through the menu.  But I ordered a pork sandwich and a spring roll appetizer to share.    Inside, the space is fairly small, with some tables directly across from the register that I would avoid if possible.  They blend tea drinks that are LOUD, but I didn't notice the seating around the corner on the way to the restrooms that are larger and shielded a bit more from the noise.    The spring rolls were brought out quickly, and the sheer size of them was a little intimidating.  They were huge, like a small salad wrapped in a rice paper.  The peanut dipping sauce made this a very delightful treat, that also felt healthy to eat!  Our sandwiches came out with a friendly smile from the employee.  They aren't giant, but the portion is more than enough.  Tasty, flavorful, and a refreshing change to your traditional ham & cheese sandwiches I am used to ordering.    Definitely not mind blowing, but a good meal that is more refreshing than your subway or firehouse, and is worth throwing into the rotation to keep things from getting boring at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! And the people there are too nice! I wish there was one in Rock Hill, SC where I live."}
{"text":"I called in an order and popped over during my work day to grab lunch. I will say when you order, instead of using the number/letter combos to order, just attempt pronouncing the menu items. When I came in to pick up my order of 1 banh mi and 1 Thai tea, turned out I was misheard over the phone and they made 2 banh mi (1 pork and 1 salmon) for me and no tea. It was all good, I bought both sandwiches and waited a moment for my tea to be made. Both sandwiches were affordable and delicious. Both sandwiches and a tea came to under $20. I would definitely come back again! The Thai tea was pretty sweet but the counter girl mentioned next time I can ask for less sweetener."}
{"text":"Excellent tofu bahn mi! I've had better summer rolls...they lacked herbs and had too much lettuce, not terrible though. Place is really clean and modern. Would like to try the fruit infused teas."}
{"text":"This is a new Banh mi place,  located in the Arsley shopping center off of South Tryon.  My coworkers and I wanted to try them out, so we were finally able to do so today.   Let's begin with the drinks, appetizer and desserts drink.   My nephew order the coffee green  milk tea. I got the Che Thai dessert and a fountain drink. My Che  Thai  was pretty good and the price was reasonable for what goes in. Fountain drink was over priced for the size of the cup.$2. My nephew however did not like his drink, nor did I. It taste like it was water down Coffee and no milk tea flavor. The eggroll seem kinda salt and really no flavor. I have had better ones. The eggrolls do have taro, which is similar to potatoes. We also go the summer rolls but no flavor in the meat that they use.   Now let get to the real reason we came, the banh mi. They have some interesting banh mi. So we all order different ones and shared them. We got the Korean, Philly cheese steak, and  the banh mi buger. I have to say the cheese steak and the banh mi buger were pretty good and was season well, while the Korean  needed a little more flavor. I was sad that the korean didn't come with Kimchi. But all in all the banh mi is good.   They are still new so hopefully once they get the hang of it everything will get better.  Parking is a pain, like they have no parking spots. So you will have to park and walk."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day with some co-workers and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is clean, bright, and inviting. The menu has a section for specialty drinks (milk tea, Thai tea, boba, etc.), Vietnamese dessert (che ba mau, che Thai, che banh lot, etc.), appetizers/sides, traditional banh mi, and fusion banh mi. They also have your standard fountain drinks.   I ordered the banh mi special ($5.50), nem nuong summer rolls (2 for $4), and che ba mau ($5.50) for dessert. All three were delicious. I highly recommend the nem nuong rolls here -- they do it right! :) My only complaint would be that the summer rolls can sometimes stick to the paper liner they are served on. The bread they use for the banh mi is excellent: soft but still has that great crunch. One other thing I like about this place is that the sandwiches are a good size. I have been to other places that use much smaller bread rolls, but this place uses the true banh-mi-sized bread.  Fair warning: they do put some jalapeno slices in the banh mi (most legit banh mi places do this), but I wanted to call it out in case there are people (or kids) who can't eat spicy food and may miss it in the ingredients listed. You can request to not have these put in.  My co-workers ordered the Korean banh mi ($7), spam and egg banh mi ($5.50 -- don't knock it 'til you've tried it!), and the satay chicken banh mi ($6).  There were nothing but positive comments at the table, and we have already decided we will be throwing this into our regular work-week lunch rotation. I will be back to try some of their other sandwiches and definitely their specialty drinks!  Update: their banh mi thit nuong ($5.50) is also delicious and Vietnamese iced coffee ($4.50) is nice and strong!"}
{"text":"I'm almost like a regular there now, love the environment and the food. The texture and the taste of the popcorn chicken is just right. I personally LOVE the fruit tea with passion fruit flavor!!!!!"}
{"text":"The name caught my attention while driving by in passing so i said to self oh heck, why not ? Surprisingly the service here was a1 from the time i walked in the door to the time i walked out. I ordered a chicken sub. It entailed jalapenos,cilantro,etc. The tea i ordered was definitely a winner.  Infused lychee tea that came with real live fruit bits mixed in. Needless to say although the sandwich was good i can see myself probably only coming back for the tea, the tea won me over i want to try more. I took my order to go. The employees came around with these big gigantic colorful straws asking what color would i like and im thinking to myself like why do i need this enormous straw but once i left and started sipping on that good tea i see why i needed it, so the actual fruit can swim right on thru the straw with the tea."}
