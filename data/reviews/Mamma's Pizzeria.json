{"text":"Best diner-style restaurant.  
Pizza is amazing.  Poutine out of this world.  Definitely will try the breakfast !!!"}
{"text":"Decent greasy spoon diner, but the last time I walked in there was a million fruit flies all over the first table I saw. Gross!"}
{"text":"I want to give 2.5 stars but I can't.

The Good: Their pizza is awesome.  They have a diner style menu but their pizza is one of the best I've had in Montreal.  Their poutine is ok, but the gravy is kind of sweet for me, I prefer a more pepper based gravy but it could be a Coke/Pepsi kind of thing.  Their fries are good!

The Bad:  Most of their staff smoke right outside the side of the place, and then go back in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why managers (who also smokes outside) let their staff do this.  Do they really think that all potential patrons trust that they'll wash their hands properly every time.  I've worked at restaurants and half the time, the smokers didn't wash their hands when they came back, especially if it was busy, or if they did, they just ran their hands over some water for a couple of seconds.  Proper hand washing etiquette is super important.  Most people only focus on the the palm of their hands but forget inside their fingers, their thumbs, and the back of their hands.  Anyway, it's gross.

It's not super expensive but it's a bit pricey.  They have a weird 10% off deal for McGill students only, but not for Concordia students.  The manager told me it was because most of his clients whom were students were from McGill.  I told him I was a Concordia student, showed him an ID, was promised a 10% discount and NEVER got one.  I did get a hilarious discount card, where after 9 purchases, you got a 10% discount. Buy 9, get 10% of the 10th.  My girlfriend and I wondered if it was a joke.

The side of the restaurant is not very clean.  The green bins smell heinous of rotten meat and fish, especially right before it's collected.  This, ironically, is where the staff choose to smoke.

Anyway, the food I had was delicious, but the hygiene thing and the strange discount policy rubbed me the wrong way.  They lost a lot of business because once I stop going somewhere, I don't talk poorly of a place, but I don't suggest it to anyone.  There are other places in the Plateau that have surely benefited greatly from my or my girlfriend's recommendations.  Sadly, we couldn't recommend Mamma's but if you're in the area and want a good pizza, this place has them.  Just make sure the cooks wash their hands."}
{"text":"Some restaurants will always hold a special place in your heart - or should I say arteries. Mamma's is not an experience to be missed, whether you're a native of Montreal or just visiting. It is part of the reason why many students pack on the Freshman 20, Boreal beer not-withstanding. Located in the Latin quarter, Mamma's Pizzeria is open until 3 a.m. and you can get burgers, steak subs, eggs and bacon or poutine. When I was a student at McGill, if you got 2 orders of poutine for take-out you got a third for free, so we were always trying to rally a third person at Closing time to feast at Mamma's with us. This place has been around for over four decades now, and if any of my friends are heading out to Montreal I tell them to stop here. It's just part of the Montreal experience you don't want to miss. Montreal gave me a horrible addiction to poutine I'm afraid I'll never shake. Cheese, fries and gravy?! Who knew?!"}
{"text":"Just a classic Montreal Italian diner. With booths and big windows looking out on grey avenue des Pins. Everything here today feels clean, the food is fresh and no fuss and the waitress is chill and feels like she's probably related to Mamma. There are a few tables of area regulars eating lasagne and pizza and fish and chips, but they serve breakfast till 3pm so my two eggs come out quick and with no judgement but with perfect golden potatoes crispy but not greazy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and a fresh slice of tomato and pineapple and some baked beans on the side. Simple and filling and fast. Plastic table mats and you pay at the counter and you're back running errands on lower Main in no time."}
{"text":"Small little side-street mom and pop restaurant. They had amazing lunch deals! ($10/plate) Sometimes it can be hard to find reasonable prices in the city. The service was great, the pizza was homemade, and the fries were extra-crispy. I would definitely come here again. Bookmarked, for sure."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, but this is one of the only places in Montreal that I not only had a bad experience at, but have actively boycotted.

I went here with a friend, ordered some poutine. For whatever reason to-go wasn't an option just then, so when we picked up the food and drinks from the counter ourselves we just ate it at one of the tables inside. Afterward, we weren't entirely sure whether to leave a tip (as we hadn't actually been 'served' by anyone), so we decided to just leave a modest tip in change on the table as we left.

A large older woman (ostensibly Mamma herself) chased us as we exited and literally THREW the change at us, apparently angry that we didn't tip enough for the privilege of serving ourselves.

(Poutine was fair-to-decent albeit overpriced, I suppose)"}
{"text":"Hidden and sooo good, the area is missing more mom and pops places, hands down the best pizza. It remind me a lot of Altos"}
{"text":"mamma's is a casual dine in/take out restaurant that serves pizza and typical american diner food with some canadian specialities mixed in. i'm talking about pizzaghetti and poutine, obviously! i stopped in to try mamma's italian poutine, which is vegetarian since it's topped with marinara instead of gravy. you have to specify that you want that sucker topped with cheese curds or else you'll get mozzarella (which is definitely not as exciting). we ordered sandwiches as well and while the food was good, it was nothing exceptional. the staff was extremely friendly though and i'd visit again just for that."}
