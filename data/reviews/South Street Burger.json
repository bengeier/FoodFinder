{"text":"Burnt, fully charcoal tasting patty, didn't offer to replace even when requested. Run by a bunch of sloppy kids who have no interest outside of goofing off"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back, it's worth trying once but if I'm buying a burger for $10 I expect it to be really good. Tasted like a burger I would make at home. It was a mediocre, average burger. I got the Hawaiian Burger, perhaps other burgers are more exceptional. Personally, I would have preferred to get a burger from Harvey's or Burger Priest."}
{"text":"Got some 2-for-1 coupons on hot dogs and burgers, so figured I'd give it a try.

This location near North York Centre is nice and spacious. Looks well-maintained, with interesting posters along the walls (along with an offer to \"order by fax\" which I assume they honour).

Their menu consists of burgers, fries, and hot dogs.
Burgers come with 4 oz or 6 oz options.

Hot dogs come with beef or pork options. Apparently they distinguish them with \"hot dog\" and \"sausage\", so initially I wasn't sure if they meant whether I wanted it to come in a bun or not.

All hot dogs and burgers are made-to-order, with 31 different toppings (including sauces) available to choose from, such as lettuce, pickles, pico de gallo, banana peppers, and so on. So while they're warming up your meat, you can figure how you want it served.

To my disappointment, everything seemed pretty small.
The beef hot dog came with a nice large sausage, but the pork hot dog came with what looked like the small sausages you'd get from the Loblaws next door.

Burgers were a bit better than the hot dogs, but again they were pretty small for a $10 burger. I guess the patties were denser because they definitely didn't have the size, but the patties themselves were pretty good. Personally, a bit greasier than I would like, but still alright.

It's pretty pricey for what you get, compared to other burger places where $10 can  get you a nice-sized portion."}
{"text":"WOW!!! this was a pleasant surprise! I wasnt expecting such a good burger at this big chain burger joint. 

I was expecting this to be those chain burger joints, where you can taste the burger patty as frozen ones like Hero Burger. But i was presently surprised this place actually had patties that tasted like they were made from real ground beef. I ordered the swiss and mushroom burger and it was amazing. They even have toppings like other gourmet burger joints like garlic mayo, guacamole, cayne pepper onions etc and of course the other regular toppings. The fries is NY Fries which made the poutine taste even better!

Service was good as i already ordered and they had already made my fries but changed my mind and wanted a poutine and they let me change it without giving me any trouble. The restaurant is really spacious an clean. And for a gourmet burger the price is really reasonable. I would def come back here again!!"}
{"text":"The New York Fries are what they are best known for.  I have yet to try any of the burgers as of yet."}
{"text":"I have been to the south street burger joint at Bayview and loved their veggie nachos burger.. So I decided to eat my birthday dinner meal at south street burger joint at sheppard n yonge - worst mistake! 

I went n asked for the same burger and when it came and i had the first bite, I didnt feel quite right about it.. So i asked the counter lady n she said it had beef pattie!!! I m a vegetarian n was aghast by it!! Though they replaced the burger but my bday evening got totally spoiled.. Plus the burger didn't taste good at all.. Bayview place makes it way better.

I dont think i m visiting it again."}
