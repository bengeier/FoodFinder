{"text":"What a wonderful donut shop. We came here early one morning to purchase donuts and breakfast sandwiches to bring to my dad's work. I was really surprised with the selection of breakfast items, and donuts alike. We went with the ham, egg, and cheese sandwich, which was SO good and filling. I really enjoyed it. We also got a dozen of assorted donuts and received many raving comments about how great they were. The prices were fair, the customer service was excellent- we had a great experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. I had a ham and cheese hoagie. Let me tell you it was so fresh the girl, Patty, sliced the meat and cheese after I ordered. The bun has got to be one of the best I have ever tasted. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts and terrific coffee! I usually get Butter Crunch or Strawberry Glazed donuts. They have expanded the food they offer so we'll have to try some of it. Love that they open at 5am!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Donut Connection coffee. I love all of the new stuff they're putting in they're much more than a donut store now.

The people who own and operate the Donut Connection are very interesting and provide fantastic customer service. I love talking to them. I hope they're here for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Honestly, not what I was expecting, but was pleasantly surprised! 

The guy behind the counter was really patient and let us try some donut holes while we decided on our order. My boyfriend and I each got the 'two donuts and coffee for $3.50' deal. 

The donuts were fantastic -- very light and had great flavor. Together we got two chocolate iced, a maple, and sugar. The sugar and maple were my favorites! He seemed to really like the chocolate.

The coffee was pretty standard for a gas station. It was on the stronger side though! The only thing I didn't like was that the caregiver added the milk and sugar for me, I would have preferred to do it myself. 

This place seemed to be a local favorite. There was an older woman sitting with her husband at a table and I swear she knew everyone that walked into the store. 

All in all, I had a good experience and wouldn't hesitate to visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I tried this Donut Connection after searching for close businesses that have donuts. I ordered a half dozen donuts and a coffee. The coffee was good, hot and nice flavor. We prefer cake donuts so that's what I ordered. They weren't the best we have had but did the trick for the fast easy breakfast this particular morning. My son's donut had a ton of sprinkles which he was excited about. The employee was very nice and friendly. He even gave us a couple munchkins for my son on the way out."}
