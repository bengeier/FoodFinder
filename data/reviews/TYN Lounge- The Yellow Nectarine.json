We went to TYN Lounge back in January on Thursday when they still had the saxophonist and the date night tasting menu. We chose the Sautéed Shrimp, Seared Chicken Breast, and Boneless Beef Rib Eye and ordered the Duck Confit Pizza on the side.

The Sautéed Shrimp was crisp, flavorful, and was decent size. The bread that came with the shrimp was very soft and garlicky. I didn't like the Chicken that much, it was rather bland. It's very moist though. I would definitely recommend the Rib Eye and the Duck Confit Pizza. The fresh greens on the Duck Confit Pizza make a huge difference. The Rib Eye was tender; the only thing I didn't like about the Rib Eye was the mashed potato. For me, it was too bland.

We finished the night off with molten cakes and ice cream. I really liked the dessert, would definitely go back just for the dessert.

The service was great that night, it was quite quiet when we initially arrived, but it started to pick up quite quickly.
I really enjoyed the atmosphere because there's a saxophonist that travels around the restaurant while you eat.

Overall, I really enjoyed TYN. 
Considering we went at the beginning of the year, hopefully everything is still just as good."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed about TYN is how cool the place feels inside. The design is clean and neat and open. Along with the soft blue light it has a classy feel to everything. I had a perfect Quinoa salad here that hit all the right vibes. It was very fresh and well presented, but a bit pricey at $14. It was a decent size. They make great martinis. At $8.50, they were reasonably priced. The service was good though a bit quiet. I guess I am used to bartenders who are a bit more engaging. All in all, it's a nice place. I'd take a date here!"}
{"text":"I think I visited on an off night.  They were quite busy and only had one server on the floor but several \"hosts\" that seemed to not be doing anything.  The server was new and didn't know anything about the menu and our order came out wrong and then a host approached us and made us feel like we were wrong.  We had to ask them to make it right - they seemed content to let us eat what was served not what we actually ordered.  It was a little odd.  It's a nice room but not sure I would go back.

Also, this is just a personal bug of mine but we were drinking (quite a bit as we were waiting for food and then waiting for correct food) and I asked for a glass of soda water on the side and was charged $2.50 and not offered a re-fill, the glass was just whisked away when I was finished.

Meh. I've expected better sums this up perfectly."}
{"text":"We went here last night on a double date and as a first time check in on 4square we earned 15% off.  Yay!  Of course we checked in here on yelp as well.  

When I walked in I realized I'd been to this venue close to a decade ago as another place... I don't remember the name, but I think it had karaoke and maybe had parrot in the name.  

Anyhow, as soon as I walked up to the door I remembered being there years ago and it being a typical pub type place with yellowish or cream walls and older brown wood accents.  Once I walked in I was met by bright white walls, black painted cement floor, and it was brightly lit.  It looked unfinished until after 10 when they cleared the tables off the soon to be dance floor and dimed the lights while adding mood lighting.  It turned night clubby after 10 or so apparently and had much better lighting.. it no longer looked unfinished.  

I ordered the grilled cheese that was a brie, tomato jam and prosciutto chunk of yummy!  It came with chips(or soup or salad) for an extra $2.  Seemed odd to me since usually one or two of those are usually offered with the meal at most places, but they were pretty good.  A little on the salty side for my liking, but a nice colourful side for sure.  They came with a caramelized onion dip that was really good and definitely added to the chips.  One thing I really liked upon researching the venue, once we set it as our destination for the night, was that everything is made onsite... even the ketchup.  My table mates enjoyed the burgers which they all appeared to enjoy. 
 
Our service was good.  The food came quickly, but it was not busy so I pretty much expected it would.  The water was refreshed fairly frequently and the waitress was on the ball for the most part.  Once we got our bill we had to ask for the 15% off which was originally confirmed upon our arrival and separate bills which took three attempts to get correct.  The price was decent for dinner for two with a couple drinks each at less than $40.

Overall we enjoyed our evening and spent an entire 3 hours there without realizing how quickly the time had passed.  I would definitely go back for a casual evening."}
{"text":"I still haven't been here for food yet but I have heard great things about their chef and how wonderful the items coming out of Tyn's kitchen really are. I do though know how fun Tyn can be on Saturday nights when two of the best hip hop DJ's Rick Cruz and Al V are on the ones and twos here. Vaulted ceilings, glowing white interior with contrasting, changing lights to create ambience, this place is dope to check out for some drinks and dancing. Come early cause there's usually always a long guest list and an even longer line."}
{"text":"Today I went to the Tyn Lounge for lunch and the short story, I was pretty happy.

The ambiance is very contemporary and modern.    I was quite surprised when I walked in, because it is very unassuming from the street.  Despite its lack of curb appeal, when you walk in, the transformation is surprising.

The menu is quiet varied and in my opinion, it is reasonably priced.  You would pay a similar amount for lunch or dinner at any surrounding restaurants.  The salads are in the $12-$14 range.

They had two sandwich specials and also a soup and salad special today (which I ordered and posted a picture so that you could check out the presentation).  

The soup was butternut squash.  It was well presented and very tasty.  However, maybe a touch on the sweet side for me.  However I still ate every last drop.

It also came with a grilled brie and prosciutto ham sandwich, which was delicious!  However, those are two of my favorite foods in between two pieces of bread.  I was one happy camper.

Also, they gave a small side with a slice of tomato, with some arugula that was tossed in a creamy balsamic dressing (I think... that's what it tasted like) and it was delicious as well.

I was very happy with the meal I received, and I got it all for $14.  What impressed me more than the food, was the presentation, ambiance and the portion size.  The portion wasn't huge, but I was completely satisfied at the end.  Had I gone somewhere else and received twice the food, I would have ate heavy and felt guilty.  This in my mind was the perfect lunch portion size.  I left with my lunch hunger perfectly satisfied.

Gentlemen, this is the perfect \"first date\" place.  Its not cheap, but its not expensive.  The ambience and presentation is impressive.  It looks like they are open for both lunch and dinner, but they are not open very late."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, TYN was another pub or restaurant that I had never been into. Then it closed, and this spot was under construction. It opened a few months back, but I hadn't had occasion to go in.

Last Friday I met a friend for lunch and I suggested we go here. We walked into a bright interior-white walls, dark furniture and high ceilings. We weren't quite sure whether we should seat ourselves or wait. There was a hostess desk at the front door, but no one really seemed to be in charge of that, so we sat ourselves.

The service met expectations. Our server checked on us regularly and polite and helpful. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I think it took us an hour total to have our lunch. I ordered the Chicken BLT (chicken breast on focaccia w/ bacon, lettuce tomato and roasted red pepper). A decent sized sandwich. You can substitute chips (literally chips, not potato wedges or fries, but they're made in-house) for soup of the day or a salad for an extra $2. That seemed a little out of place these days in Calgary. Most places I've been to lately give you the option of either of those three for the same price.

I wanted to order a specialty coffee, the the Mexitaly more specifically (Amaretto, Kahlua and black coffee), but I was told the machine hadn't come in yet. What machine? And why are these drinks on your menu if you can't serve them yet? That was a little disappointing. Instead I got coffee and Baileys... with the shot of Bailey's running me $6.75.

Anyway, it's an alright place if you need to grab some lunch. It would also probably work well if you've got a big group of people going out for a meal as there was one already seated at the back of the restaurant.

{"text":"Had a nice, romantic Valentine's Day dinner at The Yellow Nectarine. 
The service was good, the space is nice and the menu is well balanced.
The only downside is that the food is slightly bland.

Everything on the menu is descriptively delicious. What actually comes out, I find to be just a tad bit disappointing, comparatively. 

An example would be with the expectations one might have for a \"poutine.\" You would expect a dish with some crispy potatoes, either roasted or fried, right? What you get is a bowl of seemingly-boiled fingerlings. Not very textured, not very flavourful. 

Or if you order \"truffled mashed potatoes,\" you'll probably be playing a rousing game of \"Where's the truffle?\"

But the food is not \"bad\" by any means! It could just be a bit better.

One thing that really did stand out was an order of creme brulee that came with some house baked amaretti cookies. The creme brulee was really good and the cookies were, honestly, probably the best amaretti cookies I have ever had.

Lastly, I would like to comment on the decor. Everything has a nicely-designed \"upscale\" look to it. Everything is clean and modern ... 
HOWEVER ... the multi-coloured lights on the bar and against the walls are just flat out tacky. It makes me feel like a have sweaty glitter on me transferred from a seedy nightclub. 
I am sure the \"nightclub\" or \"late night bar\" feel is what the owners are looking for, but honestly, just use plain, white light (rather than fluorescent purple) and I am sure you will attract classier, less-tacky crowd."}
