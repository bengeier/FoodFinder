{"text":"SO happy I tried this place, just moved here from Chicago and have been dying for some good pizza. This was the 4th pizza place I tried in Little Italy and was definitely the best so far. I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"By far the worst service from any pizza place I have ever been to in my entire life. Pizza is good, but they suck ass."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent (the white pizza is better than the red) but don't expect anything better than mediocre customer service.  Nothing is ready when you get there to pick it up (has happened all four times I've gone to pick up) and when you call and they are \"busy\" they are pretty short with you on the phone.  I guess if they are \"busy\" they don't want any more business."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab pizza by the slice close to the Case campus. The cheese blends and sauces are really good. Their specialty pizzas are a little on the pricey end but it is well worth it. My favorite is their Hawaiin pizza, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes or at least doens't mind pineapple on a pizza. 
The staff is also super friendly here and if you eat in the bring your food to one of the few tables for you."}
{"text":"The customer service at this restaurant is terrible.  I am baffled that they are still in business.  The owner is extremely overwhelmed each and every time I attempt purchase food and he seems to be the only one working most of the time.  Honestly I have called to order food at least five times and every single time I have been put on hold for 10-20 minutes.  My husband and I laugh because this business is a HOT mess.  When have never actually been able to order food over the phone because they can't get their act together.  Additionally, we live close by so we have tried to walk there and order in person.  That hasn't been a success either.  The owner can only handle doing one thing at a time so if he is cooking, or whatever he does in the back, he doesn't come out to greet customers.  Honestly, you can stand there for 5 minutes and he doesn't acknowledge that you are there saying \"hello\".  

I have also tried to order gelato several times because they have a neon gelato sign in the window.  I was successful one time and it was great.  The nutella flavor was unreal, so good.  The problem it's usually broken because it gets too hot in the restaurant during the summer months.  Ironically, many people want something cold when it's hot outside.  It's a shame.  This guy can't seem to get it right.  

I have successfully ordered a pizza one time and never went back.  The dough is very yeasty.  Not worth the wait.  I would pass on this one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a pizza place for a date night in Little Italy, we came across this place. It was fantastic everyone was so nice . Food was really good and the customer service was great! Very happy. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We've had all the pizza in Little Italy and this one takes the prize. And they deliver! 

Sauce is delicious.  We asked for a tiny bit of cheese and they made it to perfection. Can't wait to order from them again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for the past four years of my college life. I probably spent about $500 total at this place during that time. They will not get a single cent from me from now on. I will not write the details yet. I am really mad at the moment. Excuse me. 

- The guy who bought the 20 pcs wings."}
{"text":"La Pizzeria's is disappointingly mediocre

The pizza is bland and average. Their other products are mostly good - great gelato and calzones and cheap 2-liters (I used them as a convenience store for beverages quite frequently). I tried their garlic bread once, and it was overpriced, small, and burned. Prices are the tiniest bit high.

The service is friendly and personable, though, and the interior is clean. I can't think of a place that is more exactly described by \"ok.\""}
{"text":"Rude on the telephone. Completely uncalled for attitude... the sub par food isn't worth how your treated."}
{"text":"?????pizza ????gelato???????????????????????????????????????????!"}
{"text":"Food is great and I'd probably give 5 stars except every time I call, they are either out of the food I want, take too long for delivery or closed when their web page says open.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Cute little place we stopped by for lunch with very nice employees. We saw the secret (that I'm not sharing) for their stuffed crust pizza."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. It makes me wish I lived in Cleveland. I recommend the garlic dough swirls too. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have to say- this is the only 'za I order in Little Italy. It's made with only fresh ingredients and they deliver unlike many other shops. I loved the hint of fresh rosemary I kept tasting. They just added a gluten free and stuffed crust option as well. I've tried the pasta with white and red sauce and everything tasted home made as well. My only critique would be the desserts are lacking a bit. But I guess it doesn't bother me, because I generally only order pizza- their specialty. Yes, you may get put on hold if they're busy- they're a small place but they do the most!"}
{"text":"I feel like being in Little Italy, this place HAS TO have good pizza. 

And they do. Gosh, the pizza was so perfect. I was craving some and a friend of mine goes there often and I felt like it was time I experienced this cute little shop. Definitely worth it. 

One complaint that's holding the last star back--my boyfriend got a calzone with chicken in it and they use frozen chicken (nothing wrong with that, if you ask me), but there were some slushy chicken bits in the middle. The Buffalo Chicken Calzone is new to the menu from what I understood, so maybe it's just a cook-time issue they need to get ironed out."}
{"text":"It's a small little pizza joint with a delicious meatballs and sauce.  You will lovee the family meatballs- with homemade marinara sauce on top of pasta :D ITS LIKE HAVING YOUR NONA'S MEATBALLS DURING PASTA FAMILY DINNERS 

The baked wings were a little disappointing.  It looks like the wings weren't flipped on the other side so one side was slightly soggy.  Skip the BBQ and Honey Mustard sauce- the BBQ sauce is glorified ketchup with cinnamon and apple cider vinegar.

The house specialty pizza is all right- the sauce is nothing too special, but the crust is delicious.  They need to put more sauce on the pizza and slice the olives so the olives don't overpower the rest of it.  

Their gelato flavors are pretty good, but vary day to day.  Some are hit or miss.  The best flavor is the lemon.

The menu is a little limited to just pizza, subs, pasta, and small amount of appetizers, but perfect if you are looking from some delicious pasta and gelato. It's disappointing that the pizza and wings were not that good.  

I'll give it another try again soon, but probably with subs and pasta instead of pizza."}
{"text":"Well things didn't even get in the right direction from the moment the phone was answered. Starts off with the receiver being picked up and the phone being placed on a table(hold) I'm guessing... So the receiver gets picked up and I ask lead time for a fairly large order to be delivered to the Crile building at the Cleveland Clinic. I was calling this order in at 10:30 am. I asked for clarification on delivery time and I was advised it was self explanatory... I said you know what, nevermind, he replied with \"ok good nevermind\" Needless to say the call ended at that point...."}
{"text":"This pizza is truly incredible. Fresh ingredients, thick slices and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Don't bother at lunch time. The food here is mostly really tasty. Some of the sandwiches aren't good but the pizza and some sandwiches are. The service is the real problem. There are never enough people and things take forever even for a pizza place. You get left on hold or not answered at all and ordering in is worse. For example, I walked in for a sub for lunch because it's nearby. There is one gentleman working and he tells me he will be with me in a second because he is busy. Ok that's fine it is lunch time. Fifteen minutes later he answers a pair of phone calls, puts them on hold and then asks what I want. I order a sandwich which is just toasted lunch meat and cheese on bread and he tells me it will be another thirty minutes even if he so generously puts me in front of the two call that came in after I arrived. I wish this was an isolated incident but it's often this way. With so many other options so close by I don't know how this level of service survives."}
{"text":"The only place opened on Memorial Day so I thought why not? Didn't look up the menu just called and ordered a large cheese. I go and pick it up and also get a bottle of pop (the 20oz). The total....$15. Fifteen dollars. I was in shock. The pizza is good (not great) but good. But not $15 good! I can go to Maxis and get a pizza with gourmet toppings for $16! Honestly, there is no reason for a large cheese pizza and a pop to be $15. Next time I'm going to Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Good crust. Mediocre ingredients.

Pizza is cheap, consistent, and quite tasty. It is the local go to, but nothing really special.
I would have otherwise given it a 4/5 if not for all the other great options around it (Valentino's and Vero Bistro). 
But this is of personal preference, there is certainly a crowd who I know will find La Pizzeria better than the above two I've mentioned.

I recommend the deluxe pizza which has pretty much everything good on it (with a heavy sprinkle of chilli flakes and parm) as well as their chicken parm sandwich. One thing to note - The pizza is WAYY better fresh out of the oven, the by-slices are meh..

What's more? La Pizzeria hires good looking people, so you can always have that to look forwards to when ordering. I can only speak for the beautiful ladies who work there, but I have heard from girl friends about their attractive male staff..

Anyway, La Pizzeria will certainly get more of my business for their consistent food, their distance from campus, and their value, I just wish they would bring back their gelato!"}
{"text":"Just. No. Mozzarella sticks tasted freezer burned and I think they were microwaved. They were dry and limp on the outside. On the flip side, the pizza was wet. Soggy and wet. Spinach isn't even really expensive and yet they use canned spinach (yuck!!!) and there was so much liquid from the sauce and the toppings that it dribbled everywhere when we took a bite. The crust was soggy and tasteless. Still struggling to find a decent casual pizza joint in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ive been in here dozens of times. I will concur Michael C's review. Its a nice place to go for a quick slice so long as you don't get stuck behind a family member or relative. Then the boss gets tied up chatting while you wait. Otherwise, decent place to go for an ok slice of pizza for a few bucks. The salads are pretty good. Very clean and great location.  Valentinos across the street has no bathroom or seating so LaPizzeria corners the market. Literally."}
{"text":"It was late December. A Saturday, to be exact. My coworker and I were hungry and had been talking about ordering a pizza for a few weeks now. \"Might as well be today that we pull the trigger,\" I thought. Working in the Little Italy / University Circle area has its advantages... So many great options for pizza... but therein lies the problem. \"What sounds good?\" I asked. Not that I expected him to make it easy, as he said the same thing he always does, \"Up to you, I'm fine with whatever.\" Thanks man, you're a real help... I'd never heard of La Pizzeria before, but I'm always up for an adventure, and from the reviews I read, my taste buds were going to need extra underwear after this flavor explosion. \"Large pepperoni and sausage for pickup, please!... 30 minutes?! Perfect!\"

The inside of the shop was small, but in a quaint hometown way.  The smell of fresh baked dough was a welcome addition, not to mention the empty gelato cooler, which reminded me of summer, and gave hope in a gloomy winter of returning in warmer weather for a tasty frozen treat. The man behind the counter looked rather familiar, and I realized it was the same face from the whimsical cartoon on the website; it's the owner himself! A one-man show of sorts. I thought, \"This has to be good.\" We chatted for a moment about the weather, and he pleasantly told me to be careful out there. Nice guy.

Back at the office, we cracked open the box, and the smell hit us like a freight train. It was like I stumbled upon a portal to old world Italy and I somehow knew Italian. \"Questa è la pizza più grande che abbia mai mangiato!\" I exclaimed. And boy was it. The crust was chewy, and crispy, and salty, and sweet, all at the same time. Like a vortex of contrasting ideas that oddly made sense. The sauce was perfection, and the toppings... I have no words. Sweet spicy pepperoni. Large chunks of crisp sausage. A single tear slid down my cheek as I grabbed a third slice.

If you're looking for quality, if you're in search of perfection, if you need adventure in your life, go to La Pizzeria. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I called to place an order for delivery. I was told up front the wait would be over an hour, which I did not mind. As I tried to place my order I was treated very rudely, and told that they were busy. He was obviously trying to get me to cancel my order, which worked."}
{"text":"BEST Chicken Parm in Little Italy"}
{"text":"Meatballs were great! Taco pizza was very good!! Very friendly service! Peach gelato was yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here when visiting from NY randomly because no other restaurants around were open at lunch time.  The girl at the counter was very nice and helpful.  I ordered wings and pizza. Both of which tasted fresh and exceeded my expectations.  I would surely recommend this place.  I would give 5 stars but the service was a little slow.  Took at least 30-40 minutes to get wings and a medium pizza.  While that does lend to making food fresh which is great (and much more preferable than sacrificing quality for time) I wish they could cut this down a little as that is a long time to wait for food.  On that day given the options available and not knowing the area it was worth the wait and I thoroughly enjoy it.  I think you will too."}
{"text":"I had a large house specialty.  It was delicious!  The ingredients were fresh; the chicken high-quality;; and the crust a perfect contrast of crisp and soft.  I was able to have three meals from it!  (Yes, it does taste good cold...)

The order taker was diligent, and the delivery person prompt and friendly.  I highly recommend La Pizzeria for sit-down or delivery."}
{"text":"After getting bad customer service at my neighborhood pizza place, I came across a mailer from La Pizzeria and decided to try it. I host classes and like to have some snacks for the students. I called and spoke with someone about delivering to my business which is just outside of their delivery area. They were accommodating and friendly. The pizzas arrived on time and were delicious! The white sauce is so yummy! 
They will be getting our business from now on which is about 3-4 pizzas, 2 times a week."}
{"text":"La Pizzeria is one of the few low-priced restaurants that are within walking distance to Case's campus.  I occasionally go to La Pizzeria to pick up lunch when I need a change from Qdoba or the University Hospitals cafeteria.  There isn't much seating inside the restaurant, although there are several outdoor tables set up during the summer.  The inside of the restaurant tends to get hot during the summer, so if you want to eat there during that time of year, you will probably want to sit outside. The restaurant has very good meatballs and both the House Specialty pizza (a white pizza with chicken, peppers, onions, artichokes, and olives) and House Specialty oven baked sub (a very well-stuffed Italian sub) are delicious. Their other pizzas are very good as well.  If you're a Case student looking for a reasonably priced meal close to campus, I would definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Pizza was below sub par, I mean we are in little Italy the least you can do is make a half way decent pizza. Cheese quality was awful (used the elasticity test) definitely frozen and not fresh cheese. Dough was equally below par. Ordered 3 different pizzas including taco, buffalo chicken, and plain cheese. Wasn't happy with a single one, also ordered the garlic knots, the theme continued with average at best quality, won't ever be coming here again."}
{"text":"Perhaps I was a little harsh...the food is good and the people are nice, they just need to update their website. Certainly the best food option in the immediate area and much better than Valentino's for pizza."}
{"text":"really good pizza... hot and just the right amount of greasy from the pepperoni! super friendly on the phone and the delivery person was really nice

we ordered a sheet pizza with pepperoni and two order of their garlic dough swirls total was under 30 bucks for a TON of food, good value compared to many places

a menu came with the delivery and I like what I am seeing, subs look real good... to bad we are only staying at the local Courtyard Marriott for one night!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good and definitely satisfied my pizza craving, however it was so small for what I paid for. You get a limited option of toppings and it the large pizza just was not enough for the group of four I went with. Probably would try another place next time. Didn't get that Italian, \"authentic\" taste I expected."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken parm, perfectly cooked and with fresh chicken breast and sauce...some of the best I've had.  Service is friendly but I wish they had more seating on crowded days. Overall great spot for pizza and subs near Case."}
{"text":"Their pizza is not bad if you can ever actually get someone to take your order. I can't think of a time I called them and was not put on hold for more than 5 minutes and most of the time I have to call back if I want to ever talk to a person again, but usually I just call another place. It's like they don't even care about getting your business.

Update: still put on hold for a very long time every time I call. Now I just hang up and call somewhere that actually wants my business. So I never get food from here anymore."}
{"text":"Well, I tried again and still not too impressed. This time I ordered early and to-go. A simple cheese calzone. And it was good! But not the best I have ever had and very very heavy. Lots of oil/greese and the cheese wasn't really part of the calzone since as soon as you took one bite it fell out. The crust was just really really hard and overall the cheese mixture was kind of strange in texture and followed through with the taste. 

But it's Little Italy, I'm sure I'll find pizza somewhere."}
{"text":"I like to come here once a week to enjoy lunch with two of my hospital colleagues. We don't order pizza, but the menu items we enjoy for lunch are reasonably priced and have always been served hot and fresh.

My favorite lunch item is penne pasta with marinara. It comes with a decent portion of pasta, house salad, and a generous order of garlic bread with mozzarella. That's about 8 bucks and I'm full when I leave. I've also had the barbecue chicken sub as well as the chicken and broccoli calzone. All three are tasty and filling enough for me.

There are, maybe, four tables in the place, so dining-in won't be for everyone. We have often arrived to find local Italians (some we know) in there having animated, boisterous conversation while eating, adding to the charm of being in Little Italy.

The three of us like the owner a lot, though most times he is very busy and often works solo. He could definitely use some reliable, competent help to keep up with demand, but our experience at lunchtime has always been good. It's a reliable place for us to have an enjoyable, relaxing meal away from the rigors of our work"}
{"text":"The Pizzaria is off the beaten path in Little Italy but it's worth the walk.  Their food is all well priced and their sandwiches and pizza's are great.  

I especially love La Pizzaria because of the service.  I often order catering from them and they quickly learned my name and will bend over backwards for me.  Once we had a small error in an order and they immediately fixed it and over-compensated me for it.  That's what I like to see in a catering company.  Many companies like to lay blame on others (me, drivers, the girl at the front desk), but La Pizzaria takes ownership.  Not to say that they often make errors, it was just the once and I've ordered from them countless times.  I just appreciate the honesty and the customer service."}
{"text":"We only stopped in here to get some gelato, but it is now my mission to try their pizza because it looked yummy!! The gelato was good but according to my Italian relatives it wasn't quite what you get in Italy. I can't comment on true Italian gelato but I'm inclined to believe what they told me!"}
