{"text":"Like the first reviewer, I was ecstatic to see another purveyor of vegan food on the East Side. I decided to drop by on a Friday morning, not knowing their hours. They weren't open, but luckily one of the owners was near the door when I walked up, and she kindly let me in (she said she has been letting people in when she has been there while the store hasn't been open because their hours are a bit limited right now). The store is run by an incredibly friendly mother-daughter team. They gave me free samples while I was in the store (some delightful pretzel-chocolate concoction, a coffee-flavored chocolate, and a sample of their cookie dough truffles). They make light and white chocolate in addition to the traditional dark chocolate, so some nice options. I decided to get a vegan brownie dipped in chocolate and some of the cookie dough truffles, both of which were delicious! The owners even threw in some free white chocolate-covered blueberries, which were also very tasty. The owners said they would also like to serve vegan soups and salads in the future, so keep an eye out for that. I would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"They deserve 10 stars!!! So glad to pay a visit to No Whey today. My daughter found them doing an Internet search. It was well worth the 1/2 drive. The owners and family are truly wonderful people. They had a wonderful selection of vegan products we hadn't seen before. Not to mention the wonderful chocolate. We will be going back on a regular basis. Thank you so much ."}
{"text":"A friend and I wandered in while waiting for my favorite Thai restaurant to open next door (Bangkok Thai in case you're wondering). The owner is very friendly and knowledgeable and when asked about several items instead of just describing them she gave us samples. There are some very unique food items (coconut bacon crumbles) in addition to some Whole Foods usual suspects (Daiya vegan cheese). They offer a vegan soft serve which tasted remarkably non vegan which I would definitely get in place of a custard or ice cream. This place could really take off considering all of the food allergies/sensitivities in today's world.   I have 2 small suggestions:  1)merchandise the items in a bit more visually appealing fashion. The chocolates in the fridge were very hard to see since there was no lighting in the fridge. Perhaps add some lighting in the fridge and some nice containers that are labeled describing what each chocolate is.    2) streamline the brand a bit more. The sign on the outside of the building says Snaction yet it is listed here on yelp as No Whey Chocolates. I think this could be very confusing to future customers.   All in all would definitely go back, the owner is passionate about what she does and that definitely shows!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to stop by No Whey for awhile now, finally got the chance a few weeks ago and I'm glad we did. One of the best parts of the store are Ethel and Stacy, the owner and her mom. Such genuinely nice people, they made us feel at home right away, offering us samples and showing genuine interest in us. They have a decent selection of vegan offerings, their vegan jerky prices are BETTER THAN AMAZON!  The chocolates were good, my boyfriend really enjoyed them. We both really liked the ice cream, smooth and creamy and vegan to boot!  We've already stopped there 3 times in the past few weeks and I know I need to stop to get some stocking stuffers for the boyfriend. Definitely a place to go!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time to get my pico de gallo bean chips, hemp seeds for my salads and smoothies, and delicious chocolates. Aside from vegan grocery items that you can't get anywhere else, it's fun just to go and chat with the ladies who run the place. And now they have soft serve! This is a gem on the East side!"}
{"text":"I was excited to notice a new shop in my hood the other day while out for a run - No Whey! Vegan Chocolate Candies, a vegan candy store. It's less than a mile from my house, and, ironically, across the street from a huge non-vegan candy store. (and in the same crazy little strip plaza as my favorite Thai restaurant - Bangkok Thai)  They just opened and have some crazy hours - 4:00-9:00 pm Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. (and it still looks a little like the Chinese restaurant that was in the same spot for years and years and years) My boyfriend and I dropped in on a rainy Tuesday night and we were the only customers for quite awhile. There was a huge tray of samples (hello, dark chocolate and cranberry bark!) and a small selection of candies and vegan goods on the sales floor. They feature a lot of products from Plant Kingdom, a local-ish energy bar/hemp bar creator.  We chatted it up with one of the owners for awhile and you can tell they're really just starting to get the swing of things with their business. (but at least they take credit cards! yay, Square!) They hope to expand their product line and carry other vegan products as time passes/revenue increases. As of right now you can buy some Leahey products (as seen in my photo above), vegan marshmallows, Daiya cheese, and a few other vegan goods. It's a great start, honestly. I really think the sky's the limit for a vegan business in Cleveland...now if only I could get the capital to start my own vegan cafe/juice bar..."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is no longer in business.  I called before going during \"normal\" business hours and the phone rang and rang then trans to a generic voice mail."}
{"text":"No Whey is AWESOME! How did I not know this place existed??? We were out on the east side yesterday and thought we would check to see if the store was open -  wasn't sure on the hours. (They appear to be open Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday evenings, and Saturdays from 1-9.) It is not easy to find - I was looking for a No Whey sign, but over the storefront in large letters is \"SNACTION\" something or other.   The store features some random vegan items (like grocery-type items), snack foods, pre-made meals, etc. but it seems like the star of the show would be the chocolate treats. The owner said she was pretty picked over for the day, but I easily found sugary treasures to take home - vegan s'mores in a three-pack and a vegan chocolate-dipped brownie. HEAVEN, people. My husband (a non-vegan) took one bite of that brownie and said, \"this does not taste vegan at all\" - it was like a classier Hostess cake - soft brownie on the inside and a soft chocolate coating on the outside. A few chocolate chips on the top rounded it out. I want another one just writing this review. The s'mores were also incredibly delicious.   Whether you're vegan, dairy-free, or just looking to try something different, I highly recommend the treats at No Whey. I haven't eaten many sweets since going vegan, but this was such a great treat I will definitely return to try some other items.   Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Really annoyed.. Just drove out all the way from mentor just to visit and it's closed. Hours say it opens at 12 so I'm really confused."}
{"text":"Oh thank you No Whey! I have searched for so long for decent vegan chocolates and now I've finally found you. I tried the S'mores -- beautiful milk chocolate taste -- and not a single cow was harmed in its production. I also sampled the chocolate-vanilla swirl soft serve -- and seriously -- I have never had soft serve that good -- thick and custardy! I so wish you were closer to home as I'd stop in every day."}
{"text":"I live close to ' No Whey' and I am constantly visiting this store. They make excellent Vegan Chocolate and Bakery! They sell more than Candy and Bakery. I really enjoyed the Vegan Jerky, Marshmallows and Popsicles they sell. The owners could not be any nicer; they offer you samples to taste most of their products before you buy. Recently they made us a giant Vegan Peanut Butter Cup and decorated it for a Birthday Party. It was excellent! If you have any interest in Vegan Foods, do your self a favor and check out \"No Whey'"}
