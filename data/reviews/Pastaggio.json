{"text":"Nice, quiet place. Calamari appetizer was great. We had the veal parm and Chicken mushroom both 5 *. Place is clean and staff is very nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I agree that this is one of the best Italian restaurants we have been to. The pasta is always fresh and perfectly cooked, the staff is friendly and the prices are great."}
{"text":"canada's day on the patio out front was perfect!  the food is amazing for this town. defiantly a nice change from the regular restaurants around town. the staff are friendly and there is a nice atmosphere. food is a little expensive but worth every penny"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick  bite of lunch, on a weekday with a colleague, really wanted a sit down rather than a fast food pickup.  The place looks newly renovated, nice decor, huge space and we were the only table inside.  You can tell it's a family  owned establishment, there looked to be relatives or close friends with teenage kids sitting in front outside just hanging around smoking, talking, not eating. Assuming we were served by either the owner or wife, or again maybe close family member, she was probably the most casually dressed waitress/server I've ever had.  Flip flops and strappy tank top as server attire just did not fit in with the otherwise updated  refined decor.  Service was not particularly friendly or warm considering there were so many family like members loitering around the place, felt  a bit unwelcoming like we were the ones out of place.  Food looked better than it tasted, was expecting home cooked recipe goodness, but instead everything with sauce was bland and most of the food came out barely warm.  Maybe we came on the wrong day, but it feels like the owners are just a little too comfortable already and care less about making a good impression on new diners.  Yelling orders and comments to your kitchen from the front  when there are  swinging doors dividing  the front and back, is just too distracting for your diners when we are trying to have a conversation at the table."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Been there a few times and try something different every time and am never disappointed. Had the mushroom chicken, stuffed pepper (a special), blue cheese calamari (also a special), and boccancini balls. All great! And my friends have tried other things and loved them. Reasonable prices for a nice dinner out and we love the patio!"}
{"text":"True disappointment for an Italian restaurant. Pasta were no where close to being Al dente and sauce was really watered down."}
{"text":"Horrible...just bad. Ill keep this short..because this place does NOT deserve any sort of recognition!! I ordered the chicken parm, and my friend the steak. My chicken parm tasted like frozen food that had been microwaved, topped with tomato canned sauce and cheese. My friends steak tasted like it was cooked by a poorly, run down steak joint (in some cases, those probably tasted better). I have never been soo disappointed with food, mainly because I am  not picky at all!! To top it all off, the food had no appeal what so ever, horrible presentation, it was soggy with tomato sauce which was drenched all over the plate.
The lady who served us, long curly black hair'd, was polite at the start, but once we paid for our bill, my friend was finishing his glass of wine..and she kept coming up to us and asking if theres anything we'd like..and one may think she was being genuinely polite..but she was just rushing us out to get out..not like we were taking up any seats since the place was dead! 
Did not expect this from a place that is clearly over priced for its food, and service.
DO NOT GO!! WASTE OF MONEY & TASTE BUDS."}
{"text":"Spending the day in W-S recently, I walked up and down Main Street, popping in and out of stores, and restaurants seeing what the locals were saying and what offerings tempted my taste buds. 

As the days heat beat me down, and my hunger reached unnatural levels I stumbled upon a beautiful brick enclosed patio within eyesight of the GO Station. I'd seen this building when Google Earth creeping the town and figured I would make this one last stop in before deciding where to eat. 

Pastaggio has been in this location for several years, however the local Italian family that owns and operates Pastaggio has been serving delicious eats to the Markham-Stouffville area for over 15 years. With mamma working in back cooking all the meals, and the rest of the family working together to keep the front of house humming, you can feel the sense of 'family\" from the moment you walk in. 

While the exterior might lead you to believe that Pastaggio might be a touch dated because of the historical look of the building, you'll be pleasantly surprised to discover that the interior is modern and classically decorated. Perfect for a romantic dinner for 2, Lunch/Dinner with a group of friends, or just to stop in for a quick espresso at the bar. 

I opted to sit inside to seek refuge from the day's heat and started to look through the menu - delicious! As you all may know, I'm not one to go out for Italian food as I can usually make most items myself at home. That being said, the menu here was tempting enough to have me coming back, and soon!

Not wanting pizza or pasta, I inquired if they were doing anything special that day for lunch, and without skipping a beat my server told me about their delicious veal burger. Made specially for them, it's 100% ground veal chuck (no beef - meaning it's similar to a meat ball in taste), served with my choice of traditional paninni toppings.

This sounded right up my alley and paired with my choice of side salad (all for $10.95 + cost of toppings) I was sold. My Veal burger arrived shortly there after topped with Italian hot peppers, Rapinni, Provolone Cheese and Mushrooms! 

It was unbelievable! A totally different taste then a typical burger and with the topping selection I didn't require any traditional burger toppings (ketchup, mustard, etc) - and man oh man... those hot peppers, WOW!! Hot and Amazing.

I'm excited to return to Pastaggio in future and sample more of their menu, in fact when the staff were huddled around a near by table eating freshly made meatballs like they'd never seen them before, I took note that they MUST be that good!

Thanks Pastaggio and Staff!

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks on a Friday night - lots of wait staff around - friendly service. Decor is modern and the place is clean. Nice big patio out front and parking on the street or in the back.
Only had cocktails but will return to sample the menu."}
{"text":"Had a last minute reso on Valentines Day with the Mrs. We've passed by this place all the time and Italian is her favorite. The place wasn't too busy but 530pm is not really the prime dinner rush. In any case, service was prompt, attentive and friendly during our stay. Atmosphere may have been on the bright side with the music a notch or two too loud but I liked the family and very kid friendly feel & not so much the romantic/pretentious vibe. As for the food, I really enjoyed my wifes Penne Pesto which had a robust flavour to it and was quite filling. My Pasta Ariabiata, however, was really lacking the bold and robust profile I've had in other places along with the spice and meek offering of sausage.  Though we were in and out in just under an hour, any alone time, esp to break bread, with my beautiful wife is always a good time. Would try again, during the summer, out on their Main St. patio."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place with really good food and wine. It wasn't too busy but he service was excellent and very attentive!  I would definitely come back to this restaurant if I'm back in This area of Canada!!!!"}
{"text":"Driving through Main Street, not a lot to choose from, so decided to go with the only Italian restaurant.  Exterior looked nice and they have a patio.  There was a big sign draped access the front advertising specials, which is usually not a good sign for a restaurant like this, but I won't use it against them.  Interior was surprisingly modern, looks like they had a makeover recently.

There was only one other group, so the waitress greeted me right away and told me to sit where I like.  I was then provided with good service from there on in.

Menu is what you would expect, typical Americanized Italian food.  Ordered the house red which was brought in a carafe right away. Then ordered the veal parm since that should be difficult to screw up.

This was where I was a little disappointed.  It looked much better than it tasted.  Spaghetti had this chewy texture to it.  Sauce was very bland, except for the over salting.  Looked like it was from a store bought jar, lots of dried herbs that were not cooked through enough.  Veal was soggy, and chewy and the breading not crispy.  I would guess they breaded it and then froze it first.

I give it 2, but only because the wait staff and presentation was good."}
{"text":"There aren't too many restaurants in Stouffville, but on one main street, this one is a gem.
Been here a couple times, why do I come here? It's tasty, not too pricey, usually has seats and is not empty.

The only bad part is if you try to park in the back, more often than not there won't be any and you have to back all the way out because there isn't enough space to maneuver a turn. Do yourself a favor, park at the GO station across the street or on the street.

As for the food, I usually get the fried calamari, always standard fare.
I've had the spaghetti and meatballs. You only get two meatballs, but they are big meatballs. For $15, it's decent price.

I've also had the veal parmigiana, it was one huge piece of veal. For $17, it's a steal.

When I'm looking for a place to eat out with family in Stouffville, this place is always on my list."}
{"text":"Went for lunch party of 4.  Food was bland and very oily.   Rapini was done very well but everything else lacked flavor.   Server was friendly but they all appeared more concerned with their personal lives than with the guests which was only our table."}
{"text":"Got take out order and The chicken parm was so salty I could barely eat it. The vodka pasta was very bland and way too salty too. Been to this place twice. I'm done."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by this place on a weekday for dinner. We were very warmly welcomed. The staff was very nice! 
We tried the zucchini fritters, which were just divine and fluffy, and the bocconcini balls, which were done really well. 
They were very willing to make some small substitutions and I had the seafood pasta and it was flavoured well."}
