{"text":"My friends and I were here in June and they were packed ~ the table wait time was 5 minutes.  Our server was friendly and knowledgable, food is good but it's the dessert that I enjoyed the most.  Price range is very affordable for the food and service that they deliver.  Must place to see!"}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas and I'd say I eat sushi all over the city about 5 times a month. I frickin love sushi! This place is pretty yummy. They have really good service. Very friendly. ABSOLUTELY LOVE their vibe the place gives off. Hawaiian music, very chill and gets pretty busy at night too.  As far as fish goes ORDER THE 808 TUNA SALAD! Really tasty.  If youre comming here for all you can eat, I dont really recommend here. I was turned off when I found out they give time limits and only cetain sushi for it. So I'd rather go to Sushi Factory on Eastern. DONT GO TO THE ONE ON TROPICANA, its gross there.   Also they have a conjointed hawaiian food place. Awesome malasadas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  We used to frequent when they were located downtown Vegas.  We were saddened to hear that they had moved.  On our last drive from CA to CO we decided to stop at the new location and we are sooooo glad we did.  The food here is amazing.  Everything was delicious - short ribs, Portuguese sausage, Teriyaki chicken and Garlic chicken.  And very reasonably priced.  Looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"The fried noodles and the garlic chicken are my favorites. Sometimes I hate to go in there because I know I am going to spend $60 plus on poke!"}
{"text":"I recommended this restaurant to my friends, because I've had a good experience at this place. we sat down for dinner at 7:15 and the restaurant wasn't real busy for a Sunday night. We placed our original order (All You Can Eat) and  waited 20 minutes or so to receive it. Half of our order was brought out and watched as people came in after us starting receiving food we initially ordered. We asked the waiter but he didn't seem to care & never brought us the rest of our food. One person in our party received two items he ordered and that was it. We spoke to the Manager (Jesus) about the horrible service and he offered a 10% discount off ONE dinner, what an insult to us. I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for good food and service. why would you insult your customer, instead of making it right and fixing the situation. There are many good restaurants to choose, why pick one that doesn't understand the value of customer service."}
{"text":"Looked like a \"Deli\" at the front door, but, went there for the FOOOOD...not the loooooks.!! The food was the \"GREATEST\" sevice was the best, and It was friendlier than being at Grandmas house !!!! The ; Dragon, the Tiger, can't be beat ! I've lived in this town for 45yrs and have eaten at most Gormet rooms , but the FOOOD here was over the TOP ... Enjoyed it very much, will for sure go again."}
{"text":"That is correct. That was the first time I personally had to wait, but once in... all was forgiven. My go to Sushi is always the Caterpillar roll."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10 years and something has changed. Horrible service, ordered ribs 3 separate times and never got them, had to constantly chase down the waitress, never refilled drinks.  This place was great but now is a total dump."}
{"text":"Still waiting for the quality of the food, but this is based solely off of the extremely rude woman with the piercing on her cheek taking our order at the cash register. Ive never had a person taking my order literally ignore me while she continues a convo with her coworker. Then, rolled her eyes at my boyfriend, and as we tried to say, \"Thank you\" she ignored us and contunued talking to her coworker...what a horrible feeling. TIME TO LEARN CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. We just left, we couldnt stand her or the other employees vibes.  The cooks however, need a rasie!!! Seriously though, the food was excellent. The katsu chicken and teriaki chicken fried noodles were to die for!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood, yummy sushi, bomb service!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My favorite local Sushi place magically disappeared recently and I have been looking for a replacement for \"All You Can Eat\" sushi. I have been to a lot of different sushi places in town and find Island to be quite good.  The wait wasn't bad, the staff was great and the food selection/flavor was right where I needed it to be. I will definitely be frequenting this place in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over several years.  It's Hawaiian themed and some of the food has Hawaiian flare.  I go with a group of people and get the All You Can Eat Sushi.  The Ahi Poke is very good.  They have a good variety and the food is real good.  Desert is also included with the AYCE.  The wait can be long and the service is slow since they seem to be on Hawaiian time."}
{"text":"This place sucks after waiting to be seated which took 10 minutes standing there with the workers standing around. We left. I don't care if they have the best good on the planet. Making us stand there while the watched was B'S. I would never go back there and I would not recommend going there."}
{"text":"The Poke is very good! All you can eat sushi. Fish is very good. You can also get all you can drink saki for an extra $8.00. I recommend this place for good Poki and good all you can eat sushi menu."}
{"text":"Island sushi  is the best , great customer service , best place for eat all you can sushi"}
{"text":"Island Sushi is my favorite sushi joint around... The food is excellent the atmosphere is fantastic and the sushi bar is a great place for fantastic food and a cheerful atmosphere... My favorite place to go and get down on some all-you-can-eat"}
{"text":"We had an avocado cucumber roll, mochiko chicken and spicy tuna poke bowl. Topped off with a 6 pack of filled malassadas. So ono. Plus a free drink:) check in and take a photo."}
{"text":"Service  is soo slow food was mediocre at best! I don't know why this place has 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is a great secret.  For all of you who want to experience the best \"buffet\" in Vegas of sorts, come here.  It's an ayce sushi menu out of this world.  The selection is amazing and the fish is super fresh, and will never have a fishy smell to it.   One suggestion is to try out the poke..good stuff..when we are in Vegas we will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Wow, my favorite AYCE sushi in Vegas! I've been a bunch: Sushi Mon, Hikari, Oyshi and Island Sushi THEE BEST.  I love the AYCE menu. Had all the specialty rolls, nigiri, and all kinds of appetizers. I was pretty excited to see they had ahi poke, tako poke, raw crab poke, ahi belly even garlic chicken and mochiko chicken!! The nigiri had a big piece of raw fish over a small little nugget of rice (How sushi SHOULD be!)  Their plate lunches are winnahz too! I've gotten their saba and laulau plate before. They also have these bentos that come with choice of garlic or mochiko chicken and comes with garlic ahi, spam, rice and fried noodles!! All for $8. That beats Zippy's zip & surf pac anyday!! They also have a small bakery that has coco puffs and malasadas.  Definitely one of da best local places to eat in the valley!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Poke is so good here.  Really impressed with how fresh the fish is and perfect with the Maui onions.  Teriyaki chicken is delicious, nice flavor and the offer brown rice (and Mac salad!)."}
{"text":"My kids and I have dined here for years but after today's experience i don't know if we'll be going back. I ordered food via Postmates (mochico chicken, chicken Katsu and fried noodles) and the mochiko chicken was so burnt and hard. So very disappointed. With other local options nearby it's a shame that the food wasn't of the greatest quality"}
{"text":"I love sushi! We ordered \"Salmon lovers\" and \"ahi poke\". Taste was good on both orders:) I will come back for sure. Thanks to the yelp!"}
{"text":"Always here for the Sunday brunch. Every Sunday they have AYCE brunch which also includes the AYCE lunch menu. The staff is always really cool and of course the food is soooo good !"}
{"text":"Yelpers had many good things to say about this place, so I decided to give it a try.  The restaurant decor is simple and clean. I appreciated the digital frames at tables near wall that flashed photos of food and patrons.  Servers were friendly but we were neglected as soon as it got busy and they forgot a few things we ordered. This maybe a problem for people since there is a 90min limit on AYCE sushi.     Now for the food:  Ahi Poke, 5 Star Fresh tasting with good color.   Garlic Chicken, 5 Star Juicy and flavorful.   Macaroni Salad, 1 Star It was too salty and eggy for my taste.  Fried Oysters, 2.5 Star On the burnt side losing the taste of the oyster. See my pic.  Sushi (Variety), 2.5 Star The taste and fresh color of the fish was not there, the presentation looked slapped together, rushed and mushy. Blah.  808 Special, 2.5 Star Nothing too special about a fried banana, vanilla ice cream, whip cream. It was just bland.  Malasada Sundae, 2.5 Star The malasada tasted old and hard. Vanilla ice cream and whip cream didn't do anything for it, either. Bland.  The drinks were on the bigger side which does not merit stars but definitely appreciated.    I don't have a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! The all-you-can-eat is reasonably priced and the rolls are excellent. I highly recommend starting off with a spicy tuna hand roll or two; the spicy tuna is like no other. Alaska roll is also recommended, and of course try to save some room for dessert! The 808 special - fried bananas, ice cream, strawberry slices, whipped cream, chocolate syrup - the perfect end to the best (and biggest) meal you'll have for a week."}
{"text":"worst service ever! first time i was here they made us wait 20mins for 6pk malasadas while staff are just chatting at the counter, not rushing to make our order. second time tonight, made us wait for 1/2lbs ahi poke and malasadas only to get our orders wrong for a bowl of ahi and rice after 30mins! so frustrating! u badly need to improve your fucked up service!"}
{"text":"Their crunch is AMAZING! And thei dragon roll is even better. I love this place for my Dojo and I. You have to go and you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I saw all the good reviews and decided to try this place out. I went for happy hour and thank God I did! Because this place is NOT WORTH paying full price for sushi. The sushi is okay...I've had wayyy better at other places.. i ordered the mt Charleston, lava lover, and the spider roll. All of it was ehh. The sushi is small and the spider roll that i order had a really strong fishy taste to it which is not normal. So that really brought it down another star.  Service was not good at all. There were only two sushi chefs and not alot of people, it took forever for the sushi to come out. The waitresses didn't even come by once to fill our water or anything.   If you want better sushi and don't mind paying a little more go to sushimon! Taste is ALOTT FRESHER! &&& Better service! =))"}
{"text":"Best place ever for ahi poke and sushi among other things! Like the all you can eat for $25! Garlic chicken and beef teriyaki are the best ever! We take our fam and friends from out of town there always! Definitely give it 2 thumbs up for the food, desserts and definitely the best customer service! One thing I suggest is calling and making reservations cuz they are busy!"}
{"text":"In town for Memorial Day weekend and had to drop in to Island Sushi for the Sunday Pupu brunch. Everything I had was well prepared and tasted delicious. Started with Cali roll, rainbow roll, miso soup and then got serious with Teri beef, loco moco, ahi poke bowl and wrapped it up with two mini banana pancakes with chocolate chips and guava syrup, mini creme brûlée, malassada breakfast sandwich and banana tempura. This was a great AYCE experience! I really was impressed by every dish...banana pancakes and the rainbow roll were my favorites. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I saw all these reviews and decided to give this place a try. I just ordered $80 worth of sushi from them and couldn't be more disappointed. The sushi was so bland! To top it off, I had asked for spicy mayo (enough for 5 rolls) because we hate soy sauce. They gave us a small side enough for one roll. Pretty much my $80 went down the drain and the sushi went in the trash."}
{"text":"Great sushi items. I didnt have to wait long and the price was reasonable.  I like the location and prefer sitting by the belly up bar area.  Great staff and friendly service.  Good parking when we arrived but it was packed when we were leaving.    Ive been to other sushi places and I prefer this one over the others. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Great sushi and nice environment. Takes me back to the islands"}
{"text":"Wow the loco moco was so yummy and perfect on a cold day. Best local eatery for island food."}
{"text":"Barely an upgrade from store bought sushi, the restaurant seemed dirty in general. I would never go again or recommend"}
{"text":"We've been here for both their poke bowls and AYCE sushi. Their poke bowls are pretty yummy and healthy. AYCE option is great too. Lots of variety with fresh seafood. And the best part of AYCE?? You get TWO desserts!  service is awesome with friendly staff and prompt service. definitely one of our go to places when we're craving sushi."}
{"text":"Customer service to be completely taught from scratch 5 minutes to say hi after standing in front of the hosts,even though we were the only one to be seated waited another 10 just to have someone else come in and seated I believe hosts friend, no explanation total lack of care,I guess they are feeling to cool for that...walked out...waste of time..."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group and we had a blast enjoying everything they had to offer from the all you can eat menu. I'm not a big sushi person but everything I had tasted great. I love that they have a nice Hawaiian selection also. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Their chilli garlic enamame is delicious!!! Their rolls are fantastic. The Town and country roll is huge!, so be ready to pig out!! First time customer, and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, excellent food, I've been to many sushi restaurants but this one is something special. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Just ate thier agian they slacked for a minute but are back on top. Try the salmon lover and candy cane roll. Tell them RN Sent you. Great food."}
{"text":"I love their food , but their attitude kinda suck !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck sushi I have found yet in Vegas. Happy hour Monday through Wednesday all day long. Most rolls are around 6 bucks.  We love the crunch roll, the 007 and the rainbow roll.  Friends tell me there poke bowls are super good too!  Sitting area is pretty small so it's frequently a short wait to get in."}
{"text":"After leaving there tonight,i gotta  say i am pretty content with the food prepared for me tonight from the poke express . Especially  with the server who helped me. I was having an uneasy day until i walked in,up to the poke case and was immediately greeted  with a big  smile and 100% kindness.  She did an awesome  job with the preparation of the poke i ordered as well letting me leave with a smile/laugh allowing me to definitely want to come back. She's  also the reason  why i rated you guy's  5's. Thank you \"Poke lady\" for your politeness and all around (Aloha spirit.) Keep smiling girl."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place after a great recommendation from an acquaintance. Although the sushi was good, the service was horrible.  We didn't have to wait to be seated but the waitress never brought us our appetizer, nothing hard to remember (it was just 2 orders of miso soup) and was not very welcoming.  We felt like she didn't want to be there and do her job. Also, although there were not that many people the wait for our sushi (all raw, no cooking required) took a long time. The only thing that came to the table fast was the check and the only thing that left the table fast was the money.  Don't think we are coming here again."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed, my green beans had worms in them. Customer service was bad, still charge me full price for everything. Nobody even apologized. It was just a plain horrible experience."}
{"text":"I'm really sad I have to come back and udate my review.  We visited Island again last Friday and had a pretty bad experience.  The service was AWFUL.  We went as a group of 6.... all ordered AYCE.  We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second.  That's really unacceptable.  As far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi.  On a Friday night at 6:30?  That's crazy.  And that would probably explain what the hold up was.  Our waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.  When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less.  \"Yeah, we know we're having problems.  You have 90 minutes, don't worry.\"  Lame.  There were still some very yummy rolls, but worth waiting an hour and a half for?  Not at all.    It was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm giving them zero stars (strictly for the reservation) because they somehow \"lost\" our reservation...how in the world does that happen??!!?! We were there this past weekend and had made reservations over a month in advance for a party of 40. We found out the day of our dinner that we did not have reservations, they told us that they lost it and apparently gave the spot to someone else...very disappointing. Isn't it as simple as entering a reservation into your book or system?"}
{"text":"i usually eat at sushi mon but decided to try island sushi instead.  when i arrived the staff was really helpful and friendly.  the food was prepared fresh with no fishy taste.  i highly recommend island sushi."}
{"text":"Really great service and selection of foods. Don't forget to get some malasadas to go."}
{"text":"This is as close to Hawaii as I'm gonna get.  I hate to say it but it's even betta than Cali (and I live in an area that's Hawaiian friendly).  The Ahi poke bowl is just the right mix of spices and shoyu.  They also have a wide variety of flavors line wasabi ahi, furikake ahi poke, spicy avocado poke, salmon poke and even kimchee raw crab!    I also had the salmon skin bowl and that did not disappoint.  The salmon skin was crispy and just the right amount of saltiness.  Most salmon skin I've had were rubbery and hard to chew.    Lastly the malasadas are right on point.  I love haupia and they can fill the malasadas with vanilla chocolate and haupia filling.  Almost as good as Leonard's.    So if you have a craving for island eats, this won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Eggplants fries are the bomb!  Yes, it is also part of the AYCE sushi menu.  Typically, we would go to Goyemon for the AYCE, but Island Sushi is our next go to place if we don't want to trek to Goyemon.  The fish selection are great here too.  They are fresh and delicious.  What I like to order here are not just the egglants fries, but the crab tako.  I can chow down three order of these because the sauce and the raw crab goes so well together.    For dessert, we only get one order per person, so I typically chose wisely.  I would get the malasada if it was fresh, and not just a lump of stale dough.  If I asked and it has been sitting since earlier that day, I would default to the brownie and scoop of ice cream.  Overall, I am a fan and will return.  They also have a AYCE brunch menu that includes item like King's Hawaiian bread french toast, and other interesting items.  Check it out if you have not done so!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and sushi chef's. So far the best AYCE sushi in Henderson that I've found(out of three nearby). It doesn't have a fancy dinning area but for good sushi, who cares?"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii... Tried many island style restaurants out here on the \"9th island\" and this is my fav!! Always fresh poke! Quick service.. Once they forgot to make my order that I called in.. And they snuck in free malasadas. Totally worth the extra 6 or 7 minutes it took them to rush the order!! :)"}
{"text":"Good flavor but too much rice. $1.50 for a sliver of jalapeños when I took out cucumbers from my roll.  It be courteous for u guys to mention before charging for stuff.  Saucy lots of rice, no substance. Place divided next door for the express looks pretty cool though. Hey, good tunes though."}
{"text":"I had the teishoku A with a choice of fried Saba and the Surf and Turf sushi roll. Both were good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's like a piece of Hawai'i here in Vegas.  The local food and ono sushi is what keeps me coming back.  The fish here is fresh and with all you can eat dinner for $24 which includes all the sushi, appetizers and desserts, everyone is happy!  The owner is a cool guy from Hawai'i and he makes it a point to walk around and talk with you, always making you feel welcome!  I 100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I made a take out order of the oxtail soup & a combination order of 1/2 chicken katsu & 1/2chicken teriyaki. The oxtail soup is $11.50 & it was a rip off. There was only two pieces of meat which were like small to medium pieces of meat & they did not include the shoyu with the Ginger & cilantro condiments.  They also did not include my chicken katsu sauce. When I called I spoke to the manager named Angie & she was helpful but she said she had to talk to the kitchen manager.  The kitchen manager told her that I would have to bring the items back for her to look at it and determine if it was made up to standard or not. Are they seriously crazy that I would drive back just for them to look at the order!!! Is she really that insane to think that I would lie about something like that?!?  Unacceptable!!!  Obviously this kitchen manager was not in the business for a long time because this is unacceptable to treat your customers this way!!  They're just lucky that Angie, the manager has a good head on her shoulder and understood where I was coming from."}
{"text":"I always overdo it at this place and it's worth it every time.  If you love good Hawaii-style sushi and eats, this is the place to go. The specialty rolls are big enough to share, but you won't want to because they are THAT GOOD!!!  Come during happy hour and eat your weight in deliciousness....."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now... Wow! Good food at a great price. Not only all you can eat sushi but Asian/Hawaiian influenced appetizers and sides.   Favorites  Chicken katsu Baked muscles   I love sushi but not all sushi restaurants are created equal.... Island sushi is close to the top of my long list of sushi places that are in the affordable range.  Happy hour is good if you want a quick snack and don't want to be paying so much.   All you can eat prices (approx.) Lunch---$22 Dinner---$26"}
{"text":"Always a delicious treat when we eat here. Came here with a few friends that were missing \"local food\" so what better place than Island Sushi & Grill. Very accommodating with the 10 friends we had, started with a couple appetizers for everybody: spicy tuna with pickled daikon, ahi poke, baked mussels, garlic chicken, Kim chii fried rice, yaki soba, spicy raw crab (yummy), hamachi Kama, sashimi salad and that's just appetizers.   On to the Nigri sushi all fresh and perfectly made: hamachi, yellowtail, Cajun albacore, ebi, amaebi, salmon skin hand roll.....whole lotta goodness in just two entrees. For the grand sushi rolls we ordered the maKaha, big island, kahuku and more than we can't seem to remember due to being comatose.   Oh let me mind you that they do offer an AYCD on sake!!!  What?!?!?!  Yes all you can drink sake!!!!  Great food and get drunk, how can you complain. Let's not forget the dessert: 808 special!!!  So yum yum and you can even take some cocoa puffs.   Hard to find great sushi spots and we've grown to love this place.  Will definitely keep going back especially with the start of their punch cards. Auryte!!!!!"}
{"text":"Il give three star! Definitely coming back here... $21.95 buffet sushi and etc..staff friendly great food..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family tonight.  Food was average. Service was slow.  Garlic albacore and garlic tuna were super salty.  Had trouble finding chicken in the Chinese chicken salad. Garlic chicken was super tasty, though.  We had trouble getting waters refilled. We requested it twice and were forgotten.  Granted it was busy but there was plenty of help.  I ordered malasada for dessert which was delicious.  I ordered a second.  It never came. Another server came by and asked if we wanted more dessert. I told him I was waiting for a malasada. He apologized about the wait and said he'd look into it.  Ten minutes later no malasada so we just left. Boo."}
{"text":"Boyfriend got Bento B (garlic chicken, ahi, spam, rice, and fried noodles). For spam, that was the most flavorful slice he's had. The garlic chicken wasn't overpowering with garlic, but still had great flavor.  I had regular saimin with a spicy tuna roll on the side. The saimin was normal; I liked that the noodles weren't overcooked. The spicy tuna roll was good, with a good chunk of tuna in each piece and the right amount of spice.  Lastly, we shared butter mochi. Which oddly is like biting into a stick of butter, except it's delicious.  The service was friendly and helpful, gleaming with aloha spirit! We want to try malasadas and creme puffs next time."}
{"text":"You bet your ass I gave this place five stars! Whoo hoo! \"QOQ\" will be the main focus of this review. You know, quality over quantity or vice versa? Well, this place can go either way. All-You-Can-Eat Sushi for $24.95 along with $2 Sake Bombs, ALLLLLL DAYYYYY, sounds like a win-win situation in my case!   A few warnings before we get down to the nitty gritty part of my review: -A 90 minute time limit to the AYCE goodness (NOOOOOO!) -A surcharge for wasting food -Only one order of Uni and Sweet Shrimp per person  So, the food:  - The Uni: My first time having it, but I'm sure they did it right because the sweetness of the Sea Urchin and the gooey goodness made me want more than just two rolls. Yummy! - Garlic Chicken: flavor overload in my mouth! Couldn't get enough of this. - Ahi Poki: FRESH FRESH FRESH TUNA! It almost felt as if the fish were swimming in my mouth. - Tempura Philly Roll: Fried. Cream Cheese. Fresh Salmon. I can't ask for a better combination.  All their sushi is extremely fresh and they do sushi right. Make sure you order accordingly because they will charge your ass for leftovers. For dessert, make sure you get the \"808 Special\", tempura-battered bananas and strawberries topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dallop of whipped cream. *drools.   With a party of 14, the service was exceptional. Our waitress kept us happy with our Sake Bombs and kept up with our nonstop demands for food.  They, also, have a pretty decent \"Happy Hour\", which consists of $1.50 Small Beers and $3.00 Big Beers. So, order a Big Beer and a round of Sake and you've got yourself set for about 10 Sake Bombs! Yes!  So, we walked into this place starving and left this place with our bellies full. We didn't even wanna walk the Strip, we just wanted go back to our hotel rooms and pass out. I toast Island Sushi with their $2 Sake Bombs! Yay! Island Sushi, you have got me hooked for life!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner and had the AYCE sushi. The service was great. The waiters and waitresses were friendly. The sushi chefs were easy going. We sat at the counter on a night with not a lot of customers and the food came out promptly.   Now the bad news. The sushi quality was not good... but i guess you can't complain if it's ayce? The cooked food was good but it was very filling so I don't recommend it if you are on the AYCE plan.  Another problem was that they used the \"ajitsuke\" nori (the sweet and spicy flavored nori) for the Uni sushi. I don't know if this is \"hawaiian style\" or they were just plain lazy, but this is the only sushi restaurant that I have been to that uses ajitsuke nori for their \"gunkan\" sushi. And because of the flavor in the nori, it killed the flavor in the uni.   The presentation of the sushi was not like other sushi places too, in a bad way... Even I could probably cut the fish the way the chefs did. It didn't affect the taste, but come on!, they should've taken better sushi-making lessons before they started working behind the counter.  If you want to have AYCE sushi, I would recommend Makino, which is cheaper, or Sushi Mon, which tastes better."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since Poke express moved. The spicy ahi with avocado was awesome!! Fish was fresh and flavors right on. Kimchi mussels, limu tako and lomi salmon also very good. Chicken Katsu was good and crunchy, no complaints. However, the oxtail soup had only two pieces of meat, a few pieces of cabbage or bok Choy very small and the rest was broth which was very oily. Disappointing.  Excited to have laulau since it's been a long time but very dry with no taste. All in all would go back for the poke but cooked food needs improvement."}
{"text":"It's a really good deal for the sushi, appetizers, and dessert if you get the AYCE. The happy hour deal for 50% off sushi also seems pretty good too. Everything we ordered was tasty but the rolls had way too much sauce on them. I'm not sure what the name of the sauce is but it was the sweet sauce that's usually on unagi. I would have given this place 4 starsif they would just go easy on the sauce. A lot of the rolls seems very similar so I wish that they had more variety."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location ever since it opened, food and prices are great until yesterday!! My family and I went to island sushi for lunch as always the food was delicious but our server was horrible,  she had an attitude with us from the start no customer service what so ever... As we were done with our lunch she came back with our check which was on the same bill, we asked her before we even started if we could have separate checks which she said ok.. we asked her again for separate checks so she went to the back to separate them.. my sister in-law overheared our server and the manager talking in the back about our checks, the manager which then said in a very loud and rude way \"well they should have sat on separate tables if they wanted separate checks\"... With that being said the manager which was a Japanese female came out towards our table and said \"before you start talking let me say what I have to say first\"... really?!! My sister-inlaw told her finally that she just wanted to pay her bill and leave then the manager said all the way across the restaurant \"yes you will pay your bill and never come back\" this was in front on everyone that was in the restaurant!! The bill was separated into 4 checks there was 6 of us, gratuity was places on all checks which was 10.00 so our bad server would have gotten 40.00 from us.. yeah right!! I would suggest to upper management that they train this particular servers and so called manager how to do their job right!! Again I have been going here for years and love the food but this experience has turned me away for a very long time.... gonna try island flavor heared they have better food and great customer service. ...."}
{"text":"Went to Island Sushi last night.  The grill part is still good, especially if you order ahead for a to-go order.  Poke Express has moved on to another sight and Island Sushi now operates that area fully.  I honestly can't tell you how good the poke is, as after waiting 35 minutes for our order (2 orders of 1/4lb poke), we left without the food.  The orders were not brought out in the order that it was taken.  4 or 5 people who had ordered after us received their orders well before we did and it's not like we had a huge order.  The woman in front of us had ordered some sort of crab dish and it was incorrect so they had to redo the order, because her dish was cheaper.  Why not just eat the cost and give her the order?  They were slow, unorganized and looked extremely lost.  I may continue to go there for the grill section but if you want great poke in a quick and efficient manner, I'd go to the original poke express as the service at the new poke section is ridiculously bad."}
{"text":"Love this Place.  It has to be our \"Go To\" Sushi place for a couple of years now.  I agree with Bethany's review - you need to sit at the bar, especially when Jason is working.  Whatever you order, believe me, it will be wonderful. Please note - WHEN you go, and IF Jason is working, make sure to make your \"LAST ROLL\" is a \"Jason Surprise\".  Believe me - it will be worth it and you will LOVE IT, but you have to request a \"Jason Surprise\".  ENJOY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kinda confusing...which island cuisine are they trying to represent? Everything was mediocre...so either fine tune the sushi dishes or Hawaiian items! The male waiters were nice but we ran into one Asian female who was very rude  and unappreciative of our business. First and last time coming here and def not recommending to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing but what takes it over the top is the outstanding service. We had a party of 10, but our server, who was one of the best I've ever had, gave us his complete attention and smilies. Our kids weren't the most quietest however the help from the other servers to assist and keep us off of the pressure was none short of awesome. I only wish they were bigger! The great aloha spirit was definitely felt here and I will definitely be back and recommend to everybody. Thanks Island Sushi!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have dined at Island sushi and after my 2nd time I was impressed and excited to bring my mom with me to dinner to enjoy some sushi. Today I brought my mother and we each got a combination dinner. We were quickly forgotten about as soon as other tables ordered all you can eat, we had to remind our server that we hadn't gotten our soup when our dinner was brought out. My mom ordered the garlic chicken (DO NOT ORDER IT!) as her choice in the combination, and it was greasy and unappetizing, she didn't even eat it. The salad was dry with no dressing like it had each time I had been before. And the desert portioning tonight was laughable. I won't even get into the service...... Very disappointed. Wondering if there was a new cook or the boss was just out for the evening."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great aloha atmosphere.  Second time at this sushi bar (counter) and experienced thoughtful service by the chef.  The owner's son also provided a warm and courteous service."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while vacationing in Vegas (yay Vegas!) I'm really glad we drove out of our way for this one because it's worth the 30 mins drive and some!  Our faves include the spicy Mexican roll, big island roll, fried oysters and the garlic tuna."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Doesn't see like anyone was trained or knew what was going on. Food was decent. Need a manager badly."}
{"text":"I love this place! 'All you can eat 'sushi includes delicious appetizers like mochiko chicken, poke, shrimp tempura, lomi salmon, the list goes on. Nothing like the regular sushi spots. And the sunday brunch is even better with even more to choose from. Its about a 30 minute drive for me. But so worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and my family absolutely loved it! We ordered from the ayce menu and it included appetizers (such as small portions of garlic and Mochiko chicken) as well as two desserts per person. Our favorite rolls were the island special, tiger roll, and black widow. For dessert, the tempura ice cream (ice cream covered in white cake and then  dipped in tempura and deep fried) was SO good! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Island Sushi is one of my favorite go to restaurants. Both sides have a wide range of options and I mostly love the poke bar. Great prices for the best and freshest poke in my area. I've tried a large portion of the menu and never have been let down. Lunch and dinner time gets pretty busy, so sometimes there is a wait. The service is always good though."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place since they have been open. However tonight was the smallest portions worst service we have experienced from the side services. Very sad!!!!!. The sushi bar service was still great!!  DONT THINK WE WILL EVER GO BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, will return. Service alittle slow.  All you can eat menu could have been larger. We went in wanting all u can eat. Picked Island due to reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"A little piece of Hawai'i in Vegas.  I know, SHOCKING, right?!  LOL!  Came here to get a bento and some grindz before heading out to shoot some guns in Boulder City.    There is a poke / seafood counter in here as well.  If you plan to order both food and poke you can tell the counter person and they will send it over to the \"food\" section and you will get rung up once.  There were authentic local Hawai'i people behind the counters at this place (I could tell) so you know they know what they're doing.  There is a place to sit inside very casually or you can go to the restaurant next door and dine in there - looks like a resto/sports bar atmosphere.    I got the Bento B, which comes with Garlic Ahi, (1) Chicken Option, Noodles, Takuwan, Furikake Rice, and 1 piece Spam.  I chose the Mochiko Chicken as my chicken option.  Lots of food in this bento and very filling.  Great taste, which reminds me of home, so it's a winner in my book.  Haven't tried the sushi, so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMY! My fave are the tiger, big island, and crunch roll. Happy hour is the best! I'm obsessed with this place."}
{"text":"Fresh fish and good service, what more can you ask for.  Revised on 02/7/08: Updated the rating from four stars to five.  This places continues to impress me.  The fish is always fresh and the lunch special is amazing.   I tried the two item combo and it was so much food, I had leftovers for dinner.  The mochiko chicken is sooooo goood!  I highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"OMG when I was introduced to this place I was so excited to see that the had bentos!! Totally reminds me of the island life and how as a young child I would get bentos after school or before we went to the park!! This is an awesome place to go to and their poke is just as good as back at home!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here... I Went last week, I remember it being better. Fish quality was so-so. Spicy Tuna was dry with no flavor. The environment has changed since the re-model. One this one trip, I went from LOVING this place to, Not going to go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"It was our first time here so asked the girl what she recommends.  she said garlic chicken was their popular dish.  So we had the garlic chicken, kalbi and malasadas.  All were delicious!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this. Service was excellent but sushi was mediocre. It was almost gross. Makes me sad!"}
{"text":"Affordable all you can eat lunch! Hamachi Nigiri, Spider Roll, Crunch Roll, 007 Roll, Spicy Tuna and Chicken Katasu, Gyozas.  Makes me, my wife and friends smile!"}
{"text":"Ordered a mini chicken Katsu to go and what a disappointment.  It was a mini of a mini plate.  not worth the exuberant price you charge your customers.  better places around town that gives more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here an hour before they closed and we were glad to hear it was happy hour.  Pluses - $2 Asahi Drafts for happy hour and sushi rolls were delicious.  Downer- service wasn't that great. It took us 10 mins to get our bill after asking our server and 15 more minutes for her to give us the bill. It was a little busy but tables she went to, she was returning for water refills, food orders, or checking up on them."}
{"text":"We always come here every time we go to Vegas and even stop here before leaving Vegas.  Husband and I grew up on Maui and miss eating local Hawaiian food.  We tried their AYCE sushi deal for lunch.  The sushi, poke, Kama, and dessert was ono-licious.  I even took home boxes of malassadas to share with friends.  They just have everything to make an island girl happy...and for just a little while I feel like I'm home in the islands."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!! Yassssssss came to get a custard and plain malassada. While ordering I was asked how my day is going and all that!! Ummmmmmm I'm great thank you, for asking!! Love it!! On to the next   Xoxo"}
{"text":"AWESOME. AMAZING. BEST experience I've ever had. I recently went to Island Sushi after sifting through dozens of sugg's on Yelp. I was in town with family for a tradeshow and NONE of us were disappointed. In fact, we all agreed we'd Yelp about how amazing this place was. The server was awesome. My cousin asked if they had a roll with strawberries and they didnt, but about 10 minutes later the owner and sushi chef cam and asked what she was looking for. He custom made a roll for her.  We were all doing the all you can eat (I highly recc it), so to go out of his way to make a special roll even though we weren't paying more for us--was way too generous and was the icing on the cake.  If you are in town, live in town and want AMAZING, fresh quality sushi, check this place out."}
{"text":"Except your food on island time...  My sister ordered sushi (all u can eat), ended up getting her first roll halfway through our meal. My eggs were cold and her sushi was warm. I'm thinking they cater to some people and leave others in the cold."}
{"text":"Visited twice but I think that's that.   During my last visit, the service was dreadful.  They were very understaffed (so, not really the waitstaff's problem) which translated into an annoying ordeal just to get our order taken, water refilled, or our food.  C+  Unfortunately, the food did not make up for the service.  We ordered the salmon sashimi with orgasm sauce ($8).  The salmon was drenched in the mayonnaise-based dressing and, even then, under all that crap, I could tell it wasn't the freshest fish.  Pass.  We also ordered the Joe's Special and Maui Wowie rolls.  I enjoyed the Maui Wowie (shrimp tempura, eel, avocado) but the Joe's Special was pretty underwhelming.  Also, once again, I wasn't impressed with the quality of the fish.  Maybe I was there on a bad day?  The only redeeming quality of our meal was the malasada sundae.  I really enjoyed the fresh malasada (portugese donut), vanilla ice cream, and guava sauce. However, I would not endure another dining experience here just for this dessert.  Which, is a shame, because it's delicious.  Overall: If I ever returned, I'd go to the take-out window and skip the restaurant."}
{"text":"I feel that this place is going a bit downhill for me. The service can be hit or miss and some of the grill items are inconsistent. My mom loves visiting and getting a bento. The last two have not been as good as the two we got before. I keep going hoping that the next visit will be better, but the last three were no good for me. Will wait a little before trying again."}
{"text":"I love Poke Express here, and also the grill for takeout has excellent service.  But, we received such poor service in the restaurant, we won't be going there again.  We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken immediately by a very friendly gentleman.  We gave our order to the waitress.  We didn't want AYCE, so maybe we weren't worth her time.  Half our order came within 5 minutes.  The other half came 45 mins later.  A couple was seated 15 minutes AFTER us, got their food, ate, paid their bill and left before we received the rest of our order.  It was mochiko chicken, and other than being a little overcooked, it was delicious.  We then waited another 20 min after completely finishing our meal for our waitress to come back and get our order for dessert (which was included in the price of the meal I ordered) There were only 4 other tables occupied at this point....and at least 2 other wait staff.  This was a very insulting experience.  I can understand mistakes when a waitress is very busy, but being obviously ignored when she only had one other table was just too much.  I skipped dessert and just got the check.  To his credit, the man who took our drink orders ran to get us malasadas to go, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  Our waitress was nowhere to be seen and didn't apologize for the poor service once.  We spent nearly 2 hours there, and she spoke to us a total of 4 times.  I'll stick to the grill and Poke Express after this.  Unless we decide on AYCE, since that seems to be the only way to get service in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch on 10/6/09.  Poke is very good.  Wait until 4pm for dinner and you can order Uni, Ama Ebi, and Hamachi Kama!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE sushi places that we have visited.  Great service, and friendly and helpful sushi chefs.  I tried AYCE once here,but  I feel like I am being gluttonous so I prefer to order by the piece and get sashimi as well.  However my friend gets it all the AYCE every time and loves it. Good service, good food, good ambiance (they play Bob Marley!)"}
{"text":"Island Sushi is our go-to place for AYCE. Everyone here is Island friendly, the service is great, and they keep bringing the sushi. It has a real locals feel, and we will be there at least once a week. The poke is good and we love the malasadas too."}
{"text":"A large group of friends went there on Tuesday (1/2 $ off rolls). This place offers a Hawaiian take on Sushi.  The wait staff seemed to be preoccupied.  The place was not packed but they had a a good amount of people. However, the orders came out slow. One person received their food and 10 minutes later another person received theirs.   Does the staff not know that we need small dishes for soy sauce? Do they need to be asked to bring some ginger and wasabi? Hello, it is a sushi place and we are all ordering sushi.  So, the sushi was ok. Its not great and not bad.  Because we had a large group, we were charged 18% gratuity. The charge was on the pre-discounted amount plus tax. So, we really paid 29%. This might be the new norm but I think it is wrong.  The service was sub-par at best. It was hard to get the wait persons attention. I know they have a hard job and I am sure they are nice people."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Staff not very friendly and do not look happy at all. Do not go right after lunch. Maybe the dinner staff will be better. Great food though."}
{"text":"I should first admit that I did not try the AYCE sushi. That said, if you like Hawaiian comfort food, you have to come here. They have solid  Portuguese sausage, spam, malassadas, mac salad, and saimin. And, of course, Poke Express with +10 kinds of poke. Just imagine that the desert is the ocean and you're practically on Oahu."}
{"text":"The all you can eat lunch is a great deal and the food was bomb!  Some of my co-patrons in my party were not impressed when we first entered, but were believers once they tasted the food.  Got two men to admit they were wrong!  That's how good this place is!"}
{"text":"Dined at Island Sushi this past Sunday.  I don't know any of the sushi chefs so I sat at the table.  Great team work in servicing, which included a helping hand from the boss.  Sushi rice was perfect and fish quality was nice.  Unlike a few other AYCE places that serve only mochi ice cream for dessert, this place has a handful of delightful sweets to choose from.   Look out for the Pocho, he's nice but can be abrasive."}
{"text":"My go-to for Hawaiian plate lunches! I'm from Hawaii and this place reminds me of zippy's back home. Our faves are the kalbi, chicken katsu and garlic chicken plates. We also love the fried noodle deluxe, CRISPY salmon skin sushi bowl and bentos. I haven't had a bad meal here! Oh and don't forget the malasadas, chantilly cake and their poke is ONO too!"}
{"text":"Visiting in Las Vegas is always fun! One of the funnest things to do in Vegas, besides wasting your $ on the slots and in the shops, is EATING. Vegas has some amazing restaurants.  Island sushi is one of those amazing places. I went with a large group of friends and we tried several  rolls. All of them were amazing.   Every Monday and Thursday they have 50% your bill and that knocked our $300 bill to $150. We were pretty damn pleased.  I walked out feeling great, not stuffed. Everything was Fresh and just yum.  I'd describe this place as orgasm-in-mouth. Yum! I will be back."}
{"text":"Use to come here frequently because we loved the service and especially the sushi and AYCE. Will NEVER go back again because the management is awful!! Very disappointed in the way they have been treating customers lately. They can't handle volume and they put customers down when they get busy because there is not enough staff to accommodate the customers. Only 2 sushi chefs and it sometimes takes over an hour to get food on the table. Employees look overworked and the service shows it. Sorry but this place sucks!"}
{"text":"Service sucks, old fish, rude workers. Ghetto sushi rolls. Fish is mushy. All you can eat is a joke. The old ratings were true. But staff there is not the best. Don't eat here save your money and time yuck no stars if I had a opportunity"}
{"text":"Fast service, good sushi. Not the best in Vegas, but great AYCE sushi menu for only $25 & that includes appetizers, other entrees, & desserts as well. Nice, friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Las Vegas during Christmas Vacation and were looking for a Sushi place on Yelp.  Island Sushi is by far one of the best sushi bars we've ever been too. Not only do they have super sushi rolls, but the service is exceptional and friendly.  Chuy was our sushi chef and he really made sure to take care of my wife as she is with child and she can't have any fish that is not already cooked.  Chuy made what we call a Chuy Special it had Cream Cheese, Cooked Tempura Shrimp, Sesame, eel sauce and a bunch of other stuff that was so yummy & very tasty!!  Also our sever really went out of her way to hook us up with appetizers and gave us several recommendations of things to try and our water cups were full without asking the whole time.  What an exceptional value and service........next time you go don't forget to ask Chuy for the Chuy Special what a treat you will not be disappointed! Don't forget to pick-up some Hawaiian Custard Doughnuts on the way out...WOW!!"}
{"text":"I tried other AYCE sushi places, and i'm not really a sushi snob, as long as its pretty fresh and they make it, in front of you and as  long as it tastes good -that good for me. I've been here a few times, what I like about Island Sushi is that you get your sushi fix (if you are hungry) as well as Local Hawaiian specialtys like Poke, Mochiko and Garlic chicken, malasada, miso yaki fish, etc. Food is tasty and you will eat plenty. Try there special sushi like Candy Cane, Mauna Loa, Surf and Turf etc. Food is comes pretty quick and servers are pretty cool."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best AYCE sushi spots in town. It's been really packed lately but that's because of how great it is. I can never have enough of the island special roll. The best. Everything is great at this spot!"}
{"text":"Poke is always Ono and fresh. Always a must go destination when in Vegas. Always great to come to a restaurant where aloha is not only served in food but atmosphere"}
{"text":"Delicious! My favorites were the cajun albacore nigiri sushi & for dessert the malassada sundae! If you're hungry, the all you can eat specials are more than worth it! Not as full because mainly ordered lighter entrees, but you can definitely fill up if you order plenty! Lovely relaxed atmosphere & friendly staff! It would be nice to have more of a waiting area since we were all packed up front and standing during our wait on a busy evening, but definitely a place worth a trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places, but new management is different, disappointed because there was a hair in my sushi and all she offered to do was give me a beer.  I don't drink beer, but a discount on the bill would make sense.  Business owner 101"}
{"text":"Poor service and they charge 18% gratuity for a party of 5 not family friendly. You can get better quality sushi at other places."}
{"text":"They have everything here. They have a lot of desserts here like the Chocolate Dobash and Guava Chiffon cakes and more. They also have a Poke Express in there. They cook all of the local favorites and they're pretty quick in giving you your food. Tasty, tasty, tasty. They also have an all-you-can-eat sushi bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"i went here a while back and tried the mochiko chicken, spam musubi and garlic chicken. all are good items to order. however, i must admit, the spam musubi was a bit dry. i like my musubis with some kind of sauce on it - teriyaki or shoyu/sugar.   my bf and i went here today. he ordered the garlic chicken (mind that he's tried it before and absolutely LOVED it) and was utterly disappointed by the look and taste of it. it was not at all how he remembered it. not crispy and not very garlicy.   my conclusion:  they make good food, but not consistently. and like a good golf swing, consistency is key!   side note:  they have sushi, all-you-can-eat, bakery goods and most impressive, poke express!"}
{"text":"food is always good here but the service is lacking. they are usually slow"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Coming from a place where japanese hawaiian food is super common movin to vegas and not seeing many of these types of restaurants is hard. I cant normally come during the day when theyre open and i usually do take out.   I have tried the poke bar in the back and the gentlemen was super helpful. He let us sample a fee things before we decided, which made it even harder because everything was marinated so well. The seaweed salad was delicious and had just the right amount of seasoning.   When i order take out i usually get the take out bento box a with garlic chicken. Sessa i think her name is, simply awesome. Super friendly and has great customer service. This place really gives the aloha spirit.   I love the desserts that they have too. The butter mochi i had ordered last time was superb and tastes just like my aunties. Thats how you know its homemade and fresh."}
{"text":"Sat in sushi section , the fish was and various other meats were still fresh and tasted delicious , the sushi maker was very helpful and made great convo , I had the all I can eat , great value bring ur A game to the counter  the more the better , recommend the fried California roll ."}
{"text":"I came here for AYCE sushi and this place has pretty good sushi, and this is the only place where I was able to find soft shell crab poke. Yes, it was yummy.   Another trip for the malasadas and coco puffs. Dang this place has the best malasadas in town so far. Perfectly sugared, fried to perfection on the outside with a slight crispyness and then you hit that warm and luscious dough on the inside which gives a light but chewy goodness. Next time I'm ordering a dozen for myself. Coco puffs were quite tasty too. Chocolate pudding was good, the puff was nice and light, and the macadamia nut frosting on top was the closest I've had to Liliha bakery's mac nut butter."}
{"text":"The sushi might be good here but the customer service is awful. They will let you stand for 15 minutes and pretend not to see you. You have to wait to be seated, so despite having open seats at the bar you're stuck looking like a fool. It isn't worth it. I'll gladly drive 30 minutes across town for a better place."}
{"text":"Was looking for an AYCE sushi place with a group of friends in the area and found this. Did not disappoint!    At first walking in and you see the counter for all their poke and other hawaiian food, and we were led to go to the sushi area for AYCE. Candy cane roll and Kilauea were the def favorites. A lot of various rolls that are unique to their spot and the service was good and the servers were very nice and attentive to us. We went in the middle of the week so it wasn't crazy busy. Would def go again."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly atmosphere. You get a choice of sushi on one side or hawaiian style bbq on the other. For the price, it's worth the AYCE here. There are TVs to catch the sports games and I've brought the whole family to dine here."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Did the ayce for dinner today. Everything was tasty and fresh love the island flavors. The one thing I would complain about is the servers. They don't seem happy or helpful that your there. Opened the door and there's two rooms one for sushi and the other for Hawaiian food? We stood there waiting cause there was a wait to be seated sign didn't wait long but anything more then a min. Makes no sense you just feel like your being ignored its Monday at 530 maybe two tables were sat in the whole place. We finally sat got waters and waited for our delicious food to arrive. Must say everything we tried was the best very happy about that. Again just the overall friendliness with the staff and we had like three or four people help us? Wasn't sure who to ask for what but all helped us. Get the poke any roll and defiantly the creme' brula it's small but oh so good."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to LV with the inlaws and my family.  One suggested Island Sushi.  \"Sushi\", I'm in!  Even though I already went on two other occassions earlier in the week, but it's all good.  For an AYCE, this is one of the better ones I've experienced.  Very extended menu for AYCE.  Included a wide array of appetizers, sushi, rolls, and desserts.  Only thing is that there are a few item which allowed 1 per person.  This was Uni, Amaebi, seared Ahi Toro, Hamachi Kama (large size, not small), Tako kim-chee, couple of rolls, and some other items. This place is where you ordefrfrom a menu , not a buffett line. Food is freshly made upon order.  Over all, it wasn't bad.  The uni was surprisingly fresh.  Amaebi...tolerable.  Other fish items, not bad...not the best quality, but again, this is AYCE.  It also included some dessert, 808 special...good. So was the malsadas and creme brulee.  Best to order one of each to share.  Of the 5 of us who ordered AYCE, we definitely got our moneys worth.  Better than the AYCE places here in LA (Joe's Sushi, todai).  Would I go back here if I return, yes if with a larger group who's not into paying $100 pp for omakase.  This place will do to get your fix for sushi...and then some."}
{"text":"Ordered poke. Quality of fish has went waaay down.  Lacked flavor. Not good. Not even close to what it used to be."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars due to the shitty plate lunches they serve. The first I had to send back which was a simple Mochiko chicken (burnt and flavorless) I changed my order to the BBQ mixed plate which was the special and that too wasn't good at all. The meat was so salty I almost choked! If I wasn't starving from a long hike and drove 30 min to try it, I would have sent it back. The manager never bothered to come out and say anything to me personally but instead just stood behind the counter giving me dirty looks. The reason this place gets two stars is because the Poke I ordered in the back was fairly good.  The cook should get dirty lickens or maybe the owner should for allowing them to serve the plate lunches as Hawaiian food. It may be good for Vegas but living in the islands for most of my life I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE GRILL SIDE, NOT THE SUSHI SIDE...  I've been to Island Sushi many times and think that it's the best AYCE sushi spot in vegas but I had never tried the grill side.  Tried it once and will never be back.  I got the bento with garlic ahi and mochiko chicken.  The ahi was over cooked beyond belief...dry as a cardboard and no garlic taste at all.  The mochiko chicken was soggy and tasted old.  The fried noodles that came with the bento was just that...fried noodles.  Not one green onion, onion, kamaboko, char siu...nothing.  The best thing in that bento was the spam.  The wife got the lau lau.  Horrible...dry and no taste at all.  It was like they didnt add any salt and the leaves were not moist at all either.  Came with lomi lomi salmon but no mac salad?! Blasphemy!   I'll be back to the sushi side but never again to the grill side.  Its sad cause I hear so many local peeps raving about this place.  If this is what theyre raving about, I need to open up my own plate lunch / bento spot and show these guys how its done! If this is the best plate lunch / bento place in vegas, thats sad...."}
{"text":"Food is very good. I have only had delivery so I don't know how the restaurant is but the sushi is very yummy. My only complaint is that delivery is so much! It was about $15 for a delivery charge."}
{"text":"Came to get some poke. Whoever the poke server was shouldnt be in there. Rude as fuck, and I fucking mean it why would you slam the containers and the fridge and giving people that mad look. I didnt appreciate that at all. Food here is great but if you have people just like him/her (I couldnt tell) its not worth going back to."}
{"text":"I love this place and I love the happy hours. The service is great and friendly. The most I love is the desserts. I tried the deserts here when I was on my date and I love it."}
{"text":"My first time here with the family.  Oxtail soup, poke, garlic chicken, and malasadas filled with custard.  Try the various pokes.  All excellent.  Price was reasonable and food was fantastic.  Will definite be back whenever in town."}
{"text":"Oh Yeah, you guys, Oh yeah.  Went for the AYCE a few days ago. Freaking spactacular as always. This time I ventured out a little more, going with my usual nigiri (Oh that hamachi) and rolls (black widow everytime baby) and some new treats, including the strawberry and goat cheese salad, the grilled hamachi collar with ponzu and the teri beef and teri chicken.  Beautiful.  Sarie had a few rolls, loving every bite. She did the classic Sarie rolls (California, Spicy Tuna). What can I say, she knows what she likes... The service is always crazy good. This time we were laughing at our girl's description of the size of the mochi balls. God bless! ('I've had bigger balls' she tells me) Oh! And they have an AYCE punch card you guys! She brought one out for me at the end of my feast. Buy 10 AYCE, the 11th is a freebie.  I was grateful, but somewhat perturbed that I had been 3 times so far and never knew about the punchie. But hey, this is ISLAND SUSHI we're talking about. My beautiful server went back in time for me and gave me credit for those times too. Oh yeah, you guys, oh yeah.  By the way, The Bear and I will be working on punchhole #4 on Sunday night, so you better have that beautiful sushi man warmed up and ready to roll on my Black Widow baby!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I never write reviews but after this experience, I thought it my duty to warn future patrons. Never will I ever come back...not even if the food was free."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sushi place here in town! The rolls are amazing and they have awesome deals! They have happy hour where they serve half-price rolls for an hour before close. They also have an AYCE deal for $26 per person that not only includes sushi, but 2 desserts and I believe a drink as well. I always enjoy my experience here, the chefs are friendly and fast and the wait staff is awesome as well. Great presentation, great flavor, every time!"}
{"text":"The concept of AYCE Sushi is new to me moving here to Vegas.  At first it sounds too good to be true, followed by a sneaking suspicition of poor quality and limited selection.  Not at Island Sushi! For $20.99 at lunch ($24.95 for dinner), you get a large selection of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, and even desserts.  I mostly avoided the apps (ordered a miso soup and edamame), and stuck with the nigiri.  The fish was fresh and tasty, and the quality was just as good for the most part of some of the fancier sushi joints I have tried around the country.  If you come hungry, you definitely get you money's worth without sacrificing quality.  The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, as its in a strip mall and seating area is just cheap tables and chairs.  If you want a fancy dining experience, this is not the place.  I was by myself for lunch and the sushi bar has a small flatscreen TV to watch while I stuffed myself.  They also do quite a few happy hour type specials on rolls and sake bombs throughout the week if you aren't in the AYCE mood.  For your non-raw fish eating friends, the other half of the restrauant has a pretty extensive cooked Hawaiian menu.  However, I don't forsee myself trying that anytime soon.  The sushi deal here is just too good!  Just remember to save some room for that 808 Special dessert!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 30 last night and Terence and Stefani planned our dinner perfectly! The quality, presentation and preparation of the food was amazing - seriously the best rolls and bento dishes I've had in a long time! Book your party here - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places to eat at.  Can't beat the all-you-can-eat special for about $20 per person.  Great atmosphere as well as great servers.  Coming from Hawaii myself, you absolutely feel the aloha as soon as you walk in.  Great plate lunches & pastries too! My favs... the croc, dragon roll, ahi poke, & the 808 special (dessert). Sooo ONO!! A must to try out!!"}
{"text":"Their chicken plate was really good very fresh. The cashier was my too friendly . When we asked for siracha sauce we were told they did not have any but we could buy some from poke express. Seems like we were bugging her when asking her anything. But the food was decent, Macaroni salad tasted more like potato salad then anything ."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat some 'hwn' breakfast. Instead got Teri beef plate lunch.  The meat was very chewie, border of being tough. I also ask to get it well done. But didn't. For some reason this was not a very good visit. The cashier she had no 'aloha'. No greeting. I had to tell her good morning. Over all, diapointing visit."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant, service was excellent, staff was very friendly \"chewy\" and \"Jose\", and the food was very fresh. Drink never went empty, and the variety of food is great. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this place last Saturday around 11 am to pick up some food at Poke Express (which is inside Island Sushi & Grill). And since we were already here, we also decided to pick up Bento A (Teri beef and teri chicken ($8.25 prior to tax) for us to share to go. The teriyaki chicken was good and the amount of rice you get with this order was plenty. But the teriyaki beef was just okay. Honestly, we both agreed that we would have been happy ordering Bento C (choice of chicken, $5 prior to tax).   Anyways, the people taking our order were friendly. The wait for our food took a while though since it is cooked to order. There are limited tables in this little place.   Just also wanted to mention that there is a nice sit down restaurant area right next door that you can get their all you can eat special ($21.95 for lunch, $26.95 for dinner... both prices are prior to tax), which we may be interested in trying the next time we find our way here. I would also like to try their malassadas next time as well.   By the way, this place is located in a small plaza, located next to a Mediterranean/ Persian restaurant with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"ordered some nigiri.  it tasted funny.  I threw it up a few minutes later.  not a pleasant experience.  the fish is definitely not as fresh as other sushi places in vegas.    before I threw up I told my waitress that there was something wrong with the fish and she told me I was going to have to pay extra for uneaten food even though I was paying for all you can eat in the first place.  this only put pressure on me to keep eating the rancid fish.  I felt like I was dealing with a crazy person.   the menu is pretty lackluster too.  once you order all you can eat, about 1/3rd the menu becomes off limits (not included in all you can eat) ."}
{"text":"This place is SO good! Make sure to try the malasadas, macaroni salad and spam and eggs! It's a little taste of Hawaii in Vegas! It's a little harder to get to now that they moved to Henderson, but it's worth the cab ride!"}
{"text":"I moved from Southern California so of course I have high standards when it comes to Sushi! By far this is the BEST place I have been to in Las Vegas for Sushi! I left highly satisfied! They have very good customer service, they are on top of everything and very polite! I sat at the bar where you can watch them make the sushi rolls before your eyes! I tried Saki for the first time & I have to say it was AMAZING! Definitly coming back to this place often! Only thing I did not like is how small and crowded it feels in there! Overall though I don't mind it because their Sushi is certainly worth every second!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the bento boxes! The mochiko chicken is bomb!!! Spicy tuna bowl is delicious too!! And if you are a fan of natto you can get that here too!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi and Hawaiian food restaurant in Vegas! Everyone that works here is always so nice and the food is delicious and reasonably priced. Especially love the All You Can Eat Sushi & Sake option! Great for when friends come and visit us from out of town! My favorites on the grill side are the Garlic Chicken, Avo Ahi Bowl, & the Coconut Mochi. But you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We ordered 4 different kinds of poke, 3 different sushi rolls, kalbi, shrimp tempura. Even had malasada sundae, mochi ice cream, and tempura ice cream. I can't complain about anything. Everything was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and just ono. Straight up broke da mouth"}
{"text":"There is an Island Girl somewhere deep inside me and I think I found it. Well, it has always been there with food so yes, it is there.   I stopped by after getting my lashes and brows done because personal maintenance makes me hungry apparently. I did not know what to expect when I walked in, maybe some Hawaiian food, sushi, Island food? Trust me, I am not that familiar with Island food although people think I am fully literate on this cuisine because I look Hawaiian or something like that. I do know what I like when it comes to certain Island cuisine and that is when the Island girl makes a guest appearance.  So on my visit, I decided to order the Spam Misubi which I never had until I moved to Vegas. I am not a connoisseur but I have eaten great ones and ones that I felt like saying \"I will never eat this again!\".  The Spam Misubi at Island Sushi was one of the great ones. It was warm and tightly wrapped and so yummy-yummy. I do love spam and rice, I am Fil-Am so I know it is in the DNA.  I also ordered the Specialty fried noodles with Spam and BAM, so spot on!! It tasted like the pansit my mother used to make once or twice a year for special occasions. It truly tasted like something from an Island Mother's kitchen or at least a Fil-Am mother who threw down Grilled Cheese sandwiches in front of me and Fil-food on some annual occasion.   Too bad this place isn't on my side of town as I have been looking for a Hawaiian/ Island like restaurant but that will not stop me from stopping in after getting my lashes glued on.   Mahalo!!"}
{"text":"Overall, not bad - a B. It's Hawaiian-style sushi, so lots pf avocado in everything, and lots of fried foods. I wasn't expecting a lot for sushi in Nevada - anyone see an ocean nearby? But being used to good sushi in San Francisco, San Diego, and Seattle, it was a disappointment. Good if you just want some cheap-o sushi."}
{"text":"Shushi well done. Fresh with less rice. Most of sushi restaurants will prepare the rolls and te nigiri with a lot of rice and you get full wire barely eating any fish. At island sushi you will eat more fish than rice. Order all you can eat sushi for about $25 bucks. The special includes a lot of thier appetizers."}
{"text":"The restaurant has slow service...The waiter told us our table was ready...after almost a 2 hour wait.  Mind you we stayed because it was someones bday that really wanted to try it so i was hoping it would be worth it for her. Room temperature sushi. Nothing exciting nothing new nothing to wait for.  May i add they gave us a complimentary sushi dish... Would have been a pleasant apology if all of us werent having theyre ALL YOU CAN EAT...theyre poke selection outside the restaurant is good...idk if that counts"}
{"text":"2.10.17: Sometimes going with a local Hawaiian to a Hawaiian restaurant really has perks. We came at a really odd hour so there were only one other party there. Once we walked in it was like hello, hello, welcome, welcome..There were so many workers there greeting us. I think that's normal though. They're a friendly bunch.  I wasn't too hungry so I didn't order anything but did try a few things from others. The poke bowl looks so good. The Tuna was on point and delicious and abundance. The plain ahi poke was also good but a bit too much soy sauce for me. Tasted salty.   The service was good and the food came fast. The main thing I liked was the malasadas. They did it right. It was fresh and hot and fluffy. We got the plain ones without filling and dang it was the best thing I ate all day. So good.   Side note: We came on our last day in Vegas and got some Malasadas to go. It was not the same at all. Was pretty disappointed. So when you do go get it ask for the fresh out of the fryer ones. =)"}
{"text":"YESSSSSSS...... Came here for AYCE while visiting a friend from Henderson. It was amazing! The fish was so fresh and that was one of my concerns. Coming from Cali, I always worry about the freshness of fish when I'm less than an hour from the ocean :p So, we stuffed ourselves full. The rolls came out quick and were pretty creative. Best part, my son was 1/2 price because he was under 10 but he ate 20 pieces of salmon sushi :p"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I go at least once a week. The poke express, AYCE & breakfast is out of this world. We've been coming for years and have literally never had an issue!"}
{"text":"First time eating there with my wife and son. Waited 15 minutes until we got called up. Once we stood up to get seated, the hostess apologized and stated that we had to wait just a bit longer because they accommodated a couple before us who wanted to occupy a 4-seat table so they can sit next to each other rather than face to face.  A total of 45 minutes passes by since we first arrive and I get the attention of a gentleman who seemed to be the manager. I asked how much longer and he states another 10 minutes. After nearly an hour of waiting, we finally get seated. The worst part, my son fell asleep during the wait time and did not get to eat while we were there. To top it off, the manager who was also our server, apparently left for the night but failed to notify another server to take over his duties of serving our table as we were left unattended for nearly 20 minutes. That was the last straw that caused us to ask for the check after only making two rounds of orders of All You Can Eat Sushi."}
{"text":"Went to eat last night with family. Got in right away great service. Mac is always very professional, very accommodating, and very down to earth. Which is great because it's not someone just bringing your food and leaving. He is one of the reasons I like to come to this sushi restaurant. He is a great ambassador and loves his job. He recommended we try the hamachi with lemon and ponzu. This was amazing! Our experience was great. Food was very fresh!"}
{"text":"Friendly girls working the cash register and took our order.  My mother in law had visited this place since moving to LV.  She enjoyed the food and taken many other relatives there.    I ordered the kimchee saimin and regular saimin for my daughter and I. My daughter had the mini Teri beef. She LOVED IT!!   We normally go to Aloha Specialities @California Hotel in dwtwn, but they also have a location in Downtown.... We may have found a NEW place to eat!!"}
{"text":"well we are always on the hunt for Ono local food. someone recommended us to try island sushi. it's a little drive from our house but hey, it's Friday lol.   was glad it wasn't busy there. my wife ordered the fried noodles with kalbi, my boys ate the mochiko chicken and I ordered the garlic chicken.   unfortunately we didn't have a chance to take a picture because it was so delicious lol!   prices aren't that bad, and portions are good.   saw the menu of the sushi and we are definitely going back to check out that side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wrong order was given so I called letting them order was wrong went back on a lunch break waited a while before I was helped only to be told they needed to refund me  before they could juSt correct my order. Had to head back to work grab my debit card then head back . Needless to say at that point I just wanted a refund no food. Waited again to just get a refund.  Which they declined even tho I had spoken to some one in regards to refund . Not only did I pay for something I didn't get but also declined refund . Definitely last time I go there"}
{"text":"The service need some improvement be more friendly the sushi are alright I give a 3 star overal"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Hawaii and grew up eating poke-EVERYTHING. Then I moved to California and had been living for 4 years with out it.   Now I'm living in Vegas and stumbled upon island sushi for some sushi, great sushi btw also, BUT then I saw the menu and they had Poke! After 4 years I've been reunited and I must say taste just like home!!!!   LOVE LOVE LOVE the spicy combo with my brown rice, SO ONO!!!   Feelin back to my roots!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Sushi restaurant in the Henderson/Vegas area.  We are soooo lucky to have moved into the area and discover this jewel. They have great service, awesomely talented sushi chefs and kitchen chefs, fresh seafood, and an innovative menu that is constantly evolving. They put a lot of thought and care into keeping their customers happy. We enjoy the \"all you can eat\" regularly because it is totally worth it.  The menu is huge so there is always something for everyone. We are also part of the rewards program that rocks!  Oh and the garlic tuna is the best :)"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for such a long time now & I can't believe I waited this long. I do live on the Westside though so it's a bit of a travel but it was worth it!   Boyfriend & I did AYCE around lunchtime. All the sushi were fresh, huge and delicious! I suggest getting the Chili Garlic Edemame as well! Service was terrific, loved the interior. Just a quaint little place with various Hawaiian decor.  Really appreciated the warm ALOOOOHA spirit, since my boyfriend & I are from Hawaii. Oh, and if you're looking for poke, look no further. Poke Express is next door!  You're welcome. :)"}
{"text":"We actually came for Poke Express but they were closed and Island was still open.  I cannot comment on the service since we were on the self serve side but the cashier was friendly and gave us her recommendations.    Good: Avocado/Poke Bowl - your standard poke bowl which really hits the spot when you're hungry. Puahana Roll  Decent: Ox tail soup - the ox tail itself was good well and the meat just fell off the bones.  The soup itself though tasted like soy sauce and water."}
{"text":"Love this place have been there many times and never disappointed. The all you can eat a long with the bottomless Japanese beer is a great deal."}
{"text":"We found this place from some of our friends who took pictures of the food and posted it on their FB. We are happy they did! The Poke Express was def. different for me. Never ordered ahi poke to go like that.  We ordered a quarter lb of the poke furikake, hawaiian, and the spicy poke. Decent priced.   We also ordered to go... the teriyaki beef with noodle combo & the garlic chicken combo. I kinda felt like i should have asked, \"can i have some beef with my noodles?\" Don't get me wrong, the noodles were good, but I felt like there was just not enough beef.... or chicken.  The staff at the Poke Express area was very very nice. But the rest of the staff behind the grill and register are kinda rude and snoody. And from reading other reviews, it seems like these people have good days and bad days. Word of advice for those moody people.... please leave your bad attitude at home. Its a good thing that the food and the Poke Express person was nice, or i would give this place two stars."}
{"text":"Not going to buy poke there again. Poke has a lot of filler, onions. It's like onion poke. Go to Hawaiian style poke in Mountain Spring road in Chinatown."}
{"text":"HOLD UP, HOLD UP. I'm actually eating their food right now as I write this review. It's THAT good.   I ordered my food for delivery and I'm so stoked to be enjoying this from my house but I cannot wait to dine in!   I ordered the oxtail soup because I saw it being raved about in the comments and trust me, the comments are REAL about this dish!! Even though I had it delivered, when I got it it was still nice and hot. They even wrapped the containers in Saran Wrap to make sure nothing spills!! I opened my container and holy, it smelled delicious. I saw 2-3 big and fatty pieces of oxtail. The cilantro and ginger came separately which I appreciated because I don't eat cilantro aha. It comes with 2 scoops of rice which tastes delicious with the soup.   I also got a side of kalbi. It's around 5 individual bone pieces. A little bit pricey imo but the flavor is really good. I'm addicted to rice so I can eat one piece with one bowl lol.  The malasada w custard is freaking BOMB. I only got one since I've never tried. But the custard is like the ones they put in asian bread and it was soft and chewy and came in it's own box.   Honestly from presentation to taste, everything was perfect! Definitely coming back really soon!"}
{"text":"Called for take out. Was on hold for 3 minutes  before calling back. Was told that order would be ready in 15-20. Drove there. Guess what. Not only was my order not done. I'm still waiting for order. Person at counter keeps telling me order will be up soon. Any way. 10 minutes and counting later....still waiting for takeout order. Thank goodness I'm not in a rush today. I hope the food is good."}
{"text":"Great authentic Hawaiian style food. Service brings this place down. Employees tend to be snippy, to downright rude. Orders frequently come out incorrect. Great food though."}
{"text":"Got an avocado poke bowl from here and it was fantastic!!! It just took a long time to get my food."}
{"text":"This review is based on purchasing poke in the back.  ***THIS PLACE IS NO LONGER POKE EXPRESS*** First off, shame on you guys for taking down the sign that Poke Express moved to a different location.  A lot of old customers does not know (including myself) that Poke Express is no longer there.  Walked in thinking it was still Poke Express.  Quality and Service was horrible.  I order some poke along with a side of rice.  My order was just sitting there while the lady behind the counter catered to new customers.  My order came out after my friends order (he ordered a poke bowl), which he had placed after me.  How hard is it to scoop some poke and rice then have a customer pay for the damn thing instead of just having it sit there? It took 20 minutes for me to get my order.  The lady (sorry), which looked and sound like a man had some major attitude.  No smile what so ever.  We're from LA and we always order a ton of poke to bring back home.  We ordered a ton of Poke to bring back home and felt robbed.    I found it \"fishy\" after tasting the quality of the poke and also the amount of time it took to get our order, that this was no longer Poke Express.  I had to yelp to find out they had moved.  Eventually went to the new location in which they had advise us Island Sushi took down their sign that they moved.  Basically taking over their business making it seem like it was still Poke Express without anyone knowing.  Shameful.  Please be aware and stay away!!!"}
{"text":"12/27/2015  Can't wait to go to Hawaii for Hawaii's beauty and now, their sushi!   Simply our favorite sushi place in the coun-tray! We had the lunch for two all you can eat. I do really appreciate and respect all the rules laid out for the all you can eat. The owners want you to value and respect all food and not throw any of it away. So, if you are going to eat. You better eat it all and within an acceptable time. All the sushi we ordered was just delicious. Picture will speak a thousand words. I will soon load one up of this great experience."}
{"text":"I pretty much like everything they have to offer...we're always doing AYCE sushi there and start off with their appetizers. My favorites are usually the ahi poke, deep fried geso, garlic chicken and shrimp tempura. My usual rolls are the Island special and my husband tries a variety of rolls. We really like the spicy tuna hand roll too and salmon skin roll. I've eaten at the grill side of the restaurant before and we love it all. Bento boxes are great for when my kids don't want to eat anything else...always top off the night with the 808 special dessert too!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am from Hawaii and love \"local\" (read: non-traditional) sushi!  I have only been in Las Vegas for about three months now, but Island Sushi is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant so far!    I always go for dinner and have never waited longer than ten minutes for two people to be seated without reservations!  However, with a bigger group, reservations are recommended.  I always opt for all-you-can-eat sushi, which is $26.95 for dinner.  It's worth it for me because after you eat a couple of rolls, you end up saving money.  However, I know not everyone has my appetite...  What's great about this restaurant is that the sushi is not overloaded with rice, HOWEVER, most orders come with about eight large pieces of sushi.  The value is there because there is a fair amount of filling and toppings, but you may be surprised with the size/amount that comes in one order!  This is the only downside.  I typically order: California Deep Fried Roll, Island Special Roll, Poke Roll, Spam Roll, and the Town & Country Roll.  Yes, all at one time.  Yes, I get my money's worth.  Yes, I gain ten pounds immediately and roll myself home.  All of them are fresh, delicious, and feature a wonderful array of flavors that complement each other perfectly (e.g. sweet, spicy, salty - yum).  Beware that they do charge $2 per piece that you do not finish.  The strategy I found to have worked best is to order everything you think you want to eat at once.  If you wait to think about it, there could be a delay in your order, and once that food begins to settle... defeat is inevitable.  If I order the aforementioned all at once (read: 40 large pieces of sushi), I am able to finish it once I get on a roll (pun intended).  Also, remember to follow-up on your rolls!  Once they didn't bring a roll that I forgot about until the end, and I was so overwhelmed.  As for dessert, I always have the 808 Special!   I just love tempura banana - something I have never had before!  My friend had the tempura ice cream, but we both agreed it wasn't as flavorful.  If you're looking for a Hawaii-feel, the ambiance is great! I believe they play KWXX radio (read: Hawaiian/local music), and everyone is extremely friendly.  I know there's a take-out portion of this restaurant as well with plate lunches, poke bowls, and the like, but I have not tried that yet.  YOU NEED TO GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Over ordered for lunch but have some snacks for later. Good flavor, but not as refined as some other local sushi places. Definite Island style. Especially liked Mickey's rice, a genuine Da Kine comfort food. AYCE prices for dinner are pretty competitive. Will try again. Service could be just a little more responsive. Not really too bad, but the wait staff could be a little more tuned in the customers' needs. Only thing that kept me from grading 4 stars. So 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating.   There are two parts to Island Sushi. One side of the business is a sit down sushi and grill joint with well spaced tables and a sushi bar. The other side is primarily a take out \"Poke Express\" that serves up different varieties of poke and other goodies, think Island Style small plates. We only tried the lunch time a la carte sushi side. Definitely will try the Island Style take out on a different occasion. If we can find some taro chips to go with the poke, it will be like the Princeville grocery on the north coast of Kauai. Looking forward to checking out Poke Express.   One tip if you plan to go. Parking is not good. Island Sushi is in an Eastern Ave strip mall with inadequate parking. Quite a few of the spaces are marked \"30 mins only\" and \"15 mins only\". We just had to ignore that and parked in a 30 minute spot. Another parking anomaly is that the handicapped parking was at the back of the parking lot. Never saw that before. Regardless, solving the parking dilemma is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, Island Sushi is AMAZING!!! My husband and I go here on a regular basis and we have never received bad service or mediocre food.  With both Sushi and Hawaiian food we don't need to look elsewhere.  Give it a try and you won't be sorry.  The only thing I will recommend is that you make reservations even if you don't think you'll need them.  This place is always busy and if you even hope to try their amazing Sunday Brunch you need to reserve a spot."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, the \"all you can eat\" is a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I been longing for malasadas since we visited Leonard's in Honolulu in 2015 and glad to find out that island sushi sells malasadas! We made it a point to check this place out while in Vegas. Called and placed the order in and picked 1/2 dozen up in 20 minutes. We couldn't wait and ate them right outside of the restaurant. They were hot and fluffy.  May not be as original as leonard's but they were very very good!!! Definitely will visit again when in Vegas again!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I called in to order, the girl working there suggested I try the Katsu Spam Musubi in addition to the regular spam musubi. She said it was really popular...so I did. It was yummy. The spam is fried like chicken katsu before it is rolled in the seaweed. It's more heavy than the regular spam...so I'm going to stick with the basics but I appreciated the suggestion! Prices seem low, which is an added bonus!   The people working here have always been friendly. I also noticed it's busy, so that's a good sign! One night I went in for sushi and there was a 45 minute wait. The sushi side of the restaurant is extremely small and it was packed! The other side of the restaurant (when you first walk in) is for non sushi items and it was busy as well. I think this is always a good sign, especially in this random little strip mall. The sushi was decent, not great. I will stick to the other menu items.  My favorites are the spam musubi, which is usually why I go here! Most times, I place a to go order for just this. I have also tried to kalbi ribs and teriyaki chicken, they are pretty good. I would def recommend calling ahead because even the line to place an order can be kind of ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Need to offer daily!!! So excited to find a place that has oxtail soup! Complete w/ginger, green onions & rice. A hearty meal in itself. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Honestly wouldn't even rate this restaurant after tonight. My husband and I have been coming for years and usually sit at the sushi bar which has always been great. This time we sat at the tables and not 1 employee out of probably 6 didn't even acknowledge us. We stood there for a solid 8 mins with no word from any employee!   After we got seated, took another 10 mins for our waitress to come to the table. She finally came over took our orders for all you can eat. My husband only likes California rolls and is from Maryland and loves crab! The crab was so filled with mayo it was terrible! We ended up eating everything cause we were starved besides maybe 3 pieces of one of my rolls that had imitation crab in it. I picked around it.   Server came back and said she would charge us $2 each piece because everything needs to be consumed not just parts of it. Listen I get it, but when it's full of mayo and doesn't taste good (which I told the server) you should prob just take the $6 off the bill as a gesture and not try and argue with us. The female \"manager\" came back with our check (which had the $6 charge on it) and said there's nothing she can do because it's the owners who implement that rule. My husband and I both work in hospitality and thinks it's crazy that not only wouldn't she take off the charge she laugh at us! At that point I couldn't even talk I had to walk out and left my husband to just pay the check and leave.  It was definitely our fault for not saying something about the taste of the crab in the first place.. But everything that happened tonight I will never go back and I will make sure to tell my friends about what poor \"laughing\" customer service they provide. Well you got your $6 bucks! Hope it was worth it versus having repeat customers. I will be taking my business elsewhere. I advice...hire new staff."}
{"text":"My sister was craving sushi so my cousin from Hawaii brought us here. We entered through the Grill side and they asked us if we wanted to order from the grill or have sushi. We stood there debating for probably 5 minutes.  I wanted both! So we sat for sushi and ordered from both kitchens. They definitely have good Hawaiian comfort food and their sushi was fresh.  They're desserts are ono too! I had a guava cake.  The prices were fair and the menu extensive.The service was very friendly and quick.  All your favorite Hawaiian dishes and sushi. If you're in the Silverado Ranch/Eastern area this is a good spot to bring the family."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi joint in Vegas. All rolls are half price at 8pm on Sunday! You can taste and see the care and passion they put into their rolls here."}
{"text":"We eat here once a week for their Happy Hour & it never disappoints! I especially love that their HH is extended to the weekends! We have our \"usual\" & it's consistently good every time!   My boyfriend gets: - Salmon Sashimi w/ Orgasm Sauce - Salmon Lovers Roll - sometimes he'll order something different!   I ALWAYS get the Crunch Roll. I find myself craving it throughout the week. I'm not a sashimi fan, so I do stick with what I'm comfortable with.   As far as service goes, everyone is always friendly & smiling. They make you feel comfortable. Sandy will usually come to our table & say what's up; it's nice when the staff recognizes you!   I love this place. You have to try it! Oh, & the desserts...to die for. 808 Special & the Tempura Fried Ice Cream. Oh myyyy."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi in a modest setting. AYCE option is great for those who love nigiri and handrolls. They have happy hour for the rolls too (50% off) which is great for people who love roles. Service can be slow since they're always busy but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Dined in with a few friends. Food was normal sushi but since its more on the island side vs japanese side they didnt have the sauces I normally have with my sushi. Also, I ordered teryaki chicken to go for my fiance. It took about an 45 min- hour to receive it. Our original waitress never checked  back with me about it. Finally a waiter came by so I could ask him why my togo order was taking so long. Finally a 3rd waitress brought it, no apology. My fiance thought the chicken was good but not teryaki sauce with it. If service was better, id consider going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by before going to the airport to fly back home.  We ordered some Poke from Poke Express, who are located in the rear of Island Sushi.  Ordered a mini Kalua and Cabbage, spam musubi and some Malasadas for dessert.  I was a bit disappointed with the potato/mac salad, since it was a bit bland.  The kalua and cabbabe was good as was the spam musubi.  Filled the malasadas with custard and chocolate, which are always a great way to cap-off a meal.    Service was friendly and quick.  I'll have to try some other dishes upon my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is good but there is a big problem for me when it comes to the poke....they do not use aloha shoyu in their poke...reeaally! And when you ask them to they have stink face."}
{"text":"ISG is one of several sushi and hawaiian eats options along Eastern, but as far as I know, it's the only one with a happy hour that includes half-off cut rolls. Came by recently to check it out and recognized the interior, vaguely recalling a previous takeout order. Menu is large, with AYCE and a la carte options that include the usual apps, nigiri, and rolls plus poke and various hawaiian specialties.   Food was fresh across the board- eggplant fries were freshly fried, fish in my rolls was fresh, and everything came out quickly. The rolls themselves, though ordered from the specialty section, were not as impressive as elsewhere (presentation, size) but it was a decent meal. What did impress me was that the service was among the best I've received at an AYCE spot, with nearly every server in the dining room checking on me at least once even though I was sitting at the bar, where I am used to being forgotten elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food really good here, the service is great and they're from Hawaii.  Nothing I like more is to support Hawaii residents spreading the Aloha and our culture.  The mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, shrimp tempura  and sushi is all good!  The green tea ice cream and the 808 Special is good for dessert.  I think after 7 or 8 it's 50% off sushi."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of people back in October & we all ordered the All You Can Eat Menu. Service was good. Food was great. The restaurant always seems busy & that brought out an awkward moment as this big brute guy started yelling at another customer that apparently had jumped in front of him in the waiting line. The management didn't seem to try to do anything to stop the yelling as the big brute yelled at multiple customers for over 5 minutes. It caused a serious uncomfortable setting for everyone in the venue."}
{"text":"Regret #1-forgot to take pictures of the beautifully red ahi poke bowl accompanied with sesame seasoned cucumber and topped with taro chips! Deliciousness! Children enjoyed the oversized loco moco and won ton min. Such a wonderful treat for Hawaii locals in Vegas.  Even ran into some friends from Hawaii!"}
{"text":"When not partying on the strip I enjoy eating around town. I found Island Sushi through yelp and decided to make a late night stop for some ahi poke salad.   FOOD:  The quality and freshness of the to-go AHI POKE SALAD was very good, but I prefer poke with no suji or at least less pieces than I got in my serving. There's just something about ruining quality poke with pieces of suji to chew on. It was late so maybe that's all they had left to serve.   The next time I return to Island Sushi I will definitely give the ahi poke another try, definitely do the AYCE option, and order the highly spoken of garlic chicken. I would of never guessed that was a highlighted item there!   A-OK for now but for sure an update to four stars....soon!"}
{"text":"Superb Sushi!  It's pretty ridiculous how much I enjoyed their sushi.  We decided to try them for lunch since it was recommended by friends. The right side of the restaurant opens at 11:30.  We chose to sit at the sushi counter in front of chef Jason.  He was friendly and quick in preparation.  We had a great lunch thanks to him!   Since they have AYCE, it worked best for us to try several different creations.  Jason suggested the Hamachi which is yellowtail.  In the first bite there was a unique flavor.  We asked him what it was.  They combine orange and lemon into the yellowtail for this distinct flavor.  We immediately loved it.    The 007 was our second choice.  Crab and cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado and eel sauce certainly made this a winner.    The Island Special with soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce did not disappoint.  Incredible flavors from each roll this far!   The cherry on top was our final order of the Baked Salmon.  This is a California roll topped with cream cheese, salmon and dynamite.  It just melted in your mouth.    I cannot wait to come back and try some of their other choices.  I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"5 star for the best ahi poki!! Loved the spicy masago and the lumi seaweed ahi poki! Tasted so fresh and not slimy or fishy at all! The loco moco was a tad bland and green tea mocbi was meh. The bento box was awesome - sprinkled rice, fried noodle, chicken teriyaki, oxtail spring roll, yellow cucumber, shrimp and vegetable tempura and a slice of spam and mac salad! They do have sushi bar next room and all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Love both sides, the grill and the sit down restaurant. The food is great along with the service. I love having a place close to home that reminds me of growing up in Hawai'i where I can pick up a plate lunch.   My mom raves about the Teri beef because it reminds her of my late grandpa's secret recipe. Anytime we have out of town guests, we always bring them here."}
{"text":"First time visit, AYCE for two.  Server was very friendly & food was pretty good.  Atmosphere was ok, but not date-worthy (down home, mom and pop vibe).  All around excellent value, with excellent service.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously the most delicious rolls I have ever had. The fish is fresh, the people are really sweet. I love the atmosphere. Its like fusion Sushi/Hawaiian food. Everytime I visit Vegas this is one of my top places to stop and eat at.   The food is super affordable because they have happy hour, like every day. I believe Tuesday is Happy Hour all day, so half off their rolls.   My favorites are the Island Special Roll and Spicy Mexican. Their garlic edemame is super delicious. Also they have these amazing noodles when you order from the Hawaiian part of the menu, they are so yummy.   If you are in the area, stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"3 star service but I actually like this place!  I've eaten next door multiple times for the Hawaiian food and came with friends to get poke but never got around trying the AYCE here..  Looks run down and outdated which had me iffy about the place before .. But it was the closes sushi joint from the gym so I gave them a chance.  We ordered.. Puhi Maki Roll (daily special) - spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish on top with garlic ponzu sauce (Very Tasty!) Salmon Skin Handrolls - crispy salmon skin, just enough sauce and not too much rice wrapped in seaweed (DELICIOUS!) Raw Crab Poke - fiancé got this, looked appetizing and plentiful but I wasn't daring enough to try it.. Eggplant Fries - crispy, sliced, battered eggplant came with Spicy Miso Sauce, which I think didn't really compliment it, but I'm one who doesn't really care for dipping sauces. Baked Salmon Roll - it was good but nothing special about it, loved that it didn't have so much rice nor cheese on top!  Tofu Poke - so simple, yet sooo good! Fried tofu in their poke sauce with onions! (SOOO GOOD! Lol) Malasada Sundae - the malasada (aka Hawaiian donut) tasted like cardboard, was dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for days.. Strawberries were sweet and the vanilla ice cream.. Was just ice cream.. Not a fan.  Sushi chefs were attentive but the waiters/waitresses were not.. Service was slow from the waiters, i.e. took almost an hour to get my eggplant fries.. Bit of a turn off..  Overall satisfied with my meal and will def come back for the salmon skin handroll and tofu poke!"}
{"text":"I haven't left the restaurant yet but I'm so compelled to write this review.  This place is the BOMB!! Food is fresh and delicious and the service is even better. Our server Mac was super efficient, timely, and attentive. I am SO GLAD we came here. We will definitely be back. Everyone needs to give this place a try if you're in the area. Mahalo!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the sushi portion of dinner. The restaurant is located on Eastern past Serene, but before Richmar. If you get up to BJs, you've gone too far. Inside of the restaurant is sectioned off in to two areas. Entrance area seems to be designated for traditional Hawaiian grilled dishes, and the area thru the door on the right is the sit down sushi area. We came here on a Friday night and it was packed. They do have a wide selection of AYCE sushi and many sides to choose from (although the sides appear to be half of what you'd get if you were ordering a la carte).  The AYCE menu has two symbols that denote different things. Chopsticks next to the item indicate it is a dinner only item, while the sushi icon indicates it is one order per person.  The rolls were fine and fish relatively fresh. One thing to note is their speciality rolls were in fact not drenched in Yum sauce or mayo concoctions of any sort. A lot of what we ordered had their garlic sauce on the roll itself, and I wasn't a fan. It tasted like gin ...I know strange.    We sample several rolls: Joe's Special, Black Widow, Spicy Mexican, Lava Lover, Lasagna, Surf and Turf. I also had their scallop mayo and salmon nigiri. The salmon was fresh, the scallop mayo was very bland and forgettable. My favorite roll of the group was Spicy Mexican, the rest were decent, but nothing I would rush to eat again.  The service was fine, minus the initial hiccup. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our first three rolls to the table. I know that it wasn't our servers fault, and it was pretty packed in there. They didn't bring it out roll by roll so we had food coming throughout, instead they waited for all rolls to be made before they brought them out. I guess it makes more sense that way, especially with being so packed.  So although, famished by the time we got the food, I won't hold it against them.  I would recommend this place is you want more simple, non yum sauce heavy rolls with fresh fish and friendly service."}
{"text":"Pretty decent to get your AYCE sushi fix. My fiance and I ate by the sushi bar and based off the random rolls and nigiri pieces we picked out, I thought this place was \"ok\" as I judge my sushi by quality over quantity. (Though, I will say, it is expected that quality does go slightly down in an AYCE sushi place compared on one that isn't AYCE so my opinion might not be too fair.)  Finishing off my meal with the 808 dessert was quite a treat. The service didn't stand out to me and the inside of the restaurant doesn't appear to be anything special either.   On one last note, I do order breakfast with Island Sushi more frequently than I do sushi and love their menu. I usually order a two egg plate and malasadas. Their malasadas are made to order. I thought their malasadas are \"ok\" as well; it tastes too dense for me and the custard filled one kinda tastes like instant jello pudding mix."}
{"text":"The best place in Las Vegas for great Hawaiian food. You can either grab something to go in the take out section which offers amazing traditional Hawaiian dishes or you can dine in at the restaurant side. My suggestion is to sit at the sushi bar and do the all you can eat for $26. You honestly can't beat the price for what items you can get. I recommend the ahi poke, joe's special roll and some Teri beef! Make sure not to skip out on dessert. Get the 808 special with tempura bananas! Staff is also amazing. I've never had anything short of a perfect visit and I hope it remains that way."}
{"text":"If you're going to go to an all-you-can-eat Japanese place, then this is definitely it. This restaurant is not buffet style but continuously ordering food from the menu style. The sushi here is really fresh, the food is great, and the service is awesome too. When I came here, the waiter even gave me a discount too because the sushi was taking a bit longer than usual to come out from the kitchen since the place was packed and the kitchen was a bit backed up. They even have my favorite chuka seaweed salad here too which you can order as much as you want.  Keep in mind there is a time limit on how long you can eat. I think it was 1.5 hours but I'm not sure if they will enforce it or not. Also, you can only have 1 order per person for the sweet shrimp and uni sushi.  Excellent food, excellent service, and not overpriced. Make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years thinking the back of the restaurant is \"Poke Express.\" Today I went here thinking I would get fresh poke just like the north location and just like every other time I came here. Unfortunately there was a big change and I didn't realize Poke Express was no longer there. It looks exactly like Poke Express same setup and all,  but according to Yelp they moved? I got a poke bowl. The employee helping me was already wearing a glove when he came up to me to ask what I would like to order. I noticed him sweating, which always grosses me out because that means sweat has to be wiped and it is usually with a hand or arm. Gross. I ordered by bowl and he used the hand with the glove to make the poke bowl packing in the lettuce multiple times with that gloved hand. Later he took my cash with that same hand with the glove. I sat down and saw he still had on the glove and began to wipe down the area where food was being served. Then he proceeded to take a woman's order after me using that same glove that touched money, a dirty rag, and who knows what else! So disgusting! I am highly disappointed because Poke Express was my go to poke spot when I wanted poke that reminded me of Hawaii. It appears this poke spot is in the same location but the owner is the same for the whole store. I asked someone at the front and they confirmed it is not a different business. I called and spoke to a manager after and he said he would talk to the guy and that he is new but honestly there is no excuse. People can get really sick and I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with my family which is a big group.  We decided to get separate checks to keep it easier for both the staff and us.   The food came out relatively quickly but we had no way of remembering who ordered what (as is common with big sushi orders).  My end of the table continually received tons of sushi to the point where we asked if it was a mistake.  The server kept saying that this was what we ordered even after suggesting several times that perhaps it was for the other end of our large party who hadn't received most of the sushi they had ordered.  Since there is a time limit and a per piece charge for uneaten sushi we cancelled the remaining order for our end of the table.   Meanwhile, the other end of the table had only received one of the rolls out of the 5-6 they had ordered.  When it was brought to the servers attention, she said that it was coming.....but still didn't put it together that our end of the table had gotten way more than we ordered.   So, long story short, the owner came out and pretty much said \"too bad\" and that they could order more since it was all you can eat...  We were already past the 90 minute limit and most of the party was done eating.  Reality is that they were just unaccommodating.  The sushi was fine and the price was right...but I felt bad that some of our party left hungry and they still paid the same amount as the rest of us who were full of sushi."}
{"text":"I knew about Island Sushi and Grill because I order from their Poke Express every time I am in Vegas.  In addition to the poke I would order, I would sometimes order from the grill:   - Katsu musubi:  the spam is breaded with the same breading they use for chicken katsu.  Adds a yummy crunch to the block of delicious goodness that is spam, rice and sauce.   -  Goteburg musubi - The portuguese sausage also with rice. Yum! -  Malasadas - like a creme filled donut.    Ive recently also had them cater my sister's bachelorette party which was held at the Vdara.  Their catering menu is available online.  I ordered a small tray (feeds about 10-15 people) each of the:    -  kalbi ($70):  good quality beef perfectly grilled. No sogginess or rubberiness. -  chicken katsu ($36):  Still even crunchy after it was delivered.  -  garlic chicken ($36) :  So simple yet so flavorful -  mac salad ($24) and rice ($17): must haves when ordering Hawaiian food.  I also ordered 6 pounds of the amazing poke.  My order was delivered to the hotel at the time I had requested and without any issues.  I received a call when they were on their way and when the food arrived at the hotel.  The poke was delivered on ice.  Everything was delicious - as expected - and a big hit with the ladies.  I was a bit nervous that it would be too much food for 14 girls, but the small trays turned out to be the perfect amount.  We had enough for dinner, for a late night meal after hitting the club, and even for breakfast!    Needless to say, I highly recommend Island Sushi for a nice meal and/or for catered events."}
{"text":"First time there. Have been working our way through this part of Henderson looking for the 'right' sushi place. As it is now, that place is I Love Sushi, and after tonight, still remains. Island is a hard to describe place. Seems to be two or three joints in one. But, we were there for sushi. The atmosphere/decor is pretty basic. We saw tonight , which I now see is true of a couple of nights, all cut rolls were half price. So, we ordered away. All in all, did not find it that compelling. Mostly everything seemed pretty bland. Even spicy tuna, which should be good for a little pizazz, was tasteless. For us, it was OK, but no better, and not in the cards for a second visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went with a friend to AYCE and we both loved it! We live in Anthem and we usually go to I love Sushi (which is expensive and not AYCE) Or Yama but it will change now, since this place is so close. All the sushi we got was fresh and you can taste and feel the freshness. The vibe was really nice, with smooth reggae playing around. The staff was really nice. Our waitress was so nice we talked and asked questions and she was great all around. After stuffing our faces with sushi we got the 808 special. And usually when you get all you can eat they give you a piece of mochi cut in half or a sad excuse of a scoop of ice cream but the 808 special was a satisfying scoop of ice cream, tempura bananas, fresh strawberries, heap of whipped cream, and chocolate drizzle and it was perfection. The perfect end to a perfect dinner. with my drink my total was $28 which is completely reasonable. PS, when you buy 2 AYCE you get free sake. I don't know if it was everyday but it was nice."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5  but because we got bad service from our waiter I have to go with 4  We walked in and the place is split into two parts, dinning in and dine out. We stood for 10 mins looking confused because no one talked to us. I walk into the dine in part and stood in the middle and was finally  noticed to be seated.  I asked a lot of questions and the waiter did help explan but that was it. He didnt tell us specials which the other waitress did. We never saw him again. He never once came to ask if everything was OK and if he did come over, I had to wave him down. All the other waitress were nice and kind to check on us but I was disappointed our own waiter did not care. He checked  all other tables but never came to ours.  I will come back for the food because it was amazing but if we get him again, I will request for someone else. It's a small thing but he ruined my mood and that is something a waiter should never do if they want customers to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Poke from Poke Express tasted really fresh and lots of variety to choose from.   I also ordered the Loco Moco and it was HUGE. Such large portions and great price as well!  The only disappointment was the spam musubi. We ordered the regular and that spam katsu musubi, and felt that there was lacking flavor. It was overpacked with rice, the slice of spam was tiny, and there wasn't any sauce on the inside. We ended up dipping our musubi with our loco moco gravy just to get some more flavor. There was so much rice in one of my musubi's that the seaweed didn't even wrap all the way around :("}
{"text":"I wasn't happy with my experience. I ordered Portuguese sausage loco moco- waited about 15 minutes just to get spam loco moco. Ordered garlic shrimp plate and there was no taste to it. The macaroni salad was so bland- also no taste. I left still hungry :( I won't be eating here again, but I will come back for the poke though every once in a while cuz it's $16 per pound- wwooww, but it's onolicious. I would give it a 1 star but the poke is delicious so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok. i prefer not to go to AYCE places, because the fish is not the freshest. Also, sometimes the service sucks really bad, if you are not sitting at the bar. Prices are about average for AYCE joint.   If you want better sushi then go to Momo Sushi."}
{"text":"Simply very good fresh sushi, the 50% off helps a lot as it makes a great price point ! Very fresh and amazing MISO soup."}
{"text":"All I can say is that if you miss Hawaii, just come here. Plate lunches, poke, AYCE sushi and tons of locals. Always busy, always fresh. Like I never left home..."}
{"text":"Horrible !!!! This time my roll of sushi was half the size of the last time I ordered. Just because they were busy doesn't mean you had to cut the size of the roll. I felt like I got ripped off!!"}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite sushi place in the Las Vegas area. Had done different items like the spam n eggs roll, holy crap it was good! The beef sliders was great, hell it was all good. I will definitely be back...T"}
{"text":"This review is based on their Grill Section of the restaurant.  Been coming here and having lunch with the girls often since it's closer to their work.Their prices are pretty reasonable.  This last trip there, I had their bento box combo with Teri beef and mochiko chicken. Both the teri beef and mochiko chicken was a tad on a sweeter side. I did enjoyed it and my son enjoyed the noodles that come with it.  I had their saimin (previous trip) and it's not the greatest saimin I've had...  Overall, the food, I give it a 3 1/2 stars. Service is more of a 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this location. I go to this place only when I'm near the area. So this time I had a 9 stamps on my card and it was my wife and I, we were suppose to get a free all you can eat. But all of the sudden they no longer honor the stamp card I had. The waitress was nice about it when she saw mi reaction, she offer to call me back the next day after she talked to the owner. But guess what? there was never a call back. There is no expiration on that card or anything that said that is only good for Certain time."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to leave a Yelp review typically, but I was so dissatisfied with their service that I felt the need to voice my opinion. I walked in at 9:30 (30 minutes before they are supposed to stop seating people). The hostess told me that all you can eat has ended already but told me I can still order sushi rolls for half price. We ended up sitting down anyways and I order 2 rolls... But then I try to order more and they refused to serve me. They said that they already put the food away and they are done making food for the night, yet there was still 20 minutes left to order food. They didn't even warn me that they were closing the sushi bar or offer to make me anything else before closing down. The sushi wasn't bad but I was extremely disappointed with the customer service. They lied to us and were too lazy to even serve me when they were supposed to be open. Worst service I have ever had. Next time I'm hungry for sushi I'll make sure Island Sushi is my last resort."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and they keep me coming back every time. The owner is around often and I've seen him build the business. The food is amazing. The price is perfect. The chefs are great at creating dishes for those who are picky and recently they've added a weekly specials menu to their all you can eat. If you're looking for a great environment it's the place for you. Make sure you stop by between 1130 and 3 on Sundays and do their brunch. You're missing out if you don't."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. It was a Friday night and really busy but we were still seated almost immediately and proceeded to get astounding service throughout the entire meal. The sushi itself is delectable. The chef is phenomenal and incredibly personable. Everything was great here. I highly recommend for lunch or dinner any day."}
{"text":"First off, I love Island Sushi. The women in my office order nearly every Saturday from the Eastern location. The food is always fresh & delicious. BUT, it seems like every time we order there is some new rule about items included with your meal. 1st order of Teishoku Combo B, no dessert was provided or even mentioned. 2nd order of Teishoku Combo B, any dessert was an option. 3rd order of Teishoku Combo B, was told we did not have a choice of the type of dessert & was provided Plain Malasadas. There just does not seem to be much consistency. Most of the staff members are wonderful to deal with but others seem to believe they're doing you a favor by taking your order. If the food was not so great, I would definitely be going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the poke here because I had heard such great things about the place. Unfortunately, today the service was REEEEAAAALLLY slow... Even though I called ahead to order pick up 20 minutes before. My food was still not ready after an additional 10 minutes of waiting. Poke was not that great, but it could have been that the steam from the rice started to cook it as I was driving to my destination."}
{"text":"I would like to give a big thank you to Terry the owner & his team for making my son's birthday a wonderful celebration at your restaurant. The food was delicious and prompt, and the drinks just kept flowing. Everyone had a great time and loved the food and service.   This place is awesome and recommend to all who are looking to eating some Ono sushi and great service!!!   Kudos to the Island Sushi Grill Team!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe our mistake was going on a Saturday night, or having the high expectation of cleanliness when consuming raw fish. We were here for five minutes. The hostess offered to seat us at the sushi bar because that was the only seating available. We said sure. Upon seating down my sense went into overdrive.   First: My chair was rocking back and forth and felt like it could collapse at any moment.  Second: The fish in front of us, the fish being used to make sushi, was not looking so hot.  Third: The smell coming from the fish made me sick to my tummy.  Fourth: The view we had of the kitchen, the one preparing raw fish, was dirty, dirty, dirty.  That was all it took. My husband looked at me, we both said \"okay\", got up and walked out."}
{"text":"I don't want to be a \"sushi snob\", buuuut.... This place was definitely subpar compared to some spots I have been. I actually picked this place to have lunch because of the other good Yelp ratings-- I don't see what all the hype is about. Sat at the bar, chef & servers were really nice & helpful, but felt like the rolls were made very sloppy (if that makes sense). Atmosphere is really BLAH. Barely any differences between the rolls. Absolutely nothing special, about the rolls or this place; in general..."}
{"text":"We live nearby and always get the garlic chicken plate, kal bi plate, kim chee fried rice, Da Hawaiian breakfast plate, or the breakfast sandwich w/portuguese sausage.  DA BEST ONO KINE GRINDS :)  Can't wait to try their AYCE sushi one of these days!"}
{"text":"Tried the sit down location.  Food is good value - you get alot for your money.  The service was super slow, however.  Friendly vibe.  Decent tasting food."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch usually..  Roast pork with Gravy Spicy Tuna Bowl Salmon Skin Bowl  Bento Box with Garlic Chicken  ...are my go-tos.   The minus one star is that it usually takes a good 15 minutes for things and there is only one cashier running the spot on its own. Other than that never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they do not know how to properly prepare spam musubi. The Nori is not supposed to have a paper like consistency when served. It's really not that hard."}
{"text":"This place is really good. There's two sides, the Hawaiian food side and the sushi side. The Hawaiian food side also has two counters, one for just poke and one for all other menu items. They've got plate lunches, saiman, loco moco, bento boxes, chicken katsu, garlic chicken, kalbi, all the usual dishes you'd expect. The poke counter has a lot of choices, even if they run out in the evening they can make you some if you ask.  The poke is good and fresh and very similar to what we would get in Oahu. The sushi side is good as well, they do AYCE and also have a good brunch. You should also check out the desserts, they got pretty good malasadas and mochi. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Just moved to vegas and we have been trying all the Hawaii flavor eateries.  They have 2 sides to the restaurant the sushi side and then the plate lunch side we did not know that but we were able to order from borh sides in the dining sushi side.  Food was great service great and you can order poi 9 dollars delivery on thursday. Will be back"}
{"text":"First time here and I wasn't impressed at all.  The food was just normal and plain.  The seaweed salad looked sloppy on the plate the salmon lover roll tasted like lemon more then anything and fish was not fresh.. This will be my last time here.  The servers were aright but overall I'll take my business else were"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places. We order a special roll which had scallops in it. My friend took one bite and had to spit it out. It was super fishy and stale. When it came to the bill the manager informed us we had to pay for the uneaten scallop roll. We told him it was inedible, he informed us that they charge $2 a piece for the uneaten roll even if it is inedible. WTF. Will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is \"The bombdotcom.\" Everytime we come to visit Las Vegas, this is a MUST STOP!!! Everything you eat and order is so amazing. The freshest of desserts too. It's a perfect eatery away from home... Thank you island sushi for always taking care of us with your beautiful Aloha and Hawaiian hospitality!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Staff was super friendly and provided fast service. I ordered the oyako don which didn't have a whole lot if flavor and was overcooked. My son had katsu which was pretty good. Price was reasonable but again, food was just okay."}
{"text":"GREAT POKI! Love this place to get your sushi fix quick."}
{"text":"Currently, our favorite go-to restaurant. Both sides of the restaurant are satisfactory. Then why four instead of five stars? Because it's not a \"knock your socks off\" experience. Four stars for us is still a lot of love  though. We will probably continue going here on an almost weekly basis. I highly recommend making a reservation for the sushi side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I love sushi and even though I'm not an expert with it the wait staff is always willing to explain and give pointers.  My husband is a huge fan of the Loco mocha and orders it almost every time. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! The sushi is amazing! I'm definitely going to be a returning patron :)  the only reason i'm giving four stars and not five is because when i ate lunch there me and my mom were excited about the lunch special where all rolls were HALF off. wow! however, after ordering several rolls and stuffing ourselves to the brim..we asked for a box to take the rest home. here's the catch: it's half off, but if you don't finish, sorry. you can't take it home. it's considered a \"dine-in only\" special..this makes sense from a monetary stance i guess. however, it would've been more polite for the waitress to have informed us of that PRIOR to ordering about this little rule."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great upbeat staff which you can understand when they speak to you. The poke is great. The big  island roll is fab. Must try the spicy mexican if you like spicy rolls."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a great happy hour, amazing service & excellent food. Our server is always Mac and he deserves some recognition. He is always beyond sweet & attentive. Even when they are busy he makes sure to keep checking up on us. He's the best!"}
{"text":"Great spot for fresh authentic Hawaiian poke! (When entering, their fresh poke is straight ahead).  This restaurant actually consists of 3 different venders sharing a space. Into the separate room is the actually island sushi sit down restaurant. They offer AYCE sushi, which is good, not my favorite, but still yummy. I do love that they have many Hawaiian dishes and styled sushi!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, Hawiian food as authentic as it gets, and really fresh poke for when you're on the run. The staff is really sweet, and service is quick. My favorite Hawaiian restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"this place is split in two.. you can have a sit down hawaiian style meal and walk into the other side for some sushi..   Hawaiian Side: LOVE LOVE LOVE the ahi poke.. and u can get a pound for like 12.00.  the food is very good!!!  when i order to go i usually order the kalbi short ribs and katsu which comes with yummy macaroni salad. it's always good and fresh off the grill..  and we always have left overs.  malasadas and desserts = primo!  it's really small when dining in on the sushi side, but the sushi is good so it's worth it.   i've only been here once, but i can say that the fish is very very fresh and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"My family always tries to come here when we're in Vegas. $26.95 for AYCE sushi dinner?! TOTALLY WORTH ITTTT. They don't have just sushi, they have other side dishes like mochiko chicken, kalbi, udon, edamame, etc. They pretty much have EVERYTHING :)  I recommend the Hamachi Kama (grilled hamachi collar). It's limited one per person during dinner time, so you definitely have to order it! I love getting the Salmon, Tuna, and Hamachi nigiri. For dessert, get the 808 Special (Tempura Banana) or the Malasada Sundae. Soooo bomb  Honestly everything here is SOOO GOOD. One of my favorite AYCE's in Vegas. It's a sit down sushi restaurant and you don't have to get the AYCE option but I highly recommend it. They also have a grill side of the restaurant where they have other choices of foods. Also check out Poke Express!"}
{"text":"Alright as a newbie here in the LV my friend Jenn brought me here with a bunch of her friends to eat. Def. a warm welcome to Vegas as i just moved here 2 days prior to this dinner. I must say the food is definitely awesome and reminds me of home but then of course the owners are from Hawaii!!! Huge fan of the place and the owners are great as well. The food selection is huge and the prices cant be beat especially if you do buffet style for 20 some what dollar's. The service is also on point here and the staff is definitely super friendly and i would totally tell my friends to come here for there sushi cravings!  I do wish this place was closer to me then i would go a little more often haha but no matter, its still worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"If you craving Hawaiian food this is the place to come..plus you can grab poke too! Cheeeee!"}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but great things about this sushi place. I've been dying to try if for myself. I called to make sure happy hour was still going on. I was told yes, until 10pm. I show up at 9:35pm party of 4 for happy hour and was told last called was at 9:30pm. At this point I was highly upset as I was lied to over the phone. I was told happy hour is until 10pm show up at 9:35pm and was told last call was at 9:30pm. NOT COOL. The guy at the front didn't even care and just laughed at us. We decided to leave and headed to I LOVE SUSHI instead."}
{"text":"Picked this place from the array of recommended sushi buffets because it sounded excellent  and there was a longer time limit on eating. I don't eat more, just slower.  I must have been there about the 90 minute limit but they were still encouraging me to eat more. Great choice! Divine ahi poke salad, one of my favorites.  Don't miss the garlic chicken. The fish was really fresh and the portions generous."}
{"text":"Terrible communication and customer service! I called to place a phone order for pick up later today. Then I called a second time to add to my order. Neither time did the person who took my order (two different people) mention that I needed to provide a credit card number, nor ask me for a credit card, nor tell me payment was needed before the food would be prepared. Only when my husband went to pick up the order, did they start cooking the order. Yes, I realize this makes absolutely no sense. Why would someone call in an order if the restaurant only started cooking the order once you've arrived and paid? Why waste your time even calling ahead?  I left my phone number so they could've called me to ask for a credit card, if one was needed. I would've happily left a credit card number to save the 15-20 minutes waiting there for my order to be prepared, if only they asked for one.  I will never be ordering catering or take out from them again."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing and so full of flavor!! Our server Shayne was very helpful and professional. Food came out in a timely manner and the whole experience was lovely. Thank you Shayne for fast, efficient and friendly service"}
{"text":"Food was gross. The fish tasted sour and the rice tasted like it's been sitting out for a couple days. When I told the wait staff he said let me get her (her being Roxanne). Roxanne came over and asked \"is everything okay\"? My husband and I both said no everything is not okay. She then asked what was wrong and we stated that the fish tasted sour and the rice tasted like it has been sitting out for a couple of days. Instead of being apologetic she said \"well the rice was made this morning, I know I was here and I'm not going to charge you for the extra for the leftovers\" with an attitude I might add. We asked for our bill and I told her we are not coming back and I did not give her a tip. You would think with our complaint they would have given us a discount or something. So I will not be coming back and I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Despite my anticipation going in, I was underwhelmed.   This is an unassuming little place tucked in a strip mall on Eastern. When you walk in, you enter the grill side (order at counter). To the right, is the sushi side. Both sides have a sort of dive feel. And not that \"isn't this so neat\" dive feel. More of the \"where's the posted letter grade\" dive feel.  The servers were definitely friendly and the service was perfectly fine.   The menu is fairly lengthy with a good variety of different types of rolls. I tried 4 different sushi rolls and the edamame. All were just \"eh\". Everything was too squishy and nothing tasted particularly fresh. And I wasn't impressed by any of the flavor combinations (despite them sounding good).  Maybe I just ordered the wrong items? Neither the food nor the atmosphere made the mark for me. There are definitely far better strip mall sushi joints out there."}
{"text":"**Grill side** Island sushi & grill has to be my favorite place for Hawaiian local food. Anytime you walk into a hawaiian local spot you will always feel the warmth and aloha. They are so welcoming it feels like i'm home! Garlic chicken is so awesome. I always get the bento with the teriyaki beef and choice of chicken which would always be the garlic chicken. I share with my son all the time and he absolutely loves it. He never leaves me any noodles though :(  Now that they have poke express, I'm totally in love! Spicy ago combo is my ultimate fave poke! Their limu is good too. I'm just sad it's far from my house. Malasadas are yummy with the fillings. There are other desserts too. So good! A good 15 mins but it's so worth going there.  *sushi side* All you can eat is great, i always have the scallop mayo, i can't find it anywhere else and that really reminds me of back home. they also have really good sides!  service is always good"}
{"text":"Awesome deal for half off rolls! My boyfriend and I came here last night and had 6 rolls + miso soup + 4 sake bombs, for $54 total. Each roll has 8 pieces so...it's plenty of food! It's great quality and I know my sushi!  Half off rolls is 3-5pm and 9-11pm; and half-off all-day Monday and Tuesdays. Don't get flavored sake though (it's sickeningly sweet). just stick with the $2 sake bombs for a good time."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the past 3 years now. It's definitely a piece of Hawaii that makes you feel like you're back on the island. Food is good and I always get Poke in the back of the restaurant from Poke Express. (Side Note: I first started coming here because my uncle and the owner of Poke Express went to the same church in Oahu. The owner of Poke Express was a well known chef back in Food Land.) The one thing I always come back for is the Garlic Chicken plate and the malasadas. They just upgraded the restaurant so it seems like business is doing well!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have to go to Island Sushi at least once for the AYCE sushi and side dishes when we are in Las Vegas.  Everything is always fresh and made well.  We are from Oahu and travel to LV at least two or three times a year.  What has been keeping us from flying there is the ridiculous fares with Hawaiian Airlines.  We really need another airline that flies non-stop to Las Vegas.  We recommend that anyone who has not been there you won't regret it. There staff is also very friendly and always there to help if you have questions.  They are the BEST!!!!  The price that they charge for the AYCE is more than reasonable.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was just ok. Service was horrible. So slow!! They took my order to a wrong table and didn't apologize. Took them 25 min from they say we will take your dessert order until we can flag them (they don't even bother to check on us again). Don't want to go here again."}
{"text":"Eh... Ok. The rolls I got was a little on the small side for the price. Back home I pay two dollars less and get bigger rolls, here im paying two dollars more and get half the size. I don't know if that's the normal size of their rolls or if it was because I order it to go."}
{"text":"I like that this place has sushi, as well as a full Hawaiian menu, AND Poke Express all under the same roof. The bf doesn't like sushi, but I could bring him here and even he could find something he likes.   Items ordered: Salmon poke with special sauce-From Poke Express  Maui roll Big Island roll Lychee Saketini Kahuku Roll Japanese Lasagna Edamame White Peach Saketini  A few friends and I met here for dinner one night around 6pm. It wasn't super busy and our server was attentive. I usually always get AYCE, but since not all of us wanted that, it was better just to order ala carte. The more expensive option, but probably saved us hassle in the long run. I enjoyed everything, but nothing really stood out to me. They do have some interesting rolls, like teriyaki chicken, that are different than what you usually find on a sushi menu, but they didn't really peak my interest.The saketini's were good, they are served cold with interesting flavors like white peach and lychee. I stopped by the dessert case on my way out and regret not getting anything. They had guava and chantilly cakes that looked pretty delicious. I feel like this is a place to try, but not somewhere I could see myself running back to."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place! I was in the area and, based off my friend's recommendation, we dropped by during Happy Hour (50% off rolls). I was in a bit of a hurry and just ordered 3 rolls between us:  -Ahi Fever Roll -Caterpillar Roll -Spider Roll   All were excellent! They tasted more authentic than most sushi restaurants. So delicious. There are two separate sections and we sat in the self-service area (Poke Express?), however the staff was still friendly. I look forward to trying the AYCE here. It's somewhat in my area so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This rating is strictly for their Guava cake. I ordered a 8\" guava cake for my baby shower the day of. I called around 1:00 and the person who answered said they had just sold their last Guava cake. I asked if they would be able to bake another one. They said they would and it would be ready for pick up in two hours. the cake looked appealing with the shredded dry coconut flakes around the rim of the cake. The cake was the highlight of my entire dessert table and all my guests would not stop raving over how delicious it was. It was fairly priced at $20. Overall, I give my overall experience with this restaurant a 10/10 for their customer service and delicious bake goods! I will definitely be going back to try their Chantilly cake."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, but as of recent, their service is horrible.  The waiters are not the same and the current ones are slow and it seems like they don't know what they are doing.  It's disappointing how bad their service has become.  They used to be so good.. I have been waiting to get seated 30 minutes.  UNREAL!!   And to top things off they have NO ginger!! Who the hells has sushi and no ginger!! Very disappointed in this place   Terry, you were completely out of ginger that day which is ridiculous considering you serve sushi..  You had 3 huge open tables that were empty.. 30 to 45 minute wait is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are very delicious and they have a good all you can eat deal. Try the croc roll. They even give a free dessert at the end. I always leave feeling stuffed. Good customer service. This place is a must when you're in town."}
{"text":"I try to swing by this place whenever I am in Las Vegas. Expect to make reservations if you bring a group. The location and the interiors are comfortable, read... not fancy however the sushi is on point.   The variety, quality and service for an all you can eat sushi restaurant is what makes this a great find. The $28 for all you can eat is about what you would spend for a buffet but the variety of food including Kalbi, mochiko chicken and sushi makes this a great sushi experience. I do confess to having a sushi coma recently after visiting here.   Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wasn't really expecting much out of this place but this place was really good. It was a little busy so it did take little to get our food. But our waiter and the busier were really kool and helped us choose some rolls and desert."}
{"text":"nothing over the top about this place besides the $8 all u can drink asahi drafts. food was average and so was the service."}
{"text":"I live in LA and I literally crave their poke that it makes me want to drive 4 hours just to have some!  Only con is that parking can be difficult at times and there's not enough seats to accommodate a lot of people. Other than that, the food is unforgettable!"}
{"text":"This place is the freshest! Went there for dinner and Mac was one of our servers, he is always amazing! They are all amazing, I wish I could recall all their names. We also like to sit at the bar sometimes with Juan, he's very entertaining. We have become regulars not only on the sushi side but also on the grill side. Sistahz always on it with our orders."}
{"text":"What is not to love here! They have all sorts of stuff going on. AYCE sushi, poke shack and island grill. They have a variety of desserts to choose from. We've checked this place out twice and have only been to the poke shack. First time we just got bought some ono poke by the pound to go and the second time we got delicious poke bowls. Both times the fish was great. Did not disappoint.  I see that the grill and the poke shack share space which is no problem at all. We had plenty space to sit while we dined there. We definitely are checking out the brunch special they have in the near future as well as the AYCE sushi. I've heard nothing but great things. Til then I'm a fan of this place and will continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place is very good! Their all you can eat is very good with a lot of choices. They had one order of uni (sea urchin), amaebe shrimp, and a few other good choices. The rolls are good as well. I would definitely go back to this place!   Every Vegas stop from now on will include a trip to Island Sushi."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch....sat at the bar with my husband and ordered sushi for me and Hawaiian breakfast for him.  From a very rude service,  we felt unwelcome and almost as if we were bothering the waitress, to very very chewy seaweed,  (low quality ingredients and supplies) and semi-dirty place. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited here originally three years ago with coworkers and have been returning ever since.  I live in Summerlin and it has been worth the drive to this location every time.  The sushi is presented with a hawaiin/polynesian accent and is very delicious.  The service is very friendly (the Ohana spirit is alive and well here).  Please try the crunch roll and oh yeah for dessert try the 808 ice cream."}
{"text":"Breakfast is good here if your craving for Hawaiian local food. The kimchee fried rice, local moco with kimchee fried rice and bacon; eggs and rice is a good portion."}
{"text":"Been here several times with family and friends, and generally have a great experience.  I am a sucker for Dragon Rolls, and the ones here certainly deliver.  Their eel is always top-notch.  Their ahi poke is good, and it's nice that it comes with AYCE (one dish).  I'm extremely picky with it comes to poke (my Hawaiian pop makes some that is out of this world), but I would recommend it to others.  What gets me right in my sweet spot is their tempura ice cream.  Oh man, is it delicious.  The batter is just the right amount of sweetness, density and melt-in-your-mouth flavor that can make you want to eat 6 bowls of it.  Service can be hit or miss, sometimes slow and sometimes not.  Food is consistently tasty though, so I'll lean towards a 4/5 on this one."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and atmosphere. A nice Hawaiian feel, very busy, and yummy food. If I'm ever back out this way I'd come back."}
{"text":"It was our first time here today and we've heard that it's one of the best --   service was below average - our server is not friendly at all and is not very attentive. we had AYCE and ordered 6 long rolls and some nigirl.  ordered hot tea and took our server 10 minutes each time she had to refill our tea. she passed back and forth and once checked if we wanted to order more and if there's anything else we wanted.  sushi was room temperature and is not the freshest.  at almost $30/head for dinner sushi -- we were expecting more both from the service given to us to the quality of food being served.  unfortunately, this will be the first and last visit we'll have at this joint,"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food ever!! We love everything on the menu. We always go here every time we are in Vegas. Poke is fresh and so yummy! Best Teri beef and garlic chicken- you have to try it! The all you can eat sushi is also a great deal!!"}
{"text":"Slow service if you sit at a table (because it's ALWAYS packed) but the food more then makes up for the wait. Happy Hour is all day Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and it's 1/2 price rolls. Yum!! It's delicious and fresh and awesome. Just saying."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi in the valley.  They're quick with the orders not like the other ones.  They switched management so the rules for kids has changed.  They used to let us share with our 3 year old since they barely eat but not we would have to pay half of an adult price.  Quality went down a little bit but is still good.  These are the reasons why I only gave it a 4 star instead of 5."}
{"text":"AYCE lunch here was mediocre. The nigiri was not fresh enough for me and the sushi was put together without care. I like that it's close to my part of Henderson but I have not gone back from the last time I've been there. I would have enjoyed this spot if I came for non sushi items~~"}
{"text":"Love it! Reminds me of home.  Can't beat the portions or the price!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in town.  Their local Hawaiian food is also amazing.  And don't get me started on desserts.  The butter mochi and chocolate malasadas are to DIE for.    The AYCE sushi is the way that most people go but I never have enough of an appetite so on Mon-Wed I come for the 50% off rolls deal that they offer to locals.  It's a steal and is usually a better deal for someone like me who only gets 2-3 rolls max.  Only beef is that they don't do half rolls, which a lot of AYCE places will do to allow you to try more options.  I highly recommend the kahuku roll (topped with orgasm sauce) and the town and country roll (cali roll with garlic chicken on top).  I also love the lava lover for something spicy.  What I like most is that they don't skimp on fish quality and they don't pile on the rice, even when we do the AYCE.  Plus they have the most extensive AYCE menu out there to include all of their amazing side items--poke, cucumber salad, teri chicken, etc.  If you happen to be in the area on a Sunday and want a great brunch, head to Island Sushi.  They have all you can eat AND all you can drink mimosas.  Just get there early, there's almost always a wait from the time they open until the end of brunch."}
{"text":"I have been too the other restaurant in downtown but first time at this location. I was in the area. So figure try the original location plus hungry nothing better for lunch then plate lunch. I should have tried something new but enjoyed the chicken and eggplant last time so got it again. Most part it same menu as the other location although in this one Poke Express in the store too and have lot more desserts lot of them individual pieces packed too go containers take home. The selection is pretty huge but like Poke (I love! So need make stop again just too try it) and dessert only had room for lunch.   It interesting way store set up with one half being sit down restaurant style and other side local style find place sit down eat. Thankfully went late lunch because less then twenty seats. Side you seat yourself.   Sure if ever in need for some good local food and sushi. It offers the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I hate to do this on Christmas Day. Unbelievable placed a pick up order and came home to the worst food ever. I can't believe this was once our favorite spot to go to. We have been going here less and less since the quality and service just keeps going down.   I spoke to the manager who asked that we bring our food back so they can remake it. It's Christmas Day I don't want to drive back there to bring our food back to wait again to remake it.   This place was amazing at one point please do what you where doing before and get it back up there!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say!  A-lo-ha!!!  An absolute favorite of mine and my family!  They've got choke (lots of), food and dish items for choice!  Their Garlic Chicken broke da'mout!  So deeeelicious and they have Butter Mochi!!!!  We literally take AND treat our family and friends coming to town for a visit to Island Sushi & Grill!  Mahalo nui for your awesome customer service and all of your Ono grinds!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi..everything is always so good. The sushi chefs, juan and chuy are so nice and friendly and always make us laugh when we sit at the bar. Only thing is that i don't like is some of the staff isn't as friendly. It also takes them forever to refill your drinks or to come to you if you need anything."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend once, though we tried a second time and they happened to be closed. The AYCE includes the awesomely delicious ahi poki, which to me alone is worth the trip (it's a bit far from our side of town). The baby tako were very yummy, too! The rolls were tasty and we ordered a LOT- to the point that I think our chef got frustrated, as we saw him walk off with a sour expression & another chef meekly replaced him. The rainbow roll was disappointing as others have said, but overall the food was tasty & the drink specials were great. Worth trying, and I'd like to go back soon~"}
{"text":"I had Island Sushi delivered via Postmates over the weekend, and was very disappointed in the quality of my Tiger roll.   Keep in mind, I considered delivery time and potential wait time which would lessen the quality of the food - however I my order was delivered to me within 20 mins of ordering. 5 stars for Postmates!   Back to the Tiger roll... the seaweed was chewy & the prawn was soggy. TMI, but I had a bad stomach ache after, if you catch my drift.   won't be returning here."}
{"text":"If your into AYCE Sushi and Island food , this is where it's at. Great Variety,  Great Selection and weekly additions . I went for the 1/2 off rolls on Monday special and couldn't resist and got the AYCE. Best sushi spot in the VEGAS Area"}
{"text":"This place has some really good all you can eat sushi-fresh and a good variety to chose from as well! After ordering a few things we told the sushi chef what we liked and he gave us a few things to try, he was right on with that and it was very much appreciated!   Now this was about a week and a half ago and we wanted to try it again!!! I had to be at work in 45 minutes so me and my husband decided to met there for a quick bite to eat... My only complaint is that the sushi bar is way to small, there were only about 3 seats left at the bar, 2 were together and one alone. Its very close in there and so there was not enough room for us to squeeze in there cause it would not have been comfortable. (not to mention my husband has a huge aversion to sitting next to other tables or people at restaurants, if they try to sit us next to another table and there is an open restaurant he freaks out!) and we didnt have time to sit at a table and be served so we had to leave!   We will defiantly be back again, this place is good and the dessert is good too and included (808 dessert was amazing).  We ended up rushing over to The Ka for a quick bite, always a good place either as a 1st choice (which it usually is for us, but we wanted something new) or as a backup!"}
{"text":"Tough one. The sushi is good, the sushi chefs great, but the table staff and service, mostly fair. It used to not always be this way and I find it harder and harder to recommend Island Sushi remembering the years past. I guess not all things improve with age and Island Sushi is such a place at this time. My kids, that have been coming to Island Sushi since age two, now six years later recently asked to start going elsewhere. Kids are honest, is there more that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Disappointed that many say this is the best 'Hawaiian' food in the Vegas area. I would say those who feel such way have never been to Hawaii or haven't been back in 20 plus years. The garlic shrimp disappointed all around, it was the type of shrimp you'd find in a lower end Chinese buffet. The spam was dry, yet the rice was perfect. I do commend the staff for showing true Aloha to the customers this gives a great vibe. All in all the dishes are hit or miss but a great poke selection is what will keep me returning. I will never again eat what had this trip."}
{"text":"Sooooo Good. I come here every time I visit Las Vegas. My absolute favorite for POKE and Mochiko Chicken. After eating poke in Hawaii this is the next best place for it. We ordered the limu poke, spicy poke with avocado and the Kimchi tako. Also the mochiko chicken dinner large and one al carte mochiko chicken. It was enough for three big eaters. Oh I forgot to include 3 spam musubi. Again sooo good. Try it the next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here. Great all you can eat option. Don't even think about it! Mila was one of our servers and was such a pleasant and fun lady. Tikae was our sushi server at the bar and did a terrific job. Ricardo was awesome as well and had lots of suggestions."}
{"text":"I'm not big on giving 5 stars but I think this place deserves it. I have been searching for THE sushi place in Vegas and now I have found it! This is clear across town from where I live, but worth the drive every once in a while. I have been reading the reviews for the place and it had me so excited! Finally, for my bf's birthday, who is a sushi fanatic, we tried Island Sushi.  I like the idea of hawaiian fusion mix. We got here, a small sushi restaurant connected to Poke Express, and sat at the bar. We arrived around 4:15p, so it was still early and there weren't many people here at all. I think our sushi chef, Terrence, seemed like an owner or something. Not sure, but he was awesome! I told him it was our first time there and we had heard about it from Yelp, and he explained everything to us and gave us a special treat in the end.  So first off, we are Uni fans. HAD TO try the uni. It was fresh! Also had the hamachi and salmon. And some other stuff, don't remember. But everything was fresh. They also had a good variety of appetizers to choose from, different types of poke, some traditional sushi apps, and some hawaiian type apps. We ordered... hamachi kama (not a big fan but it wasn't bad), eggplant fries (YUM!!), crab poke (didn't know how to eat it!), little fried octopus (like calamari and it was super yummy! it looked cute too), also.. a couple other things. Can't remember it all, but nothing disappointed me at all. Some went far above expectations.  For the rolls, they had a decent variety and we couldn't decide what to try. They don't really do half orders (only on your last roll you can do a half). So Terrence asked us what we liked and just made some rolls for us. One had hamachi inside and outside and it was great. Also had the Big Island Roll. Did a half order of one the soft shell crab rolls (don't remember the name) and then there was another roll, but don't remember.  And then the desserts! We were limited to one dessert each which was a bummer. Yama Sushi is unlimited but they don't have the variety like Island Sushi! I got the 808 rolls after seeing all the pictures of it. Its deep fried banana with ice cream and whipped cream with fresh strawberries and chocolate syrup. My bf got malasadas (deep fried dough) with ice cream and whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Delicious! Not to mention they gave us mini puffs because we are yelpers! (well at least I am).  Overall, great experience. Their prices are decent. And they gave my bf half off since it was his birthday (we didn't even ask for it). Terrence is great! And the food was fresh and delicious. The servers were nice and the food came out quickly. If only they had a location closer to me, but you can't have everything right? I would go back to this place weekly if I could, but my waistline would not be happy with that. But I definitely recommend this place to everyone.  ALSO!! Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday they have 1/2 off rolls all day. Other days they have half off rolls certain hours for happy hour. Check their website for specials. And they have a full bakery attached to Poke Express (same place). Yum."}
{"text":"This place may not be for everyone, but I love it!  I've been here eight jillion times for AYCE sushi- the service is great, friendly, the sushi chefs are fast, smiling, ready to be of service no matter how busy they are, and I've been there when they've be REALLY busy~!  When you order from the servers the food comes out hot, or cold as the case may be, and quick- never had to remind a server \"we're waiting on,...\" ever.  The AYCE rules are reasonable, and, best of all, never get the feeling they're slowing down because you are doing AYCE -- Rolls are good, a good variety of everything- I developed a shrimp allergy, so even with that, the variety is outstanding, and they will make accommodations.  Not fancy, so don't get your hopes up that you're going to a place that's getting Michelin Stars- if you want a place that you can go, eat good food, relax and have a nice visit with friends and family, there ya go!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Service was great and the sushi was awesome! $21 for unlimited sushi!? Sign me up. Will definitely be coming back! YUM!"}
{"text":"Spicy tuna bowl is really good! Also love the poki options, staff was really nice as well..been the past 2 days now! Also love the ocean salad!"}
{"text":"This was 4th time here and obviously if we come back we like it! But this time... The service was terrible! And everyone knows you go out to eat expecting at least decent service but tonight it was just the opposite. We sat 10 min after we walked in (which is really fast) ordered right away but our rolls took an outrageous amount of time (only 2 rolls) I'm not even going to talk about the waitress and her lack of customer service. I won't include the entire staff in this review the bussers were amazing as always!!! The food was amazing as always, 3 rolls 4 beers and a sake for $50 and the only way they went wrong was the waitress...."}
{"text":"I love this place!! This is my first time and all I can say is BAM!! We had great service from Shane and the food is out of this world amazing!! I love the sushi infused with an amazing Japanese Hawaiian twist! If you haven't been here you haven't lived!!"}
{"text":"I was craving Asian food after being in Utah for 4 days, and Hawaiian Japanese food sounded delicious! We ate the Sunday brunch buffet for $21/person. The buffet included your choice of appetizers, sushi, and a choice of dessert. The food was pretty good for the price. We ordered lots of nigiri, different styles of poke, and 2 rolls - a total of 35 dishes. I loved the unagi, while my hubby enjoyed the uni. We had the ahi, fried tofu, kimchee tako, and raw crab poke. I liked the fried tofu and ahi poke the best. The desserts weren't very good. We had tempura ice cream and 808 special. The tempura batter fell off the ice cream.   Service was great! Our waitress kept on coming back to our table to see if we wanted to order more food. I'm glad that we weren't ignored.   One minor grip was that this restaurant charged for green tea - $1.50 per person. I'm not used to paying for green tea.   You need a car to get to this place since it is really far from the Strip. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I was craving Hawaiian Oxtail soup so I decided to stop in. I didn't realize that Poke Express was also inside this location so that was a Plus! The Customer Service is excellent, everyone was so nice and greeted me and made sure I was helped. The Oxtail soup came out with 2 scoops of rice, green onions and ginger. Upon taking that first taste, I felt like I was on the Island. The flavors were all there and then I got to the oxtail, it fell off the bone and just melted in my mouth. This is the Oxtail soup I remembered when I was in Hawaii and I can't wait to have it again! It was a large portion so I had to pack half of it to-go. To top that off, I had 2 malasadas: Plain and Haupia. Both were amazing, very close to Leonard's Bakery. If you are having Island withdrawals and want some delicious food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Always a must when we go to Vegas. Everything on the menu is ono and the people working always bring the aloha Had the Kim cheese fried rice and the Portuguese sausage, eggs, rice w/ side of corn beef hash. Took home banana bread, malasadas and chocolate mochi. Everything is homemade, fresh and always huge portions. We do eat a lot of local food, and this place ranks at the top for mainland venues. Oh, and can't forget to mention the fresh poke bar! Local heaven!! Mahalo I.S. Be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best AYCE sushi joint in town.  Everyone one is friendly, with great service.   There is always someone asking you if you need something.   The sushi chefs are way friendly and will make whatever roll you can create in your mind.  The poke is so good and the desserts are freaking great.  I try to make them lose money when I eat here, gluttony at it's best!"}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner and got the AYCE for around $27 per person. This is probably the first resto with 3 different spots: plate lunches, poke, and sushi (a sushi resto to be exact). Think L & L , Tanioka's, and Sushi Twister all combined into one. Was the AYCE worth it? I think so. You can order anything on the menu with a limit of 2 for desserts. The poke was great and had that melt in your mouth texture. My dad ordered around 3-4 small bowls of poke alone. The sushi was pretty good but I think still not as good as Yama Sushi. The only thing that I would say negative about this place is that the male waiters in the sushi resto were not really \"waiters.\" They were pretty much  there to take your order and give you your food. I would expect a waiter or waitress to be at least a little engaging and I don't think once did the guy ask \"How was the food?\". But the food is good and I'll come back to try their plate lunches.  Note: You know when you are next to Hawaiian locals when you hear the table across from you say, \"Uncle, sooooo....how was California Hotel?\" LOL"}
{"text":"a hole in the wall to be sure but the poke bowl was super delicious! lots of poke for $10. we also had the bento with mochiko (sweet rice flour) battered fried chicken and the ahi, with rice and noodles. the ahi was so-so but the chicken was good. the sweetness was unique but i'd probably try garlic next time. a lot of food for $8 and change. definitely stays on my list to try again."}
{"text":"We came here because someone recommended the malasadas. Boy, they weren't kidding. The malasadas were good! They were fresh, soft and had a crunchy outer layer.  We order the plain, guava custard, and original custard. Loved the Guava custard filled malasadas.   I ordered through Grub hub on my way to Island Sushi and my order was ready when I got there. However, I still waited in a long line to get them."}
{"text":"The poke bowls are really tasty and flavorful. The only reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is because it is overpriced. I had to pay when I wanted extra spicy mayo and when I wanted to substitute normal rice for sushi rice. Poke bowls taste much better with sushi rice. It used to come with that but then now they give regular white rice. I don't eat there as often anymore because it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Sorry a late post. Decided to try their all you can eat about 2 weeks ago. The good, they have a great selection for all you can eat (for both sushi lovers & for non sushi lovers), got seated fairly quickly & all food came out in a timely manner. The bad, 1st server introduced herself as \"Angie\" & were barely waited on by her. Servers don't wear a name badge. Got seated by \"Bronson\" (I asked his name) & became the table server, who rarely came by the table. Recently went back to eat sushi, again the all you can eat. Better service & all food came out in a timely manner. Able to use the \"loyalty card\". If you don't have a loyalty card, then get 1."}
{"text":"Coming in here was a bit confusing. At first it threw me off that there is different sections for different restaurants. It looked like one big place to me. Poke express is inside island sushi and I was strictly coming here for poke but decided to eat at island sushi also. This place is pretty good. Good customer service and good food. The lady that had helped me was nice. She explained all the questions I had and was very nice about it. I liked the Hawaiian food mix that they had going on.   I had the \"grilled\" side of island sushi.  I ordered the loco moco with Portuguese sausage. It was pretty good. I had tried stuff my group had gotten also. No complaints really.  I would recommend coming here just for the poke express but this place is a added bonus. Although it only says ISLAND SUSHI outside and a small poke express on the door when coming in. My food at poke express probably overshadowed how good the food is here so I will probably come back here and give an update if this place is even more awesome or not."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Stopped by during my Vegas trip and was very impressed with the authentic Hawaiian menu and taste!!! I ordered the bento box c, which was only $5 but comes in a very generous portion. I had it with mochiko chicken, my friend had the garlic chicken; both were excellent. I will be back for the loco moco. I'm pretty sure the staff are from the islands because they were just so nice and friendly. I grew up on Guam and also lived in Maui, so it was great to eat spam again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my Co worker to try the sushi. We ordered off the menu and did not do all you can eat.  We ended up ordering 4 normal rolls, two speciality rolls, one baked roll, and an order or sashimi.  A the food was bad. Probably the worst sushi I've had in Vegas/Henderson area! The quality of fish wasn't good, and the sashimi was still a bit frozen.  The service was awkward. I would ask for something then the sever would ask me 10 questions back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Food deserves an A+ !!! And the service is even better! Thank you to our server Mac for making our experience a memorable one. We make the 3 hour drive just to come out and eat here!"}
{"text":"Ono food for reasonable prices. Their poke tends to be smaller pieces but has always been fresh every time we get it. There are two sides to the restaurant: a sushi side and what they call the \"grill\" side. I haven't been over to the sushi side yet, but can say that the grill side's food is great. Won ton min, poke bowl, loco moco, mix plate...all grindz. I'll also usually pick up a half dozen of their malasadas to take home; not quite Leonard's, but they're warm and hit the spot. However, I didn't care for the guava or chantilly cake when I got them.   We live in Summerlin but drive all the way to Henderson to eat here, because it's a little piece of the islands on the 9th island."}
{"text":"Our family had the AYCE deal. We ordered the 3 year old SPAM, eggs and rice since she's not big into sushi...yet. Our older kids on the other hand LOVE sushi so this was a special dinner for us. Here's what we ordered:  Edamame Gyoza Baked Mussels Mochiko Chicken Shrimp Tempura Vegetable Tempura Black Widow Big Island Island Special (Family Fave) Katsu Roll Surf & Turf Roll Rainbow Roll Mauna Kea (Family Fave) Crunch Roll Joe Special Dragon Roll *And we reordered a couple of these.  Overall, it was a good experience - I felt like I was eating at one of the local joints in Hawaii. They were pretty fast at bringing out our food too. Bonus points for having a dessert included in the AYCE price. We'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"best hawaiian food in vegas! mochiko chicken & teri beef bento! mmmmmmm...."}
{"text":"Great service. I expressed interest in the Poke Express next door and they offered to bring my order over to eat with my Island Sushi food. But once I looked at the menu I decided there was plenty there for me to enjoy. My husband thought the pieces were small, but I was content with the portions. We ordered: Hamachi Kama- generous meaty yummy, Rainbow Roll- lots of fish on top, Mackerel Nigiri. The sushi has no frills. David S said something about the fish being warm. Mine was very room temperature, but nothing happened to me. The atmosphere is casual relative to other places. It's connected to Poke Express. On my way out I got dessert over there. All in all it was an a-ok lunch experience."}
{"text":"Ahhhh our favorite go to when we just want islander food and sushi,  we are so lucky to have this place in Vegas!!!  We discovered it years ago through friends from Hawaii and still drive all the way across town to come here regularly!! We love the island special,  the mauna kea,  Maui wowie,  the croc is awesome.  We always get the poke,  garlic chicken,  seaweed salad and save room for dessert. We usually come for the Sunday brunch,  they have a special menu in addition to their regular ayce menu and it's only $21.95!!!! I always treat myself to the tempura ice cream,  it's so Ono!!! Love you guys,  don't ever change!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so perhaps I have a sushi addiction! We went to island sushi the other night. There was a wait, which wasn't that cool, but the food was great! I don't think I've ever had a fresher rainbow roll. Do it"}
{"text":"Our first time here on vacation and the selection of all you can eat rolls and side dishes were endless! Great desserts too. Everything was delicious! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad sushi. We did the all you can eat. Wish that they did half rolls. Wanted to try a lot of stuff on the menu. No problem though.  4 full rolls, ahi poke appetizer and an 808 dessert later...very satisfied!!! Would recommend you give this place a shot. Do the all you can eat cause a couple rolls and appetizer are same or more than the 21.95 price of AYCE"}
{"text":"My only experience comes from the non sushi side, where they serve the bentos, dessert, and poke etc.  Their food is pretty good,  it reminds me of local food in Hawaii and the service is pretty quick.. They have a pretty good variety of poke but I reserve that for weekends since I work on the west side of town and can't get there on weekdays before they sell out!  It's quite a popular place as I see a lot of local people from Hawaii, so  hey, you know it's good.  One of my favorite dishes is just a plain ole bento (the one without the mahi mahi...nooooooo).  Try to make it there as a treat for dinner every pay period.  I'm never a let down."}
{"text":"I come here for both, the sushi and grill side   I typically order Poke, the Crunch Roll and a Mini Garlic Chicken when I stop by. Their poke is excellent, always fresh. I had their Malasadas for the first time today, super light and fluffy. Not too sweet. They are tasty except there was a slight odd aftertaste to them, can't quite explain it.   The prices are very reasonable.   The establishment could be in a better lot location, since parking space is a little tight if you have a large vehicle/truck.  Most of the staff members are helpful and friendly. There is seating for the sushi diners and grill diners. You can dine in, take it to-go, or order and pick up! Whenever I come here, there's always a considerable amount of customers and a wait time which is a good sign - people like it, hence they go here.   If you're around the Silverado Ranch area and want some good Sushi or Hawaiian food, go here!"}
{"text":"I don't normally like sushi but this place is delicious! They have a huge variety of sushi with great prices. All you can eat and happy hour are definitely worth the money. Good prices and great service!"}
{"text":"best ahi poke in town , service is always 5 star. best AYCE sushi place in henderson. best of it you can make reservation  for a AYCE place."}
{"text":"First time eating here today, poke was fascistic a long with the other Hawaiian treats. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great.  You can either order off a full Hawaiian food selection or choose from a variety of great tasting poke towards the back of the restaurant. A very nice cozy place."}
{"text":"Tried the poke express for lunch today.  The woman helping me let me sample as many different items as I liked - in fact, she encouraged it.  I ended up with a 1/3lb of the spicy ahi poke and 1/3lb of the \"ocean\" (seaweed) salad.  My total was just over $7.  I was very pleased with the service at the poke express bar, and the food. Can't say anthing about wait staff, since I took my food to go."}
{"text":"Dined here on Friday night 3/2/12.  I was a little skeptical at first being that this place was in a shadier part of downtown Vegas.  My hubby and I had a number of sushi rolls which were all very good and fresh too.    What sticks out in my mind the most about this place however, were not the sushi rolls we ate, but the malasadas we ordered after dinner.  OMFG!  They were soooo insanely delicious!!!  My hubby ordered the plain malasada and I ordered the custard filled malasada.  So freaking good!  It was worth going to a shady area just to eat.  Best foodie find in a while.  They were fresh, soft and warm.  The custard was perfect, not too sweet or overpowering and very creamy.  It was so good, it made it worth while cheating on my diet!  The plain malasada was very tasty too, but the custard filled one was over the top.  A little piece of heaven in your mouth I tell you!  They also have chocolate and haupia filled malasadas too!  I would definitely dine here again as they have a pretty large Hawaiian food menu too.  They have very good prices for breakfast and lunch that I will for sure have to try the next time I am in Vegas.   VERDICT:  GO FOR THE CUSTARD FILLED MALASADAS!  Your taste buds will thank me! :)"}
{"text":"My boys are a BIG fan of this place and so am I. When I'm in competitive eating mode I do the all you can eat sushi. I love the Surf and Turf roll, Town and Country roll, and Big Island Roll, HOLY MAMA! The all you can eat menu is fabulous. The only thing is it's really hard to get a table. Once the big Hawaiians show up they ain't leaving until there times up. They sushi guys are awesome and Erin the waitress is super cool. When I'm not in the mood to be a cow, fried noodles are yummy, avocado poke bowl with taro chips are healthy good, garlic chicken plate is delicious and flavorful, the teri burger broke da mouth, and the custard pie hits the spot. I love this place! An absolute gem :)"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, offering a variety of specialty sushi rolls, and Hawaiian flare food. This place is good, but often ridiculously packed during dinner hours."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! So good and the service is awesome, very reasonable prices too! Also a huge bonus is that you can even get real Hawaiian treats here! Also hard to find things like Lomi salmon. Wow!"}
{"text":"I am from Orange County/Los Angeles area and was recommended to come here for AYCE sushi from a friend.  I have NEVER tasted sushi that was so delicious!  I am not a sushi expert, however, this sushi was so ono (good) that I didn't need any soy sauce!  Little rice, they focused on the fish.  Fresh wasabi is offered but is $2 each (totally worth it).  Poke was very soft and perfectly flavored.  I will make an effort to always come here for sushi when I'm in Vegas.  Nice service too."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! I waited 25 minutes to be seated for all you can eat. Not to add they weren't very busy. Then another party comes and is seated before me. When I'm finally seated, the waiter comes to my table 15 minutes later asking how is everything. Well considering he hasn't even taken my order. I would say Everything is horrible! I get my first round of sushi. Then I sit and wait 30 more minutes without any service . I would not recommend this place to anyone. When I order all you can eat sushi that's what I expect to receive. Not two rolls and over and an hour of waiting. Save your money and not to mention I was so irritated I didn't even get dessert. This place is a joke. I will never waste my time again."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. I phoned my order in today the girl taking the order had an attitude. She didn't even give me a total over the phone like most place should give you a total. When I walked in to pick up my order shyra looked like she didn't even care and looked like she didn't want to be there. You need better customer service don't think I'll be back again. Kalbi wasn't a hit for me for $9.95 I could of went to L &L and got more ribs and it taste better too."}
{"text":"I love Island sushi, I've been coming here for years, but last night was probably the worst experience ever. The service was absolutely terrible, it does get busy, but the server at least will acknowledge you. We sat for 10 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order, and another 10 after that for the server to come take our orders. The combination that my niece ordered came out with only half the items, and we seemed to inconvenience our server when we asked for the rest of her items. The first roll that we ordered which is my husband's favorite ended up coming out at the very end of our visit we had to ask twice about it, and when it finally came out it was, burnt, dried out and inedible. Thankfully the busser was good with filling our drinks because ordering was impossible all night. The service has really gone down. They used to be so friendly and fast even when it's busy."}
{"text":"We come here for their AYCE because the kids all have their own favorites, and this way, they are able to have more options.   Love their malasadas. I order for pick up sometimes and they get so busy, you'll get frustrated waiting longer than what you're told over the phone when you get there. I don't know the girl's name, but she's always the one ringing me up at the take out register. She's always giving me a weird bitchy vibe.   Poké is hit or miss as far as the fishy taste. When it's not pungently fishy, I enjoy my occasional Shoyu Poké which I blend with some seaweed salad over a bed of warm white rice."}
{"text":"Malasadas in the States? cool! not as good as leonard's down in hawaii, but not too bad at all.  I recommend getting the pan-fried noodle combo....pretty outstanding tasty noodles for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I swear this place is not the same. Customer service is so so/jus ok.  I got the ISG reward card after paying and the chick act like it would've taken too much time from her to give me my points SMH  Oh and the cakes, yea the cakes suck. Who da hell puts coconut flakes on a guava cake. Also I'm curious to know why was the guava cake $20.00 and the rest was $25.00.  I bOught it on Saturday and now it's Monday I transferred the cake to a plate and what do u know there is frickin mold on the bottom. Like fo real ISG-how old was this cake? That's jus nasty. I inserted some pictures, I trimmed the edges cause it was junk and than to notice mold.....oops there goes the cake in da trash. NO BUY DA CAKES FROM HERE-GO TO WORLD OF CAKES(they make da best cakes and island flavor get um too)"}
{"text":"Why no negative stars??  Horrible, just horrible.  This place should be reported to the health department and shut down.  I've never had an overall bad experience at a sushi place as there is usually something positive to focus on but this place is a clear exception.  1) Service was horrible from the start. The host was confused with the difference between per piece and all you can eat pricing. Once we were finally seated, it took over 10 mins for someone to come over and when the waitress finally did, just asked what we wanted and walked away. We asked for spicy mayo literally five times and when they finally brought it, only brought two even though we asked for individual ones.  2) I had the baked Tempura Roll and it made me deathly sick. It didn't taste bad but after I finished it, I had to rush to the rest room and still felt sick long after.  3) The place seemed run down and very low end. I like to give places the benefit of the doubt as some great places can be dives but this place takes the cake.  Horrible, horrible experience. Buyer beware!!"}
{"text":"SERVICE- HORRIBLE -went up to the counter after 25 minutes of waiting for my food, I was waiting in front of the cash register for 2 minutes and staffed walked by me multiple times, didn't pay any attention to me finally after 3-4 min the lady in the front told me \"she'll be right with me\" waiting ANOTHER 3-4 minutes, she finally asked \"how can I help you\" (at this point I was pissed) I told her I've been waiting for 30 minutes and the 2 parties of 4 people that ordered after me had gotten their food.... She asked another worker if they had my food (they obviously forgot) they gave me a mochiko chicken on the back counter that was obviously for a call in/ take out order... she gave it to me AND DIDNT EVEN APOLOGIZE!!!!    FOOD QUALITY-- DECENT  POKE-- GOOD FOR VEGAS"}
{"text":"loved the eat all you can for  $24.95! I could only eat so much, any leftovers are subject to penalty. So order only what you can finish. Service is fast,efficient and friendly. I would go back again and again."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE sushi places I have tried. I came here for my daughter's 13th birthday because she wanted sushi.  I was thinking feeding a bunch of teenage girls, this could be expensive so I knew I wanted an AYCE option. I also wanted a place that served more than just sushi because let's face it, not everyone can get down on raw fish. I really think I chose the perfect place! Other than the shitty parking lot, and a few service hiccups, I would say we did pretty well.  There ended up being 10 of us. I only made a reservation for 8, and they accommodated us. It was a small squished area, and there was a bigger table they could have put us at, but whatever. It was my fault so I was not going to complain. Three of the girls went with a teriyaki chicken plate that was served with rice and mac salad. It was good. But I was there for the unlimited supply of garlic edamame, gyoza, tempura, tiger rolls, and oh my new favorite, the black widow roll. I did not even realized I like soft shell crab until this roll. They also had great dessert options like brownie sundaes, green tea ice cream, and creme brulee.  There were certain items you could only have one of, but AT LEAST they offer these items unlike other sushi places. (certain sashimis and desserts) And a few certain items that were only available for dinner. Which is a couple bucks more, but still a great price at $27 p/p.  The restaurant is small with a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese decor. The service was not bad. It was not amazing. They forgot a coke, and served us a roll 25 minutes after ordering it. They did not charge us for the 6 uneaten pieces of sushi which I was grateful for. Our total bill including 18% tip came to $300. For sure a decent price for 10 at a sushi spot.  I can't wait to return without the kids, and indulge in their half price happy hour."}
{"text":"My Island Sushi cherry has officially been popped! My cousins have been telling me to try this place out for months, and finally we all got together to feast!! (I was the only newbie).  WHERE: Located on Eastern & Serene.  WHAT: As a first-timer, I had to do AYCE!! Wouldn't it be a waste if I didn't eat all I could?!! Ok so back to my experience.  I am in love with baked rolls, and the only downside to this place was that AYCE did not have ANY baked rolls whatsoever! I was bummed at first, but when I tried what they did have, my \"bummness level\" decreased.  WHAT I HAD:  The appetizers I had were: ahi poke (I might have to say that this is one of the best I've tasted in town! It was very fresh and tasty), mochiko chicken (ahh, I fell in love after the first bite!), seaweed salad (sweet & delishhhh), and baked mussels (always one of my favorites when on any menu).  Special Sushi rolls I had: -Mt. Charleston roll; Since they didn't have baked rolls, they did have baked scallops on this roll.  I had to take advantage because this was the closest thing to baked that I'd be getting that night. Haha, when I did get my roll, I was very pleased! -Ahi Poke roll; I apparently couldn't get enough of the tuna in my system, I needed more! Kudos to this roll though =). -Island Special roll; this roll was my all time favorite! Everyone must have this! It hit the spot indeed.  *NOTE: if you do decide to do AYCE, you get to choose a free dessert! I always have room for dessert in my tummy =D. There were malasada&icecream, brownie&icecream, just plain icecream, mochi, and I believe there were a couple more.  I settled for my mango mochi of course.  WHY: A lot of people have been comparing Island Sushi to 808 Sushi (because of the whole owner/chef switch, I actually am not so clear of it myself), but I have personally come to conclude that Island Sushi defeats 808 Sushi in my book."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time today! We ordered 2 rolls a la carte and some plates! The 2 rolls came out very fast and were very good! My dad received his garlic shrimp plate shortly after, he was pretty much done with his plate before my mom and I received our plates (about 20 mins) apparently there was a mix up in our order not a huge deal cause we were still full from the rolls. Our waiter (mack) was kind enough to give us dessert on him for the inconvenience which was really nice of his!  He was a great server all in all and checked up on us very often! If it wasn't for Mack being a great waiter we probably wouldn't have a huge interest in coming back but his friendliness is what will draw us back in! Thanks Mack!!"}
{"text":"I went to their weekly Sunday Pupu (appetizer) brunch which includes a special Hawaii Pupu menu + the regular AYCE lunch menu for the same price as a regular lunch AYCE, pretty good deal if you ask me. Ive eaten at the sushi side a couple of times and just as it was before the service was eeeh ok at best, i expected better and faster service since its not always full capacity when we go.  I really enjoyed the extra pupus that you can order, my favorite was the \"seared garlic-peppered ahi belly\" that was the best thing on there, but the only bad thing was that it was limit one order per person, so i recommend getting that as one of the last of your sushi orders, my favorite dessert from the pupu menu was their small slush or ice cream float shot, the one on the menu this time as the green apple slush float shot, it was very very good i got a brain freeze after downing a couple lol. The rest of the menu was just ok nothing really special.  For the grill side i always used to drive 8 miles just to get their bento or malasadas, pretty far drive just for some food but its worth it when i have the Hawaii food craving, i don't go there much anymore since i always hit up the IslandbreezeLV truck which is almost always closer to me than Island Sushi."}
{"text":"When I am in vegas I usually go there for the Malasada.  But, I will get there special of the day especially on Friday for chicken long rice with Laulau and Lomi salmon.  Overall the food is pretty good for plate lunches. But this last time the teriyaki chicken was a little salty compared to previous times.    Once in awhile they would have coconut custard pie and that's pretty good.  The poke is excellent one of the best in the area.  The deft touch on the shoyu for the poke is on point not too salty."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch just got a regular customer!! Real bargain for all the choices!! Promise, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Sigh.. I didn't want to do this but I had no choice...  All I can say is shame on you Island Sushi! We loved getting in the car with anticipation of eating all your delicious rolls but no longer.... Last night the hubby and I wanted,nay craved, your succulent rolls. With mouths watering, we stepped in and got seated.  We order our drinks but no one was around to take our order. We tried, oh did we try, to get someone's attention but I guess the wait staff was too busy chit chatting by the cash register to notice. We decide then and there to get up and fill our empty bellies somewhere else and that we did!"}
{"text":"Good for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!! Loco Moco for just $6 bucks or so for breakfast.  Hardy enough that I have it at 7am and not get hungry till after 1pm!! That is back for your bucks!! Poke bowl was generous in size and in flavors.  The only draw back to this place is location.  It's 200 plus miles from home base!!! Luckily I have Bachan's Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Damn daniel back at it again with the whiite riice  I am starting to feel like i am in a relationship with this place. I cant stop loving island sushi. Treat a lady so goood"}
{"text":"So this is my second review for island sushi and I always eat here. Today is the first time I had ever been charged for something ridiculous. I asked for ponzu sauce because I think it tastes better with sushi instead of soy sauce. Our waitress gave me a tiny bit of ponzu sauce and never refilled it and charged me 75¢! I don't mean to sound cheap, but the principle of being a sushi place and charging for dipping sauce is ridiculous! I've been going here for almost two years and I have never been charged for ponzu sauce! And the charge isn't listed on their menu. Island Sushi should think about getting rid of this ridiculous charge."}
{"text":"Best and closest food to local food. Even better than some local places in Hawaii. We normally just go to California Hotel for local food but this is definitely our new spot.  They have everything. We tried a good amount of everything... Musubi, kalbi plate, garlic chicken, loco moco, Portuguese sausage loco moco, oxtail soup, fried noodles, as well as like 5 different pokes. All were freakin amazing and I'd highly recommend this place to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Island sushi rocks!  Everything I had was good except the raw tako wasabi was a bit weird!   Go here"}
{"text":"Wow I am in love, found the joint in a strip mall but was worth braving 100 degrees with pasty white skin for Island Sushi. Didn't go ayce cos my eyes are bigger then my stomach!   I hate wasting food so ordered ala carte with the Scotsman. Had miso, Salmon Lomi and garlic ahi tuna to start..the tuna had great flavour and was a fave right away.   For rolls we ordered the Big Island, Mauna Loa and another one with Cali roll topped with baked scallop and mushroom on top, the name escapes me cos I am working on 4 hours sleep while writing this after a night at the BJ tables in The Orleans.   Hats off to the fantastic staff at Island, answered all our questions, and since it was Monday we got 50% off our rolls, Bonus!"}
{"text":"The food was awsome and the service was great.  Lunch happy hour ends at 4pm, I got in at 3:30pm no rush and everything was nice and relaxing.   A must try.   ENJOY"}
{"text":"Food is very good, happy hour every day, half price !! :-) :-),, Sunday brunch with mimosas,specail pricing,, it's really great and you should check it out not only for the delicious food but always great specials"}
{"text":"Yes, that's my photo on the front page of this restaurant. Yes, you're welcome for making you hungry.  Now, it's just ok. Quality has shifted to the wayside just a bit, but the volume of sushi you get could make up for it."}
{"text":"This is our go-to AYCE sushi joint in Vegas. Being from Hawaii, we can appreciate the fact that the owners are from Hawaii and the food is authentic. Sushi is great, the plate lunches are great, the desserts are great, poke is great, all of their food is great. You shouldn't even question if you should come here or not."}
{"text":"I was craving mitsuken a restaurant in Hawaii.  I ordered the mini garlic chicken plate with fried rice, bacon, and eggs.  The food was salty with little to no taste.  Gave it a 4 star because the customer service is always on point!  The atmosphere is always aloha in here.  The restaurant splits on one side you have sushi and the other you have local Hawaiian food with poke. The parking lot isn't huge but good enough.  Never had a hard time parking."}
{"text":"Service was awful. I ordered saimin and my daughter and son ordered bento and fried noodles. Food came out cold and I'm almost positive that the server forgot to put in my order. It came 10 minutes after I asked another server if my saimin will ever arrive. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The place is divided into two. One side is for Hawaiian food and the other for sushi. Which is pretty cool because you can still order from both menus whichever side you are sitting at. I order the bento box B with the garlic chicken. It comes with furikake rice, fried noodle, spam, and fried garlic ahi. There was a good amount of food. The garlic chicken was very tasty with a nice kick to it so was the garlic ahi. The service wasn't bad. The food came out pretty fast. Cool place overall."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi?  Oh yes! Hawaiian style grinds?  Oh Yes!  This is a must go to place for anyone from hawaii. The AYCE sushi is fantastic, but it does have a timelimit and they are supposedly strict with leaving leftovers (we did not).  Also comes with a dessert.    You want malasadas?  they have them here too!"}
{"text":"Had the AYCE, wifey and kids had combo boxes.  So good. Desserts good. Service was great, everyone super friendly."}
{"text":"The first time I came here we got out with 39 items in total, the next day in Vegas we had dinner here again, got out with 49 items all for a little over $100. It is nice that every food you order is fresh from the kitchen, it would be nice if they can serve 2/person on the soft shell crabs on the buffet. Love their fried donut ice cream, shrimp tempura, teri beef, tiger roll."}
{"text":"BEST HAWAIIAN FIX OUT THERE!  this place beats l&l and most of the items found in aloha kitchen! well, actually I only go to aloha kitchen for their adobo fried rice omelet but I have tried their bbq and it doesn't compare. I absolutely love the MINI garlic chicken, that comes with a scoop of rice and side salad of miso ginger dressing, just enough food for lunch or small dinner. their rice is sticky and the bottom of the rice scoop gets soaked in the garlic chicken sauce, best part of the entire dish. poke express is also in island sushi, and they have the best fresh assorted poke! for dessert, get a plain malasada!"}
{"text":"Island sushi is by far the \"bestest\" place for island style food and broke da mouth sushi rolls!!!!  We eat here about 4-5 times a month and it has always been Ono-licious!!!! The ISG crew is very friendly, attentive and fast!!!!  I recommend EVERYTHING!!!!"}
{"text":"for an all you can eat, this is an amazing sushi bar. they are very fast with there orders and everyone is friendly. when I come back to vegas, I will be back"}
{"text":"Never had AYCE here but I did have their Garlic Chicken, Fried Noodles and Poke. I love the Poke from Poke Express!!! Garlic Chicken and Fried Noodles taste good BY THE ORDER, but if you order by pan, it tastes different. Fried Noodles were bland and garlic chicken was burnt. My sister had a get together on New Year's Eve and ordered a good amount of desserts, including Coco puffs. I'm not a fan of coco puffs but decided to try it since the last time was in Hawaii 6 years ago. I bit into one, and there was a short hair in the chocolate filling, I almost threw up!!! That turned me off even more. I'll probably will never order anything here besides the Poke. I'll stick with other options on Eastern."}
{"text":"Great to eat here during happy hour. Service was good and food was great. I think the total was under $30 and included 6 rolls 1 hot saki and 1 bottle of beer. This was my first time eating here and  would definitly go again."}
{"text":"Really good fish, awesome rolls like \"the big island\" and \"surf n turf\". Had the happy hour with half off sake with AYCE. Unfortunately I have to take a star away because quail egg doesn't come with AYCE, like I understand if they don't want to give me 6, but they could offer 1 per person like most other sushi places. If not for the limited AYCE, this would be my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Their poke is ONO-licious!!!!  Everytime I come to Vegas I make it a point to get poke here at least once.  Hands down, the best poke I've ever had!  And so many varieties to choose from.  Also love that they have desserts as well.  Their mochi is so delicious!  Soon as you walk in you can feel the aloha.  Everything is reasonably priced too.  This is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat not just in Vegas but anywhere!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place after passing by & hearing other satisfied opinions. The taste of everything was so flavorful. I felt like in a small local business in Hawaii. It's casual and a clean looking atmosphere. The variety of appetizer plates you can order besides sushi for the All You Can Eat is great. I kinda wished there were more spicy rolls but the mussels, nigiri, spinach salad, and etc tasted fresh. Service is fine too. I will definitely be back. My favorite sushi places have some competition!"}
{"text":"the malasadas with ice cream, whip cream, and guava dizzled on top! I can't believe my roomie only told me about this now. ugh I'm hooked!  Sake bombs with the workers! If you beat them the round is paid by them.  Fun! hahaha"}
{"text":"I don't mind the grill side at all. Food is good and staff is friendly. But the sushi side wasn't the best. Our waiter gave us ok service but when he went on lunch the manager, I think her name was Stephanie which wasn't the best at giving us even a good service at that. Her vibe was totally negative and we just wanted out from there.  I think if we ever come back, we will just stick with the grilling side."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but overpriced so stick to all you can eat! Also their poke is amazing.   Their malassadas are so delicious, especially the custard filled one :3   Only negative is how crowded and small the place is. Kind of confusing when ordering and paying too because they have three different sections you can buy food from. You can get meals to go from the front and the back is where they sell poke, and they have a separate room on the right for dining in."}
{"text":"Don't come on a busy brunch day, too busy  This is my new favorite place...AYCE Sushi for $20....WHAAAAT! Ridiculous right? Even I couldn't believe it but it's true, and it comes with dessert. Start off with fresh shoyu poke...then sashimi...then the rolls...then do it all over again until you get kicked out or your stomach explodes haha. Staff us awesome and they now have Poke Express so you can take home fresh poke. Kinda pricey but it's the closest thing to being home away from home.  They got OK pastries and local bentos which is a plus when you want a home-feel. I love this place...AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I order delivery. placed my order a little more than 2 hrs ahead. my order was 35 minutes late, food mas cold. my chicken looked like it was last night left over and it was  put back into the oil to warm it up. on the ordering website it say coke bottle and they brought be a fountain cola. Online when you pay it gives you the option to add a tip this doesn't show on the receipt and then the driver it standing there just looking like really no tip.. Makes me wonder if they even see that money."}
{"text":"Great sushi and even better staff! They are so kind and attentive! The music and vibes are just perfect for a great dining experience! This place is for sure a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Special  10 min drive for pickup. Salmon skin salad, Hamachi Kama. Yums"}
{"text":"So a friend invited me to island sushi because our favorite place sin  city sushi  had to relocate and is not open yet. I'm always up for giving anyone a second and maybe a third chance so this is my third chance in 11 months. Last time the food was pretty bad the sushi was really bad unfortunately it hasn't improved I think it's gotten worse.  The sushi is really terrible $21 lunch for all you can eat the miso soup is out of the machine or freeze dried a lot of the fish is obviously frozen. The shrimp tempura was greasy. The appetizer was frozen gyoza. The garlic chicken was burnt and greasy like you don't change the oil kind of greasy. I haven't had the take out part but the sit down food is  bad. How anybody gives this place more than two stars must have a low expectation of getting good food for their money.  I try to be fair but damn get your act together."}
{"text":"The place is really tasty and worth going to during happy hour times. Otherwise, I'd say it's price. We spend about $35 dollars for two people to get about 5 rolls and a drink. The rolls are generally simpler because my husband has shellfish allergies, so you'll be spending more if you purchase rolls with shellfish. We enjoy this place, but it can at times be quite dirty due to the high volume of customers. It's important to note that you cannot bring discounted rolls home."}
{"text":"I visited this place three weeks ago with a friend and had their AYCE sushi. I was really surprised at how good their sushi was. Their service was very friendly and the rolls came out really fast. I think this will be one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I had the displeasure of participating in a six pound Loco Moco eating challenge here on 8/10/17. This event was a freaking joke! We all had 45 minutes to finish and although no one finished, I came the closest eating nonstop until the last five minutes when I hit capacity and had a small reversal. What ended up happening was the restaurant changed the rules during the challenge and kept the new information secret from all the eaters, out of fear everyone would stop eating. The funny thing is the dude they declared the winner aka 'last man standing' had been knocked out cold by the challenge 20 minutes prior to the time expiring. He sat there staring at all six scoops of rice, macaroni salad and malassada unable to continue and ended being declared the winner, all the while it was me who pushed through the pain like a true warrior eating until the point of no return. I finished everything except a couple scoops of rice. Even if they had added what I reversed to my plate and weighed it I still would have slaughtered the losers weight total by close to three pounds if not more and they had the asinine nerve to declare him the winner. I'm the true champion of this challenge and that is a fact that only a fool would dispute."}
{"text":"My 14 year old son is a huge fan of sushi so I decided to bring him here and give this place a try. The food is great and the staff is absolutely fantastic. We sat at the bar and watched as their staff made each order. It was entertaining and as I said earlier, their staff is friendly, attentive, and absolutely fantastic. If I could give it 10 stars I would. The restaurant is clean, welcoming and also welcomes large groups. We will definitely be back and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys sushi and Hawaiian cuisine."}
{"text":"Legit Hawaiian kine grindz. We just moved to Vegas from Hawaii and have been searching for a place with good local grindz. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"So after hearing about this place from my best friend's sister who lives in Henderson and from overhearing a couple folks talking about it at a bank off of West Cheyenne, I had to take my family here to try it. I must say we were thoroughly impressed! I'm not a sushi connoisseur by all means but I have had my share of sushi from all around the world within 39 years of my life and this place generated a big smile on my face when I left. Most AYCE sushi joints around Vegas can't compare to the quality and price of this place. The items you can order with the AYCE deal is extraordinary...especially when you can order kal bi and poke. To top it off, my 11 year old daughter and wife were so happy to be here and loved every bite. And finally, I want to say thank you for supporting the military and offering a military discount to our meal!!! There are few minor flaws about this place. 1. I wish the bathrooms were bigger. 2. I wish you guys would turn up the Hawaiian/Island music more. I couldn't hardly hear what was playing. 3. I wish you guys would open up another restaurant in the Centennial Hills area, or somewhere close to there. Thank you Island Sushi team for the superb experience. We'll be visiting again if we're ever on that side of town."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for good sushi!   Great happy hour specials and AYCE.   The sushi is always fresh and delicious. We tend to eat here a lot when craving sushi. You can't beat the half off happy hour.   Plus Hawaiian food for those in your group that don't want sushi. It's a plus of both worlds. I would recommend not ordering the spam musubi though, very dry."}
{"text":"My cousin took us (and about 10 other members of my family) here for dinner.  3 stars for quality of food and additional star for selection of food. We all got the all you can eat sushi, and for 10 fatties, it was a great deal.. 90 minute time limit was more than enough to stuff our faces with sushi.  I have to admit that the Nigiri was totally worth it.. fish to rice ratio was great.  Big pieces of fish with smaller amounts of rice made the hamachi nigiri a go-to favorite of the night.  Another must is the eggplant fries! My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, but he loved the garlic chicken and the eggplant fries.   Another aspect on their menu is the malasada sundae... and their desserts in general.  A lot of sushi places just have green tea or mochi ice cream as a dessert... Island Sushi has tempura ice cream, brownie sundaes... yum.   I would definitely come back on my next Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed since the majority of the reviews of this place are great. I'm thinking maybe employees (or people who know them) are writing reviews on this place. My boyfriend is obsessed with AYCES so we've been to A LOT of places in Vegas. I would like to think I knew what I was talking about. The menu was so small, I couldn't believe it. Especially since so many reviews are saying what a big selection they have. I don't like the fact that they don't have pictures of the rolls on their menu. I would like to see what I'm ordering. I personally don't eat raw fish so I like to order rolls that are baked or fried. Not one single item was like that. The menu does say baked and fried but they just cook the stuff on top so the rice is still cold. My boyfriend loves albacore tuna. We went at lunch time and they didn't have it so we had to pay dinner prices to get what we came for. He didn't like it at all. He said that the fish was room temperature. I thought that the shrimp and the unagi were fishy. The rolls were nothing special at all. I did like the fact that they were relatively bite size. Some places we go to they cut their rolls so big I have to struggle to get the darn thing in my mouth. My biggest complaint, only one desert per person. The whole reason I go to anything all you can eat is so I can get lots of desert. Luckily my boyfriend doesn't eat sweets too much so I got his. I absolutely love mochi but I didn't get any because the only flavors to choose from were strawberry and mango. I'm a vanilla and chocolate kind of girl. Maybe we'll come here for Hawaiian one day but we will definitely NOT be back for sushi."}
{"text":"Review for the grill side only.   I've been eating here for over 6 years now and I still haven't written a review for them?! What is wrong with me? I was first introduced to this place when my old roommate brought home their oxtail soup. Immediately then, I was hooked. I knew from then on, if the oxtail soup was good, everything else would be good.   So one side of the restaurant is a a sit down sushi joint while the other side is a grill making delicious Hawaiian fare. Like I said, I'll be writing about the grill side. They have large portions, enough to have leftovers the next day. Everything is cooked fresh. They have a display of desserts which include malasadas, chantilly cake, guava cake, mochi and other ono Hawaiian desserts. There is also a small poke counter to order freshly prepared fish. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. I do have my go-to favorites though...  Oxtail Soup: this is my #1 pick when eating here. The broth is rich and deep in flavor. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. They give you huge pieces of meat and 2 big scoops of rice. The ginger and garlic are on the side so you are able to customize your broth. Such a filling meal and very satisfying in the winter months.   Ahi Avocado Bowl: When I'm in need of a \"skinny-person\" meal, this is it. Although it's not really a skinny person meal because the bowl is absolutely huge. The fish is fresh. The avocados and a richness to the fish and rice. The cucumbers add that refreshing crunch. Plus it's extra delish if you add some soy sauce and sriracha on there.   Katsu Chicken: who doesn't love perfectly crunchy katsu?  That's exactly what this is! It's fried fresh. The chicken is juicy but not at all oily.   I can go on and on and name a few more delicious dishes like kalbi beef plate and a bowl of saimin, but I'm don't want to bore you.   Seating is limited, so try to come during non peak meal times or take it to-go. No matter, just come here and get your grub on. I think I'm going to get this for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"All Hail Island Sushi! Any qualms I had with this place are nonexistent now. We went really late craving their combo plates ( pick teri beef / chicken etc) but when we got there the server let us know that the grill was closed.( only sushi is served late night) Sadly we went back to our car when he flagged us down and said that they would gladly make the meals for us. It would just require reheating the grills and if we wouldn't mind the wait. DUH! we waited for our yummy serving of Hawaiian-style carne! and it was SooooOOo good and the fact they went the extra mile this time speaks volumes!! MAHALO ISLAND SUSHI!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Loco moco is the bomb and the sushi is always fresh! Service is great but on weekends it can be pretty packed so be sure to make a reservation"}
{"text":"Honestly I walked in and walked right out. The place looked incredibly filthy. There were stains on the floor and tables weren't wiped clean. I'm not a picky person but there are plenty of other places around town that are more inviting."}
{"text":"I normally order a garlic chicken, garlic chicken combination plate with all brown rice.  Their bentos are great too! The garlic ahi tuna with a choice of chicken suits enough for two meals. The garlic chicken is sweeter in comparison to the mochiko chicken.  I do enjoy this place greatly for Hawaiian food, and it is probably the best in Las Vegas. the Plaza location is way better in though as far as consistency goes. I suggest going there if you want a larger variety of food along with tastier flavors.  The sushi here is sub par to the other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Definitely come here for the Hawaiian food and the tuna poke bar though (I will review this as well). It is worth a shot!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I've been to in a long time! I came here with part of my family in a group of about 12 people. Most of us had the AYCE sushi and it was awesome! We were served often and we almost never had to wait for drinks or more food. The recommendations of the waitress were right on and we had some of the best rolls we have ever had. I don't remember all of them( this was a couple of months ago), but I do remember the candy cane and the island roll. Fantastic. Also loved the garlic chicken. Most surprising was the creme brûlée. My mom is a big creme brûlée snob and enjoyed this so much she wouldn't even let me try it! And the atmosphere made me feel like I was back home in Hawaii and that is a big plus! Will be coming back here on every visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"*EDITED* We are regular customers to Island Sushi and Grill.  We have had multiple family events at the AYCE and frequently eat on the Grill side.  Service was excellent and has always made us feel we are important customers, we feel the Aloha. We recently had an issue with an order from the Grill - take out.  The associate assisting us was new to the complaint department. After speaking to Chef Terence, he resolved the issue respectfully. Quickly. Effectively.   We will continue to patronize Island Sushi and Grill, recommend to friends and enjoy all the local food they have to offer.  Thank you for making us Feel the Aloha. We give this restaurant a Four Star Rating Food - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Customer Service Resolutions - 5/5"}
{"text":"What AYCE sushi restaurant gives you UNI?  ISLAND.  Definitely a winner here.  The sushi quality is not the best, but it is pretty good.  It gets 5 stars for being one of the best, if not the best, AYCE sushi restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Big portions with alright flavors.  Stopped here before making the drive back to LA. The ambiance is very casual. You order at the counter and find a seat. The food is made to order so it takes a while to get your order.   Food: ordered the katsu and their pork loco moco. The food was good. The pork gravy was yummy but it didn't reach its full potential until it was reheated at home. The katsu was OK. It had more breading than chicken. My friends ordered a beef with sauce which they said was very good. I will try that next time. The food overall is just not comparable to some restaurants in Hawaii but it will do!  Staff: these ladies seemed extremely busy and didn't really smile much. I understand that they have things to do but it felt like I was a bother any time I needed something.  They upcharge 89 cents for teriyaki sauce. They only have soy sauce and ketchup on their condiment bar.  Table and chair seating for maybe 6 people per row. They have a bout 4 rows.  Overall, its a nice casual spot to get your Hawaiian fix but it doesn't necessarily trigger nostalgia that will transport you to hawaii --- the POKE side is great though"}
{"text":"Sushi was good and beers are always cold.  Sat at the Sushi bar for a afternoon break from the norm.  The lunch specails are good pricing and the sake made it a perfect.  Tried some new flavored sake which was prety tasty.  Food quality was good, the scene was freindly and staff was more then willing to help out and get refills.  I will be back and will bring some more people with me. will"}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems. My favorite sushi place. Everything is so fresh and you can definitely taste the difference. I always do the ace. They have an all you can drink add on with beer too. There's always a crowd here. Very casual atmosphere and friendly faces."}
{"text":"Waited 5 minutes after signing myself in to the sushi side (three servers that made eye contact, but didn't acknowledge me) and then a minute standing in front of the cashier on the grill side (two people at the counter without acknowledging).   The decent thing to do is a head nod, \"we'll be right with you\", or even a smile. None of the above happened. Absolutely unacceptable. Service here is definitely not even close to what it used to be. Not warm and not friendly with any consistency. Last couple times during the day were okay. Still not the same.   Used to come here all the time and raved about this place to everyone I knew. Sadly, this will probably be my last time here. There's too many options close by."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Been going here since they opened and I've never been disappointed. I've been a loyalty member as well and have redeemed my rewards numerous times. Mac is a server who I've built a rapport with because I go so much and it's nice that he remembers me and the family. So you have good food and great service."}
{"text":"This place rocks! So happy we stumbled upon this place.   I've never seen a restaurant where you sign yourself in when you walk in the door. We came in,  saw a few others doing that so then we signed in.   We were seated in a few minutes and got great service.   We didn't do the all you can eat but we will go back and do that another time.  The sushi was super good.   There's also a to-go section. Many people were coming in and getting their food for take out.  They called it in. I'm glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"If you're from Hawaii and it's time to grind, come here!    This was the first place I ate at as soon as I got off the HCG diet.    The bento C is my favorite, but their Crispy Chicken with Oyster sauce special that got my attention.....Oh man, I wish they had a super size of that!     The Teriyaki beef is ono...brahda, everything pretty good here.    Not too much choices if you're on total strict diet, but at least you can get brown rice, and poke.   if you're trying to watch calories.  .  This is a  Hawaiian style restaurant, and short and t-shirt is perfect....you don't have to dress up."}
{"text":"I am so DISAPPOINTED  we come here to eat sushi all the time and last night was the last time we will ever come here. My boyfriend and I both woke up with the worst food poisoning we have ever had! We have been in bed all day. Not too sure if the fish wasn't fresh or what it was but it's not good."}
{"text":"i came here to eat a few times since the review and a lot of my friends told me that this place was good.  First I tried the hawaiian side which was not bad, but it wasn't great.  The Food I must say lacked flavor.  I ate the Mochiko Chicken and the Beef stew and they could use more flavor in the dishes.  It was pretty bland.   A few days later I decided to try the Sushi side and again it wasn't great but not bad.  the Rice was overcooked and they did not use enough sugar in their sushi rice vinegar which made it a little bitter.  and anyone who is a lover of great sushi knows the rice is the most important ingredient to sushi not the fish.  oh by the way the salmon was really bland.    I decided to take home some baked goods home so I can eat it after at home..  I got some Malasadas, a custard pie and guava cake.. I took it home and decided that i couldn't wait and ate them immidiately.  i'm sorry but the malasadas was hard as a rock.  Not fluffy at all.  The custard pie was good except the crust was too salty.  and the cake was good also but the cake part was very dry.    It seems that they do not have any quality check going on at this restaurant.  or they just don't care."}
{"text":"\"OnoLiscious!\"  Oh my God, when this place first opened it just had the sushi side to it, obviously they are sooo Ono that they opened a fast food side right next to it, with all the Lorcal dishes back home in Hawaii are also offered here, especially the Malasadas....sooo good!  run down:  All you can Eat sushi - So worth it - get the Poki, Lomi Lomi Salmon, garlic chicken , Heck Try all of the pupu side and sushi rolls.   My friend goes there just to eat poki and she orders literally 8 bowls, believe me you'd pay more for just 4 poke bowls normally.  Fast Food side - Bento Boxes are a good deal Saimin is good Malasada's custard filled are Delicious, taste just like Leonards in Hawaii.  Only things that I'm not impressed with is there Eel and Oyakudon bowls, they are soggy and literally when I tried twice to go there and order the Oyakudon (chicken/egg bowl)  they gave me the wrong one and I got stuck with eel.  But to be fair I had a large order both times, so on the 3rd time I just ordered the Oyakudon bowl alone, and I was dissappointed.  I guess I'm used to everything else, which is 98% of the food there 100% onoliscious.  I was hoping their Oyakudon bowl would be like Ichiza's (spring mt), but this dish isn't a staple in Local Hawaiian food, it's more Japanese, so for them just to offer it is remarkable in itself.  Their Guava cake is ono too, but pricey.  Love there breakfast..mmm...mmm...sooo ONO, I'm salivating for my Home food since moving to Denver. :-( can't wait to get back to Vegas.   Oh, forgot to mention the SERVICE is GREAT!  I've been to a lot of all you can eat sushi, actually literally every place in Vegas that has one, and some of the servers get annoyed when we order soo much and they have to keep going back.  I eat like a typical local girl, from a family where we are eating and then talking about what sounds good and what we want to eat later.  lol   Our culture , well atleast my family...We can EAT.  When you get Hawaiians and they have Puerto Rican and all the people who live to eat, you get one Hungry family.   :-)"}
{"text":"Came here Sunday afternoon, Chase was our server. He was very friendly and attentive. The hosts that sat us and got us drinks and refills throughout our time there were very friendly and helpful. Sushi was good, we didn't get all you can eat just a few items. Tempura roll, California, bakes scallop and the jalapeño sushimi. We also tried the vegetable tempura.  Baked scallops was basically just a California roll underneath, it was delicious. A lot of food for the two of us. More than enough.   Everything was delicious, we were quite full, didn't have room for dessert. But we'll definitely come back to try some."}
{"text":"Spam musubi bomb , great friendly staff!! Place is always busy food is always fresh. Breakfast, lunch & dinner this place is bomb"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Very attentive and the fish quantity is amazing. I have no shame to admit that this is the second day I've had lunch here..this week..in a row.    Only downside about the AYCE is that you can only order half rolls on your last one, but that's fine. Every sushi place has their rules.    Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Just went down a few stars for me. They started doing their poke differently. There's not even close to the amount of flavor that their older poke had! I'm really big on poke and this place went down a lot for me. Also, during this visit the service wasn't very welcoming. Pretty bummed! But the garlic chicken was good as usual, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while looking for sushi in Vegas...sooooo good! They have all day happy hour on mon-Wednesday which is half off all rolls. They also have a legit all you can eat ($22 for lunch $27 for breakfast), but we chose to go a la carte. We ordered 5 rolls, all delicious: tempura roll, spider roll, tekka maki roll, salmon lover roll, and the poke roll. Final cost was $30 with tax and tip for 2 people and I was surely satisfied. The tuna was realllllyyyyy good and all the tempura was super crispy. Service was also awesome! Can't wait to visit again...probably for AYCE! Only bummer is its way off the strip and probably not worth the trek if you are in a strip hotel."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stupendous. Their fish and ingredients are top quality. They have great happy hour deals where all cut rolls are half off!!! To top it off they have great hospitality."}
{"text":"\"Very good sushi!\" I'll add this place to my Sushi list. The staff is friendly, welcoming, very helpful & the prices aren't bad either for the all you can eat :-) I'd definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Alright, so after months of aniticipation, the family and I finally packed our bags and made the trek to Las Vegas. For the kids, they were excited to see Grandma & Grandpa...as for my wife and I, well, we wanted to stuff our faces.   Sushi Mon has been our spot for years but after some lobbying from my parents, we decided to give Island Sushi a shot... Plus, Sushi Mon can get SOOO crowded and busy sometimes. We ate at Island Sushi for my birthday and again about 3 days later. We were gonna go to Sushi Mon but I thought: \"Island Sushi's a Hawaiian sushi joint, so why not patronize my people, right?\"   Needless to say, we were not disappointed! First off their Sushi Buffet is cheaper than Sushi Mon. Second, they have that \"local\" taste. (Hawaiian-mainland transplants know what I talking about) Everything on the menu is O-N-O! Check out the pics I uploaded! Only thing I didn't take a picture of was the Garlic Mochiko chicken...we ate it so fast, I didn't have a chance! My personal favorite was the \"Island Special\"... Soft shell crab, topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce (sweet, creamy sauce) HO!!! Buss yo' Mowt!!! And it's all you can eat!!! That's just nutz... The owners name is Dean and he's a real cool, down to earth guy. He even brought out our orders when our waitress was busy...   Well, if you're ever in town or you live Vegas and wanna try out a new Sushi Buffet, you gotta check out Island Sushi!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today and I had the Hawaiian French Toast. Delicious.  My man had the roast pork mini plate and it was very good as well.  Poke Express opened at 9AM and we finished our meal with some great ahi poke."}
{"text":"Worst service here, never coming here again!  I came here last night to order some poke to-go. And from what I witness and experienced, they're really unprofessional. I've eaten here before and the service was excellent then, I don't know what has happened now. I came in and the girl who worked the counter took my order. I stood and waited because everyone else that came in, was dining. Just me and another man were waiting on our order. 20 minutes in neither one of us has gotten our food. I wished that they had a seating area for pickup. But the man got tired of waiting and from what I understand, they messed up and forgot his order, he waited... and he waited too long! So he demanded his money back after he waited an hour! I felt bad for them but understood why he was unhappy. He still had to wait to get his money back, but not in cash! In a gift certificate.. HA! Shows a lot of their character.  Should of been a hint to leave but I still waited and I decided to ask the girl how much longer because people who came in after me got their order and I still had not gotten mines. She responded to me \"what did you order?\" much to my dismay. She sees me standing there and didn't even bother to ask me anything. If in her mind she didn't remember me ordering, shouldn't she have assisted me to see what I needed? So I told her and then she remembers. She ran back to the kitchen and came to me and apologized and said a couple more minutes. I waited about another 15 minutes and my order still didn't come. And the girl just ignored me. I could have thrown a fit like the guy did but I realized how embarrassed they were after he did that. So I stayed patient. The owner comes to me and asks me again what was I waiting on. Are you kidding me? Did they forget my order again? After I tell them for the second time, I see him going back to scoop up my poke, literally 3 minutes later he finally comes with my order.   I will not be coming back. 40 minutes wait and the poke wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the wait. They need to learn how to run a business and be more punctual."}
{"text":"One day in Vegas me and my girlfriend had this super craving for poke ! We went on yelp and was torn between this other place that was recommended to us and this place, we went with this place due to higher ratings.   The poke bar is all the way at the back and the guy was super nice and friendly. He didn't seem to get impatient as we wanted to sample everything and everything was delicious! He even gave great recommendations and would mix pokes for us.   We also saw that they had sushi so ordered a couple rolls, the sushi is not so great but the poke is to DIE for. You can tell the poke is really fresh."}
{"text":"Good place to drop in for lunch.  Sat at the sushi bar and was in and out in an hour easy.... came in hungry, left really full.  There fish isn't the greatest for AYCE.   And I'm not normally an AYCE fan... but for lunch this place is pretty good.   I'd actually give it 3.5 stars.  Service: 4 stars - people are really nice and my tea and water were never empty  Menu selection: 4 stars - they have everything from sushi to plate lunch  Fish quality: 3 stars - not as flavorful or interesting/unique as other places like Naked Fish  Rolls: good selection but not overly crazy variations... and you can ask to have a roll customized for you  Ginger: 3 stars - I'm a Ginger fan and was a bit disappointed that there's didn't taste as fresh as I was hoping... it was a little tough and didn't have the sweetness and punch combo I like  Restaurant ambiance: 3 stars - nothing special but it's clean and doesn't smell like fish  Bakery section: 4 stars - their desserts always look amazing but I have yet to give in to my desire to eat them  Poke counter: n/a - have not enjoyed the Poke yet so I'm going back later this week to try it  Parking: easy, lot out front is rarely filled  Location: easy to find, faces Eastern just south of the 215, and is in a little strip mall"}
{"text":"We come here every time we come to Vegas! Just like being in Hawaii! Food and poke is on point my favorite is the malasadas and the poke! Exactly like Hawaii, which is very rare to find!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Best sushi place in town!!! Our chef Juan had great customer service he was very knowledgeable and friendly. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Malasadas. All day every day. Get your life and order a dozen. AYCE is legit too, I can f up the surf and turf roll!!!"}
{"text":"So the food was great! And they have other options which is great if you have picky kids/people in your party. HOWEVER.... The service I experienced was not good at all. I had to ask for straws for our table 3 times. We waited maybe 15 minutes for our small desserts. And nobody came by to ask if I needed a refill... which all of us did. He had to try to wave them down as well. There was a male waiter who did a good job though, but he was not even out assigned waiter. We just managed to wave him down, and he finally gave us our straws and got our desserts.   tl;dr+more:  Pros: More options than other sushi places, good food, really good deserts, Sunday brunch specials, cheap.  Cons: VERY poor service, seating is strange, small and feels somewhat cramped, very loud atmosphere/ Hard to talk to others at the table."}
{"text":"I went here solely for the malassadas. I got my malassadas and some butter mochi as well. Made the mistake of getting the chocolate filled malassadas, it had a weird slightly sour taste to it. I also got custard filled, didn't like that either. But I must say, the plain non-filled malassadas was da bomb, reminiscent of Leonard's back home with the yeast flavor. The butter mochi was ok, too oily/buttery for me."}
{"text":"Ate there're twice this past week thinking the 1st visit was just a bad day for them since they could not get  2 bento plate served correctly without missing items.   Yet the 2nd visit for lunch took them 1hr and 15 mins to get a 1 plate lunch and 1 mini plate lunch order correct, which they never need get right. In frustration, we just left with what they gave us.   Not worth even 1 star  Update..... 2/01/2016  called in  2 garlic chicken Mini to go, told 10-15mins. Arrived 16mins paid then waited additional 40 mins. Asked for refund, then told the plates where sitting here next to the dount machine for 30 mins. Never did hear from Terrance, yet noticed the abundance of sign which read\" Check your meal before you leave we are not responsible\". Apparently, that's the owners efforts to correct the lack of attention his staff has a handling his customers orders. BTW, It took the manager 22mins to refund my credit card. Of course, they offer the food for free and a box of donuts. I declined since the food sat on the counter forever. I told the cashier and manager, I prefer to pay for my food that way the restaurants stay in business. Several of the patrons waiting for there food nodded in agreement to my conversation with the manager.   I asked to have Terrance the owner call me, which he never did. I can't believe this is not an on going problem with Island Sushi, they wasted another 1hour plus of my day"}
{"text":"I need to update my review.  Food is still excellent, but having been there 1-2 times per week for the past year, it gets harder more annoying when you realize that certain customers are treated like old friends, and certain customers are treated with complete indifference.  I am fed up with begging for refills, begging for my bill, and being virtually ignored while the manager is chatting up his pals and the wait staff is ignoring me.  If I do ever decide to go back, I will eat at the bar (the ONLY place where you get friendly, fast service), demand my bill immediately and tip the sushi bar workers.  I have always tipped the wait staff over the recommended amount, and still I am treated like a second rate citizen.  It's just not worth it anymore.   Sushi chefs are A+.  The wait staff absolutely ruin this place, and the manager I spoke to does not really seem to care.  Also, having read numerous reviews about the terrible service saddens me that nothing is actually done about it.  Again, I've been going weekly for over a year.  I have never once left thinking \"wow, that was great service.\"  Even when the manager chimes in on Yelp, he offers apology by NOTHING else.    I reiterate:  sit at the sushi bar, immediately ask for your bill, and bring cash so you are not stuck waiting endlessly for the apathetic wait staff."}
{"text":"Zenshin/Island Sushi & Grill catered our wedding Nov 2016. We were drawn to them because of the variety in their menu. From the very first taste tasting, we were blown away at the professionalism and quality of service provided! My spouse and I were coming in from out of state to have our wedding in Las Vegas and had many obstacles, especially finding the perfect caterer, but Zenshin made it an easy choice from the beginning.  The management was extremely personable and detailed in the services they provided. We never felt pressured into anything we did not want and they genuinely made us feel like we were their most important customers. Additionally, there was a vast variety of food on the menu, and every single thing we ordered was delicious! It was hard to narrow down the choices because we wanted everything on the menu after we experienced the taste tasting. On our wedding day, the caterers were all set up and ready to go at our venue when an hour before the wedding started we had to move the reception across town, not only were they flexible, the rushed over to set up at the new location and their execution was FLAWLESS and they did not miss a beat! Everybody loved their food, especially their sushi and desserts! Zenshin saved the day and I would recommend this staff any day of the week!"}
{"text":"The place is renovated. I used to like coming here, service was fast and used to accurate with your orders. I had a bad experience a couple months ago for bday dinner. The server was slow, he brought us things we did not order and he didn't bring us items we did order. I decided to give them another chance today and it was a repeat of the same service. I highly recommend not coming here, place looks great but I felt like I spent more time waiting than eating. What sold me away to not coming here was a beetle crawling on the table where we were sitting."}
{"text":"Great restaurant...not a fan of the sushi tho. I'm a huge sushi eater and could try every sushi place in the city if I could. With the number of sushi places around Vegas, this is good, but not my number 1 choice for sushi.   Garlic Chicken and Hamburger Steak is definitely what I go there for! And their Hawaii breakfasts for Portuguese Sausage, Eggs, & Rice...yummm! haha!  Not a Sushi place for big sushi eaters..other than that...it's a taste of 808 in the 702."}
{"text":"What a delightful find off the strip in Las Vegas.  This is a small Hawaiian run sushi joint that offers one of the best all you can eat sushi deals in all of Vegas. I came here for dinner the other night and I was thoroughly impressed with the food and value! There are over 40 items to choose from and all for an affordable 25 bucks. The sushi rolls are made to order and super fresh. He Kalbi short ribs, garlic chicken and gyozas are amazing. Don't forget to order all you can eat dessert as well. My go to is the Malayalam sundae or the tempura fried banana with ice cream. There is an amazing oxtail soup that is separate from the all you can eat menu hat is a must order as well. Come here often with an empty stomach but it won't empty your wallet!"}
{"text":"My research on Island Sushi is a bit incomplete.  We came to sit down for plate lunches.  We weren't sure where we were supposed to sit.  Turns out the plate lunches are on one side and the sushi on the other.  I ordered the combo kalbi and kalua pig.  The kalbi was out of this world.  The kalua pig was less impressive, as was the mac salad.  I didn't try any of the poke or sushi, though. And maybe that's were the magic is.  I'd definitely come back, but I'd be savvier about my choices.  Kalbi 4eva."}
{"text":"Today I had a hankering that could only be satisfied by the taste of fresh sushi and after doing my research I found that Sushi Island may hold the answer but boy was I wrong. Once arriving at Island Sushi we waited for 10 minutes to be seated, we finally decided that our best course of action would be  to seat ourselves and only then did we receive acknowledgment from the staff which rudely told us to go back and wait to be seated while they rudely talked amongst each other. I give them a one star because of there horrific service"}
{"text":"This is my go to for some fresh island grinds! Loco Moco, Hawaiian plate, and the bentos are my top picks. You can also order out some fresh sushi or eat in if you prefer to. They have all you can eat sushi everyday. Spicy Tuna and (uni) sea urchin are my top picks. Customer service is on point whenever I'm here! Young lady in the front is always very cheerful and recommends faves of customers if you have no clue what to get. Desserts are so (Ono) delicious and my pick is always the malasadas filled with custard. At the poke counter you can find lots of island favorites like the ahi shoyu, tako, raw crab, dried aku, poi, and lots more (pupus) appetizers to please that hungry belly. My faves are the limu ahi and the Kim chi raw crab. They are decently priced in my opinion, but others may think otherwise. Im always satisfied!"}
{"text":"I'm not into most Hawaiian food, but I could eat here every day for a week without getting tired of it. The half-price happy hour deal looks great, but their rolls are rather small; Fortunately the all-you-can-eat special is very reasonably priced and it covers almost their entire menu.   Their traditional rolls are good, but I recommend branching out and trying the Hawaiian fusion rolls. The Town & Country and Big Island rolls are both phenomenal, and the ahi belly is some of the best i've ever had. For desert, I've enjoyed the 808 special and the malasada sundae and thoroughly enjoyed them both.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's and my favorite place to stop by on our way back home from a Vegas trip. Such a good price for all you can eat. The sushi is so good and the portion sizes are perfect"}
{"text":"Likes: they get Hanalei poi and poke!  Dislikes: my fried noodles & teri beef wasn't that great.  I'm told the all you can eat buffet/sushi is killas. Maybe next time I visit Vegas I will try em."}
{"text":"Island sushi grill sucks!  They have totally gone downhill this year.  I used to be a big fan of this place, but recently they have just been dissapointing.  Dine in-They burn the food, let alone takes forever for them to cook your food.  They never have malasadas.  They dont get your order right.  They forget simple items that come with your plate.  Pre-order/pick up-They dont tell you that there is certain items are out and they cant make what you ordered till you get there to pick up your food but they try to charge you for it.  Heres a thought call the person back to let them know, you do ask for a telephone number.  They lost all of their good chefs to other locations.  I've given ip on island sushi, this place is not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Great food but the service sucks. The people are great just constantly under staffed."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I am dining. I have been here for almost and hour doing AYCE, and so far have pretty much been ignored. Not only have I not received the majority of the items I ordered, but have actually received items that we not even ordered. Definitely think the servers need to be more organized and work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Love the food and the employees. We come in once a month and get to enjoy some great island food and sushi. The prices are awesome and the staff make it a point to get to know you. Our 12 year old actually put island sushi on his Christmas wishlist. LOL we normally come in for lunch or dinner but had the pleasure to grab breakfast to go one day. The breakfast was awesome. worth stopping in and enjoying. Mon-wed is 50% sushi dine in only. I know they have other deals to check out their site."}
{"text":"Got spicy tuna rolls to go. Rolls fell apart- tuna was mushy and bland. Rice was loose. Eel sauce on the side unexpectedly runny in consistency. Taste wasn't terrible, just anticlimactic. Overall, not worth $20 for two rolls. Where's the good sushi in Henderson?!"}
{"text":"This was the best find in all of Vegas!  We will bring our entire basketball team back for many years. They were accommodating, friendly, fast and super fresh sushi.  Everything about this place is great and I will recommend it to all our friends"}
{"text":"So I have this thing for AYCE sushi. Sure, the quality isn't is as good as a regular sit-down spot, but I'd rather get my money's worth. And considering it was $24.95, you bet I was gonna stuff myself. All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this.   The place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full. Service was pretty good though considering it was busy. Our waitress came by often to get us more water or take more orders for the all-you-can-eat dinner. If I remember it right, sake bomb shots were $2. Keep in mind it comes in a glass with the beer already.   Their salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll. Do yourself a favor and get the tempura ice cream for dessert. It's pretty damn awesome, so save room for that. Yeah. I'd go again, but I'd like to try something else too."}
{"text":"Not to bad for the all you can eat deal  Service was great  Bring a big appetite"}
{"text":"We come here often and really like this place. They make some creative and delicious rolls. We recommend sitting at the bar, the sushi chefs always take great care of us. I like the all you can eat and the combo plates. Make sure to try the mochi for dessert and their selection of Japanese wines."}
{"text":"Doing the serious happy dance right now. This is foodie heaven for me. Sunday brunch including breakfast options, AYCE sushi, Hawaiian specialties and Hawaiian desserts. EVERYTHING is ono-licious! Enjoying the  malasadas now."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi place in Vegas. Great happy hour & all you can eat prices. My favorite roll is the Island Special. The Poke is bomb also!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for awhile now and I think it deserves a review . When you walk in there are three different 'stations' I would say . You got poke express which is a company set aside on its own . Then two more sections that is just island sushi . One side is mainly the fast hawaiian food and one that is more sit down with the AYCE sushi option.   They've got a happy hour I like to go to every Monday - Wednesday all day that is half off select rolls. I love the surf & turf! I can't not come here without eating it . The food is really yummy , however the real let down is how they lack in service . It is just so-so and sometimes irritating. Whenever I come to the sit down section I can always expect service to be slow and mediocre. Usually it takes a long time for them to refill drinks and take your order, esp if your an AYCE . There not rude or anything there just extremely slow , which is why it didn't get 5 stars.   The atmosphere is nice , it clean with two tvs on either side. It also has a sort of mini billboard on at each of the side tables that advertises local businesses .   I LOVE the Togo/fast food side of this place. It's so yummy , everything that I've gotten from there . I especially love the bentos , can never go wrong with those. If your looking to buy poke I suggest going to the poke express counter .   Tada!"}
{"text":"I ordered sushi from Island Sushi on Postmates. I wasn't able to do special instructions to the sushi roll i wanted on the app, so i called Island sushi as soon as i completed the order. 1st i was put on hold for a FULL 5min. So i hung up and called back. I told them i wanted to add cream cheese to my roll. She says it was already made and i can't add it. Which i reply, \"well if i wasn't put on hold for 5 min, i would of been able to tell you before it was made.\" So she puts me on hold again. Now some guy answered and tells me the same thing she did. I said \"well than it's to be remade\". And then he puts me on hold for another FULL 5 mins! Comes back and said \"we were able to add it\". I thank him and apologize for being difficult (even though i don't think i was). AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DID!! Are you f*cking kidding me?? Never again Island Sushi, NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Sushi IS my food of choice although I seem to have only reviewed steak houses. I do not live anywhere close to this place but make the drive as much as possible. The rolls are great and if you can handle it after the best happy hour ever, the 808 is the way to go.  The hours are limited tho and closed on Sundays..my only day off."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was koto and the AYCE was some of the best I've ever had. Now it's island sushi. The AYCE is standard fare. Carbon copy of all the other AYCE sushi places in town for the most part. What this place has that others don't is the aloha spirit. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. Never an empty water cup. When I'm here, I feel like I'm at a friends house. Always feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I didn't make the best decision (their Tuesday special of ramen), but still giving it 5 stars because the service and other options are on point. For me, service is key. This team understands that concept. They are extremely friendly and helpful. They enjoy their job and that makes a big difference. Also ordered salmon avocado poke which never disappoints. Always a good choice on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I love this place the cafe/grill side of the restaurant is awsome Poke is always good and  affordable my family ordered delivery a few times it was not consistent but when they did something wrong we got some good deserts in return :) dining in is also a different experience the servers are very nice and the food is good my husband checked in on Yelp and we got all you can drink sake for $8 overall a nice place have nothing bad to say great experiences :)"}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of a friend who knew I moved here from Hawaii. She recommended the all you can eat sushi but we decided not to get that because I couldn't see myself eating that much. My daughter wanted the yaki sobs but it wasn't available because they ran out of the sauce. My boyfriend got the sushi and said it was good. I got the fried noodle combo with mochiko chicken and garlic chicken. The chicken was good even though it was a little over cooked and dry. The fried noodles was the bomb but little on the skimpy side for the price they charged.  I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.   The place is kind of small and not a lot of tables are available. I wouldn't recommend going during lunch hour unless you are doing take out."}
{"text":"I love stopping by here after the gym in the morning. My favorite is the kalbi shortribs for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for poke & Hawaiian food. For awhile, I've been looking for taegu that I used to eat as a kid back in Hawaii & this is the only place where I can find it!  I've been to the sushi side a few times (serves AYCE & more of a sit in restaurant), but I prefer the grill side (sit in & to go available). Bentos are served just like how you would get them in Hawaii & a pretty packed plate for the price. There's always poke bowls on the specials list, but when Poke Express is open that's where I usually order from. Spicy Ahi (tuna with masago & mayo) is the BEST! & if you're into octopus.. Tako with limu is my recommendation!  I probably should've written a review a long time ago, but I guess I was just too busy inhaling all my food. :D"}
{"text":"I was told by a friend that this place is THE PLACE to go to for loco moco. So why not try it out? There is spacious parking in this lot. Upon entering this establishment, I was a bit confused because there was a hawaiian restaurant in front of me and then a divider on the right which seemed like a sit down sushi restaurant. I guess it was two restaurants in one establishment. Anyways, I came for the loco moco. I ended up ordering the pulled pork loco moco and the chicken katsu. The lady who took our order in the front counter seemed overwhelmed as she was taking customer orders as well as phone orders. It didn't bother me so much that she was working hard, but it's nice to be in the moment with someone you're talking to.  When the food arrived, oh boy did it look good. All in all, it was okay. It didn't really hit the spot as my go-to hawaiian restaurant in LA. It was filling no doubt, but it felt a little bland. It definitely needed salt. The egg on the loco moco was overcooked. I never had pulled pork in my loco moco and I thought it was an interesting meat to add on, but I think the gravy needed to be more flavorful for me to really enjoy the meal.   The Hawaiian side of this restaurant is small with long table seating and maybe 3-4 booths. There are TVs to keep you company while you wait for your food. In all, this place is alright, but I know there are other Hawaiian restaurants in the area that I might want to visit prior to returning here."}
{"text":"Sorry Sushi-Mon on Maryland/ Silverado.. but because you were unable to seat me within 45min, I had to explore other options.  Thank goodness I did!  Sooooo.... if you're going to go the specialty roll route I highly recommend the Island Special.  Uber flavorful and delicious... as full as I was, I ordered a few of these.  The Spicy Mexican was ok too... but I guess it depends on what you're in the mood for.  There is one thing you MUST order... it's the poke.  It's sooooo good, that if you're on the all you can eat menu, you can only order one order per person.  That is definitely saying something.  Something to keep in mind... they have a great happy hour special (9p and beyond!):  50% off all sushi cut rolls + 1/2 off Selected Beers & House Sake - it's an amazing deal!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never checked in.  The food tastes great.  Portion sizes are meh but at least like I said, the food tastes great.  I've had the Teri Beef and the Chicken Katsu.  I like the Teri Beef.  It's tender and very tasty.  I always get the Kalua Pig and Cabbage for my grandma.  They should probably just call it Kalua and leave off \"cabbage\" because every single time they are chintzy with the cabbage.  I ordered it today with extra cabbage which is .75.  I have no problem paying extra but there wasn't any extra.  They did however, throw in the bottom core part of the cabbage . Thanks y'all.  Stinginess with the cabbage aside, this is a decent place to have some teri beef or Katsu."}
{"text":"Not the best food. The service was good, but the food was just okay. Quality of food has actually declined since they first opened. The baked goods were not fresh. The haupia cake tasted like it was sitting in the fridge for a few extra days. The coca puffs tasted like store bought chocolate pudding filling. Poke lacked the awesome seasoning as other Hawaiian food restaurants in Las Vegas. Probably won't be back for another couple years."}
{"text":"Service was great Food was great Company was great  I haven't been in a sushi mood lately but Shige O. recommended this place awhile back, so he brought me and my friends here. I'm really glad that I gave it a shot. I'm actually craving the sushi as I'm typing this review.  I don't know why but I kinda doubted sushi in Vegas at first but it was pretty good!   Like I said, the service was ultra friendly. Many people are local that works here and I just had a great home vibe. They played local music and all.   I had the garlic ahi, mexican roll and a negi hama. Loved em all! I even tried a bit of their salad with the house dressing, two thumbs up. The water was fresh too (I never got used to chlorine water within the week that i was in Vegas)  They offer a huge variety of fish, and a lotta other stuff too.  I would definitely return to eat here the next time I make a trip to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Breakfast of Champions!!  Brought in my in laws from Singapore. Had  Kimchee Fried Rice Loco Moco  Portuguese Sausage  Malasadas - plain, Haupia (coconut) and Custard  What can I say, never a disappointment.  Winnas as usual. Great start to the day!"}
{"text":"Drove here in Henderson at 8:45am from Summerlin and they don't have Malasadas until 9:30. :(  I was gonna share them with my co workers. It's just frustrating and hard that you come here from other side of town and they don't have it ready. Before, whenever I came at 9ish they already have it available. Yes, I know I could have called, but I assume since they opened at 8am??? It should be available by now.   They have very delicious Malasadas... I share them with my friends and family... they all love it."}
{"text":"My favorite  spot anytime I am in Vegas . Variations of pike to order  wasabi, furikake, spicy avocado, kim chee whole crab pieces, octopus, mussels and ao forth. Order by the weight so it gives plenty of options to to try them all. The tuna was fresh and tender and the crab was finger licking good. Definetly a must for sashimi lovers. Offers other Hawaiian dishes for the non seafood lover."}
{"text":"ok so went to Island Sushi last night and ordered a saimin and a mini tonkatsu.  First of all, we were the only ones in there, our order took over 15 minutes to come out, our  tonkatsu came out first and when we opened our plate, there was 5 tiny pieces of tonkatsu.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?  we just sat there staring at the plate saying are you kidding, are they serious?  we asked the worker if this was really the order, she said yes, they give one piece for a mini!  we had to laugh...then our saimin came out and was not even hot, we had to ask them to put it in the microwave.  this place has gone downhill and I guess that's what they do, suck you in with the food and then they rip you off!  We love their food but seriously, what's next?"}
{"text":"Read through the reviews, and decided on trying the garlic chicken and deep fried octopus appetizers. Both were good, but the chicken was a standout. It had a nice thin coating, and the garlic sauce was fucking delicious.  The Island Special roll with spicy soft crab and tuna was tasty as well. Our server, and sushi chef were very attentive even though it was busy. Make sure to go during happy hour (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) for %50 percent off all rolls, and drink specials. We ordered a bunch of rolls, and apps, but the bill was still below $50. What a deal!"}
{"text":"1 star for the poke bar 1 star for the yummy dessert bar  1 star for the all you can eat sushi option   We went in early evening and they had 3 parties ahead of us. 2 tops and we were a 4 top (2 adults and 2 kids). We waited in their front room, the restaurant was behind a lil curtain in its own room. We waited for about 30min. A little too long for only being the 3rd party on the list and with at least 5 open tables in the restaurant. The lady who was sitting people had called another party before us but we stood up and said, we got here before them and we still haven't been seated. She gestured for us to go ahead inside as well. We walked in the restaurant and they had at least 5 tables open.   We did the AYCE and ordered our girls their own individual bowls of rice and a couple appetizers for their dinner. There was a lot of waiting in between, waters not being filled in a timely manner (we had to ask a couple times for refills), and our server forgot one of our orders but made it seem like they were still making it. It was well over 20min and we ordered another roll after the fact and still got that before the first one. Then he charged us for 2 kids AYCE when they didn't even touch any of the rolls, just what we ordered them individually. That was another 5 or so minutes waiting for them to adjust our bill. We spent 2.5hrs at the restaurant. Half the time was us waiting on their service. We ate our food pretty quick, at the most we were eating for an hour. The rest of the time was waiting to be seated, waiting to order after being seated, waiting for the food, waiting for the bill (we had been done for a good 10min and no one had brought us a bill, we had to ask them), and then waiting for them to correct our bill for over billing us.   The food is not that great to be receiving such a service. They look busy, but they just have 2 servers for the whole restaurant. At least that's what I had noticed. Maybe hire a couple more servers and you'd provide faster service instead of guests waiting and waiting. Definitely not going back to the restaurant. There's other AYCE sushi places with better service and better tasting food. I do like their poke bar though, quick and friendly service every time I went there."}
{"text":"I came here for the Hawaiian desserts and AYCE sushi. I have to say I was let down. I had high hopes...The fish was just okay and not worth the price. At $23 per person I expected better quality and bigger pieces of fish. The rolls I tried weren't very tasty either. I was okay with it thinking, I'll get my desserts and couldn't go wrong there right? Wrong again! The butter mochi needed more flavor, coconut milk maybe, the chantilly coco puffs were dry and horrible, tasted like frozen from the box kind, and the chantilly needs more sugar. I also tried the guava cake, again dry and missing the right flavors, my kids wouldn't even eat it! The only thing that was still amazing were their malasadas! Yes, they got that part right! That's unfortunately the only thing I can recommend. I haven't been here in years and it's nowhere near what I remember :("}
{"text":"Very interesting place, it's a sushi and hawaiian restaurant right next to eachother/in the same building.  Luckily I wanted Sushi and the boy wanted Hawaiian so we drove a little out of our way for this place.  First off, let me say that the staff here, even though it seems young, was extremely friendly.  They all stopped what they were doing when we left and said good bye.  That's huge for me, it shows how much they care and I really appreciate that.    The food?  All good.  We got food to go, I got the spicy mexican roll which was a shrimp tempura roll with spicy hamachi on top and jalapenos.  Then I got hamachi sashimi, which, for 5 slices being only $10, was very well priced.  All the fish was fresh, sauces were balanced, it was beautifully displayed.  The boy got the garlic shrimp combo meal and he was very happy.  I wish this place was closer, I would go more often, but we will definitely have to make a trip back soon!"}
{"text":"My son just love this place. We are celebrating his Birthday today. And the saketini Yelp promo put it over the top!!"}
{"text":"La la lovvvve their malasadas and garlic chicken!!! The one and only place that serves authentic Hawaiian food that actually tastes like it's from home. (aside from the Cal)."}
{"text":"My favorite all you can eat sushi joint.  The staff is great and they are family friendly. I love all the spicy rolls.  If I didn't have such an Army to feed (they eat like one too) I'd be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi!  We finally found a place to eat sushi in las Vegas - \"The Island Sushi and Grill\".  It's sooo good and it's all you can eat.  The ahi, tako and crab poke are addicting! The hamachi kama is to die for! All sushi are made to order and the desserts are good.  The malassada sundae is very delish, reminds me of Hawaii...."}
{"text":"There is alot going on here, so I can't give a grade for everything, but the lunch I took out recently was pretty poor. Chicken Katsu Curry, was a mess. The rice was improperly cooked, lumpy and overcooked. The curry was bland and only onion, undercooked carrots and no potato. Thoughtful in the way they put the Macaroni salad in a seperate container so it won't get hot, BUT stale, probably a few days old MAC salad?! I never throw away macaroni, but this time it was a no go. Good friendly service, poor to go food quality.  Makes me want to go back to Ted's Bakery in Oahu, they are the BEST!  ----------------------------- I was in on Sept 24th around lunchtime, not sure why you ask when I was in there. If you have good cooks and bad cooks, you should know. Maybe the menu has too much variety to keep fresh? Simple items like Macaroni salad should be rotated to keep a fresh product. I've had food through here for years and it used to be much better. No complaints about Poke Express, they are ONO! It's a gamble going to Aloha grill or the sushi place, sometimes good, sometimes bad. How can you go to a place where it goes both ways? I sent you a message on the website."}
{"text":"If I'm in the area always try to make a pit stop to grab some fresh hotmalasadas and of course poke!! It shows I haven't been here for so long that they have poke bowls. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend because my fellow 808 friends loves this place and swear that it's as close as it gets to home.  Us Mainlanders now gotta be on the lookout for Hawaii style cooking. :)  So for starters, they have daily specials and I wish it was a WEDNESDAY because they have Meat Jun.  Hopefully it tastes just as good as Dong Yang in my hometown in Wahiawa. Definitely need to make my way out to Vegas during the weekday.   Food:  Tako Poke Shoyu Poke with limu Spicy Ahi poke bowl Friday's special - Lau Lau plate with rice and long rice Fried Noodles with Kalbi And lastly for dessert 1 dozen malasadas  When you first walk in, there are dessert choices on the left hand side.  Also, looks like that's where you can order \"to go\" items.  Keep walking in and go straight to the POKE station where you'd find lots of different types of POKE.  On the right hand side is the dine in with a sushi bar.    Our server was alright and nothing really stood out.  Our food came quickly and everyone was really nice.  We even met the owner. Aloha!    For the food here's my opinion:  Poke was on point considering that I've had the opportunity to try all different places from San Diego's Best Poke and the infamous Foodland POKE so Island Sushi is good.  The lau lau was dry, unfortunately.  It was overcooked.   Fried Noodles and Kalbi was also good.  The kalbi was on point however the noodles lacked flavor which is fine so I added soy sauce. (I like salty food so that's my fault) Now for the malasadas.  Lots of places claim that they have good malasadas.  I will say that so far on the mainland, Island Sushi & Grill has the best.  We opt for 6 malasadas to eat at the table then took 6 to go.  It was good that I had to return before leaving Vegas for San Diego.  I called in my order and when I got there my order wasn't quite ready.  :( Which is fine so I waited.  The young lady (on a Sunday morning) grabbed a box from the warmer and filled a couple with custard.  This time around the malasadas wasn't as good.  Not sure why, it was also not as hot.  :(  I think I should've ordered when I got there instead. It probably would've been hot.    Aloha and Mahalo Island Sushi & Grill.  Definitely a restaurant I will return to when I'm in Vegas.   #islandgirlnette"}
{"text":"We tried Island Sushi a few times when they first opened and they only had a sit down restaurant. Back then they had so-so food (we had ok sushi) and average service. Unfortunately, we weren't that impressed and wrote them off. Then about a year ago a friend said that IS has opened up a grill section on the opposite side of the sit down restaurant with a very different menu filled with local plate lunch favorites. We heard a lot of good things about their plate lunches, so we had to give them a try.  We walked in during a lunch rush and the first thing I noticed is how empty the sushi and sit down area was and how packed the new grill section was.  I looked over the new menu and was impressed. They had everything...breakfast plates, saimin, burgers, bentos, and many of the plate lunches you would eat in Hawaii.  They also had a dessert case with all kinds of sweets...cakes (chantilly, guava, & haupia), mochi, cocoa puffs (don't do it, they are FAR from Liliha Bakery's gems!), and cookies. And they do make malasada's and they are pretty good. We also had AYCE ($20.99/ person) lunch sushi menu which was very good for the price. They also have a Poke Express in the back of the restaurant.  If you are hosting any party, this is where you should get your poke. They have a wide variety of poke dishes, ahi, tako, shoyu, crab, etc.  Our favorites: Garlic or Mochiko chicken Ahi Belly is ono Hamburger steak Bentos for $8 you can't go wrong.  Tako Poke  Love their breakfast menu- Loco Moco with fried rice  Island Sushi Specials: menu Happy Hour 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday     All Day   Drink Specials $3.00 Large Beer $2.25 Hot Sake $4.00 Saketini #1.50 Small Beer $2.00 Sake Bomb   Sushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95 Sundays                    11:30 AM - 3:00 PM   AYCE Lunch & Dinner Lunch-$20.99 Dinner-$24.95  If you had an ok experience with IS, you should give them another shot. I'm glad we did. They stepped up their game and service.   Shaka brah"}
{"text":"I would have rated 2 stars, but because of the Sunday Brunch with added pupus/apps, it deserves the 3rd star.   I know it's called Island Sushi, and the owner is from Hawaii, but, I don't care much for the raw fish, sushi, or rolls here. I swear I've tasted much better, fresher fish. in addition, they DROWN their rolls in a watery, too sweet, unagi sauce. (I'm used to the kabayaki unagi sauce, which is dark and rich, and found at most other sushi restaurants here in Vegas,) The only roll that I can remember from here is the Candy Cane Roll, but, still, it's no big thing. But, in any case, I return here with my boyfriend every once in a great while to fill my tummy with pupus/appetizers galore! The selection of appetizers that they offer is VAST in comparison to many other sushi bars ON SUNDAYS. I like the mochiko chicken, eggplant fries, and their tempura sauce! It is sweeter than most places, which i happen to like as well. The Sunday list changes a lot, and it includes mini desserts too. I always get a creme brulee to finish.  The service is decent at best, some waitresses a little friendlier than the others, and the decor, is... well, i don't know how you would call it, but I guess, they're trying too hard for the local island feel. I am definitely not fond of the digital photo frames up next to our table, showcasing various rolls,random groups of people, and, then, seeing it in a never ending loop from the corner of your eye!   In any case, you just might find me there eating a plate lunch on the grill side. ;)"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place here in Las Gaygas! Hubby and I always come for AYCE. Our favorite rolls are the Kahuku, Mapuana, Dragon, 007 and lasagna. They also have a great selection of appetizers including shrimp tempura, kalbi ribs, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, and others. My favorite is the seafood dynamite. It's clams, scallops, and shrimp covered with spicy mayonnaise and onions and baked. Their desserts are also quite tasty. I always order the 808 special. It's a combination of strawberries and bananas fried in tempura batter with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. My hubby ordered the creme brûlée once and it was laughably small, slightly larger than a half dollar coin! Mocha ice cream is also very good.   The only reason I knocked off a star is because of the service. They always take forever to refill drinks and the waitress there is often rude. I understand that it's always busy but crack a smile once in awhile and don't be so short with the customers."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't written a review on this wonderful establishment. Every time I have mainland family visiting, a stop at this restaurant is a must. In Nov 2014, I think I spent over $200 visiting this restaurant because of all the family we had visiting.  I have been coming to this restaurant for the past four years, before I even moved to Vegas. Two reasons why:  1. I'm a noodle head and they have really good fried noodles. Noodles like I used to get from the manapua truck when I was a kid but with more char sui, spam and kamaboko 2. The POKE deli in the back. As far as I know, this is the only restaurant that has this, similar to all the supermarkets from HI. You can sample some of the different pokes they have. You even can choose to get a 1/4 lb of poke. This allows you to get all kinds of poke to taste!  And honestly, I would say that this is the original poke restaurant in Las Vegas. Although poke is the current trend in Las Vegas and all these poke bowl restaurants are opening up. If you want authentic, original Hawaiian style poke, come here. Forget the rice and all the vegetables and load up on poke. Before I forget, the poke counter closes early than the restaurant, at 8pm.  One of my family favorites, malasadas. When you visit this restaurant, be sure to put your order in asap as it does take time to fry up these bad boys. Try the different filled flavors. Be sure you leave room for these delights at the end of your meal as it is best when it is fresh.  And they did renovate the \"carry out\" portion of the restaurant. When I visited the restaurant last week, my family of 12 got there as soon as they opened up. We were able to take up two rows of tables with plenty of room for other patrons.  Because this is an extremely popular restaurant for the \"9th Islanders\", it is important that you plan ahead. Lunch, dinner and weekends, this place is poppin'."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Vegas this is our always our first and last stop. All you can eat sushi oh yea! At first we thought what? Sushi in the middle of the DESERT? no way. Boy were we WRONG! Everything on the menu is good and we will continue to come back. Half off specials is the bomb and if you go during a UH game, they pass out sake bombs. Well, they did when we were there last time. Yesss!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try the oxtail soup but didn't want to wait until 11 PM to eat at the California hotel.  We ordered some poke and katsu along with the oxtail soup.  You order at the counter first and they will bring your meal to the table.  We went during dinner time and there was 10 people already in line.  There's a sushi only section on the other side of this restaurant.  Crowds of people always stand in line to eat here.  We will have to go back and try their sushi next time.    The oxtail soup has a different tasting broth.  It's more like an udon tasting broth which we found to be very interesting.  The oxtail meat was very fatty which also made the broth quite oily.  My meat had A lot of fat attached versus what I would get at the California hotel.  Quality was lacking but it was good enough for us to eat for dinner at a reasonable time.    The chicken Kutsu was prepared just right and I am enjoyed eating this more than the ox tail soup.  The poke was good for what you'd get in Vegas where it is nowhere close to an ocean!  My mother-in-law got the garlic chicken and that was very flavorful!  Overall I would come here again when I'm visiting Vegas.  Good comfort food but avoid prime dinner hours!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is always busy. Sushi is fresh and the rice is just enough. So you can eat more sushi. The desserts are well crafted and tastes good too. It's decor is very simple and functional. I like that it is open late too. My favorites  are uni, Hamachi kama, and amaebi. ."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The all you can eat sushi deal for dinner is absolutely worth it.  The grill is very tasty, from the bbq short ribs to the garlic chicken to the fried noodles.  They also have a fresh selection for ahi tuna in the deli section, variety of flavored marinades.  The customer service is also great!  Once I had ordered something new to me, and it was just too salty for my taste and without any hesitation they replaced it!  Thanks"}
{"text":"For a late night snack this place was pretty good.   50% off sushi rolls during happy hours.  Staff was friendly, service was good and fast.  Lots of rolls to choose from.  They also have an A.Y.C.E. if you're really hungry.  I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"All you can eat on Sunday is the bomb!  Great service, Good drinks, and fun atmosphere.  I recommend to anyone who wants to have a great experience and great for groups!"}
{"text":"Island Sushi is our go-to place for sushi. Eastern Ave. has at least a dozen decent sushi places, but we won't go to any other after coming here. We love the Island-friendly attitude. It's fun to come here. Today I discovered that I was the only customer not wearing flip flops. The service is great; everyone there works hard, but Mac and Chuy are always at their best. Monday is Happy Hour all day and rolls are half price. 5 rolls, one big Sapporo and a couple of malasadas are a great meal  for 2 and won't put a hole in your wallet. All of the rolls are great; just tried the Spicy Mexican and Kilauea and loved them both! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place. Service is on point and staff is extremely friendly. Hubby and i usually don't like to do ayce because everyplace we tried have been a disappointment with the quality of fish. This location is now a favorite spot for us, we will be back!!!! A big thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Decided to try it out based on a pretty good yelp rating and seeing all the food on IG. Service was awesome.  The counter help and the Poke guy in the back helped us out and answered our questions with a smile.  Ordered our food and it came out in a timely manner.  I ordered the Fried  Noodle Combo with Mochiko Chicken.  The chicken was crispy, juicy, and flavorful.  The rice, noodles, and Mac salad was less desirable.  The rice was hard, noodles were soggy and wasn't seasoned, and the macaroni in the mac salad had a weird texture.  My son had the corned beef hash breakfast.  He loved it except for the rice.  Same situation as my plate, the rice was hard.  My wife and daughter ordered Poke bowls.  The presentation was nice.  My wife enjoyed the sushi rice, my daughter not so much.  Poke had good flavor and the sides were good too.  Fresh and crisp Pickled cucumber and Crispy Taro chips.  The portions of the actual poke itself was disappointing.  It was about 2 teaspoons of fish.  We probably will order it by the pound next time.  We also ordered a dozen Malasada's.  6 haupia and 6 chocolate.  These Buggahz was MEEEEEAAAN!  No complaints here.  Aloha...."}
{"text":"Got the Mix plate with teri beef, teri chicken, kal bi, white rice and mac salad. Topped it off with some fresh ahi shoyu poke and a malasada. One of the best teriyaki sauces I have ever had! I grew up in HI and the quality here is the same if not better!"}
{"text":"Amazing Hawaiian food by Henderson.  There are 3 parts to this restaurant.  The Hawaiian Express, Poke Express and Sushi bar/restaurant.  I've never eatten at the Sushi restaurant, only at the Hawaiian food and Poke Express.  The Poke is really awesome.  If you like Tagu, it is sweet and chewy and very authentic.  The shou Poke and spicy poke is great also.  If you are a poke fan, do try Poke Express.  I usually get the Bento Box A with Garlic Chicken.  It is a huge meal with rice, Teri beef, garlic chicken, spam and noodles.  Very flavorful and filling.  My wife gets the tuna bowl.  That is huge also.  Great flavors with the tuna and rice.  They have Oxtail soup on Saturdays all day and after 600pm other days.  I like this and it's very authentic.  You combine the rice and ginger and green onions and you have a cornucopia of flavors and textures in that oxtail soup.  It has been the best I could find so far in Las Vegas.  I would pass on the Saiman.  The noodles are good, but the broth is not as flavorful as the other places I've tried in LV.    Overall, the go-to spot for Hawaiian food this side of town."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi dinner and I have to say that this was once of the better places I have been to in terms of the quality of sushi. I'd say probably in the top 3. The dinner is almost $30, but you do get a wider selection of choices known as the \"dinner selection items\" which are not available during lunch. Also items marked with a hashtag have a one item per person restriction.   I got about 25 items and I recommend getting the crunch and black widow roll. The eel, ebi, and salmon nigiri was really good too. The hot lava roll was not good at all because it didn't have much taste besides spiciness and the inside of the roll had a red paste texture.   Another highlight was each person gets up to two dessert items which was a first for me at an AYCE sushi. Be sure to try the green tea ice cream (strong green tea taste) and the malasada sundae! Malasada is kinda like a Hawaiian donut that reminds me of a cross between a donut and churro. The tempura ice cream was okay because they only have vanilla ice cream and the fried shell was kinda soggy.  Overall, the experience was very nice and I would go back here again. The only downer about this place is the appearance. When you first walk in it looks like a small bakery place with the main dining area on the right side. It has a hole in the wall sort of feel which is okay, but the other AYCE places I have been to have a more classy atmosphere and they even had lower prices haha. Either way the most important thing is the food right? Definitely give this place a try if you are craving sushi with a good selection of appetizers, side dishes, and desserts."}
{"text":"Not bad food, but a little confused. Got the combo plate with the Terri beef and garlic chicken. Did not get any extra sauce other than soy. Mac salad was warm, dry and had mashed potatoes in it. Never had island style mac salad with mashed potatoes in it. The Terri beef was good, but was not terri sauce not sweet at all. Portions were good and I would go back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"If i am in a roll mood, I go to Island Sushi hands down.  This was one of the first sushi places I ever went to and it has spoiled me to any other restaurant.   Island Sushi sets the bar for ayce sushi and each roll is so good.  They also have unique appetizers that are not in any other sushi place.  The customer service is awesome, and the environment is very comfortable."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews, I decided to try this place...and so glad I did.  Not only was service was great, but the food was so awesome as well.  We got there for lunch, but decided to do the dinner ayce instead.  4 bucks more and you get uni, amaebe, and so much more... what an awesome deal!  Like other reviewers had mentioned, they don't try to fill you up with rice.  The nigiri was definitely awesome, with the fish totally covered the small pile of rice.  You definitely get your money worth!  The hamachi kama was really awesome.  My bf, who does not eat ayce (strictly sashimi only), thought this place was great."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend consider ourselves regulars here. We have our favorite rolls and everything. The Mexican Roll is my favorite and 007 is my boyfriends favorite. They have the best quality for the awesome deal you get. Best advice is to go during happy hour. I would say the ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the service there isn't the best. They definitely need to work on their customer service. Overall top 3 sushi places we've been too :)"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow ! If I could give more than 5 stars I would ! Amazing sushi ! Great costomer service ! And a cozy environment , best sushi place I have been to in Vegas so far"}
{"text":"This place has 3 sections; Hawaiian grill, poke and sushi. Last night I tried the grill section; the place packed when I came in. Almost everybody getting to go order. The place is really small so I prefer to eat at home. We tried; classic loco moco, mochiko chicken and teri chicken, all really good and very flavorful. We also get some filled malasada; the filling is pudding but all good. My kids said they like malasada better than regular American donut; they never had one before. We all really happy with everything we ordered. They also have lots of classic Hawaiian desserts.  Next time I wanna try their sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing!   We found this sushi bar on Yelp! while vacationing from So. Cal. Back home we've had a lot of AYCE and let me tell you- this was the best! We'll totally be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Used bite squad tonight and ordered a couple rolls and a cucumber salad. Their menu has a wide variety of Hawaiian, American and Japanese food. I was surprised at how low the prices were.   The 007 was delicious! The fish all tasted fresh and they threw in a side of eel sauce for me without me even requesting it. I also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll and although it wasn't spicy enough for me, it was still tasty.   They put the dressing on the side for the cucumber salad so I didn't have to worry about the cucs being soggy. Overall, I was pleased. I'll have to try out the restaurant next time, I hear they have amazing desserts!"}
{"text":"There is the \"sit down, get served\" kine, and there is the \"lunch stand\" kine. I just went to the lunch stand part.. I went to the very back to get my quarter pound of spicy avocado poke, then I went to the register to order musubi. :) In the future I will go to the sushi bar area and check that out. Otherwise, I love it I love it I love it. Broke da mouf, fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"Ok. Can't be nice right now. Very bad representation of this restaurant. And come on guys, I recommend that everyone eats here. I am obsessed with your restaurant. But today my friend Lisa and I had the displeasure of being served by Mila and I have to say something about it. We were coming to get some sushi. Decided to do all you can eat and heard about all you can drink for $10. Awesome deal. We are both full time business women and wanted to unwind with a few beers and some good food. Mila explained that it's $10 all you can eat sake and beer. Cool. Then she later corrected that they are individual charges. We said fine, Lisa would get the beer and I'd get the sake. We could have it all! Mila corrected us, which was fine. That's her job. But being in the customer service industry, I welcome all feedback and use it as growth to improve every customers time in my store, and decided to tell Mila that I would appreciate if she could just give the feedback to the restaurant management that I feel it should be interchangeable. Just like getting all you can eat and sharing the rolls, getting all you can drink should follow the same structure. * if both parties are paying, then why not?*   She seemed to think my feedback was more funny than valuable, and proceeded to point at a table in the corner and say \"well they are all sitting over there, so-\" as if I wanted to stop my lunch to go relay the message.   All she would have have to do is say \"thank you for that feedback, I will make sure they hear it\".   From then on I just began to lose my desire to be there. Listen, all you can drink is a great idea, in an atmosphere where you facilitate an environment where people feel valued and welcomed. Mila sadly had a poor attitude the rest of our visit and did very routine \"check ins\" but obviously was following a script vs. any kind of genuine interest in our satisfaction as customers.   We were the only ones there too, and Mila kept going to the other table (the table full of the owners and managers) it made us feel like we were being talked about and it created less of a welcoming atmosphere. Remember, perception is reality. So be aware of your customers.   I'm so bummed about this experience. It was my friends first time here and I feel she had a very bad impression of what this restaurant stands for. Sure makes me think twice about coming here. The prices are the same anywhere, I come here equally because the food kicks ass, but mostly because of the environment and the amazing customer service. Well, this is not what I spent my money on today."}
{"text":"As an island girl it's nice to have a place to pick up local style goodies!!! I get malasadas from here sometimes & even all of my friends who are not from Hawaii love it when I bring these by. I'm not super into the chocolate but the custard, haupia, & guava (my fave) are super ono. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"So I've never had AYCE at Island sushi until this past weekend. I have to say I thought the food was ok. It wasn't anything that would make me want to take people to. The rolls were ok. The uni was good. The service was good. I just don't think that it was worth the price for the food. If your into Hawaiian infused sushi this place is for you but I will stick to my fave spots. The poke here is very good just expensive.... it's more worth it for me to go buy fish & make it myself. All in all it was ok but I will NOT be returning here for sushi when there are far better places, better priced."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch and it was packed because it was Mother's Day, and the only available seats were at the bar, so we were sat up there. This is another place that feels like home and the staff are always friendly and welcoming  I will be totally honest and say that I prefer sticking to the Sunday Brunch offerings and not so much their AYCE Sushi items. Flat out, the quality is just not as fresh as it should be, and I could really tell the difference as I have consumed a few thousand pieces here in Vegas alone.(True story!!!) That first order of nigiri was our last, and I just told the Chef that we were sticking to the brunch stuff.  He didn't seem too enthused about it, but hey, I ain't taking that kind of risk. I can't believe others at the bar eating sushi didn't detect that pretty sketchy quality. Anyway, back to the brunch items. We killed a good number of items from the whole list of offerings, like  Island Sushi Roll 008 Roll Red Velvet Pancakes X4 Hawaiian Sweet Bread French Toast X2 Egg in a Basket with Bacon Kim Chee Clam Dip with Malassada Chips Tempura Green Beans with Wasabi Nori Ranch Cold Ginger Chicken with Cilantro Pesto Chicken Curry Salad on malassada Chip Kim Chee and Lup Cheong Fried Rice Grilled Mongolian Beef Tips Crispy Pork Belly Bun Green Tea Tiramisu Vanilla Creme Brulee Cocoa Puff Malassada with Passionfruit Cream Cucumber and Melon Granita  All plates are tapas portions, and you can order as little or as many as you like. Sadly, the Cocoa Puff and Malassada kina come up short and I goitta wait to go home for the real deal at Leonard's and Liliha....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(261/365) \"Sunday Brunch Bash\""}
{"text":"This is the best sushi joint on planet Earth! They have an all you can eat menu for only $24.99. When we walked in, we thought we might be in the wrong place because the front door leads you to the take out counter for Hawaiian food. However, the sushi joint is connected.   During our order, my wife asked if they had any rolls that had sliced strawberries. Unfortunately, they didn't. However, the owner and sushi chef overheard the request and created a roll on the spot that had strawberries. That alone might warrant the 5-star rating, however, the service overall was fantastic as was the AYCE sushi.   The Nigiri sushi is a little smaller than what you normally get at a standard sushi bar, but it doesn't matter when its all you can eat!! The fusion of sushi and Hawaiian cuisine was a little intimidating at first, but after the first bite, it all made sense.  We are tourists and decided to try a local place and we are glad we did. I will visit Island Sushi every time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"great sushi especially at happy hour prices. bite into a spam musubi and makes you feel like bj penn is doing a duet with iz that big guy with the little ukulele."}
{"text":"Last night my wife ordered take out their Chicken Eggplant and I was really surprised that they would have the nerve to serve that item using old dried out chicken!  The chicken that was used I believe was left over Mochiko chicken from days ago that was very hard and dried out.  Lots of the pieces was all black on the outside.  Very disappointed!  When I first opened the plate box, you could see the chicken was all old and dried looking but I decided to not pre-judge before tasting but my first impression was confirmed when I first sticked my fork in the chicken.  Very tough!  Even with a knife it was still tough.    Overall the quality is a hit and miss.  I recommend if ordering take out, please take the time to open the box and see what your order looks like so you can at least make your comments while you are still there."}
{"text":"Easily one of my top Sushi Restaurants in the Las Vegas/Henderson Area.   The rolls are exceptional. Remember these Rolls.  Candy Cane, Meat Lovers Roll. Black Widow, Kilauea.  The Meat Lovers Roll is a Carnivores dream made reality. Fish and beef. Beautiful.  This place is literally a one stop for all your Hawaiian Food needs. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Its all here, and its all good. I have love for their Fried Rice Omelet. I believe this is an appropriate time to give it honorable mention, as a delicious yet simple breakfast item. Add an extra egg and you have cheap solid nutrition!"}
{"text":"I love coming here since it's so close to my house. Friendly customer service and very clean. Gotta try their malasadas which is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"06.14.2014  The plan was H & O will share a chicken katsu lunch and me and hubby will share a Bento Lunch A (teriyaki beef & teriyaki chicken).   We all shared both but ate all the katsu lunch. We had leftover teriyaki chicken, beef and rice, which will probably be a snack for hubby later after his nap.   PROS: -Food cooked fresh -The teriyaki chicken was delish!  Next time hubby wants just teriyaki chicken. :) -I loved the Furikake rice in the bento box!    CONS: -Long wait to get food (that's what happens when you show up right at lunch time 12:00pm) -I wasn't too fond of the Mac salad--too dry, not seasoned well. Tasted like it was made a few days earlier and just stored in the fridge.  -ran out of some poke I wanted to try   Eating here sure beats hubby's suggestion of P.F. Chang's for lunch.  Thanks fellow Yelpers!  I guess we'll have to come back for malasadas and salmon poke next time. :). Like tomorrow?  LOL!"}
{"text":"We came in on purpose on a Monday, bc its happy hour all day - 1/2 price rolls!! Its our 1st time here, and we REALLY don't like going to new sushi places bc we are pretty picky when it comes to sushi, but our usual sushi spot is very pricey and we are on a budget these days :p we ordered 5 rolls btwn the two of us and the sushi came out really fast, and it was very good for the prices! we paid an avg of $7 per roll, they were fresh and presentation was good... A little on the plain side, but we asked for some ponzu, screaming o sauce and siracha sauce and fixed em up a little the way we like them!  What won us over was the friendly and attentive service we got from the servers!! They were great !We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for me when I'm craving \"home\" food.  Garlic chicken. Hamburger steak. Oxtail. Kalua pig. Poke. Fried noodles. Musubis. Spam. Sushi.  *sigh* I MISS HAWAII FOOD *sigh*  Anywhoo... Their late night specials of half off sushi and sake is just what the Hawaiian ordered.   The workers know some of my friends by name; it's like home. And they have sake bomb challenges with the workers. If you can out sake-bomb them, you drink all night sake-bombs for free.  Island Sushi and Grill: SAMPS THAT!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a unique sushi experience because of the way it blends Hawaiian and Japanese flavors. It's very creative and I plan to return, maybe during happy hour.   Favorite rolls off of the all-you-can-eat menu: Big Island  Island Special Black Widow  I wasn't a fan of the Surf and Turf, the roll with beef teriyaki outside/shrimp tempura inside. Just didn't like that mix of flavors but other people in my party did.   Had I done my homework, I would have tried the fried octopus and the spam sushi roll. How could I have Hawaiian food without Spam?   The Ahi belly was tasty. We ordered four of those, one for each of us. Even after 10 rolls, several appetizers, many plates of sushi, I polished off the Marssala dessert without even talking. I totally felt like a pig. I was a pig.  I heard Island Sushi has an awesome brunch. Can't wait to try it. I would rank this place higher than Sushi Mon, for sure.  There was no wait to get in, the service is better, and I think the rolls are more creative. I can't compare it to I Love or Momo (apples and oranges)."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  My group waited 10 minutes to get seated when there empty tables available and the three servers walking around got the orders from everyone around us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to order anything.  When they finally did, it took them near 20 minutes to get our first sushi orders to us.  I'm no sushi chef and I understand the restaurant gets a bit busy, but when all three servers are busy chatting away with everyone else and forgets to bring you the order you've been waiting for, 20 minutes is quite a long time to be waiting for a few sushi rolls.  Plus, the sushi rolls weren't even cut correctly and fell apart in a mess when we tried to eat the sushi.  After the first round of sushi, they asked once if we needed more sushi (and we said yes due to the pending 8 more sushi we ordered) and despite our long list of ordered sushi, it took about 30 minutes for one of the servers to come by and take our order again.  By this time I had lost my appetite and decided to pay the bill before I became even more pissed off due to their incompetence.  I'm from Hawai'i and when I saw 'Island Sushi' decided to stop in and check this place out, I really thought I would get that local island hospitality.  The only hospitality I got was \"Oh, sorry ah\" when they realized they forgot our table orders half and hour later.  Bad service and I definitely recommend this place if you're into spending your hard earned cash by sitting around and looking at other people eat."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible!!!! Here for an hour and our server passed us over and over. Other tables that came in after had their food before my order was even taken. Then all I ordered was sushi and it took another 30 min. This is redicilous!!!!!!! Food is good, but don't come here hungry."}
{"text":"I  had to wait to long to be seated with no greeting. When seated it took to long for the waiter to take my order. The sushi and dessert was good. Not as good as the old Plaza location. Price was fair. Will not be visiting again; not worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we overwhelmed this place with a party of 10, or if someone was off that night, but I wasn't impressed with the sushi or the service.    Yes, they have a hawaiian slant to their preparation, and everything tastes okay.  But none of the fish was spectacular, fresh, or well-cut.    Most of the rolls had tons of sauce on top that overpowered the flavor.  The amaebi was not good, and the heads were overfried.    One issue which bugged all of us - the servers kept reminding us that we had to eat everything we ordered...and the sushi came out very slowly.  I wonder if they did that on purpose.    Anyways, right as we were paying the bill the whole restaurant filled with a strong scent of smoke.  We asked the waitress - she laughed and said the chef burnt a bunch of eel in the kitchen.    On the bright side, you don't have to wait an hour for a table like at Sushimon.  But maybe there's a reason for that.  This place would be two stars if it was in California, but being an all you can eat sushi restaurant in a landlocked state, I'll give them three."}
{"text":"best AYCE sushi!!! seriously this is one of the reason why i come to vegas. the quality is pretty good and they have very good sides as well! fried oysters, seaweed salad, teriyaki, etc. they also have many rolls to choose from too! very worth it!!! they also have ahi poke!!"}
{"text":"First time here. I went because it was highly rated on Yelp. Did not even think about all you can eat but my guest suggested it. The fried oysters were amazing. Was kind of blown away just about everything on the menu was available for all you can eat. Only had one issue. I ordered the salmon \"Sake\" sushi a number of times and it was never delivered even after I told two servers it was never delivered. Seems like a small thing, but that's my fave."}
{"text":"Came with the whole family to eat here for AYCE sushi lunch on Sunday afternoon and to my surprise with no wait..   I like how you can get AYCE sitting at a table & not only at the bar like how most Cali sushi places are.. super plus!  And unlike most AYCE sushi places in California (specifically the valley area) the food here was great and is sooo much better than the sushi i'm used to.   I liked how there was 3 pgs of food (basically everything) from the menu to choose from on the AYCE.. plus being Sunday there was a \"brunch\" option that included a few Hawaiian breakfast and special sushi options.  Try the Lechon from that menu!! It was f*cking delish, chopped crunchy pieces of pork with a vinegarry-soy sauce and pieces of onion and tomatoes, we had to order it 3 times it was so good! We really loved the yellowtail sushi, Salmon Sushi w/ Orgasm sauce, Kona roll, and especially loved that we got to try the Poke on the AYCE menu (limit 1 order each).  There was this roll with a sliver of jalapeno on top and sriracha that was freakin the best.. just can't remember the name of it.   Service-wise they were all awesome.. perhaps it was because we were a party of 7  and for groups of 5+ there's an automatic service charge of 18% so be advised of that.. but honestly they deserved it because they were so friendly and on it with the refills of drinks and the plates came out to us fast AF.  I love that sh*t, thank you! Will have to come here every time i'm in Vegas from now on."}
{"text":"Very, very, very good service!!! Excellent AYCE menu. Went in on a Friday night at 8pm, place was busy, but my bff and I were seated right away. I love when we don't have to ask for our water refills. I ordered everything your only allowed to get once but it was sooooo good. Rolls and nigiri were awesome. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great food great service I always try to come and eat here at least once a month! The fish is fresh and chicken teriyaki is great! Reasonably priced.  A local Hawaiian hang out!"}
{"text":"So my review is based upon some malasadas that the hubby brought home from  Vegas.  What are Malasadas say you? Malasada is a Portuguese type donut.  Malasadas are made of egg-sized balls of yeast dough that are deep-fried in oil and coated with granulated sugar. They are popular in Hawaii and since Las Vegas is considered the \"9th Island\" you can definitely find them in Vegas...  I was craving the famous Leonard's malasadas found in Oahu, so when my husband visited the in-laws in Vegas, I asked him to find some of these yummy treats and bring some back home to the Bay Area.  My only concern was the fear of being disappointed by what he brings back... boy was I happy!  He came back with some haupia filled Malasadas that felt like it weighed half a pound each.  Haupia is a type of coconut custard, and it was perfect inside these warm slightly crispy Malasadas.  The custard was not too sweet, therefore, i scarfed down like 4 of them... *oops!* **blush**was I supposed to save some for the kids? Overall, they are still not as good as Leonard's but they definitely \"fit the bill\" when it came to cravings..  I cannot wait to try the rest of the food here in person.  BOOKMARK!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been coming here for the last four years. When we're in the area for lunch or if we aren't in the mood for cooking dinner and one of us is passing by after work we'll call in a Bento A and Bento C. We really like the garlic chicken. Unfortunately, we haven't tried anything else there because we like the Bento's so much. The price for the two bento's is reasonable to us. It can get pretty busy around lunch time so it wouldn't hurt to call it in if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This place is soo not the business anymore.  Quality if food has dropped tremendously and I don't even know how they serve the food they did tonight.  First of all my RICE came out cold, how does rice come out cold like what the??? The garlic chicken has changed it doesn't taste like how it used to, the pole and fish side is totally different too the taste has dropped dramatically.  I'm sticking to pole express! Hopefully they get better and not worse because by the taste it has gotten WAY worse!"}
{"text":"Latest visit VERY disappointing! $21.95 for lunch, and $26.95 for dinner weekdays. Again no Uni, or sweet shrimp at lunch. Also, sashimi salad and crab salad only available for the dinner price. The other sushi joints near the strip charges the lunch price and provides all of those.   Ordered a bunch of sushi: albacore, tuna, white tuna etc. The fish was a teeny tiny very thin slice of fish on a very large piece of cold, hard rice. I had trouble swallowing the sushi. The quality of fish was ok. I got the dinner price and ordered the crab salad and the sashimi salad, compared to some of the other AYCE sushi joints, the sashimi salad is tiny, and only had very few pieces of fish. Really disappointing quality compared to the other places. Also, I ordered the sweet shrimp which only came with 1 piece, other sushi places gives 2 pieces and charges less.   The service was good, sushi chef was nice, BUT I was charged extra for hot tea! Many sushi joints gives complimentary hot tea. Really disappointing and will not come back anymore."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. We are from out of town but everytime we come to Vegas we have to come here. Great Local food and even better, there is a full Poke bar. I suggest trying the malasadas if you've never had, but anything off the menu is Ono!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas!  Chuy and Jayson are the best sushi chefs.  They know what I want before I even order!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Hawaiian food and Sushi, this is the perfect place for you.  We went there when they were doing Happy Hour, so some of the makis were 50% off. Yay! The makis tasted really great. The quantity was good too. We were so stuffed only after 3 maki sets + poke.   Since we seated at counter, the sushi chefs occasionally asked us if we needed anything which was nice. They recommended me malasadas, so I ordered 3 regular ones and 3 coconut ones. OMG The malasadas were so amazing! I especially liked the coconut ones. They are only 89 cents per piece and I think they had other flavors too.   We'll be back there soon to try their AYCE."}
{"text":"They were very friendly the only problem I had was that I wasn't greeted or acknowledged, I understand it can get busy but I feel that as a paying customer we deserve to be acknowledged, this is why I'm giving 3 stars, although they made up for it with a friendly smile and was told to have a nice day at the the end of my visit. The decor and ambiance could also be updated, it looks a little run down. I come here only if I'm only on this side of town and if there's nothing else that appeals to me. At the end of it all I feel that their food and portions is always good here which is why I continue to return."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine had been raving about this place for a long time, and we finally took a trip down from Salt Lake City in large part to eat here. He swore that he had done his best to oversell the place not just to us, but to many other people, and that nobody had ever been disappointed. Well...he was right. This place is amazing!  Normally, all you can eat sushi is more a matter of finding a place with decent sushi rather than anything great. But Island Sushi is simply fantastic. From the service to the food, I can't believe how good it was!  I'll admit, pulling up to this place, I was somewhat skeptical. It was pretty dark from the outside and didn't even really appear to be open. Even after coming inside, the initial welcome room was dark and pretty void of people. But once we got into the main eating area, it was on!  I knew that we were in for a treat when the sashimi salad and poke bowl came out. I could have eaten nothing but those two and been extremely happy. But my friend was ordering all of his favorites, and we ate all of them happily. The nigiri was perfect--a better ratio of fish to rice than most places. The cooked dishes we had, including soft-shelled crab, tempura shrimp, and beef of a couple of different varieties (one of which was right at the top of the best dishes there) were all perfectly cooked. I probably could have made a meal out of any individual dish I was served, so to have so many different delicious items made for a great experience. Dessert was pretty decent, too. You get your choice of 2 desserts (because you need 2 desserts after all you can eat sushi!), and they're all pretty interesting. There were 2 dishes involving bananas; any place that offers banana desserts gets points in my book.  The service was fantastic. I'm used to waiting long periods of time at any sushi restaurant, much less an all you can eat sushi restaurant, for each round of orders. But Island Sushi was bringing out dishes left and right, as they were prepared. We had a constant stream of food and were never left waiting. Excellent, friendly service!  And price-wise, this place is great. It's only around $25 for all you can eat (although they do limit the quantity of certain dishes that you can order).  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely coming back to Island Sushi!"}
{"text":"I hope that anyone that reads my Yelps realizes that I usually review places that have rubbed me the wrong way. (Unless they rub me in a really good way and I've thoroughly enjoyed it.)   First off, this place is the pits. I've been coming here for a while now, and I've experienced quality degrade. The more I come, the less I want to be here. Today is the final nail in the coffin.   What a long wait time to even order food! I was in line for a good 7 minutes before I was given attention to place an order.   Prices are outrageous! For what I got, I would have preferred any other Hawaiian restaurant that's more filling and has better quality.  I got the garlic chicken and chicken katsu combo. My mom got a saimin. So what's easier? Two pieces of different styles of chicken and frying it, or putting noodles, some toppings in a bowl with broth? You tell me...  I got mine in 7 minutes after ordering and was told the saimin will be right out. Great! Then, we waited 7/8 more minutes before requesting a refund. I don't like eating in front of other people, and I don't like waiting so long for something so easy. From the time we ordered to the time I requested a refund... 30 minutes. There was a little wait to ask for a refund.   Maybe I was a little impatient, but don't bring out other people's order when a part of a party has already received their food and the rest haven't. Don't forget to season your customers' food.   We ended up going to Aloha Kitchen on Sunset road and it was only 7 minutes from the time we ordered for it to be bagged ready to go. And they were equally as busy as this failure.  The saving grace which allows for two really generous stars are for their malasadas and their poke. Besides that, you have plenty of Hawaiian favorites to choose from, don't go here if you want to wait and want to eat tasteless food."}
{"text":"My family had a HORRIBLE experience at this restaurant today. We came in for Happy Hour and got there at 3pm. We had a one year old baby with us who is very picky with food so we had to bring fries with us from a fast food restaurant. The woman who brought us to our table told us that we cannot have outside food inside Island Sushi but I explained to her that it is just food for the baby and to please just let us keep it. She said she would have to ask her manager if that was okay. She spoke to the manager and he came to our table and told her our baby can't keep the food because it is their \"policy\". So for the next hour, our baby just sat there hungry while everyone ate.   So we ordered our food and our first roll got to our table. But none of us can eat because they didn't provide any plates. We sat for a while waiting for someone to come by and nobody came. My sister stood up and went to the front and told them we didn't have plates. They took 5 mins after to finally bring plates. Next, they brought my niece's fish but she couldn't eat it because they didn't bring any forks. We waited again for someone to come by and after 5 minutes, my husband stood up to ask for forks at the front. And it kept getting worse. We ordered rice with the fish but that didn't come until 15 minutes later after the fish. The miso soups didn't come until 20 minutes after we ordered (which if you go to sushi restaurants often, you know that's the first thing they place on your table). They did not give wasabi and ginger until we asked for it (again, sushi restaurants ALWAYS give this automatically) and when they gave us the wasabi, it didn't come with any bowls so my husband had to get up again to the sushi table to ask for one. In total, our family had already gotten up 3 times to ask for stuff. Halfway done through our food, we had to remind them that they still haven't brought 2 rolls that we ordered. Only the manager checked up on us once. Nobody else asked if we needed anything, which is weird considering there were only about 20 people in the restaurant so they weren't that busy for us to be ignored.   Worse yet, the food was horrible. The sushi tastes like the refrigerated ones you can buy at grocery stores. The raw fish were thin and dry. We paid half price for them because of Happy Hour but even so, their sushi is not worth it.   Never coming back to this place again. The only good thing about this place is that the employees were friendly, the manager especially. My guess is that they're just unorganized and forced to follow stupid rules by the owner."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DA BOMB!  As any islander living in Vegas would say!    My friends and I came here randomly one Sunday looking for a good sushi place to eat.  Of course we directed our interest to what Yelp had to say.  20.95 for all you can eat sushi PLUS side dishes PLUS Sunday specials!  What a steal!    I was really impressed with the flavors of the sushi and the taste of the food served here.  Of the three other \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi restaurants in Henderson, I have discovered Island Sushi to top it all!  You won't be disappointed!    One thing that I really enjoyed was that they do not flood each roll of sushi with white rice!  You get a significant amount of \"filling\" and \"topping\" on each of the rolls you order!  They aren't being cheap at all!    Also to all those locals from Hawaii out there, they have Poke here!  And it's GOOD!  They also have a extensive plate lunch menu and they serve saimin and bentos!    One suggestion to the fellow yelpers is to come on Sunday!  Those Sunday specials are a steal and are very delicious, particularly the Ahi Belly!    The only downside to this place and for me giving Island Sushi only 4 stars is that you are only limited to one dessert. Cmon!  Dessert is like the best part of a meal!! =P  Hopefully that rule changes!    Even so, I'd definitely be back to try this place!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. The poke is amazing! My favorite is the ahi and avocado poke bowl. The crunchy part from the chips is what distinguishes it from most places. Yum!"}
{"text":"It is hard to find Hawaiian food in Houston, so we jumped at a chance to have a good local plate.  The Kalbi Rib plate was so delicious - Best flavors!!  Everything was delicious. Fried Saimen noodles, Teri chicken & Teri beef local plates, kalua pork with cabbage and a spicy tuna poke bowl with sushi rice made for an excellent Hawaiian feast.    Do not miss the Kalbi Rib or the fried Saimen noodles!!  Wish that I had photos, but we scarfed it all down too quickly."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the all you can eat sushi. There is nothing disappointing to say about this place. The restaurant is separated in two, one side is the sushi bar and the other is for the local food.  Food & service was great. Everything we ordered was tasty, so tasty that we ordered seconds of some of the same foods. My favorite was the eggplant fries & super white tuna. Soooo good. One thing I like about this place is they have tobiko! Some sushi spots only have masago so I was excited to have it here.   Not to mention they have happy hour on drinks during lunch time so feel to treat yourself! All you can eat also includes the desserts which is limited to two per person.   The only thing different about lunch is some of sushi rolls on the menu are not available. So it will be worth it to go back for dinner time!   Definitely will be back to try their local island food :)"}
{"text":"Always great food and service. Havent had bad experience yet. Ordered spicy machiko chicken and finished with coco puffs for desert. One of my favorite spots for plate lunch."}
{"text":"Yelpers you've done it again!  You've provided me with some good \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" sushi, and this one is on my list to go to every time I'm in Vegas.  I was here during the 2010 New Year's weekend and looking to avoid the strip since there are a lot of people in town celebrating the New Year.  So decided to look into my trusted Yelp iPhone app and with a high rating of this place, I know I can't go wrong.  So I took the wife and kids and we went along with what was recommended, \"ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI\" for $24.95!!!  Just two servings of the AHI POKI pays for it self already, and that's just the appetizer.  I would also recommend Joe's Special roll, Ahi Fever, and the Island Special roll.    As for the kids, we were able to make it there before 5 PM so they had their usual California roll (my boys are 3 and 5 and already eating sushi!) and some Ebi sashimi.  After the meal we treated ourselves with some Malasada to go.  Good for kids and has a lot of parking.  The only complaint (reason I didn't give them a 5 star) was service, the waitress forgot some of my wife's order and ended up making the entire order again, but no problem since it was AYCE, it was all good for my tummy!"}
{"text":"Island Sushi is one of our 'go to' favorite sushi spots!  The wait staff we had for our large group of 7 provide us with exceptional service.  The food was great!  We will continue to go back for all of our sushi wants and needs! :)"}
{"text":"Solid place to get local Hawaiian food and poke!  I've been coming here quite often to get my sweet taste of home here in Henderson and I do approve! I mean nothing beats some of the joints back at home, but this place is great!  If you are every craving poke or Hawaiian or local food (yes, there is a difference between Hawaiian and local food), then this is a wonderful spot to go to.   I've been to both the plate lunch side and the sushi side and both are great dining options. The sushi side is especially good during happy hour where all of the rolls are 50% off! I believe happy hour is Mon-Wed all day! It's a great deal for delicious sushi. They also have an AYCE option but I've never tried it yet since I usually just go for happy hour!  As for the plate lunch side, I've had the bento boxes (which are really filling) and the spicy tuna bowl which I am a fan of, especially the taro chips inside.  The poke is also not bad. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna avocado one. The fish was good quality and had a nice texture but I wished there were more fish/avocado and less of the spicy mayo.   The parking lot can sometimes get crowded as can the restaurant so try and come early or later in the evening. Also, the sushi side of the restaurant does take reservations so call ahead if you can and know that you have a big party!"}
{"text":"So good. The front of the restaurant looks deceiving, when we first walked in I thought it was only hawaiian food (which is incredible) but there is a whole other part to the restaurant, with a sushi bar and all. So yummy, the waiter and food runner were amazing, very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious, fast and so yummy! Will def. be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love the garlic chicken here. I like the fact that they are boneless, you can just eat it on the spot without using your hands. There spicy ahi is also great in taste!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the poke burrito.  It was delicious.  Contains tuna, onion, furikake, cucumbers, avocado, sesame seeds.  It was recommended by the cashier.  They have a surprisingly good baked food."}
{"text":"Was looking for sushi in Vegas and found this place. Love it!!  Best Sushi than I've had in a long time. A must when your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best ahi tuna I have eaten in Nevada. Great staff, gotta check it out!!"}
{"text":"Super great sushi joint, run by a couple of bruddahs from the Islands.  All you can eat, or by-the-piece.  Lots of options for the non-sushi gnoshers in the group - but this stuff is so good, that even the folks who are afraid of raw fish will be tucking in!  The AYCE option includes appetizers and desserts too!  (The Mochi chicken is really tasty!)  The Garlic Tuna is my personal fave, we lost count of how many orders we got last time!"}
{"text":"bom.com! Iv never been so happy to find a place here in vegas that knows how to cook delicious hawaiian food! Poki is out of this world and they also have the malasadas!!! Anyways i give this place 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"My cousin showed us this place while my family was on vacation. This place is great. The employees were friendly, the food was delicious, and the environment was relaxing. There is such a large variety of food that it was difficult for me to pick! My brother and I got yakisoba with chicken, my parents got something else but I forgot. The yakisoba contained a perfect mix of ingredients. Not too much vegetables and not too little yakisoba! My parents said that their meal tasted like they were in Hawaii! We ate on the grill side, but as I saw, the sushi side has a nice modern look."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and loved it..!  Even better for Sunday all you can eat brunch..  They have two different menus with tasty things to choose from, the regular lunch menu and a special sunday brunch menu, all for $21..!!"}
{"text":"Family favorite.. AYCE... all you can eat... we are from hawaii and this reminds of home.."}
{"text":"Not what I would expect to see decor wise for an AYCE sushi place but don't let that deter you. They serve some of the FRESHEST fish!!! The wait staff is nothing but super friendly either!! Definitely a go to spot if you love sushi."}
{"text":"Best real fresh sushi in town! All fish flown in fresh daily, plus poke express!! only place I would trust poke (spicy poke, killer!!)  Not sure what joker put this place as 4 stars, they must think sushi is supposed to be fancy.. Sushi is from the ocean, where people wear shorts and flip flops.. This is a laid back causal place just like sushi is suppose to be natural ingredients and natural people."}
{"text":"This was not my first visit. However, probably my last. The food was OK. Nothing spectacular. However both myself and my dining companion ended up with upset stomachs shortly after leaving. The tables were very close together. In an almost empty restaurant, they sat us all in the same section. It did not give us much room to maneuver with a toddler and was not pleasant having to hear every word of the conversation of the people next to us. Half way through our meal, our waiter just disappeared. It took several minutes to get one of the people standing around to assist us. A very sweet and friendly waitress took over and assisted us took the end of our meal when our original waiter showed back up to hand us the bill with no explanation of his disappearance or apology. All in all, was very disappointed with my experience this time."}
{"text":"PROS: -BIG portion sizes -The poke is super yumm!! -Friendly service; they have that Hawaiin hospitality :) -They have like a cafe section & a restaurant connected to that. I only come to the cafe because of their really good garlic chicken.  FOOD 4/5: -Garlic Chicken ($7.75 regular/$5.25 mini): MY FAVORITE, crispy outside & soft inside. -Mochicko Chicken ($7.75/$5.25): 2nd favorite chicken dish here. -Regular plate comes with 2 scoops of rice & mac salad. Mini plate comes with 1 scoop of rice & mac salad -Ahi Avocado Poke Bowl ($10.75): OMG i love this poke bowl because it has tuna & avocado with cucumber & taro chips :) -Bento A Teri beef & garlic chicken ($8.75): The teri beef & garlic chicken combo is tasty. Bento boxes are filling as it comes with rice, noodles & takuan (korean pickled radish)"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with my cousin. Small place with a lot of Hawaiian inspired dishes. Had the small portion of kalbi beef with rice.  It was good but a tad too sweet. The pasta salad was amazing though. I could have had that for my dish. Nice place for a quick bite and friendly faces."}
{"text":"This is just wrong. I ordered the sushi burrito and the ahi tuna bento box. The burrito was very bland and wasn't very fresh. It wasn't horrible though. HOWEVER, the ahi \"tuna\" bento box was the most off putting thing I've ever received. It was incredibly dry and super thin. Nothing resembling tuna. I'll post pictures"}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch here yesterday.  We went into the main room with the sushi bar and were seated at a two top table.  Our server, Mariah, was there quickly with menus, took our drink orders, and brought us our iced teas quickly.  She answered the questions we had about items we were considering.  We order two sushi rolls and two side dishes.  The sushi rolls were the standard California roll and a Lava Lover roll which the menu describes as a spicy tuna cucumber roll topped w/ cajun ahi, chili paste & garlic ponzu.  Both rolls were good.  The more interesting of the two was the Lava Lovers roll.  It was not very spicy and carried just a small kick--wasabi being a good addition to the heat for me.  The two sides were mochiko chicken and teriyaki beef.  This was only the second time I had mochiko chicken and I liked it better than the first time I had it elsewhere.  There was not sweet sauce on the chicken.  Rather, it was served plain which was good.  The teriyaki beef was good with a topping of sesame seed for decoration and a small amount of flavor.  We couldn't leave without some dessert.  My friend ordered mango mochi and I got the malassada sundae.  My sundae was very good.  The malassada and the ice cream may have been overkill calorie wise, but ti was very tasty!  I checked out their case and I know where I can buy poke in the future without having to drive to North Las Vegas where I got it once before.   Island is a solid place for sushi and other items from the Pacific."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Always satisfied. Their menu is very creative. Great variety. My first visit there was about 5 years ago."}
{"text":"Only place you can find Fanta Fruit Punch!  Liking the malassadas too :)"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm so impressed!! This restaurant is split in half which was pretty smart imo. Half of the place is ayce sushi and the other half is Hawaiian food / a poke station.   I ordered the slow roasted pork loco moco and my boyfriend got their Thai shrimp sushiritto and both were incredibly good!  The slow roasted pork loco moco was really tender and they gave a pretty generous amount (4 big slices)! it's served on a bed of white rice, covered in delicious brown gravy and topped with your choice of egg. It also comes with a side of macaroni! Such a great portion!  The sushiritto is made fresh to order, so it makes it so much more yummy! It is made tempura - style, so there's a nice crunch to every bite!  Also, definitely get the malasadas for dessert!! You can either get it with custard or chocolate filling or have it plain! Malasadas are almost like whole fat donuts rolled in cane sugar. Yummmmm! Try getting it fresh because that's when it's the best!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The sushi is always delicious but the avocado ahi poke bowl is seriously one of my favorite dishes on this planet. It has tons of fresh ahi, cucumber, avocado, onions and crispy won ton strips over white rice with this amazing sauce. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"On a little weekend trip to Vegas, me and my friend wanted to explore the local joints a lot more and heard about Island Sushi Grill.  We happened to go there on a weekend ayce brunch time and ordered alot of rolls and fusion-y items from the menu.   All the rolls were pretty yummy and the spam sliders were addicting!    Overall a good relaxing local place for japanese food.  Definitely a place to be around to hang with the locals of Las Vegas versus all the random tourists."}
{"text":"Another Update: This island girl still like this place but gonna have to find someplace closer to my house cuz the drive across town isn't worth it anymore.  The Cali rolls terrible today. Noodles still good mochi still good poi mochi even better but OMG the roast pork more like roast hockey pucks was the worst I ever ate !  I had to take a picture and send to all my peeps! Overdone dry tasteless just bad.   Update:  Food still wonderful but the service is going down hill- there's a local girl in there that's good but everyone else up front either needs more training or needs to go if they don't enjoy their jobs and have attitude or face all the time is time to get someone who really wants to be there and has the Aloha spirit the same way the food does!!  Also wanted to mention the poke section very fresh awesome flavor!   I love love love their noodles wet or dry they season perfectly and give lots, the Mochi chicken teri chicken just about everything on the menu is good!!! The sushi some is great and some not too good the use paste roll for example not so good.  The malasadas and mochi is good but don't order the chantilly cake! The cake is dry and tasteless and it is not chantilly!  You should be shame for calling it that! All in all I eat here all the time and it's worth it! I give the food 10 of 10 and desserts 7"}
{"text":"Gambled one day while my friends and I were in Vegas, not wanting to eat at a buffet we decided to trust yelp and roll the dice. We now make special trips to Vegas just for this place. The rolls are the star of the show. Creative and delicious enough to make a group of 4 drive all the way from Los Angeles to eat here. Keep doing what you are doing. The lunch all you can eat was a phenomenal deal that left us all more then full with delicious food. To the people who live in the area consider yourselves lucky, Island sushi is the real deal."}
{"text":"Kinda bummed on this. I have been eating here on the grill side of the restaurant for years (has a sushi side) . My dish of choice was garlic shrimp but for those that have had it in Hawaii where it is prepared out of the shell, they don't do that here. Its in the shell so had to scratch that. Moved to garlic chicken and for years. Spot on. Lately it has been served kinda cold. I'm stumped how chicken that is fried can be cold but yet cooked thoroughly.  I will say I continue to come here and when its on ... Its on and even off its still good. Great people ... Both staff and patrons. Check it out ... Maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  This is probably the best deal in all of vegas if you can make your way out there.  It was so good that I went back there twice in one weekend.  The fish is all very fresh and delicious.  The best part about the rolls and nigri is that they dont overload the rice and give a good balance of fish and rice, so you aren't getting ripped off.  You also get a variety of appetizers to choose from, and I highly recommend the fried geso (squid/octopus) and the garlic chicken.  Super good!  For dessert, the green tea ice cream or the 808 special are both good and you cannot go wrong with either one.    My friend and I went for lunch and paid 20.95, but after seeing the menu and tallying it up, we easily ate over $200, no lie.  The waitress was shocked on how much we consumed.  haha  On a side note, make sure you save just a tiny bit of space for their bakery next door.  The malasadas are very good.  The plain is the best, but the haupia (coconut) and chocolate filled ones are also very delicious."}
{"text":"After my first visit here, I came 2 more times to come back for more within the same week.  Yes, the stuff I ordered is that good.  Plus, I have an addictive personality.   When you walk in , you have 3 options.    1. Order from their fast food section complete with all your local Hawaiian favorites.  My favorite dish that I have ordered twice from there, is the Garlic Chicken.  If you like crispy fried chicken and garlic, this dish is for you!  It is delicious and will. make you want to come back for more!  The mini size is just the right portion for me.  2. Order from the Poke Express section complete with all your poke needs from Ahi, Salmon, Shrimp, Special combinations, and even cucumber kim chi for your veggie requirements.  My favorites are the Special Combination poke, and the Furikake poke.  The raw fish is fresh, and you can order by the 1/2 pound.  This gets pretty pricey though, and you can get pretty full if you just order a 1/2 pound of poke and maybe a 1/2 pound of cucumber kim chi.  Good for the no carb dieters!  3. Sit down in their sushi restuarant and order sushi.  This I can't comment on because I haven't actually ordered from their menu.     My stars are strictly for option 1 and 2.  If I try option and 3 and love it, I'll add my 5th star.  I'll be back for sure!!!!   Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (64/365)."}
{"text":"First time visit on May 9th. The place was packed-shouldn't have visited on a Friday night but I was craving some sushi.  SERVICE We had a server named Marc who was just awesome! He was attentive and after telling him that it was our first time there, he ordered some of the most popular appetizers and rolls for us to try. They were all terrific!  FOOD While our server was super amazing, kitchen people were super slow. We waited over 30 minutes for our sushi. Yes I understand the place was packed but I've never waited that long at a sushi place. I was surprised to see that for AYCE, you only get 90 minutes limit. LOL are you kidding me. Half the time is spent waiting for food. Anyways, appetizers were good but sushi was ok. Some of my favorites were:  -Poke Roll -Garlic chicken (must try) -Salad (pieces of tuna and salmon in it. It was delicious!) -Joe's special  I felt like some of the sushi weren't that fresh. Having raised in Japan, I've had some good sushi and know what fresh sushi taste like-this wasn't it.  CONCLUSION Not the best but not the worst either. If you are not willing to wait 30 minutes for some sushi, I suggest Makinos for no wait & fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"It's not bad, not the best either.  I was going to meet a friend at another sushi spot nearby but when she got there she told me they were closed and open only at night.  I told her to drive further north towards my favorite intersection in LV (215/Eastern) because I've always wanted to try Sunday brunch at Island Sushi.  We both had all you can eat, we had dinner pricing because we wanted some of the dinner only items as well.  They have a special Sunday Brunch pupus menu and I pretty much ordered all of it.  The one item per person on the pupus menu, crab poke something, had a nice spice kick to it and it's basically a small crab cut in half with that spicy sauce.   I'm the unlimited mimosas champagne, I mean champion, and I had that here as well.  Keep it coming man, keep pouring it.  Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and so service was spotty.  Luckily we sat on the table at the far south east end so servers always passed us but even so, it was somewhat hard to get their attention.  But back to my mimosa, I started with the guava mimosa and it just didn't work.  I ended my next 6 refills with regular champagne.  The thick guava syrup was just too sweet and settled on the bottom of the glass.  So do come and try Island Sushi but Sunday brunch (gotta have a taste for their pupus section) is a definite must try.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time. Portions on the food seems to be getting less and less. Bought the fried noodles with garlic chicken. Must be a noodle shortage because there was more rice than noodles."}
{"text":"2 1/2 to 3 stars.    This place is a very strange hybrid of 3 restaurants: an AYCE sushi place, a hawaiin plate lunch grill, and a poke bar.    We went in with a Hawaiin friend of mine who raves about this place for the plate lunch.  The sushi section was packed.    Hubs and I shared the eggplant plate and the mochico chicken and shrimp plate.  The eggplant had great flavor but was insanely oily...it just sat in an inch of bright orange oil in my Styrofoam box.  The chicken and shrimp were nothing special.  The meals were served with a scoop of white rice and mac salad as expected.    Everything was fine but I've definitely experienced better.  Maybe the sushi is where it is at?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend enjoyed the sushi and I had some regular noodles and chicken that were good."}
{"text":"I don't eat fish, and yet I love sushi (I know, I'm a weirdo). If you are a vegetarian, this is the BEST all-you-can-eat sushi in town, without a doubt. I have plenty of choices and eat to the point of regret and self-loathing every time. My non-vegetarian, sushi snob boyfriend loves the food as well!"}
{"text":"The pictures itself of this restaurant is drool worthy. Hawaiian food, desserts, fresh poke, sushi all under one roof?! Yes... I know. Run over there! Located on eastern and 215. The restaurant is divided into two areas, the sushi restaurant, and the Hawaiian food/poke section. We got a little bit of everything- poke, ox tail soup, beef teriyaki plate, malasadas, spam musubi. Everything tasted so good, food came out hot and fresh, poke was fatty and soft. I really have no complaints, and pricing was great too!"}
{"text":"I love some goooood poke every now and then! This place is mouthwatering and lip smacking goooood!  Poke so good it makes you wanna slap yo mama!!!!!! I also had the bento which was very scrumptious and finger linkin delicious.  Great place to eat!!! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant! I've never had a bad dinner or lunch here nor have I ever had bad customer service. I usually come here for half off happy hour where you can get almost any rolls for half off the price. This place is my holy grail for sushi"}
{"text":"Cool place for sushi i guess.  What I really dug is that early in the AM they do breakfast at a very affordable price.  Any place that offers spams is A-OK with me.  If you order a breakfast meal it comes with a side of a delicious sweet bread.    Added bonus is that they make Malasadas daily which is basically a donut coated with sugar.  All my Hawaiian friends says it's the best in town, so i think it's just a \"Island\" thing.  I don't care for them personally, but i bet they're great treats that my Hawaiian friends would appreciate more so. They can also fill it with chocolate custard, but why would anyone want to do that?  Workers here are friendly too  3.5"}
{"text":"I like Island Sushi & Grill because it is ideal for groups that include both sushi lovers and those that will not nosh on raw fish. While it is not my favorite place in town for sushi, it's a very solid option, and I have never been disappointed with any of the non-sushi items I've gotten.   Most of my visits to Island Sushi & Grill have been to pick up to go orders (and poke from Poke Express, located in the back) and these experiences have always been solid. To-go orders have always been ready when they said they would be, packaged up properly and handed over by a smiling employee.   On my most recent visit I took 3 out of towners: My brother-in-law and his wife aren't big on sushi so they got items from the grill side of the menu while a friend and I both did ACYE. Pricing for AYCE is in line with most spots in town. There are some limitations on the menu (the standards: certain items can only be ordered at dinner, some are limited to one per person, no sharing). All of the sushi we ordered was excellent, nigiri was cut well and had a good fish to rice ratio. My in-laws were pleased with their selections, and we all left happy and very full for a great price.  On Sundays, Island Sushi & Grill does an AYCE brunch that I am looking forward to trying soon.  If you love sushi but also love to dine with people are don't care for it, give Island Sushi & Grill a try."}
{"text":"Love it!!!  Local girls at the counter are sweet, but be on your toes! Feisty. Killer poke, great garlic chicken.. Mmmm"}
{"text":"I've been hitting up Island Sushi for years prior to the Yelp career.  It's time to show some Yelp love.  I'm yelping in regards to the AYCE sushi while sitting at the sushi bar..  Service: I've hit up their ayce sushi bar for Sunday brunch, weekend and weekday nights. The staff has always been GREAT! I'll usually sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are all cool but I want to give a shout out to Juan.  He's a great sushi chef who is friendly and is quick with getting your order out.  THe wait staff is awesome with keeping the bottomless mimosas or beers coming which I'll usually pair up with the ayce sushi.  There's a TV and they'll change the channel to the games you request as you throw down ayce and bottomless booze.  AYCE Sushi:  The Nigiri is always on point and I've never had a bad experience.  Everything we order is great but these are my favs: Yuzu Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, Squid and the Garlic Tuna.  The Mount Charleston is bomb: California roll smothered with Spicy baked scallops and eel sauce.  Nigiri game is strong af here, everything is solid.  Ambiance: There's two parts to Island Sushi:  Pick up window dining and sit-down restaurant dining.  The Sushi Bar is in the Sit down restaurant which is directly to your right after you enter the Pick Up dining area.  The restaurant area is small and they pack a lot of tables so it's going to be noisy but nothing to derail from the dining experience.  This is my go to casual AYCE sushi joint.  Staff, service and the sushi has never failed me and I appreciate the consistency throughout the years.  It always seems to be crowded with regulars which is a testament to their performance so waits for parties of 5+ can occur.  However, if the sushi bar is empty, it's an easy sit down with no wait.  Keep up the great work Island Sushi, Mahalo! =)"}
{"text":"Big fan but very inconsistent. Sometimes my rice in my nigiri is small, other times it's the biggest ball of rice on this side of the Rockies.  Not in anyway demeaning the quality of fish or sides, but the rice to be honest, not that good. It's almost as if there is something added to the rice that just shouldn't be there. The rice to me, tastes funny, and I never complain because of how polite I am. So I will give them three stars until the quality and consistent size of rice improves.  Terry,  Fish is always great. Love the white tuna, hamachi, and unagi. I try to taste at least one order of each. Rice machines are great. Which is why I have upped my review to four stars.  All this place needs to get to five stars is top notch service. I feel like I come sometimes and the line will be out the door but tables and the bar are open.  Sushi Chefs are top notch and are always great. Some people like going to authentic places where all the chefs are shipped from overseas, but I don't speak Japanese so most conversations are just placing orders."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, had the all you can eat and it was worth it.  They have a good variety of choices to pick from."}
{"text":"We love the plum sakatini. So yummy. Their rolls never disappoint me. Our order gets to us in a timely manner and we the service is usually great."}
{"text":"Came back here 2 more times, this time I stuck with the lunch pricing vs dinner pricing during lunch time. Food is still fresh. Depending on who the server is that day will depend on how great of a customer service you are going to get.   They get pretty packed during noon time and there seems to only be 2 people working there so expect to take a longer lunch.   I finally tried their desert (808 special and malassada sundae) and its pretty tasty. I like the malassada sundae a lot because of the flavors in it.   Definitely would like to go back and eat more."}
{"text":"Poke bowl with sushi rice was awesome.  I swear I probably had more than a 1/2 lb of poke on there!  Total grinds!"}
{"text":"This place was one of our fav sushi joints till today. Had 3 all you can eat dinners plus my 2yr old. Then I get my bill...$13 for a kids all you can eat? First of all, my kid didn't even touch his Miso soup and had maybe, a couple of spoon fulls of rice (picky eater). And I get a $13 kids dinner charge? I was informed that the owner has updated the \"clause\" in the menu to \"children under 10\" must pay half price for all you can eat...so am I to understand that a 6mo old or a 1yr old - or a 2yr old will be charged $13? The hell is wrong with you? Seriously? I can see how an 8yr old or even a 6yr old could be a threat to your profits, but a 2yr old?  Please reconsider this absurd policy...because it makes you look petty. And your a better place than that. I hope."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere! I have had the oxtail soup it was delicious. Tried my friends sushi and it was fresh and tasty. Took my son about a week later, he loved it too."}
{"text":"They have the best service ! Great delicious food! Worth it!!! Give them a try I promise u will love it!  Missing Hawaii !!!!"}
{"text":"Need a sushi fix and don't wanna break the bank?  This is the place. This restaurant has two parts to it. A plate lunch side, which you can also order sushi, poke bowls, etc. and a traditional sushi bar side, where they also let you order from the plate lunch side. Plate lunch has all your local Hawaii favorites and the sushi side has all your traditional rolls and some unique rolls as well, including alcohol. One of my favorite local restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Island Sushi is Awesome!  I've been coming here every week for the past year + and it's my favorite sushi joint hands down.  My usual picks are Island special, Chuey,  fried geso,  Ahi poke  The service is quick and friendly, sometimes the sushi chefs will make random tasty tidbits and send them our way, so good!"}
{"text":"I am soooo disappointed! I'm not going to lie the food is really good but the service we received from Stephanie tonight was completely out of line. It sucks that although the food was good I still leave a negative review but honestly I will not be back just because if the service me and my party received.  We had a party of 15 and most if us got the all you can eat sushi. We didn't even receive 1/3 of the sushi we ordered because she kept giving our rolls to other people in our party even though me and my wife were on a separate tab. She didn't offer us out desert and just asked us if we wanted the bill at the end- we felt like we were being rushed!   On top of all that she over charged us on our drinks and I when I tried explaining it to her she ignored me and started talking to another person in our party WHILE I WAS STILL TALKING. She rudely said \"fine I'll take it off the bill\". Are you serious!?!? Wth is that?   After she had someone else drop of the revised bill she NEVER came back to pick it up! Our entire party of 15 left because we were waiting so long and me and my wife ended up waiting by our selves until we finally decided to walk up to the cash resister and asked if someone could ring us up. Stephanie should NOT be working in a place where she has to be polite to paying customers or any service oriented job because it is not her cup of tea.. I will not be back here ever again!"}
{"text":"I like the food here but this reveiw is just for the some of the desserts: 1. Guava Cake - I was craving for some Guava cake so even though I came to the conclusion that I don't like the Guava cake here I decided to give it another try...Yup, I don't like it- The Guava Paste/Jelly on the cake just doesn't have a good Guava flavoring at all, it's just sweet. Oh, how I wish someone on this side of town could make some good Guava Chiffon cake just  like in Hawaii!!!! 2. Cream Puffs - The pudding on top and inside is just so overpowering - Hmm, I don't know- it was just way too much.  So, even though I didn't care for these 2 items doesn't mean that I don't like/enjoy everything else in this place cause I do. They do make hella good Malasadas, Banana Bread & Garlic Chicken."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi!  Ordered so many rolls, i can't remember what I got but I just know they were all delicious. I love the Hawaiian theme behind this sushi restaurant. I can't wait to come back to try their baked rolls because they all looked so good. I wish this place was back in my hometown because I would be a regular! I didn't get the chance to try their plates but looking on their menu, their plate dishes looked so good. I only wish that my stomach was big enough to eat the entire menu.   I did try their desserts, and they were all good! Next time, I'll definitely try more of their desserts. Brownie was warm and it was a perfect combo with their ice cream."}
{"text":"BEWARE of ordering off their CATERING menu. I paid $90 for a FULL tray of Teriyaki Beef. I ended up with a HALF tray of Teriyaki-4 lbs of cooked Teri Beef. Menu says it can feed 25-30 people. Definitely NOT TRUE. What they fail to tell you is the FULL tray of Teri Beef is half in height-in essence NOT a FULL tray of beef. What a total disappointment!!! I ordered for my daughters graduation party and did not have enough for all my guests.   Also, my order was picked up at 1030am. Shrya called me at 1130am to ask when I would be picking up my order? She said it was still there. Which leads me to believe they gave me the wrong order. I spoke to Lee and he didn't help matters.   So basically, DO NOT order any catering from them. It is a HUGE ripoff. I paid $90 for 4lbs of Teri Beef. Terrible Service and false advertising!  This is my reply to Owner-Terrence Fong seems like a good excuse to me. I missed Steve's phone call as I was hosting a graduation party and trying to figure out how I would make up for the shortage of Teri Beef.   It is a FACT that the tray was  NOT up to value. No where on the catering menu did it say \"Full Tray is 8lbs\". That to me equals-FALSE Advertising. I also purchased a FULL TRAY of Deluxe Noodles and guess what? That tray weighed a lot more than 8 lbs. What is your excuse for that?   I always try to support local businesses. But, how can I when this is he result. Very sad that you decided to respond this way instead of trying to making it right. AUWE! Clearly you are not in the habit of running your business with Aloha and respect for your customers."}
{"text":"Island Sushi & Grill is an ABSOLUTE MUST when we come to Vegas! Best sushi, music, and service! My family and I always come here when we get together. Servers like Kevin and the team make the experience GREAT! Go with the All-You-Can-Eat when you're there because it's worth it. Here are some of our family faves below! Oh and make a reservation  Starters  * Shrimp Tempura  * Mochiko Chicken * Garlic Chicken   Sushi  * Big Island Roll * Kahuku Roll * Kona Roll   Desserts * 808 Special  * Malassada Sundae"}
{"text":"My cousin who lives in Vegas, but from Hawaii took us here for breakfast. The food was good & portions were generous. I will definitely go back on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Really good place with a local atmosphere. Super comfortable friendly service. A lot to choose from on ayce menu, and everything was right on. The sushi was actually really good, and although there are some straight sushi places with slightly better sushi most of those places don't have the variety that this place has. Delicious ahi poke, and a bunch of sides that I wouldn't normally get at sushi places puts this place over the top.  I went with my wife and kids and we just ordered a ton of food. There was nothing that didn't taste good and we didn't feel rushed or like they wanted to present a bunch of \"rules\" for ayce like other places. I will go back regularly. Awesome find."}
{"text":"I Come every week to their poke bowl ! The poke is always fresh . Remind me the poke bowl in Hawaii . Excellent customer service ."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in town, hands down. AYCE and they give great portions. I'm a big nigiri sushi eater and their proportions of rice to raw fish ratio is pretty even. I recommend the soft shell crab, it tastes amazing (one order per person).   There is not an item on their menu that I don't recommend. They are always busy, but reservations are welcome.   The best customer service I've ever experienced in an AYCE sushi restaurant.   I highly recommend coming here, not only for sushi, but they have really good Hawaiian food AND the best Poke in town."}
{"text":"This is by far MY FAVORITE AYCE sushi place!  It's not that close to the Las Vegas Strip, but driving here is totally worth it.  Upon entering, the first section you're in is their bake shop where you can order malasadas and wonderful treats like cocoa puffs.  To the right is the main dining area.  You can choose to order a la carte style or AYCE.  From their regular menu, we ordered their garlic chicken, mochiko chicken, and fried noodles.  ALL TASTED GREAAAAT!  From their sushi menu, we ordered ahi poke (tuna), tako poke (octopus), ebi (shrimp), ika (squid), masago (smelt roe), unagi (fresh water eel), amaebi (sweet shrimp), and their uni (sea urchin).  We also ordered a few specialty rolls.  All were very good and fresh!  Just writing this review makes me want to drive 4 hours just to eat here!  Okay, back to their review.  Their friendly staff did a great job in making sure we had enough food and when we would place an order, the food came out fresh and quick.  This AYCE isn't your typical buffet where you get up and serve yourself.  Your server comes around and you would inform them what menu item you'd like to order.  Simple as that!  When the place gets extremely busy, they have a 90 min. time limit.  The rules are noted on each table.  However when we were there, it was pretty packed and we stayed their longer than 90 minutes.  I guess they don't want you to practically live there and live off of their awesome food.  Also, they don't like it when you waste their awesome sushi.  So order accordingly.  It's an AYCE, so pace yourself.  DO NOT ORDER RICE OR ELSE YOU WILL GET FULL FAST!  For each person, it's about $24.  Don't come here expecting to eat crab legs all day.  For $24, that is a VERY good deal for fresh and great tasting sushi.  Their AYCE menu is extensive.  Did I mention that their mochiko and garlic chicken are both delicious?  I will most definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Oh no!! I found my new lunch place now..Yummy! We ordered the 1. chicken&eggplant . 2.Curry chicken. 3. Garlic shrimp. All Mini. Plus uni Sushi. Perfect size for me and my husband. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Best poke in this town/city. Service is absolutely the best even when it's was busy. Great food, hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"4 star food and service is always great so that pushes it to 5 stars for me.  Love their garlic chicken wings, the mount charleston and all you can menu.  I've taken different friends and family here and they all love it as well.  Sorry to see the downtown location closed, it's definitely a favorite place of mine to eat!"}
{"text":"Quick stop by this joint today for lunch after a morning full of Garage Sale hopping in Southern Highlands!   Our cousin said this place has bomb custard pie! If you're from Hawaii, you're used to getting bomb custard pie from Zippy's and Foodland or any other average Hawaii grocery store. Here in Vegas, custard pie isn't such a hot commodity, so when Your Cousin says \"custard pie\", you just reply, \"lead the way\"!   We arrived on a Saturday afternoon at around 1pm. The place was semi-packed, we were rushing so we opted for the take-out side of the restaurant. I ordered the kalua pig with poke plate, we shared a custard pie and a side of chicken katsu.   When you walk in, the place is kind of confusing...to the right you'll see a sign in sheet on a table with a sign directing Wait to Be Seated, straight ahead at the end of the take out side of the restaurant you'll see an ordering window with Poke Bowl only menu, and to the left you'll see the take out window with bakery showcase!   I was overwhelmed by all the signage, I just picked a seat and waited for my other half to order us lunch. It took a while to get our order but it was clear that the place was busy. Our food was good, I like that they had shoyu for us on the side next to the soda machine. I also like that they have free refills in the self serve soda machine. I was kind of disappointed that I didn't get to really take a look at the menu so I'll be back again. Next time I'll opt for the dine in side."}
{"text":"Okay kids, I got LOST in Las Vegas (isn't that a movie with that lame-o Nick Cage, I can be wrong, no wait, I was wrong, that's Leaving Las Vegas, and I'm not wrong about him being LAME). With the new car rental terminal thingy being miles away from the airport, I got lost and wound up going the wrong direction in search of the Strip. Don't laugh at me. I'm horrible with my bearings once I get anywhere, but once I get my internal GPS going, I'm good to go.  At any rate, we wound up consulting our Garmin to look for a sushi place and were actually looking for Koto Sushi (never been, but hell it came up on our search so why the hell not), but found that was Island Sushi instead. Scared as hell that sushi can be either BOMB or ASS, we entered in and knew that it wasn't all bad when everyone, well, almost everyone except us, were island folk! No shit! I was thrilled because you want to go to a restaurant that has the people there. Go to a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have chinese people? Are you high? Anyways, real Hawaiians, real ono food, you heard?  Husbandido ordered the chirashi and was NOT disappointed. Was thrilled when he couldn't finish it (take that SF chirashi!) and saw just how much rice there was to offer. I ordered chicken katsu dinner and lo and behold it came with dessert (808 special is a must have, people). So I give them mad props. I frequent SF sushi just as regularly as I frequent my home, and it's nice to find good, solid sushi and grinds as I would at home. I would dare to say not necessarily just good...but maybe better!  I highly recommend this, even if you're not lost. It's worth a drive out, and it's not too far off the freeway to scare the crap out of you.  You will definitely have enough scratch to hit the casinos afterward. Two hungry people fresh from the plane? $34. Baller status.  Oh and the peeps that work there are really COOL! Love 'em. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Used to love to eat here all the time. Although the food is still ok, the service has gone down. Went in there the other day and the person at the register looked grouchy and was bothered that the restaurant was busy. Bring back the Aloha feeling that was nce there when you first opened."}
{"text":"Literally everything is delicious at this place. So many options can't go wrong. Favorites- Kalbi plate, oxtail soup, poke bowl, spicy tuna roll, Kona roll."}
{"text":"I don't think I ever had a bad meal here. I'm not from Hawaii but my fiance say is and he tells me all the time this place is the  closest to being straight from home. I am obsess with poke and all the different types, so nothing makes me happy then their poke bar. A bit pricey,  but what do you expect when you live in the desert."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place very often however the customer service is quite lacking. If you are not of a particular racial background (white or Asian) you are ignored in line until you say something to the employees in line (who are placed higher in the line customers for their own personal orders).  I observed and experienced this twice and said something to the staff about it and all they could muster up was to say sorry. The staff here need a serious lesson in courtesy and overall business practice."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to really expect when I came here, but I saw a picture of saimin the day before and I knew that I just had to go!   I got here a lil before 11 am and it was pretty packed. I ordered the deluxe saimin and subbed it out with udon noodles instead. Everything came out fairly quickly. Broth was light and there was a good assortment of wonton, bbq pork and imitation crab meat. I didn't leave full though, so that was the downfall. My coworker enjoyed the teriyaki chicken which he ate all of.  I know I will be back to get some chantilly cake to go! They have a pastry selection that looked pretty delish, but can be pricy at $4.50 a slice.   We were in and out in 30 minutes and everyone was quite friendly."}
{"text":"This place is on my top five of all the AYCEs here in vegas!! it is well worth your $20.95 for lunch. its just so goood! Their side dishes are really good you'll have to try all of  them . They also have over 20 rolls to choose from they kind of cut it tiny but i guess thats good if you want to try alot of their rolls.  i recommend the CANDYCANE roll:]           GESO!! omgahh you cannot go here without getting gesos (which are baby octopus goodness!)   The only down side would be their nigiri. Last time i ate there the salmon wasnt fresh :[. but sometimes it is. but if this place isnt all that if your crazy for nigiri ive had way better quality in other sushi joints. Also their service could be slow and youll have to be patient if there is alot of people, their really nice though.  But other than that this placeee is really really YUMMMY!!  The sushi chef even gave me and my boyfriend complimentary SAKE BOMBS!! woot.   and again. TRY THE GESO!!!"}
{"text":"When I miss home & since this is closer to me I come here to get my hawaiian fix. Poki is expensive but worth it. They also have all you can eat sushi side all I can say is broke the mouth (deliciously yummy)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Island Sushi for their garlic chicken, fried noodles, spam katsu musubi (it's so.... ono! Katsu breading around the spam!), creme puffs, malasadas, and the list goes on and on and on. I moved away from Hawaii 6 years ago so this is a great place to eat in between my trips back home.   I would come here more often if I didn't live on the opposite side of town. :) I normally just order to go but I've been here once for AYCE and that was pretty good. They also added the option to order online too! It's great because you can specify whether or not you want mac salad, all rice, etc. Then you can specify the time you want the pick up and you can also pay online. So easy!  All I have to say now is, get over here and try it. Even if you are not from Hawaii, you will love the food! Don't be afraid to try anything and everything!   Island Sushi - Thank you for always providing great food and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"They have malassadas! Since Hawaii, having the best malassadas ever, we have looked for them and Island's S&G is pretty much the only.place that has them anywhere close to the islands! Anytime we come to Vegas we come here! We had all you can eat lunch and it was so good, fresh great price and really good service. Plus with AYCE you get 2 desserts and they are delicious! Brownies taste homemade!"}
{"text":"This place is delightful. Great selection of All You Can Eat Sushi, great service, and for those random friends/family who you have to bring that don't enjoy fish plenty of great teriyaki and other options for them to indulge in. Looking for a great place to go, come here!"}
{"text":"Something that they should really work on is the customer service. Yes they are friendly however in my opinion they're slow for the size of the restaurant. Sushi is good but will never beat SAKANA."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fresh food, really unique items. This is my first time here and definitely not my last! Loving his spot!"}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. The customer service is amazing and the people are so friendly. Now lets talk about the amazing food! The garlic chicken and chicken katsu is ono!!! Best I've ever had. Had the sushi today for the first time and it was so fresh and delicious too! My friend had the sushi burrito and was doing the happy dance while eating it. I will be going back and trying other things as well, I have never been disappointed with anything. P.S their banana lumpia makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Thank you ISG!! Alooohaaaa."}
{"text":"This review is for AYCE sushi only! We absolutely LOVE this place. Started coming here last year after moving in the area and have been completely happy with it ever since. The sushi is always fresh and chefs and staff are always super sweet. It can get pretty packed around dinner time and on weekends, but the wait is never long.  Surf & Turf and Big Island are some of our favorite rolls, but the entire menu from miso soup to nigiri is delish. Finish dinner with hot fresh malassada and you're set!  This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"We had a large party of 40 people while we were in town for a basketball tournament.  We made sure to make reservations as this place is such a hidden gem and books up quickly.  The restaurant is a little small  We are from LA and Island Sushi and Grill is one of the BEST hawaiian/sushi places we've been to hands down.  Add in an AYCE option and you can't lose!!  The staff is so helpful and accommodating giving off the classic island hospitality.  We can only imagine how chaotic it was for the staff to cater our party, with all the al la carte and all you can eat options, but they did it with ease.  The food was delicious and well prepared and came out in a timely matter.  Our whole team was so impressed with the selection and quality of the food.  We've been here several times and are always impressed and pleased with the food, drinks, and service."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi!   I am usually super duper disappointed with the AYCE sushi places bc they tend to limit the menu to certain items and they're usually items that I do not like... NOT HERE! Liked it all! They had my favs and usuals, scallop roll, poke, and garlic tuna. Poke was good and they give a nice size amount for one serving, garlic tuna had too much ginger and the scallops were cooked, not what I'm used to but they were all pretty tasty. The dessert was pretty good on the AYCE too. I think it was called the Island Special, basically ice cream and fruit. Simple but refreshing!   The quality of the sushi was good, service was good and the restrooms were clean but c'mon, put some hand soap in the bathroom! They had a sink and paper towels but no soap, what in the heck?! Sorry, had to knock a star off for that, I'm a level 4 germ-a-phobe so it was real bothersome that I had to use my hand sanitizer rather than use what's supposed to be available to you by health department standards.   One other thing that I was pretty disappointed with what that this place is called Island Sushi and a majority of the people that come in to eat here get AYCE sushi but-- they didn't include the malasadas in the AYCE Menu. Not a big deal but I would've rather have had them... Been awhile since I've had them :(  Word to the wise... You have to decide whether or not you want AYCE right away, they're sticklers for it. My sister-in-law ordered edamame and then decided that she wanted AYCE after the order had been put in and and they said that they had to charge her for it because they \"can't\" change it out."}
{"text":"Great place for poke, especially their spicy ahi \"cube\" bowl. Their items are fresh and reminds me of being back in Hawaii. Their staff is friendly, too. They also have some baked goods to satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Pokè !!! The best poke in town hands down. I used to go to poke place on Craig, but this one is by far so much better !!!!! Pokè bowl is to die for."}
{"text":"I came here again a few weeks ago, and was a little disappointed the food didn't live up to my memory.  The first time I came, this WAS THE BEST SUSHI ROLLS I ever had.  Now, it's really good, but the rolls didn't pop.  The sushi didn't seem as fresh and vigorous as before, and the presentation was also a little bit underwhelming.  Still, very good sushi and I would eat here again if in the area;  Probably won't make a 200 mile detour trip like I did this last time though."}
{"text":"Great sushi quality! I hate that they don't take reservations (only because I drive from Summerlin). I give them 3 stars because their service is mediocre. They have a larger selection of apps and side and treats, also a bakery so you can grab some fresh malasadas before you go choices between pandan, chocolate, or vanilla. Ono!!"}
{"text":"Love it here but I miss the option to get Poke Express too. It was the best of both worlds! Just miss that counter... Butter Mochi is good here too."}
{"text":"When I want a quick spicy tuna bowl fix, i go to island sushi. I went during lunch hour so the tables were full and people were in line to pick up their food orders. It took 10 minutes to order our food and another 15 minutes to get the food. The spicy tuna bowl tasted great, I just wished it looked like a bowl. The food wasn't presentable as I hoped it would be. I also wished they had more help because this place gets packed and it needs more seating arrangements."}
{"text":"Two words when ordering on the Grill side, GARLIC CHICKEN! It's the closest thing to the Mitsuken restaurant in Hawaii, and boy let me tell you that is some bomb ass Garlic Chicken.  Everything else on the menu is A-OK, and so is the poke.  It isn't anything to rave about, but I do make do since I can't have it fresh like home.    On the sushi side, it's bueno! I think it's just me, but I love how the rice is.  It isn't too sticky or moist, it's just right.  Also, a keynote when ordering get the deep fried gesu.  OMG! It's amazing, especially with their mayo sauce.  It just makes everything taste better! I tend to think that the sashimi tastes better on sushi, so if you're craving raw fish.  Go for their sushi, it tastes a heck of a lot better.   Being from the Island, I say go here if you're craving the island food. It does live up to par, I just wish the poke came right from the ocean. Vegas needs a beach, so we can get a fish fresh!"}
{"text":"Had AYCE sushi at the restaurant this time-- soo ono! Great staff, a bit slow when it gets too busy, but over all, there are so many items that you can order from-- and the food is so fresh! Only thing though, only 90 mins. max at the table and then one dessert per customer.  Good selection of desserts- tempura ice cream, mango mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream and 808 sundae (strawberries and tempura bananas with ice cream and chocolate).  I think that you can get the coco puffs or malasada too even!"}
{"text":"My family love Island sushi grill. We come here once a week. We love the Poke Express. We love the sushi. They have something for everyone.   I would recommend any of the following: Poke AYCE Sushi  Garlic chicken Roast Pork with gravy Bento box Chicken eggplant Malasadas"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with their cake. Chantilly cake has been my favorite cake for a long time and when I took a bite of the first piece of the cake I was disgusted. It tasted like the cake has been sitting their for 3 days. Hard and not moist at all. The frostings texture didn't even look like frosting. What a waste of $4.50."}
{"text":"I don't know how I have not reviewed this place, I eat here more often then I should for my waistline. This review is for their grill side since I have not gone to their sushi spot in years so can't judge it. The grill side has a small amount of seating,  but it's set up more for takeout while the sushi side is more of a restaurant.   I do recall the sushi side had half off happy hour prices on certain days,  so I recommend investigating that before you go for that specifically.   So back to the grill... First of all this place is the best place to get poke.  Super fresh, great selection of flavors,  and although I have only ordered by the pound, I saw they now also hopped onto the poke bowl and burrito band wagon.    Their mac salad is possibly my favorite of all the Hawaiian restaurants in town,  and their garlic chicken is fried perfectly, so juicy, while packing a level of flavor that makes me happy dance when I devour it.  One item you can't miss is their malasadas,  it is a Portuguese donut that became popular and adopted in Hawaiian cuisine.   Fluffy round donuts rolled in sugar, and I always get mine filled with custard.   Their vanilla custard is so perfect and creamy.  It's honestly my favorite donut in the valley.  I have tried the haupia filling, but I found it a bit bland, and had a slightly off taste.   Overall this is the most solid Hawaiian restaurant I have been to,  and I find myself craving it often. Even when I go visit Hawaii I find myself preferring items here, so they are legit,  and I am so glad I live by them."}
{"text":"Not sure on where to start. Had ayce on 10/14/14. Haven't been here in a while because I've gone to other places, and now I remembered why I stopped coming in the first place. 1) no customer service? I will not put our first server on blast but our second server made up for it, she was ok. 2) we were seated aprox 20mins before a party that came in and ordered waaay before them and guess what, their sushi came out 15mins before ours. Pls tell me what's wrong with this picture? Probably because I don't have the scooops with the peeps at island sushi. 3) they weren't even busy when we went but service was slow and unacceptable. 4) I have notice their quality in their tuna and it's something I don't recommend.   Overall, unless you know the people at ISG, great! You'll have better service than the people that don't know anyone there but still tries to give them the business they do not deserve. I guess I'll never come back, not even to their grill side. Oh wells...."}
{"text":"We live coming here. The food is usually always good and makes me feel close to home.  I love their oxtail soup and wontonmin... You can't go wrong with the poke either..."}
{"text":"Very good especially if you get there during happy hour alot of the menu items are 1/2 price off not bad at all"}
{"text":"In a word........Incredible! I have enjoyed sushi and Hawaiian specialties all over the world and at what were advertised as the best spots in each local. However................I was blown away at Island Sushi Sunday Brunch. For $20.95,  its all you can eat and can choose from special offerings of the day as well as from a few pages of sashimi, rolls, tempura, and a whole host of apps. Service was exceptional and personal. Atmosphere was light and upbeat, feeling like a locals secret treasure. I had one fried roll of crab and other ingredients that was the BEST Sushi roll I have ever had in my entire life. I cant wait to go back. The bar has been reset."}
{"text":"Located on the Eastside. Known for the all you can eat sushi, and the all you can drink add on. This place isn't bad, it's no \"I love Sushi\" but then again, what is? But not bad for a quick casual stop in. The rolls were imaginative. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"One of the better sushi experiences I've had in a while. We stopped in on a whim and sat at the sushi bar. They had a happy hour 1/2 off sushi special that my girlfriend enjoyed and I did AYCE. Wayne was making our sushi and it was lightning fast. Loved the service we got. The rolls were also really, really good. They just seemed of better quality and lighter than what I am used to back home. The AYCE menu is vast with many options. Great experience and very affordable."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places, but I was disappointed when I went in a few days ago and was able to order half rolls until it is my last roll? In all my years of AYCE, I'm not sure when this rule came about. Other than that, the food is great. They do seem to be understaffed at times though. It's typically busy but never seems to be enough servers. Connected to the sushi restaurant is a bakery where they have Hawaiian food and desserts which all look amazing."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmmm. Love the baked sushi dishes. Baked lasagna.... a must try :) There are two sides to the restaurant. Island Grill & Island Sushi. Island Grill is a more of a sit down, let's eat quick or take it to go, section. They serve hamburgers, bbq/grilled food, noodles, etc. They also have kimchee rice! I fell in love at first site :) It was delicious (for you kimchee lovers). It separates into the Island Sushi room. A nice sit down, let's drink a glass of wine or a bottle of beer, area. There are 2 Tv's which usually has sports on (for you sports lovers) and a small bar where you can watch the chefs make sushi. If you are on a sushi fix, I recommend purchasing the \"all you can eat\" sushi menu. It is worth the price you pay! Noise level can get loud when there's a big sports event on TV."}
{"text":"Excellent AYCE (All you can eat) Value and prompt, friendly service. Fresh sushi is based on the volume you can push and how you can rotate your stock, and this place packs 'em in. For $25 (dinner AYCE includes more choices) it's no wonder.  I'm a purist. I don't do crazy rolls in which have gone the 2nd-day fish, drowned in eel sauce. Just the basics. For a place which specializes in rolls, i was pleased with the result. And I'm a fussy guy.  --uni nigiri. limit one. --ikura. fresh and good. --ika nigiri. soft, fresh. nice! --salmon skin hand roll. great fresh veggies. --hamachi kama. nicely seasoned, fresh. moist inside. WIN! --tako-uni. yeah, it's not really octopus, it's raw squid with extra crispy stuff. i love this dish. not for the unwashed. strong, dark and almost fermented, like a good natto. --seaweed wraps are fresh, dry, crispy, and great flavor. WIN!  #seaweed salad. something in there that shouldn't be. and it was not fresh.  servers are super friendly, responsive to all the obsessed AYCE gluttons. two sushi chefs keep that food MOVING to the 50-seats. (personal note: Kojisan@Hanajapanese, you would have been impressed!)  AYCE comes with rules, don't you know? ! all food ordered must be consumed (that includes rice) $1 penalty for uneaten nigiri. ! no take away. ! some items are one-per-person-per-visit ! your dining feast must end 90 minutes after you begin."}
{"text":"The sushi was very flavorful. They had very tasty sauces for each roll. The poki is excellent and can be purchased by the pound for take out. On Mondays they have half price regular and special rolls. This will be our Monday sushi place for sure"}
{"text":"My bf and I found this place on yelp and fell in love with it in August.  We just went back on Monday and took advantage of the AYCE. Our waitress was super friendly and nice; actually, all the waitresses were awesome.  I love the service and the food.  Our favorites are: Island Roll, Dragon Roll, Tuna Belly, Ahi Poke, Octopus Kim Chi. We ate more than $150 worth, but only paid the awesome price of $25/person.    We ate so much, we passed out in the car.  That didn't stop us from having the same sushi craving the next day.  Love Island Sushi!!!  We'll be sure to make it a ritual to come here every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best sushi place...service and food is great!! I ordered the Kona, big island,and Salmon lover with cucumber, crab salad! They serve poke too!! Japanese and Hawaiian s a good combo! This place is at the top of my list!!"}
{"text":"Needed my \"fix\" for some local grindz while in Vegas and chose Island Sushi & Grill because of the favorable ratings on Yelp.  Drove 16 miles (32 roundtrip) from DTLV out to ISG just to satisfy my yearning.  For the most part I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't \"overly\" impressed.    It's a relatively clean place, but reminiscent of a local hole-in-the-wall diner back in the 808 - similar seats, stools, tables and floors.  Dine-in customers are still provided their meals in takeout containers, so that was a bit of a surprise. Typical local style, riiight?  Luckily the transplanted \"Hawaiian\" community hankering for island flavors are probably keeping this place open and in business.    I had the regular loco moco and my cousin had the poke chirashi. I love the fact that they make their own hamburger patties as the flavor was very good. The gravy was not generic and a nice change from what one might get at L&L. The mac salad was actually potato/mac, which anyone from the 808 would notice off the bat, so that was a nice distinction.    The poke bowl my cousin had was excellent. But, for the amount of poke provided it was priced maybe $2 more than it should have been.  It was good poke, no doubt...buuut, maybe a slightly bigger bowl for that price. This is why I won't eat at Tanioka's or Yama's Fish Market back on Oahu...  So why not 5 stars? Aside from the ambience (SO retro-local), it was the service we received...  Sorry.  Maybe because I'm in the service industry, but the staff - who look like kids of transplanted islanders - could perhaps meet/greet customers in a more friendlier tone and be a smidge more attentively as well.  It was taking a while for my plate, so I went back to the register and lo and behold, 3 workers chichatting in the kitchen about something with my order just sitting there. When one of them noticed me, he asked my name (???). WOW, how genius...we were the only ones in there - aside for some private party in the adjoining room.   Anyways, aside from service and price, this is a good place for local Hawaiians needing their 808 food fix.  Try it and enjoy..."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Half off all sushi Monday Tuesday Wednesday all day! Mowie wowie roll Is a must! My favorite out of the ones I tried."}
{"text":"Long wait to get served, sooo slowww... we decided to leave because none of them even greeted or asked if we were ready to order or not or even give us a water... not good!"}
{"text":"one of my friends told me to eat here ... glad i made that stop and every day for 2 days till i left . the hawaiian food is on point . but the poke OMG the poke is amazing and im from hawaii i didnt know u could make as many different varities of poke .... i tried all of them .. every time i visit vegas im hitting this spot up"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for about 7 years and had poor service for the second time in a row.  We do enjoy the food and we did have a large party but our experience went down even further when we spoke with the owner to let him know about our experience.  He could have cared.less that half of the table was served while the other half waited 45 min to get their food.  He just wanted to argue with us why it wasn't an issue.  Yes he is a small business owner, yes it was busy, no the customer doesn't get an I'm sorry you weren't happy from anyone.   Despite being the only sushi place we would visit for years we have decided to go elsewhere from now on.  Great.food is only half of the formula.  You need happy customers too."}
{"text":"Anytime im in Vegas this is a must stop. All you can eat or by the roll you cant go wrong. Top quality and decent prices. Great place!"}
{"text":"The food here was DELICIOUS but the service from Krislyn was TERRIBLE and left a bad aftertaste in our mouths, hence the 3-star rating.   We ordered 2 bentos and spam musubis and they came out hot and fresh for our appetites. The cashier or server KRISLYN rudely slammed our food and forks on our table like she didn't care and she lacked manners. I'm easy to please and usually let things slide but the way she treated my partner and I actually bothered me. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or if she was too busy but she should know better than to slam customers' meals on the table and she also didn't explain which order is which that I had to go up and ask another server which bento had mochiko chicken and which had garlic chicken. No one there seemed welcoming AT ALL.  I'm more likely to return since I loved the food but I really DON'T want to experience a repeat of that shitty service. The ALOHA spirit here during this one visit was nonexistent. First impressions are LASTING impressions so I'll take a deep breath and kind of expect bad service here again even though I love the food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and both times were okay, I probably would come back here with some friends but not my first choice to frequent. I did all you can eat both times during lunch  and there's an hour time period. Service: 0 out of 10 The service was horrible, to the point where I kinda just wanted to up and leave. We ordered our food and after 20 minutes there was still no food. I gave them some leeway as we ordered a lot of dishes and it was kinda busy. Around the 30 minute mark our food came out but by that point we were already kind of annoyed. I spied at the corner of my eye that a table that got there after I did had gotten their food on the spot and that annoyed me even more. After we had finished our food there we wanted to order again but waving down to staff to give our ticket too was impossible. By this point a lot of the other tables had left and there weren't that many people anymore which left me confused as to why they couldn't see my hand waving a piece of paper in front of their faces. They also missed some of our orders and we left rushed and disappointed. Food: 7 out of 10 The food was the saving grace of the day. The crunch roll was amazing to the point where we ordered four and devoured them all. The candy cane roll was also good and kinda sweet which is a plus for me. Everything else was so-so."}
{"text":"The best place for hawaiian food in Vegas!! They are always consistent with the flavors! You can also get your poke fix here too!! The roast pork and garlic chicken combo will satisfy your sweet and savory cravings!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome. Staff was really nice and fast. We got three speciality rolls, (dragon roll, black widow, and the California deep fried roll) drinks, and strawberry mochi for 30 dollars. Monday through Wednesday is half off sushi. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a few weeks now and decided to try it yesterday. My friend just got back in town and we wanted to catch up over sushi and sake. I Love Sushi (also on Eastern) is our usual go to but I suggested to be adventurous and try somewhere new!  When you first walk in I believe you're in Poke Express, a separate quick service restaurant inside Island Sushi. There is a place to order to the left and casual seating straight ahead. To the right is an entrance that opens up to Island Sushi which is a pretty small restaurant. We waited to be seated and the host said it would be about 30 min for a table. We decided to get started on sake at the bar and was seated at a table shortly after.   We weren't starving so we ordered a la carte rather than AYCE. I had the spicy garlic edamame, tuna poke, and a spicy tuna hand roll. The tuna wasn't very fresh in either of my tuna entrees. Hand roll was pretty tasteless, so I doused it in soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna poke was highly disappointing!! It wasn't flavorful and the texture of the tuna honestly felt like it sat out for a few hours. Some pieces were dry and chewier than the norm. The tuna was on a bed of seaweed salad, which was also dry. SO dry that when I tried to gather some seaweed salad with my chopsticks, I picked up ALL of the seaweed salad in an large chunk instead.   The spicy garlic edamame wasn't bad, but didn't taste extraordinary enough to make me want to come back to this place...  No complaints with the service, however, the dishes I tried here weren't memorable or enjoyable. Doubtful I'll return."}
{"text":"It is off the beaten path but well worth a visit.  Especially between 3 and 5 pm because of the 50% off rolls happy hour deal.  The variety of rolls to choose from is quite large.  We ordered five rolls, including two types of soft-shell crab rolls.  And $2 sake bombs.  What more can you ask from a sushi joint?  One star off because the 50% off deal does not apply to nigiri.  Oh well."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin.  In the past month and a half, I've come to realize I've come back to this place 4 times. The food is delicious and amazingly priced. That's something that is hard to get around. But one thing that has always stuck with me in importance above everything else is customer service.   I'm not easy to deal with sometimes. Not because I have an attitude, but because I can be an annoyingly picky eater. For that reason, it is easy to see frustration and eye rolling in a situation where someone would have to press a couple extra buttons to modify an order in a job they don't exactly enjoy.  I can tell at least for a Kapua, Chase, and Gino, that this is not only a job they enjoy, but an atmosphere that has already made me feel welcome like family. They have already remembered me by name, they have went out of their way to make recommendations, check on myself and the friends I have brought with me, and have yet to make any visit any less than fantastic. The three of them have been an invaluable asset to the restauraunt and  instrumental factors regarding my three returns, and all the returns after this review that are to come.  Thank you for the fantastic food and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Great food and the best malasadas in town and they make good poke to order with a great selection"}
{"text":"Decided to come for lunch and pick up. My order was 33$ and I was skeptical why it was so much. I got to my car and my order was wrong. I do not eat meat and specifically ordered a vegetable roll and they gave me shrimp roll. Went back inside and re ordered. Left again in my car driving away when I checked again. Wrong again!!! I had to drive back come back inside as they gave me a slight attitude. As if i shouldn't be mad I've spent an hour here trading my food and haven't ate today.  I also ordered chicken katsu for my nephew which they were going to let me keep the old katsu that has been sitting for an hour already. Lastly someone came up to me saying that I bit into one of the wrong orders. Seriously furious. This place sucks and the management sucks do not come !"}
{"text":"Sushi is OK, the only reason my wife and I have got food from them was cause they delivered. Last night we tried to order delivery, THEY NO LONGER DELIVER. so we probably won't ever have there food again."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here when I'm in Vegas. The food is always good and they definitely use fresh ingredients. I'm a sucker for sushi, and the fact that this place has an all-you-can-eat choice makes it more awesome. One of my favorite things to get, surprisingly, is the California roll. I don't know why. I just really like the way they make it. My other favorite thing to order is the salmon skin roll. Nice and crispy salmon skin with veggies in a sushi roll. Of course if you would rather order sushi without stuffing yourself with the sushi rolls, you can order things like ikura, scallop mayo, ika, unagi, and ahi. Service hasn't always been the best, but the servers are super busy, so you just need to be patient. This place definitely has the Hawaiian feels, so that's another reason I like coming here. I really wish Island Sushi was on Oahu."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, the first time for their poke. The second time for their oxtail soup.  The poke was amazing! I got the furikake, garlic, and spicy avocado. It's about 15-16 a pound for poke but definitely worth it! The slice of haupia cake was pretty good, maybe just a bit overpriced. I probably wouldn't get that again.  I personally wouldn't recommend the oxtail soup. I asked the girl and she said that they just heat it up when ordered. I paid about 12.50 and I got 3 good pieces of meat/bone. I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't fresh, but I don't think the flavor of the broth was too great.  Other than that, I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes and even their sushi. I will definitely be back for more poke! :)"}
{"text":"my friends took me here. i believe they found it here on yelp. the location is great cause it like 10 min from my apt on gv pkwy.  there are so many great things about this place i really cant get enough of it. i go about 2 times a month maybe more. the all you can eat is a great deal cause i love to put some rolls away. it is great priced too.  i usually start out with an ahi poke and some gezo. then the rolls start coming. from the chey to the island to the black widow. i don't believe i have ever had a roll i didn't like.  the fish is very FRESH. the rolls are very nicely put together and displayed. all the appetizers are great.  the other thing about the place is the staff ROCK. they are all super friendly. they are on the ball. they get your drinks regularly without asking. they are quick with anything you need yet are nice enough for a lil chit chat at the table. every one is super friendly, and keep the place clean.  so lets review-  fish fresh? YES  friendly amazing staff? YES  clean place? YES  nicely decorated? YES  would i go back? YES, many times  should you go? YES"}
{"text":"So ono!!!  We are in town for the annual Ironman race and we always have a hard time finding something healthy to eat (and not just salads). A local friend recommended this place so we went here for dinner. I like that there are two sides to this place: the take-out/express and the sit-down restaurant.   We opted to sit down and were greeted with friendly and fast service as well as an extensive menu for fish and non-fish eaters. The AYCE option seem popular, but my husband choose the ahi avocado poke bowl (yum!!!) and I choose the teriyaki chicken combo, which is only $11 and comes with miso soup, a salad, edaname, chicken, rice, and dessert!!! And that dessert option is no joke! Tempura ice cream, green tea ice cream, mochi, sundae... I choose the creme brulée. Everything tasted great and the prices are reasonable. Definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"For someone that does not like raw fish or anything too authentic like my husband (he's a regular sushi eater!) Island sushi is amazing! My husband can enjoy the \"authentic\" sushi while I enjoy they're amazing shrimp and garlic chicken! Definitely give them a try even if your not into sushi. They have other amazing things to offer & I love them for that! Oh and they're desserts are so so yummy"}
{"text":"The food was so good. The server was excellent. And everything was quick yet fresh. The only thing that took a little while is the bbq chicken but it still tasted very good! We came in for happy hour on a Saturday night and got our food within 5 mins of ordering! Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were dining March 21. Terry I love your food! It's amazing! The service is just really bad In a market flooded with sushi restaurants.    We still want to go but drive by and decided to go elsewhere in eastern due to the bad service.  I read other reviews and I am not the only one with the same opinion about the service."}
{"text":"A local recommended this place to us for AYCE sushi.  My husband and I were craving japanese food, so we said why not.    The service was great.  They adapted to our screaming child who refused to go to sleep.  They have a 90 min. time limit on the AYCE part, which sucks.  But I can see why they do that since the place is pretty small.    Their ahi poke was yummy.  My hubby couldn't stop eating it!  I ate more than him and our other guy friend.  I ordered the tempura ice cream for dessert.  The batter didn't taste that great, but it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Went there for out second time. Great service, smiles, and delish sake. We went during happy our and got too much food for two people and dessert.  Only 25$! You'll leave happy and full here!"}
{"text":"Malasadas are Ono, garlic chicken and mochiko chicken are good! Love the island special roll. Service sucked when we went. They had a short Filipino girl that served us and we seem to get her every time we go. We're always friendly and respectful but she always seems to give stink attitude. I wish she'd check the attitude at the door because it ruins our night--and we always come and bring friends to experience the food!"}
{"text":"My dad's side of the family is from Hawaii, REAL Hawaiian blood.... & I have been coming here for years as my go to spot for fresh HAWAIIAN style poke by the pound! My favorites are the tako (octopus) limu, & the salmon poke (i usually just ask for it with onion, green onion / Hawaiian Style) try Pairing ur poke with the Taro chips they sell too! THEY HAVE THE BEST MALASADAS hands down, even better than the islandS. So, with all that said... aside from the POKE side,I'm posting this review because of the experience i had last night on the other side at ISLAND SUSHI in the actual all you can eat sushi spot. Our server's name was \"MAC\"...I've been in the hospitality industry for years & i must say my bf and i were impressed with his service. He was super cool, and kind, also suggestive & attentive. He was knowledgeable about the menu & i like how he'd suggest items when we didn't know what to order anymore! My family and I made sure we took care of him & tipped him more than appropriately. Everything we ate was so delicious & fresh, & the presentation was better than most AYCE places. This business/restaurant is the closest you'll get to REAL island flavor, I promise you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!! Took my bestie here for her birthday the other weekend everything was great accept the fact the servers need to better communicate with other servers. Ordered a sushi roll from one of the servers walking by and waited a bit then another server came to take the same order we were initially for them finally getting the sushi and seen they had did a double order because of lack of communication. But other then that this is AlwAys my to go for sushi/Hawaiian food"}
{"text":"This place is awesome....they have all you can eat and the freshest sushi we have found on this side of town.  They are always busy and a great place to visit.  Always friendly and glad to be of service....a must visit place."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that we order food from this place religiously. I would say minimum twice a week. We like the food, obviously.   The thing that started to bother me was every time we grab our pick up order, they ALWAYS forget things. Whether it's our somen salad dressing or Mac salad. Or they mess up our order. And we don't notice it til we open everything up when we get home. We usually brush it off and don't mind.  But today when my boyfriend grabbed our food, our combo hamburger meal came with a drink. My boyfriend didn't know. And I told him when he came home that we should've gotten a small drink. And we laughed at the sign that was stuck on the bag. We were like, really? It said they aren't responsible for the orders once the food leaves the restaurant.  Being that we are regulars at this establishment, and that they are ALWAYS FORGETTING things for our order. This was a slap in the face.   Why don't you guys just check the orders better. It's obvious this is a common mistake and that's why they put this note on all the food orders.   Unreal"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Great food that comes with oblivious service. I really want to give it four stars, but missing and unfinished rolls can't justify it. Las Vegas is dubbed an honorary island due to \"Local Kine\" diaspora/migration to the desert, and as a result, we get lots of Hawaiian eateries in the valley. Yay! I personally do not like macaroni salad, deep-fried rolls, any roll that contains cream cheese, and sweet sauces. All these preferences go against many Americanized sushi and Hawaiian food protocol. Take my review with a grain of salt.   Their poke is delicious (at $10/lbs for takeout). Me and spicy food are like kindred spirits. I recommend the Lava Lover and Spicy Mexican. The standard Rainbow roll is tasty as well. The all-you-can-eat is a good deal, as long as you can grub until you burst. I love how the rolls aren't stuffed with rice like other places, but I don't like how many of the rolls are doused with this sweet sauce (miso? eel? ponzu? not sure) which was not pleasant and weird. Now only if they didn't forget my rolls, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"How much do I love this place?  Let me count the ways:  the wait staff and manager are VERY friendly, the sushi is always fresh and DELICIOUS, the all you can drink house sake, the competitive pricing, the hawaiian dishes, the takeout nextdoor, etc etc.  The list goes on!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?!  It's located away from all the busyness that is the Las Vegas Strip, it's decently priced, the fish is quality grade, and the AYCE menu is huge.  Ever since trying this joint out a couple years back, every trip to Vegas is not complete until we have a dinner at Island Sushi!  The staff is so friendly and attentive, the food tastes great, and the atmosphere just feels homey.  The latest time around, I decided to get only nigirizushi.  No rolls at all.  The menu for this AYCE is huge.  I had three rounds of several types of nigiri each round and still didn't make it thru the whole nigiri menu.  I didn't come across one I totally didn't like either.  Favorites would be the mackerel and the super white.  Oh so delicious.    They have a huge appetizer menu as well.  For appetizers be sure to get a couple orders of the baked green mussels.  They add a little extra spiciness to theirs that make them so tasty.  If I remember correctly (from past visits) the rolls are pretty decent sized aren't heavy handed on the rice.  I like how they don't try to stuff you up with extra rice on rolls or even the nigirizushi.  They truly allow you an all you can eat experience.  Nothing ends a meal like a great dessert (again a decent size for an AYCE).  Only one per person, and you can't mix and match so, be sure to get the 808 special and the green tea ice cream.  Then you can have the 808 special with green tea ice cream!  Can't have a trip to Vegas anymore without stopping by here at least once.  Thanks Island Sushi for the wonderful food and hospitality!"}
{"text":"Island Sushi was AMAZING! We wanted good sushi but were staying at the Strip. We took a Lyft to this place, about 20 min away from the strip, and let me to you - it was well worth it! The all you can eat selection and variety was everything we were looking for. Great customer service and I loved that we did not have to order full rolls, we could get half rolls. This was great as we were able to try more things. The AYCE option is great even for non-sushi lovers as they have great variety of other options. Will definitely come here next time I am in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The place was packed, but we instantly got a seat at the bar. The ayce is around $26 for dinner. There were a million rules that reminded me of catholic boarding school in Essex when I was a wee lad. But none of them scared us off. Usual crap: eat all the rolls. Eat the rice. Don't stay for more than 2 hours. One dessert per person.  The food: bomb. Quick. Not overly large rolls. The sushi chefs were nice and helpful. The specialty rolls were creative. Some new pairings I haven't seen before. The nigiri wasn't stingy on the fish. We had hamachi and salmon. Both were tender, fresh, and meaty.  One thing that was awesome about this place is that after 4 full rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri, the people were shocked we were ordering dessert. They wanted us to eat more. That says something about the service. They weren't trying to get us the fock out.   All in all, good place. The ayce for what we eat is probably what we would spend a-la-carte, but whatever.  Just remember, eat your rice. ;)"}
{"text":"Saw a review from a yelp user and decided to try this place out. Definitely worth going too. Had the Kalbi combo. Think cuts of beef with rice and macaroni salad. Will be back again to try a few more items on the menu. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you go here, either go with an empty stomach or go and order one of their delicious rolls. The AYCE here is well worth it. Much more worth it than other places I've been to considering most of the items can be ordered. You want tempura? Get it. You want fish egg rolls? Get some more!  This place is definitely one of my favorites for vegas. The wait staff is friendly and they try to accommodate as best they can. We had a group of over 10 people and we still got a table on a busy night.  To top the deal off, get the AYCE and then check in here on yelp. You get AYCDrink Sake for cheap!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed, the take out for sushi had such a small portion size, rolls are very small, specialty rolls tasted regular nothing special about them."}
{"text":"Garlic chicken, teriyaki chicken, crunch roll perfect combination. Garlic chicken is the bomb. Wonderful service even reminded me of the happy hour deal. Relaxing atmosphere...I hope we have this in Northern California"}
{"text":"As Guy Fieri might say, this place is a Feast of Flavor. The first time I came here I had the Japanese breakfast (grilled mackerel, 2 eggs, miso soup, green tea). This time, my two Hawaiian friends took Eric R. and I and another friend to the Hawaiian brunch! It is all you can eat pupus (appetizers) and desserts for $17.95, add $3 for AYCE sushi! We tried so many things.  We definitely loved the salmon lover roll.  Handrolls were okay (spider roll was overfried and came with krab which it wasn't supposed to but skipped kaiware and gobo which it was supposed to).  Nigiri was tiny but it is probably okay for AYCE since we could try more.  Saba wasn't my fave and that is usually my test of sushi quality. For pupus we had so many things - eggplant \"fries\" with spicy miso, fried tofu, crispy rice cake with spicy tuna and avocado, strawberry salad, cold green tea soba, grilled ahi belly and green onions, ginger chicken lettuce wrap, kimchi fried rice, ahi poke, raw crab poke, Hawaiian sweet roll French toast, and so many other things I can't remember.  Desserts: 808 special (tempura banana, ice cream, strawberries), blueberry tiramisu, warm mango mochi and coconut ice cream....the list goes on. I had iced green tea which was very good.  Service was decent considering the amount of groups and ordering tons of things.  They were hard to find sometimes to refill drinks but otherwise very pleasant.  This was an indulgence but a good deal for brunch.  It says 90 min time limit but we were there for 2.5 hours :)"}
{"text":"LOVE Island Sushi!! It will turn you Japanese. You have to get AYCE. Price comparable to everywhere else ($22 lunch/$27 dinner) but food way better. Have to try the Island Special roll. Get 2. My fav thing about this place is the side dishes. Love the strawberry salad which has goat cheese and wonton crisps. The ahi poke is the best. Chicken lovers should try the chicken katsu and mochiko chicken. More must-try's: kimchee fried rice and pickled daikon & spicy tuna - so good!! Get the 808 Special for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I had the bento combo with fried noodles, furikake rice, mochiko chicken and teri beef. The teri beef was flavorful and the mochiko chicken was delish. Mochiko chicken is usually hit or miss at places because a lot of places tend to over cook it. Here is was perfect. Definitely will repeat."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile.. now I remember why.... Food and service is heading south. ."}
{"text":"If there is a place to get good sushi that doesn't cost an arm and a leg this is the place! The staff is on point and the food is even better! I have never had a bad experience. The wait time during the week almost doesn't exist, on weekends, however, you may have to wait 20-30 min. If you haven't been and would like to find a new sushi place I highly recommend this option!"}
{"text":"Most AMAZING Sunday brunch all-you-can-eat menu.  The menu items change weekly and never cease to amaze me with creative fusions.  Go hungry!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here, had no idea about AYCE sunday brunch.   Service was great, no problem here.  Sushi was awesome, we got a bunch. I think the tempura deep fried cali roll was delicious.  On the brunch menu, we got strawberry pancake, french toast, chicken adobo fried rice with egg, mini peanut butter malasadas, peach cobbler pie. and all were excellent.  We will be back maybe this weekend when family is in town."}
{"text":"Sushi lovers dream come true!! This place is so good and it's AYCE! WINNING! The food here is fresh, good quality and so flavorful! They have a lot of options on the menu with unique-- but good rolls. My favorite rolls are the rainbow, makaha, baked salmon and black widow. Hawaiian food options such as chicken katsu and garlic chicken. Plus appetizers are all you can eat too!! Bring on the shrimp tempura! If you're not hungry enough for AYCE there's different hours depending on the day that's half off sushi rolls which is also a great option, you just need to call in and figure out the times. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is sensational and the staff is very friendly. One of my favorite sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the worst service I've ever experienced. The only reason I've gone here is for my husband and each time I decide to give it another chance and they continue to disappoint with horrible service and wait time for food has always been over an hour."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Their rolls are half price on Mondays and Tuesdays, so it would be a great sushi lunch option. Unfortunately, the sushi I experienced was incredibly disappointing.  I ordered an Unagi Roll, a Spider Roll, and their Ahi Fever Roll. I started with the Unagi. It was OK in flavor, but it was very loosely put together to the point of falling apart. It's really not a big deal, but it does detract from the sushi experience. I then moved on to the Spider Roll. This was the roll that made me question this place. It was flavorless and the soft-shell crab was slightly burnt. After making it through that roll, I finally got to the Ahi Fever. Thankfully, this roll was actually pretty good. I'm glad I saved it for last.  My rating for this place would actually be 2.5 stars. I've definitely experienced better, but I would probably return anyway simply because of the prices."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to visit this amazing sushi bar. My family loved it..  ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!!!! Great tasting sushi and poki.loved it"}
{"text":"This place has no ALOHA!! Employees are straight up rude. Attitudes are mostly from the females at the register, I mean first impression is everything for your business why give your customers attitude or rush them just because you got a long line .. Plus food came out cold and girl at register didn't mention that brown rice was an extra charge. Yes my chicken was cold yet the girl said its cause the sauce was cold, really? The inside of the chicken was cold and I sent it back, the same girl at register then yanked the plate from my table with attitude and stormed off... Oh it's my fault that my food was cold!?? I'm never eating here again and I'll make sure to spread the word to all my friends and family about this place"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some serious comfort food after a stressful week at work, which in my case means hawaiian grinds and sushi. Island sushi has amazing choices from both worlds, so I couldn't have been more excited... Except when the website said they DELIVER! What in the world, I don't even have to get off my exhausted okole to get Kalua Pig & Cabbage, Spam Musubi, an Ahi Poke Roll, and some crazy LEGIT Oxtail Soup?   The heavens opened up on my front door when the delivery driver showed up twenty minutes early from the quoted delivery time with some of the most incredible comfort food I've ever dreamt of eating from my couch. Thumbs (and pinky) way up Island Sushi. Thank you for making my Friday night a relaxing and delicious one."}
{"text":"Why was my visit here so horrible? The first time I came here the food was ehhhh alright, but tonight was just not good. Being from Hawaii you'd expect any place serving Hawaiian food with \"Island\" in it's name to have the flavor & service that reflects Hawaii. My family & I had all you can eat sushi here. Everything was fine until the end... When we're done eating we had some leftovers, we eat all you can eat sushi many times & understand how you may be fined if you leave leftovers. Our main server mentioned that we'd be charged for the leftovers. That was fine. She came back & told us a managers gona have to count each roll leftover. We were fine but getting impatient. Then ANOTHER server came to tell us that we'd be charged for the leftovers...OKAY Then to top it off she says, \"I know you guys are full but can you just eat the rest on that plate & we wont charge you for that one\" SERIOUSLY? Don't tell us what to eat especially if you know that we're full. But it doesn't end here folks. We split the bill in a certain way, the server ends up mixing the cards up & charging the wrong card to the wrong bill. We let her know its wrong. Instead of switching the cards to the correct bill. She halves the entire bill amongst the two cards. NOT how we wanted it in the first place. We were so irritated & frustrated with the service of this place we just left. The food can always be compromised by service but in this case it was both bad."}
{"text":"Recently I have been an adventurous eater set out to explore the Hawaiian restaurants in the ninth island of Las Vegas. It all started with a few visits to L&L Barbecue that got me hooked on the Hawaiian plate lunch. On a couple of recent weekends, my adventures in dining led me to Island Sushi and Grill.      Island Sushi and Grill is located along the thriving Eastern Avenue Corridor south of Interstate 215 between the signalized Serene and Richmar intersections on the east side. It is in a small shopping center that doesn't draw much attention to the business. The first impression of Island Sushi and Grill from the outside is that it is a fancy sushi restaurant. It is a false impression because inside Island Sushi and Grill is a diverse dining experience.      Island Sushi and Grill is really two different restaurants that are divided into two rooms. The first room when you enter is a Hawaiin restaurant with pastries and take out sushi. There are a few long tables and two counters. The counter close to the door is where you order the Hawaiin food. The counter toward the back by the condiments and beverage machine is the sushi counter. The room to the right is a full service restaurant offering sushi and other entrees. In summary Island Sushi and Grill is a restaurant specializing in two areas of food: sushi and Hawaiin food. Pertaining to my experiences I experienced the plate lunch dinners on my two visits prior to penning this review/reporting of experiences.      On visit number one, I exchanged around $10 for a garlic chicken plate lunch with fountain beverage then a week later on visit number two, I exchanged around $10 on a chicken with eggplant plate lunch with fountain beverage. Being that they are plate lunches they included white rice and macaroni salad. The food was served in a styrofoam box that I brought to the table after they called my order. On both visits the chicken met my expectations. For safe measure, I added schirachi sauce to it just as I added soy sauce to the rice. L&L has far better macaroni salad and Ross J's  Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue serves far larger portions. This is the first restaurant that my food adventures led me that offered chicken with eggplant. It seemed to be chicken over eggplant with a lot of white rice around it and a little cup of macaroni salad nearby.      Being an adventurous eater, I foresee many more restaurants to explore. Before I set sail for further dining adventures, my report on dining two times in Island Sushi and Grill is that it is a three star  experience."}
{"text":"Great sushi and service! They have great happy hour specials but make sure to call cause it's different per days."}
{"text":"Love this place ,As soon as I got Off the plane from Honolulu to Las Vegas ,my nephew comes & picks me Up & he drove to the strip to my hotel where I was staying at the Venetian & my daughter was there & She came with Us as well where my nephew drove toward his home In Henderson & ask Us If we like go eat Island Sushi & we were So happy my daughter had the fried ahi,I had the roast pork w/gravy & my nephew had the Kalua pig & cabbage , We Just ate It all because the food was very tasty & very good."}
{"text":"Another place checked off my list ! Glad they open early and was able to grab breakfast on our way back to LA.   I had the Polish Sausage and not too much to say about it. Plate came with 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of sweet bread and 2 eggs of choice. I felt that rice to meat ratio was off. SOOO much rice, which may be good for some but just felt that there wasn't enough sausage.   Everything served on styro containers which makes it easy to To-Go any left overs. No one else was dining at the time we were there (Sunday morning at 9am) but there were few people who came in for pick up and even more at the Poke counter.   What I would really like to RAVE about is the MALASADAS. I ordered the dozen (about $15) 6 plain, 2 custard filled, 2 choco filled and 2 haupia filled. I noticed they were pulled from a box stamped with there logo so I'm hoping this is there recipe and creation. I would die if I ever came and was told there were no more, waahhhhh ! Employee pulled out a large tub of custard and injected the plain ones.   They were so delicious, I'm tempted to type the rest of this review in all CAPS. They were moist, chewy, fluffy and soft. After bringing them home and being kept in the fridge, we would nuke em' in the micro for 30 seconds and they were just HEAVEN. Not tough or rubbery at all. Knowing this has encouraged me to take home at least 2 dozen next time.   Though the dishes didn't make my mouth water, I'll be back for some Poke and A LOT more Malasadas!"}
{"text":"I never get tired of coming to this place! If I'm in the mood for a sushi night then I stop here. If I'm in the mood for a good Hawaiian breakfast then I stop here. What?!?! Lunch time?!?! Ok then let's stop here. The sushi is amazing plus they have a happy hour. The breakfast is everything you can possibly want! Do you want a poke bowl? Yes then get lunch here. Oh did I forget to mention they have dessert!!! Im here today currently for one of my sushi nights and this place was packed! Even though it was packed our amazing server MATTq took great care of us and gave some of the best customer service I have ever received in a restaurant. I hope he gets credit for this because he deserves it."}
{"text":"Looking at all the good review of this place, I have a high expectation. Unfortunately, It's not as good as I expected.  Price is good, Monday-Tuesday 50 percent off for all the rolls, dine in only. They have breakfast and get 20 percent off from 7 am to 10 am Wednesday night, AYCE pay lunch price and get dinner value.  Quick summary of what I had:  Fried Tako and Octopus - overcook, taste a little bitter, it's been in the deep fryer too long.  Tuna poke - lots of tuna, very simple dish, pretty much tuna sashimi mix with seaweed salad. Nothing special  Kimchee tako, nothing special. Tako mix with kimchee..  Baked mussel. a little citrus flavor mix with spicy mayo baked. Not so special either...  Lomi Salmon, go get a salsa and mix it with salmon and salt. Not my favorite, can't finish it.  Miso soup, not good...  Sushi rolls looks not great, some rolls can't hold the shape, some okay. I will leave that to \"depends on the chef\".  Most rolls is okay, only 1 that I think is good. Island special roll. Other than that, just so so or not good.  Freshness, average 2-3 stars. Uni is the only one I think is okay.  Ama ebi not fresh, color has changed, Deep fried head, not crispy enough, if it's not crispy enough, it's hard to enjoy the head.   Beef teriyaki, better than expected. thin slice beef, tender with a little fat, almost like korean style beef barbeque.  Hamachi Kama, okay. Not too dry, a little crispy outside, pretty good.  Dessert is pretty good, creme brulee, 808 special (fried banana w ice cream), tempura ice cream.   Service is pretty good, considering on how busy it was, they did pretty good job, refilling the drinks. Although, they don't remember which sushi goes to which person, they almost don't care actually. They should care a little bit if they want to have a 5 star service.  If this is a regular sushi restaurant, only deserve 2 stars, but considering how busy they were and an all you can eat restaurant, 3 stars sounds like a better fit.  Will i be back? No... sorry."}
{"text":"Great place to get sushi on this side of town. Servings of the raw fish in rolls and nigiri dishes are above average size. The flavor is amazing. The tiger roll is amazing because the spicy tuna doesn't over power  the other ingredients like most places do. Def recommended."}
{"text":"Thought they had fresh food. I guess not. Don't ever come here! Got a really bad stomach ache from eating their food"}
{"text":"So there used to be a sign up front that says poke express? But it's not there anymore. My friend said they're under new management now so I'm guessing that's the reason. It's all just under island sushi & grill.   When you come in, there's a counter for the Hawaiian a la carte food. Up ahead is the poke station. The room to the right is for AYCE sushi. I usually get the poke & it's the best in the valley, in my opinion. I get a fourth or half a pound of the spicy ahi with a side of rice with furikake. Soooo yums!! Their garlic chicken and spicy tuna bowl are fricken good too.   Before my recent visit, I haven't been since like maybe a year? Or 6 months? I'm not really sure. But seems like the people behind the poke station are a bit slower pace. The guy saw me standing there waiting to for someone to take my order but he just kept talking to his coworker... ??? Yeah, it was kinda off putting. Anyway, their food is great so I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here more times than I can count and any time I'm craving sushi and treats from \"home\" (Hawaii), this is where I head. The prices are standard for AYCE ($21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner) and well worth it. You have many choices of appetizers/sides and my favorites are the ahi poke (from Poke Express), mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, sashimi salad, and kimchee fried rice. Good stuff. I like to order the hand rolls with hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon). Fresh and delicious. My favorite specialty rolls are the Black Widow, Dragon, Island Special, Tiger, Kahuku, and Pauhana.  We celebrated my dad's birthday there last May and it was also Mother's Day so we participated in the AYCE Sushi plus Sunday brunch. The special menu featured breakfast favorites like pancakes and mimosas. There were also additional desserts that were unlimited like cream puffs and filled malasadas (they were both so, so good). I thought it was just for the holiday, but I saw a similar menu during another visit, so it may be a Sunday Brunch thing. Either way, I recommend a visit with the special menu because it made the meal so much better."}
{"text":"I like this place. Although I prefer Sushi Twister or Yama Sushi, this is a good change of pace. Waitress was very friendly and food was good and fresh. I was perturbed by the slower service especially since we came on a Weds at 8pm. It was quite empty yet the food took it's sweet time to mosey on over to our table. The price is decent and the selection is average. If I want something quick and close by, this is a good bet.   The salmon was fresh and the sashimi salad was really good! Those two things stood out in my mind.   I might be back, however; in Vegas, the competition for SUSHI AYCE CROWN is definitely tough and I feel Island Sushi has some work to do."}
{"text":"How is this 11.75?! Super thin cuts that dont even add up to 1 regular sashimi size at other restaurants. Pretty greedy."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never left a review before!  I've been here for many than my check-ins have would indicate.  I've never eaten the sushi.  I usually dine on the grill side.   This is BY FAR the best Hawaiian food I've eaten in Las Vegas.  Most places I've been have been similar by and large, but this place excels.  I'll comment on my favorite dish: Kalbi  Kalbi is basically the same thing as Korean-style short ribs.  The meat is tender and is flavor-packed with each bite.  I could eat two portions without blinking an eye and I can't really eat a lot of red meat.    My other favorite thing that I crave is their macaroni salad.  The macaroni salads I get at most Hawaiian places are usually very similar and for the most part a little too mayonnaisy for me... good, but mayonnaisy.    The macaroni salad here is PERFECT.  First off, it's like a mix between potato salad and macaroni salad and not oozing mayo.    Now that I'm back in this area I will be going a lot more.  UPDATE:  This time I tried the Classic Loco Moco and it was by far the best Loco Moco I've ever eaten.  The hamburger steak you can tell was made in-house and was absolutely delicious and super tasty gravy."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed. I had the chicken cutlet and my husband had the cutlet curry. I've been away from home (Hawaii) for 7 years and was really looking forward to some good local food but it's definitely lacking. The coco puffs are absolutely terrible! Dry, and the chantilly frosting tastes nothing like chantilly. I do want to try the sushi side and the poke though, I'm still hopeful based on the reviews and pictures but I won't eat from the grill again."}
{"text":"I just found out about this restaurant about a week ago and I've already been there 3 times!  I obviously really enjoyed it!  The first time my boyfriend and i sat at the sushi bar for late night happy hour which is from 9-close.  Half priced rolls and 1.50 for beers! Even imports like sapporo. My Favorite roll that i had to go back for was the alaskan roll. They put ikura on top which is a delicious twist.  So we ordered 4 rolls and my boyfriend had a beer and our bill was $20.  unbeatable price.  The sushi is good, and even really good for a local joint,  but i give it four stars b/c quality wise, it cant compete with places like nobu. The second time we tried out the grill part of the restaurant.  We ordered the saimen combo with garlic chicken and loco moco.  The loco moco was awesome.  The saimen, was so so, i've had a lot better.  The garlic chicken was also delicious.   The 3rd time we went back for the sushi happy hour and it was great.  We started with the tuna poke and miso soup, both very good.  Four sushi rolls and 3 beers.  The bill was thirty something dollars.   We will definitely go back if we are craving affordable sushi and dont feel like driving to the strip, but its not the best quality of sushi."}
{"text":"Thank you Terry for your response and concern. I ended up waiting 35 min. And I only got my food because I went back up to the counter to see what the delay was. Then and only then did the cashier look through the orders he had sitting there waiting and find mine. Unfortunately by the time I got home my food was cold."}
{"text":"I just ordered today and had my food delivered through the Grub Hub app and the food was just ok. Nothing special that would make me want to order from them again. The Sushi wasn't bad but it wasn't good either and the Spam Musubi rolls were good but they're hard to mess up. Overall I wasn't impressed enough with the food to order again."}
{"text":"I usually stop in for poke but decided to grab some sushi for lunch instead.   Place was pretty empty, now I know why.  Scallops were overcooked and a bit rubbery. Very light on the eel sauce. Tempura was cold, definitely not fresh.   Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I Love Island Sushi! Found it on Yelp while in Vegas. Ate there every night! There is a 50% off roll nite and an all you can eat that is soooo good. (not a buffet, just all you can order. EVERYTHING on the menu!!)"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to stop before heading back to Arizona. You can call me \"Fat gurl status\" when I am here because \"Yes, I order everything that I want to eat within the 24-48hrs of all my local kine grinds that I cannot get in Arizona. I mean granted their are a very little handful of places to get my local foods but, this is still my favorite place to stock up before making the road trip back. Some of our favorites are Fried Saimin, variety of our Hawaiian poke - i love their spicy ahi combo and also their Tako wasabi, they also make their homemade Taro chips - sometimes I wish they sold it in bigger bags or zip loc bags but, its soo ono! Their custard pie is also really good and actually better than Zippys and cheaper! Lol - go figure!  I can keep going on and on about this place! Lol - but, you sorta get the picture! One day, Ill have to try their dine in restaurant because it always seem to be really busy and lots of local people/residence of LV either have reservations or are standing in line just to go eat in here!"}
{"text":"the service was good. the sushi was ok, the rice fell apart when i picked it up. the fish tasted fresh and they had a spicy roll which i loved. it was spicy crunchy! with sriracha, green pepper, crunchies and shrimp tempura. we also tried the deep fried chicken from the other room. that was super delish. and i had dessert of course. dabash cake which was chocolate on chocolate. the dessert was made at their bakery and made up for the rice. it's a family restaurant and so it was loud. they also offered half off rolls!"}
{"text":"Awesome Hawaiian Plate Lunches and Poke Bar, prices are very reasonable and the tastes are definately Island Style."}
{"text":"My first time walking in the door, I thought this is the place my husband brought me to? A hole in the wall? Really.  We got seated after 5 minutes of standing there, to the right through the shower curtain doors there was a hole in the wall sit down area. The little plates that they put on the table are cute but the little bowl for the soy sauce isn't even big enough to dip a piece of sushi.  Then when you finally figure it out the soy sauce didn't even taste like soy sauce. So I asked for kikkoman soy sauce and three different waitresses passed us by never bringing the kikkoman. We had to ask 3 different waitresses to finally get the soy sauce. So I sat and watched our waitress flirt and laugh with the other table as I was patiently waiting to get some soy sauce to eat my sushi. Wow. To top it off she left a table of 5 people (us) with a tiny dish of ginger and wasabi.... not nearly enough. When we were ready to leave we had to ask for our check and Togo box and wait... All the while another waitress acknowledges us and tells us that if we want to take our 8 pieces of sushi that we had left she was going to charge us full price (we came during happy hour). Wow. Never again, I'll take my business elsewhere, thanks but no thanks.... it didn't even taste all that great. I would rather drive 10 minutes to Samurai sushi, for half price all day long, then ever step foot in that hell hole again."}
{"text":"all u can eat................explains itself. typical options..i do like it a lot you can pay the dinner price at lunch to get the \"extra\" options poke deli bar is separate from the small dining area. that seems to be the best stuff. the price reflects it also. thee 'ol get what you pay for. worth it!!! yummy yummy poke!!! service was slightly below average & parking stinks!!"}
{"text":"Love the Ahi & Avocado Poke Bowl! Takes me back to Hawaii. So good."}
{"text":"super friendly staff on both sides of the place. the food is awesome. they have fresh malasadas (on the diner side) that you can order with fillings if you want. (talking about it right now is making my mouth water) but you have to go early because sometimes they run out. the bentos, the garlic chicken and the breakfast plates is what we usually get if we make take-out. if we dine in we usually eat on the sushi restaurant side and have a few drinks with our dinner. a great place to go to get food to close to home."}
{"text":"This place went beyond any of my expectations.  I was expecting more of the same tacky, tasteless, and Hawaiian food imitations as done by many restaurants on the continental United States.  This place was much better.  The poke was fresh and was the type I would expect from a poke shop back in Hawaii and the garlic fried chicken was not the best I heave ever had (that spot is reserved for Mitsuken) it is a nice taste of Hawaii.    Whenever I am in Vegas this will be a stop for fresh and delicious food that will remind me of the islands."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place! They are so welcoming and delicious! My favorite rolls are the island and the big island! Plus poke express is inside of here! :)"}
{"text":"Great spot, used to work with owners daughter years back and Stephanie convinced us all to go.  Worth it! My out of town Hawaiian fam even says it's legit. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"It's been several years from my initial review and I've become obsessed with this place. Every trip to Las Vegas I try to stop by Island Sushi. The key is to go late at night so that parking and getting a table is pretty easy.   I love the ayce offerings. Its pretty much everything on the menu, including the daily specials. The only items it doesn't allow is sashimi. You can get soups, salads, appetizers, sushi rolls, entrees, and desserts. There is no way you can leave here hungry!  My favorite items are the garlic edamame, 007, and mona loa. Today they also had an apple cobbler for dessert which was fantastic!   The service is always wonderful and you can tell they genuinely want to see you satisfied and happy. Definitely recommend checking this place out...YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!"}
{"text":"Island has friendly workers and good food. There is hardly ever a wait. Their uni is delicious. There is also plenty of variety on the menu so that even non sushi eaters can fill their guts."}
{"text":"Chewy is on of the best sushi chefs in this city. Try any runs or yellow tail. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Great Poke, great selections and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"this place is definitely a favorite!!!  i like that they have a \"local foods\" (fast food) side and a \"sushi side\" (full service). the fast food side serves the regular island style fast food (my favorites - roast pork, garlic ahi, garlic noodles, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken and loco moco) and the  mend the weekend brunch) and bentos and combination plates, and alcohol of course. their bento boxes are a great deal! soup, salad, edamame, cali roll, and your choice of side items (i normally get a 3 item bento box with hamachi sashimi, mochiko chicken and salmon teri and if i remember right its only $17) and you get dessert!!! (i recommend the malasada sundae or the 808 special. both reeeeally good!!!  we went in on superbowl sunday for their AYCE. we caught it just in time for brunch, and their selection was perfect! its different every week, but we were lucky to try their ribs. soooo good!!! i like that they include AYCE desserts too. green tea tiramisu and creme brulee are favorites!!!  island sushi has tons of bakery items, as well as poke express, where they sell many different kinds of poke by weight, and make them to order.  now that im not on that side of town, i crave their food all the time. i try to come back as often as i can though!   i almost forgot - service is great! everyone is very nice and theyre really attentive to their guests, more so on the sushi side. probably best service i've had for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Spectacular!  I recently just visited Island Sushi for the second time and it was fantastic. The environment is really nice, I especially like it for lunch. I like to practice Veganism as often as possible and this time I ordered an avocado roll and asked to add mushrooms, and also the miso soup. It was such a delicious meal!  In the past I've had the avocado poke bowl which I 1000% recommend to my fish-eating friends out there.   This is truly just quality sushi and service. Fresh rice and fish! You can't go wrong.  instagram: @glowrae"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. It's our first time here and I wanted to rate it 5 stars because the food was good but the server ruined the whole experience. Cashier/server Shyra just dropped the food on our table and left in a rush after we waited for a long time. Then I wanted to try something from their bakery so I asked her what she would recommend. And she replied,\"Oh, I don't eat the pastries here\" Then I finally bought the custard pie and asked her if she could slice it and also give me some plates so I could eat it. She took the box, left it on the counter, and totally ignored me. After standing there for a long time, I decided to call the manager who then sliced the pie but I was so pissed that I just took the pie home. Please tell me you're gonna do something about your employee Shyra. She was very rude and need to have some manners."}
{"text":"bad service....takes too long to take customer's orders...the lady in front is way too busy taking phone orders, delivering food on the table and preparing food....."}
{"text":"Food was amazing felt like I was right at home eating on Oahu. Service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Great place to get a Hawaiian fix. They have all the favorites even Haupui, Dobosh cake, Poke.  I tried the Poke and it was very good. The Yakisoba was OK, wonton Ramen was delicious, and kimchi ramen was good too, but just a tad too spicy for my taste. Also tried the loco moco it was good, but not the best I've had. Have to go back to try the Oxtail soup after 6:00pm."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have good poke again!!!  So this will be an initial review because the only item we got here was the poke.  Location 5/5: So the 5 rating is if you live in the south part of the valley. It's also very easily accessible, right off the 215 on eastern, you'll head south on eastern and its about a quarter mile to the left behind Taco y Taco, and Smashburger.  Da Local 4/5: its a little bit confusing when you go inside, there is a sushi bar to the right, then the entrees as soon as you come in to the left, and finally the poke all the way in the back.  Customer Service 2/5: Even though I'm a Hapa Haole I didn't feel any of the love when walking in, the employees inside didn't greet us. While my wife and I were standing in front of the cashier trying to figure out where the poke bowls where at, non of the employees behind the counter tried to help us out. There were two guys standing behind the counter yet not a single one greeted us or offered his assistance.  Now when we figured out the poke stand was in the back, the lady there was very helpful and did an excellent job, because of her they get a 2/5.  Da Poke 5/5: Da poke was on point I got the spicy poke and it tasted da bomb, flavor so good it broke da mouth!!! My wife got the spicy tuna avocado, hers was just as good! the Flavor brought me right back to the islands. Something to mention about their poke which is very important is that their poke comes from POKE EXPRESS, located in North Vegas, Uncle makes the best Poke in the valley and its great that his poke make it all the way over here.   PS: the presentation of the poke stand took me back to Tamuras.  Da Rice 3/5: it was alright nothing too yummy nothing too bad just alright, I wish they made sushi rice but hey now we know.  Da Price 5/5: In Oahu, if you go to tamuras a pound of spicy tuna poke is $15:99, here at this mainland establishment it's the same price! This made me so happy because the prices where the SAME!!! I was expecting this type of poke in the valley to be more expensive.  Overall go to this place if you live in the south part of the valley. My advice is to bring your own rice, Teri sauce, and crunch, then buy half a pound of poke and poke salad...now you have created your own poke bowl which will be the bomb as long as you know how to make bomb ass rice.   If your looking for a really nice establishment but are not brown don't expect nice service here, you know what don't even expect them employees to even look at you. There is no Aloha here and that breaks my heart. Next time I go will be just to get the poke and then get go eat at home."}
{"text":"I just want to thank island Sushi for the excellent service that they provided especially Tasia ( I think her name was). She recommended the Teri beef and ahi poke both were delicious. I'll definitely be back due to the outstanding quality of service and food. Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"All I can say Thanks for that amazing Aloha service and you guys make the Hawaii away from Hawaii. Please keep up the Aloha . Food is always great."}
{"text":"First time eating sushi here!  Delicious plus it was happy hour! Cannot beat that!  Loved the crunch roll and the black widow.  I should have ordered some poke and their amazing spicy garlic edamame! But I was too stuffed off the sushi! The staff is always pleasant and quick! This is our new sushi and poke spot! Num num num"}
{"text":"The food was good, customer service not so much. We didn't mind waiting 30 minutes to be seated but did not expect that when we were seated, the service would be lacking. As an establishment carrying the word \"island,\" I was expecting island style service. This was not the case. There was no welcoming \"aloha\" or \"hafa Adai\" spirit. We were seated..got our drinks with no straws. No one asked if we needed utensils. I had to flag down different servers to repeatedly ask for sauce. When the sauce finally came out, I was almost done with my meal."}
{"text":"Island Sushi is part sit-down restaurant and part pick-up window style dining... So don't let it scare you off if you are greeted with a packed room upon opening the front door...  The pick up window section has standard Hawaiian plate lunches and a good selection of poke. The dine-in restaurant side of Island Sushi is small... Maybe 10 or so tables and a sushi bar.  Recently, we went on a Sunday for brunch. In addition to the standard AYCE lunch menu, they also included a special menu with items such as guava french toast, raw crab poke, & salmon skin salad. They even had bottomless mimosas for $7. The sushi was good and food came out fast. I would only wish that my mimosa would have been refilled faster but, all in all, I enjoyed brunch...!  FYI, there is a new poke place coming in the next center... I wonder how it will measure up to Island Sushi?"}
{"text":"Malasadas I must say are outstanding!!  Hot and fresh and filling is a very generous portion and leaves you craving for more! Definitely a must try!  The sushi is amazing there too! Plus you get the option of going to grill and just getting plate lunches or the poke place if you are not in the mood for sushi. 3 restaurants in one place. Everyone is happy! Definitely on my go to places!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible! I really care about the service I receive and this place is cheap. I work at a near by hospital and many of my co-workers stop by weekly but last night will be the last. I placed a pick up order and asked for 3 small plates. I was told I had to pay .15 a plate, lol. And I was not given any napkins or eating utensils. Makes me wonder about the real quality of food."}
{"text":"Just to sum it all up, GREAT FOOD! Very friendly staff! And great choices! I'm not from hawaii, but I love love love loooove island food, especially Island Sushi!"}
{"text":"As a real sushi aficionado, I have to review this from the standpoint of sushi basics, and not the rolls and flavors that they have like most All you can eat sushi places.    1.  Service - Not bad, not memorable, but I would say pleasant or neutral. 2.  Pricing -All you can eat is not bad at all, but they do limit some of the more expensive items like uni. 3.  Recommend- if you have kids under 10, go for the all you can eat. The appetizers have so many of the teriyaki chicken, beef and basics that kids will like and you do not have to order real sushi for them. 4.  Try the hawaiian grill items in the cafe next door. Great stuff. 5.  Overall - not a bad place. the authentic basic sushi's are great tasting."}
{"text":"Surprisingly fresh and delicious!  Who knew you could get good, fresh sushi in Henderson?  They have an all-you-can eat selection for only $27.  We left happy, full and content.  Will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Their salmon skin bowl is good! Although the portion of salmon skin they give you is not enough for the amount of rice, overall it was good! I would eat here again when I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, not expecting much from the Hawaiian Sushi joint, but it turned out just a half a step better than what i expected.  The sushi was comparable to other AYCE Sushi bars, except their sushi left a slight \"fishy\" taste.  But who am i to complain?.. it's sushi.  What did separate Island from the game was their Sunday Special AYCE \"Pupus\", which I am guessing the Hawaiian version of a tapa.  From French Toast Malasadas to Mahi Mahi Sliders with Wasabi Aioli, the Pupus is what made my 20 bucks worth spending.  If I ever make second rounds, it'll only be for the Mini Peanut Butter Malasadas.  Other than that, I'll probably only come back when I'm in the mood for french toast and raw fish."}
{"text":"Recently all the new cashiers have sucky attitudes, don't feel comfortable ordering take out here any more.  I almost feel like when I run in to just get a quick take out, they expect a tip, and if you don't the attitude comes out, will stop coming here for sure"}
{"text":"Dined at this establishment without a reservation. It was busy! Made a mental note to myself to make a reservation for next time. Food was excellent! I am definitely coming back!  I had the Teishoku Dinner- comes with two entrees, salad, edamame, miso soup, rice, salad, and dessert; a lot of food for only $14! Wait was about 15 minutes, but worth it. Lots of attentive servers, friendly and prompt. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.  We had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99/pp.)    When you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.  After being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.    Appetizers:  * Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty! * Ahi Poki - Pretty good! * Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff! * Edamame * Garlic Chicken * Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person) * Pork Gyoza * Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person) * Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)  Nigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it. * Albacore * Amaebi (limit one order per person) * Garlic Tuna * Hamachi  * Hirame * Ika * Ikura * Saba * Sake * Scallop Mayo * Tai * Uni (limit one order per person)  Things we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.  Everyone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.  I wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.  They are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.     You are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.  Service was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.  They also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.  What makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.    Happy Hour: 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials Mondays to Saturdays: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 9:00 PM - Close Sunday: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 8:00 PM - Close  Ladies' Night: Drink Specials Only Wednesdays: 3:00 PM - Close  Drink Specials:  $3.00 Large Beer $2.25 Hot Sake $4.00 Saketini $1.50 Small Beer $2.00 Sake Bomb  Sushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch: AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95 Sundays: 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM"}
{"text":"I used to love island sushi but the quality of food and service has slipped so far that I may never go back. The sushi rolls were unrolling and the amount of time for service has taken a long time even when Island isn't packed. I know that ownership has changed and this may be why the whole experience has a cheapened feel to it. I may give it one last chance in the future but if it's the same as it has been then that's that. In the meantime I will be looking for another sushi restaurant with a regular menu and an all you can eat."}
{"text":"Their all you can eat sushi is the best.  Great local sushi.  Great service.  Great price!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite little local place. The value is incredible...very reasonably priced with good portions and the food was great. The server was very attentive. Both rolls that I had were fantastic. The spicy shrimp tempura roll was awesome, as was the Mexican roll with fresh jalapeños on top. The fried rice was also very good. I liked the scrambled egg Patty on the bottom and the two kinds of pork were a nice surprise. Can't wait to go back and try a few new rolls."}
{"text":"Good Food, ok quality Fish, Atmosphere could use some help and they need to clean the establishment better. There was food and sticky things in the menus the table was not that clean. which I found questionable. The  worse part is that they load their sushi with rice I assume to fill you up because the place is ayce. Clean the place up and cut down on the fillers and I would give it 3  or 4 stars, but for now its 2"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this placed earned a solid 3 stars for food and an extra whole star for service- our servers name was Mac.  I ordered the garlic chicken, a caterpillar roll and my boyfriend went with a cheeseburger.   The garlic chicken was crispy and really hit the spot after Long day of work. It's has a light glaze that is semi sweet with a little punch of garlic. The Mac salad was what you'd expect.  The caterpillar sushi roll was good and met my expectations. The fish was fresh and the sushi rice was as it should be.   Not much to say about my boyfriend being boring and ordering a cheeseburger but he cleaned his plate so that must be a good sign haha.   Aside from the good \"grinds \" our server Mac was genuinely friendly and very attentive! Our glass never went empty and though it was clear he was busy he always stopped, made eye contact and attended to us nicely.   Thank you island sushi, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go.  This combines 2 of my favorite things in the world - Sushi and Hawaiian food.  1. AYCE - self explanatory.  So good.  You can get malasadas as part of the AYCE 2. Poke - love their Poke.  Real Hawaiian poke and not a sushi bowl place 3. Ox-Tail Soup - I love their ox-tail soup.  Much better than at Aloha Kitchen  Cons - The wait time can be long and the place is pretty small so during peak times, be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"AYCE Sunday brunch was yummy.  Sushi choices are complemented by appetizers and even breakfast entrees.  Miniature servings so you can try lots of different items.  The sushi rice is nicely seasoned with just the right amount of vinegar.  The mini-loco-moco was really good.  The various types of chicken were only ok.  Creme brulee for dessert was really good - so good that finished it even after all of the other food.  The service was friendly and attentive but beware, the parking lot is too small for busy meal times."}
{"text":"Odd interior, Good food!  Pauhana roll is the business! Its a rainbow roll on crack! Delicious!!!! Very wide selection of AYCE   Best part is, limit is 2 desserts per person :D"}
{"text":"You bet your bottom dollar that whenever I visit a sushi joint, an All-You-Can-Eat is in order.  Today, we came here for lunch and that's just what I did.  The all you can eat was $21.95.  Here's what I got for lunch:  Chicken Katsu- Very good.  Light and crispy, their katsu sauce was sweet and AH-MAZE-ING!  Hamachi (yellow tail) Nigiri- I know it's fish, however, it tasted a lot more fishier than I'm used to.  This makes me think if it was fresh or not...  Ahi poke- I know there's a poke express right next door.  I don't think this poke was made from them.  I didn't think it was very good.  The Ahi seemed to be a little old.  Geso (fried squid legs with a spicy aioli)- This was GOOOODD!  Whenever I order fried calamari, I always enjoy eating the smaller calamari with legs.  This dish was just legs!  YUM-O.  The menu says spicy aioli but it wasn't spicy at all...BUT DELICIOUS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Garlic Chicken- Sweet teriyaki and garlic sauce all over fried boneless chicken thigh pieces.  Sweet, savory and crispy all at the same time.  ON POINT!  Gyoza- Crispy fried pork pot stickers served with a ponzu (sweet/citrus based soy) sauce.  I love the thin, watery consistency of the ponzu.  Goes well with the crispy gyoza.  Malassada sundae- Definitely a MUST TRY!  First they cut the malassada (fried donuts without the hole and dusted with sugar) in four wedges and fan it out in a bowl.  A scoop of ice cream is placed in the center with a whipped cream topping and the dish is finished with a guava sauce and cut strawberries.  Such an AH-MAZE-ING ending!  I do enjoy the fact that Island sushi is separated into two sections.  One section for just the sushi bar and another section for plate lunch/bento/fast food type service and poke express.  These sections are night and day and appeals to all sorts of diners.  If you are looking for a place that exposes you to Hawaiian-local cuisine, this is definitely the place to go to."}
{"text":"The best type of restaurant is where they know your order before you even order. The sushi chefs juan and chuie are awesome and always makes our sushi quick and yummy. My favorite nigiri's are seared garlic salmon, crispy unagi and scallop mayo. Some rolls worth trying is the makaha, maui wow wee and joes special. My favorite part about this ayce is their appetizers. Dishes ranging from baked mussels to kalbi and hamachi kama are all so yummy.  If you become a regular make sure you enroll in their loyalty program. They give your points for every dollar you spend and if when spend $250 you get a $25 credit."}
{"text":"Today we wanted to take a trek to Henderson area to visit a friend. I've been wanting to try this and it's right by their house (lucky them!).   With so many AYCE places, it's hard to pick and choose. Even having tried many, I couldn't really pick a \"best\", but had more of they're all good, but here's the pros and cons of each particular place kind of answer (IE- some have bomb apps but meh sushi, great nigiri but rolls and apps are boring). I'll go on a limb that this is the best that I've had since it meets a lot of points.   First point- appetizers are interesting, and have a wide variety. Sure, sure. Come for nigiri to get \"moneys worth\" but it gets a bit repetitive that way. I think I get my worth through the variety of foods I get to eat.   Ahi Belly with Pepper Garlic- the sauce was light but not overwhelming that you can't taste the fish melty, fatty yumminess or the nice char. Deep Fried Geso- delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus is always a favorite for me. Salmon Lomi- it was just okay. It was more tomatos than anything. Ahi Poke- very nice version. ordered 2! Tako Kimchee- nice thin sliced octopus stirred in with kimchee. Hamachi Kama- I love kama and theirs had such a good char and perfectly crispy skin  Nigiri- the fish was fresh. The plus to me was that they do nigiri smaller than average (dont worry- the rice to fish ratio is very fairly proportional). Now some people might be taken aback since were all used to largesse given in cuts but, the smaller cut is perfectly bite sized and gives the opportunity to sample more variety. Some of these restaurants serve a two bite nigiri and with the BFs braces and jaw he dislikes how he has to bite in half and break it to eat.   Standouts: Escolar/Super White Tuna- pretty good.  Cajun Albacore- very nice seasoning and ponzu sauce Cajun Tuna- this has the seasoning and then has a wasabi aioli which was quite unique and good Yellowtail- this is one of my favorite fish and it was very fresh  All the rest were good too. Only one that was just okay was the mackerel which had a bit of a salty quality to it that isn't the norm.    We also got a special chef creation which was also a highlight of the night- it was a thin slab of rice on nori that was toasted to a crispy cake and topped with spicy chunks of tuna, thin slab of avocado, a dot of siracha, and a sweet sauce- probably eel sauce. It was very nice textures and flavors together.   Rolls- not usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll with different toppings and sauce. Boring. They had some interesting rolls. We tried The Croc which combined a few favorite elements- it has some spice, it has soft shell crab, sweetness from some unagi. Pretty good. I would have gotten more, but between just the two of us, whole rolls is a lot to eat and we wanted variety. Next time when we bring our friends to share with. They don't do half rolls, except on your very last roll you want to order.  I kept getting my favorite handroll though- salmon skin which is lovely here.   Dessert- not just the standard ice cream or mochi, though they do offer that too. They have a malasada sundae, the 808 special and creme brulee. We got the malasada which was yummy and the creme brulee had nice flavors but it wasnt so solid as it should, more runny, but it was still good.   I like that this place can satisfy appetizer people, nigiri people, roll people and even dessert people. It's that reason why I think this is my favorite that we can bring all types of ayce people and their needs can be met. It's $24.95, cheaper by a few bucks than most dinner ayce and I think has better quality than those that hit the $30 mark. They give you 90 minutes which I don't really need, but I just like places where they're not timing you....I think here they realize people like to pace and sometimes, you're just waiting for food since it's all made-to-order stuff.   Did I mention the hospitality? The sushi chef/owner was very attentive, talkative and seems very cool. The staff never even let our ice teas hit halfway and came to check on us a few times to see if we want more appetizers from the kitchen.   Oooh if I lived on this side of town I will come by all the time! Since I don't, we just have to make day trips to Henderson more often!   Onolicious food, Hawaiian hospitality- whats not to love?!    ALOHA!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Postmates. Not a bad wait time.  Food: Regular size Kalbi, Mochiko Chicken & Loco Moco. A lot of food for a good price. The biggest problem we had was that the Loco Moco showed up with scrambled eggs rather than over easy. I have never had to put in a note to ask for over easy eggs for a Loco Moco rather than scrambled, but I guess I will have to next time.   Would maybe go back."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group of friends.  The place was pretty packed - a good sign.  They were able to accommodate for our party quickly.  Service was fine - not fast, but not slow.  The atmosphere is nice and friendly - it has a great casual Hawaiian vibe.  I would say that the bento box prices are slightly higher than other places, but they give you more food than most - so its pretty fair.  We ordered the one of the meals that came with 3 items (we got the fried scallops, the veggie tempura, and beef teriyaki).  The fried scallops were sooo good!  I would come back just for those... they were large and had a great flavor.  The veggie tempura was good (it came with two huge pieces of sweet potato which is my fav kind).  Beef teriyaki was better than most places, but nothing to rave about in my opinion.  We had California rolls and a tuna roll on the side - pretty standard.    For dessert, we got the 808 special.  It's like a banana split, but with fried banana.  LOVED it!  It came with our meal and I was impressed with the size of it considering most of the time meals don't even come with desert!  I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a chill place to have sushi.  We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"My kids and I eat here like... 16 times a month.   I mean.. the poke, salmon skin bowl, extra crispy chicken teriyaki, happy hour sushi rolls, Kalbi ribs, loco moco, eyebrow lady next door.... everything I need down the street! Definitely my \"food\" home away from home.  The only down side here is the mac salad.. not a fan.. but the rest of the menu is delish!!!"}
{"text":"A quickie, just to keep it simple.  So it took 2 tries for me to get a feel of this spot. First time we sat at the bar, second time at a table. Both experiences was the same. Tight at the bar though. Parking is plenty. Located in a plaza off of Eastern, it is semi busy in the area. Brings in good traffic. The inside of the restaurant is a bit cramed away from the bar. I believe about 9 tables total. Yes pretty small. Because of the small space, it gets pretty loud with a full house. Both times we were there it took about 5-10 minutes for us to get greeted, which is very rare. Customer service is good. Enough to where the Mrs. did not complain.   What ordered:  Albacore Hamachi Sake Super white Sweet shrimp Green mussels Seaweed salad Miso soup Sashimi salad Raw crab poke Ahi poke Softshell crab Fried tamper Hamachi kama Eggplant fries   Pauhana roll  Malassada sundae Green tea ic  More rice than fish. Nothing stuck out enough to write about, which makes this my most simple review yet. It's a good spot to go if your in the area and need a \"Smith's\" style sushi fix."}
{"text":"$27 All you can eat dinner special was fabulous!  Made to order Nigiri and Roll sushi, Shrimp Tempura, miso soup, teri beef, poke, etc.  If you are from Hawaii this is a must.  Lot's of local food like chicken katsu, pork cutlet, kalbi, saimin, and the list goes on!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Ok... So let's talk about this place :-)  I live in summerlin and decide to drive all the way out here to check this place out because my friend likes it. I'm always a bit leary because what a friend think's is good quality is completely different then what I think is good.    So... I walk inside and it's divided into 2 types of restaurants in 1 bldg with a wall dividing the two.  Inside the main entrance is the hawaiian side of the dining room with approx 3 tables and a counter area to order from just like aloha kitchen and L&L hawaiian.  On the other side of the wall is the sushi side of the restaurant with several tables and a sushi bar (both halves of this place are VERY small)  So after waiting a few minutes I get a seat at the sushi bar and they have 2 chefs and I think 2 or 3 servers and the place is full.  It is VERY easy to see right away that they are definitely under staffed for the amount of guests they have. After waiting approx 15 min we finally get to place our first order.  The menu looks good and the quality was fine (nothing great but certainly nothing bad at all)  But they were definitely VERY slow both the food and the servers and very cramped inside.  Once thing I will mention is when I ordered the uni (sea urchin) the first piece tasted very funny and odd and I thought ok maybe just maybe it was me.. I tried the 2nd piece and it was very noticeable.    Sorry, This place is definitely not worth going to. There are several places closer to me that I can get avg sushi and better service at."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe this place except for making orgasmic noises! This place has the best and fresh sushi.. I highly recommend eating their sashimi and nigiri its is by far the most fresh that i have eaten here in las vegas, and i LOVE THEIR GARLIC CHICKEN.. same as all other sushi places 1 hour limit for 28$ all you can eat really worth it!"}
{"text":"Pros...- good island local food don't get me wrong.... Grinds is good over there, been going there for 3 years now....... Cons- is it me or service got worst.... Went in there today, no acknowledgement what so ever.... That right there annoys the shit out of me and makes me never want to come back... It takes forever to gain a loyal customer and a second of bad service to part ways..."}
{"text":"The Fong family is doing great things as far as spreading the aloha all over what many now call the \"9th Island\" with their delicious Hawaiian food. There are two sides: sushi side and grill side, but it doesn't really matter because you can order from both menus either way. I love coming here for 50% off rolls Monday-Wednesday. Just don't forget to tip on the regular price! Service is great, but not perfect. Out of the 20+ times I've been in only a couple \"off\" days had happened. I recommend their garlic chicken on this side of town, poke avocado bowl, pau hana roll, kahuku roll, negihama roll, and big island roll. I have never had bad sushi here...ever! It gets even better, they have dessert! Yummy malasadas with various fillings, whole and individual cake slices (guava, haupia, dobash, and chantilly). Also, seasonal offerings such as pumpkin mochi! The new renovation looks great!"}
{"text":"My fav sushi place! If I lived a little closer, I'd be here all the time. You can do AYCE or just a la cart menu. But AYCE is the way to go. Try everything!!! It's Hawaiian & Japanese food all in one! &&&& they have poké! Ask for Stef or Raquel & give them a hard time lol.  Ps. Sunday brunch AYCE is a must at least one time!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. They always came back to check up on how we were doing and to clear away empty plates. Fish was fresh. We will be back again."}
{"text":"\"Whoa, do all the ladies from Hawaii look like this?\" my poker buddy ask while showing me his phone.  \"ummmm....what?\" I say, lost, looking past the beautiful wahine and trying to see the food on the website.  \"Maybe she works there.  If the next flop is red, you're buying lunch\" my bud says excitedly.  \"Book it.\" I say and the rest is history.  It's the usual, great Vegas AYCE place.  Super creative rolls filled with lots of deep fried stuff (soft shell crab, shrimp tempura), stuff mixed with spicy mayo, usually coated with a sweet, teriyaki eel sauce.   Most of the fish taste previously frozen or gassed.  All good though if you skip the nigiri.  What sets this place apart is the local Hawaiian style flavors.  Paniolo roll (teri beef inside, miso sauce, outside) and the poke roll (as its name implies).  Only disappointment, the Maui Wowie. Dang it. (You're a better person if you don't get it.)  Oh yeah, plate lunches are as good as back home.  Local style mochiko chicken, teri beef, mixed plates, and fried noodle combos.    Usual AYCE prices.  Lunch $21, Dinner $25.  All day happy hour with 50% off all rolls (not the AYCE) Mon - Wed. for the lighter eater.  Plate lunches are very reasonable averaging $7.50.  Great place when you're jonesing for a taste of Hawaii."}
{"text":"Awesome place with awesome service.  Sushi and Hawaiian food together in one place just goes together like surf and sand.    We had the all you can eat lunch and it was very satisfying.  Having tried almost half the menu of special rolls I can confidently say most were delicious.  Aside from the rolls, the mochiko chicken was my favorite and had a crisp rice flour crust with tender juicy meat inside.    Sushi pieces were fresh but small cuts. No matter, it was all you can eat so that wasn't an issue.   Salmon and hamachi were popular with our table.    Poke was fine and I liked it.  Plan on eating dessert.  I had the 808 special and the malasadas sundae.  The malasadas are made fresh in house.  It was good with vanilla ice cream, fresh cut strawberries, whipped cream and chocolate drizzle."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. Not only is it ridiculously slow to get your food either dining in or Togo, but the customer service is very misleading. We called asking if their poke station was still open around 7:45pm just to be sure our long drive was worth it. So we decided to order something from their grill section as well and also asked if we could go ahead and place an order for the poke but was told it had to be done in person which is understandable. May I also point out that the lady on the phone did not sound happy at all to talk over the phone. So we arrive there around 8:20 just to have them tell us their poke station is closed because they ran out of fish. Fish! What a horrible excuse. How can they operate their sushi section of the place if there's no fish. Since this is the only poke place that is even remotely close to us we now know better to order poke in the day because obviously they'll \"run out of fish\"."}
{"text":"This place always cranking. Very busy on Sundays especially. Still the only place in Las Vegas I know for REAL Malasadas. Someone tell me if wrong."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge - 44/100  I am surprised I haven't written a review for this place yet. I've been dining here for years and it is one of my favorite Hawai'an - 9th island restaurants in Vegas. I always feel like I'm back home when I'm here.   This review is mainly for the grill side of Island Sushi & Grill. I have had AYCE sushi here during Sunday Brunch and it was good, but it was a while back (5+ years ago). At that time it was a good price, lots of options for rolls and breakfast food. It may have changed since then.   GRILL SIDE:  - My favorites are the korean chicken, garlic chicken, chicken & eggplant, & teri beef plates.   - The ahi plate is a bit dry but can be improved.   - The malasadas are great. Freshly made and an assortment of filled malasadas to choose from: chocolate, haupia, and custard.   I love the renovations. It looks great! I like the option of quick service on the grill side with tables to dine in as well. I usually order takeout by phone and swing by to pick up when it's ready."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite sushi and poke spot in town! I love going there and I love ordering from there when i can't make it in. My favorite roll is the Island Special and I love their malasada sundaes. I've recommended this place to so many people! and I try to bring people here as much as possible."}
{"text":"They honestly wouldn't stay in business if they were in Hawaii. The food is shitty. The mochiko chicken is crap, the katsu is fatty, the gravy is not good, etc. I mean I guess for up here it's alright but it honestly is not good but is decent. Meh...it's a place to settle for but not have high expectations. Not going lie but if island flavor was here I would hit that place up way more"}
{"text":"FAVE PLACE TO EAT!!! all you can eat and half off rolls? yes please. and for such a reasonable price too!  lets not get started on happy hour as well. this place is my go to for my random sushi cravings that I get every single day. and so close to home. everyone is extremely nice and attentive. it's like being around family whenever I come in. SUNDAY brunch all you can eat is my parents fav thing to do after church. best part of my sunday funday? ALL YOU CAN DRINK MIMOSAS !! I always love this place. the people that work there. and the food is amazing. I always come back with someone new and family members that love it.   seriously. how can you not love this place? think i'm going tonight. ;)"}
{"text":"I like going back to Island Sushi and Grill occasionally. It may be a little bit on the pricey side for a casual restaurant, but it's still pretty good all the same! The restaurant is split into two sections: the grill side - which serves casual meals - and the actual sushi restaurant. Their poke orders in the grill side are always fresh, and my favorite food to get from there is the spicy tuna bowl! As for the sushi restaurant, the AYCE may be a bit pricey, but everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - on the menu is included in it. My favorite appetizer from there is the fried oysters. If you're sitting at the bar, one of the chefs may make a surprise dish for you, if you're lucky. Rolls are either hit or miss - they may be some \"interesting\" sushi rolls, but the rolls that are hits are very tasty! Customer service is also very good. I've been there in large groups several times before, and they definitely know how to handle them!"}
{"text":"Alright! WOOOT! YAY! YEEHAW! WOW!!!!!! Oh Mah Gaw!! HELL YES! These are the phrases and words I said while eating at this place.  I like this place, the service excellent! The people are nice and friendly!  The sushi was awesome, tasted really fresh to me! I like the Poki! And the CHICKEN (garlic flavored) is the BOMB! They do charge for leftovers/waste so eat up! Unbelievable!!! For All you can eat and $2 Sake Bombs..... I only spent a total of $40 bucks! WHY CAUSE THEY DESERVE A BIG TIP! :]   I'll definitely be coming back. Worth coming to and visiting (Better then most Buffets in Vegas)"}
{"text":"I come here every week at least once on saturday with my grandmother. Sometimes twice if I can squeeze in a stop during work. Literally everyone here is friendly, there aren't a bunch of places I can take my grandmother to, due to rude service or patrons, but this is always the go-to spot for us. I'm from hawaii so everything here is up my alley and I've been here so much I've practically had the entire menu, it's a great place to come, it can be busy if you come at lunch or their rush times. The sushi side is great too I've done that a couple times.  I always order Poke here, I've tried it literally anywhere I could in Vegas, this is the only place I recommend to get it. Even though it's frozen, they prepare it in a way that I can't taste that, everywhere else the texture is mush. Here the fish is always firm as if it just came off the boat I really appreciate that as I can't find it anywhere else for a decent price.  Great place to come. Great place for food. Five stars from me, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Love their tonkatsu and fried noodles.  They also make malasadas and cocoa puffs and definitely the place for poke in the 702."}
{"text":"Have been to Island so many times. They have wonderful service and the guys at the Bar are really accommodating.   Very Fresh Sushi,  I eat here a lot !"}
{"text":"I really like this place..they have a great variety here and when it comes to rolls they do a great job here. One thing that stands out here is that the people that serve you here are really nice and they want their customers to try everything.normally when you go to an AYCE place they rush you and after about three orders they tend to forget about you because they don't want you to order anymore..lol I know maybe I'm paranoid or I eat alot of sushi. Oh the tempura ice cream is awesome and the island special roll is great.my wife loves that they have hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) which is bomb too."}
{"text":"We always do the sushi and plate lunch special.  If you're looking for the best Hawaiian-style sushi and plate lunch around, this is it. We never miss this when we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here and yet again no communication with the staff..... We stood there for 15 minutes and had 5 different people ask us if we've been helped. They had a birthday party going along the back wall, other tables with patrons, two long tables that were not occupied, and then open spots at the bar. We had our baby in the car seat with us or we would have sat at the sushi bar.  15 minutes & each server that came by told us that we would be seated when the party LEFT. They hadn't even started cake..... It was 8:30 by this point and I'm almost positive they close at 9. So we would have been rushed through our meal, just like they did to us the last time. Again... Two open tables we STILL there. Needless to say, we ended up leaving. Last time we'll ever stop there again.  The FIRST time we ate there we were rushed through our meal. Mind you there was 5 of us doing all you can eat & 4 of them were eating and sending drinks to the sushi chefs for the awesome food. You'd think this would end up giving them a kick ass review right? Well, the servers began coming by and taking plates off our table that had sushi on it. Our friend who had a couple pieces left on his plate told the server he wasn't done and she put another plate over it and squished his food. We asked to speak to manager on duty and we were told they didn't have one and that we needed to pay our check and go. I then asked to speak to a manager again and was asked what for. I explained to the other server about how ours was so disrespectful. He came back with a poor excuse of a gift certificate that covered ONE entree..... Gee thanks.   Thought we'd give you another chance.... Won't be doing that again  Two stars for food"}
{"text":"Had the most incredible experience here! Sushi, sashimi, tempura shrimp, poke, and dessert... Oh my God I'm stuffed!!! The service that Mila and Jill provided was INCREDIBLE!! I will DEFINITELY come back if I'm ever in Las Vegas, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  We were seated in minutes and our food came out within 10 minutes of us ordering.  Food was good and the service was quick and friendly. . Definately making this a regular sushi spit on this side of town. ."}
{"text":"Love this place!! All the sushi you can eat!! All there rolls are great and they have a huge selection the staff is very nice and attentive. Deserts are great def try the 808..."}
{"text":"AMAZING. AUTHENTIC. DELICIOUS.   I came here last night with my family for the AYCE sushi which was totally worth the $27. Fish was pretty fresh and good qualify. Hot foods were amazing. Dessert case includes an amazing selection as well.   Came back the next day for lunch on the grill side. Ox tail is authentic, not fatty, and super delicious. My sisters ordered the garlic chicken bento box and teriyaki beef box. Teriyaki beef was not the usual flavor you would expect, but had a nice Hawaiian twist.   The poke bar at the back of the grill area had the best poke I've ever eaten. I got the shoyu ahi poke bowl with brown rice and it was THE BESTTTTTT THING THEY HAVE. I get poke wherever I go and this beats everything. The fish was fresh and flavorful. Portions were superb. The regular bowl was about $10 and filled me up.   Highly recommend this place if you're in the Vegas area. Service is great, bathrooms are clean, food is made fresh and sushi is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I think there is some major room for improvement here....I went in today, ordered a Tonkatsu (breaded and fried pork piece) and received something that resembled deep fried beef jerky.  When expressed my displeasure, I was told that is how the grill cooks.  The chef did not come out to view the \"doneness\" of the dish. They also refused to replace it.  As a local girl, born and raised on O'ahu, and living in Vegas for more than 10 years, I was beside myself.  However, the Poke Express is a ray of sunshine in the world of customer service.  Maybe some lessons in \"Aloha\" should be taught by the gentleman behind the Poke Express counter.  The salmon Poke and the Ahi Shoyu Poke was Fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"I mostly came here for Poke Express. Poke Express is amazing. But as for Island Sushi and Grill...  It's okay I guess? I got a kalbi and tonkatsu lunch combo, but compared to Island Specialties downtown, there just wasn't very much for the same price.  There's 3 small pieces of kalbi and one medium piece of tonkatsu, plus Mac or tossed salad for $9 something. Overall decent and what I expected, but could have been more.  At least service is friendly and they are fast.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I come here for their malasadas, garlic chicken, and poke station!!! It is so good. They have a grill side and sushi side, which I have dined on both and it is equally as great. However, it's hard to find parking during the rush hour and BE prepared to wait in line for a while. This place needs to expand, it's too popular and good! Lol"}
{"text":"Good all you can eat! Quality is good and so is taste. It's a little far off you're in Vegas and staying on the strip but if you're in Vegas all the time then you should try this place."}
{"text":"I love this place because the sushi is great. The reason why I'm giving it a two star is for the service they give sometimes. There's always a wait list and no one is ever watching the front nor the wait list. We waited 20 min and not once did anyone checked up on us or the list. Kinda makes the people feel unappreciated. Hire some more staff!"}
{"text":"I've always been leary of AYCE sushi. The idea just really freaked me out and I was worried the quality would be low.. I'm now an official fan of AYCE sushi, at least if it's from Island sushi! $24.95 is a steal for the quality you're getting.   Starters: The mini fried octupus was awesome.. as was the gyoza... as was the seaweed salad. All fresh and top knotch.   Sushi: The owner had flown in some kampachi for our event.. WOW I wish he would add this to the menu because it was out of this world. I also tried hamachi off the menu, it was fresh and tasty. Not a hint of fishyness. The deep fried philly roll was delish, as was the island roll, and to be honest every roll I tried. I didn't bite into anything mushy or fishy tasting.   I couldn't eat dessert.. I was much too stuffed from all the awesome sushi!! The owner was super nice, as was all the staff. I definitely recommend this as a great AYCE sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Not sure if their phone order service is going downhill but it's been a struggle to even get an order in.    USUALLY, when I call I get my order in quick.  Now it's like if you don't respond within 1 second they hang up on you.  The 2nd time there's there's a internet phone dial up sound, then the 3rd time they answer.  Not even a minute ago I tried putting in my order and I was on hold for 7 minutes.  Why did I stay on the phone for 7 minutes? Because I wanted to record everything that happened because of their stupid phone service...  Minute 1:  Them: Island sushi and grill can I help you? Me: Hi can i place a take out order? Them: Ok can I put you on hold for a little? *finishes up taking an order*  Minute 2 - 4: *background noise*  Minute 5: *Them taking another order*  Minute 6: *someone drops dishes*  Minute 7: Them: Hello? 1 second later hangs up...  I'm a regular and unless their customer service improves I will not be returning here just the mere fact that their staff is incapable of \"completing an order before pissing the customer off\""}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place in town. I've been going here for years. The rolls are so good and the seasoned edamame is the best! I would highly recommend coming here if your in the area."}
{"text":"LOVED IT! great staff and the best Hawaiian food outside of HI.. i always craved good Hawaiian food, but could never find it, until i came here! always a great choice!!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was very delicious and felt fresher than most AYCE sushi places I've tried, even ones on the strip.  The Candy Cane roll is a must!  It was so good we got two.   The rolls are about $11 each so if you can easily break even (or make money, if your economics are as weird as mine) on the $20 AYCE special.  The sake was pretty good, and with a couple bottles of Sake between us it came to $50ish?  It was worth its weight in.. deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I cannot avoid coming here. I can be craving something else but as soon as we get nearby we end up coming here. I love the kalbi ribs, kimchi spam fried rice, and spam musabi. Their oxtail was not bad either. When it comes to dessert their coco puffs are delish, malasadas are yummy, and butter mochi is addicting. They had a pumpkin mochi in October that was amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant, especially those who haven't experienced hawaiian food (like this Canadian)."}
{"text":"Have a great dinner here.  Feels like we never left Hawaii. The dressing for their Chicken Salad simple but really tasty.  The sushi feels like they are from the better sushi takeout places.  The kalbi, teriyaki chicken, vegetable and shrimp tempura very good."}
{"text":"I admit that their Poke was really good! As far as the sushi goes no good. The rolls are just not made that well, the nigiri was not that fresh and the service was about the same. I do not recommend this place if you are in that area go to Sin City sushi right down the street from their. The service and quality is way better."}
{"text":"Not very impressed by their pokè bar. Spicy ahi was okay but too much sauce and their spicy tako is something to be desired. Guess I'll have to try another pokè place."}
{"text":"Love the food. All you can eat lunch is good and reasonably priced.  Sushi is well made and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 items to go and they forgot about our salmon skin bowl. Charged us for it anyhow. Called them and no one answers their phone. How could you forget one part of the order especially everything is automated and computerized? Never again. Also, there are better places for poke, this one is a dud."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and delicious. Service is also very good. The only thing that is slightly lacking is variety in the rolls."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday evening and ordered 2 dinner AYCE for $67 ($27 each for adult)  - We had to wait about 10min for them to have a table ready for us. I was surprised to see how busy it was, being it was a Monday. Then again, they did have Monday night football on.  - Our orders came quickly. First with the appetizers. The sashimi salad is definitely a must try. Lots of flavor and sashimi pieces.  - There are certain items that you can only get once, so we got the soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was actually pretty big compared to other AYCEs around the area. Although, in the Sacramento area, there is no limit to soft shell crab. Nonetheless, it was great!  - The salmon skin roll is always on the top of my list when it comes to getting sushi. More salmon skin than actual pieces of salmon which was good, and not too oily.  - The dynamite wasn't the best I've had. Inaka tasted a bit better.  - The nigiri pieces were solid. Hamachi, salmon, sweet shrimp always rank.  - Out of the special rolls we got, I do regret getting the lava lover roll bc it a too mushy. The salmon lover was a hit. And the surf and turf was alright. Turf tasted like L&L bbq.  - Hamachi kama tasted like others. No bone. good.  - Service was quick and friendly. Bathrooms were clean.  - Best AYCE sushi buffet in the area. The change changer was their desserts! Tempura ice cream FTW. Fried banana! YUM!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place used to be my favorite sushi restaurant in town, Koto. I've given this place a few tries. The food has improved but the service has not. AYCE susi with a taste of Hawaii. Hawaiians are known for being laidback and friendly.   There were plenty of empty tables when we got there yet, we had to wait for a table. Really? We placed out order. Some items took forever but some we never got. I guess our previous server was finishing up his shift but didn't notify us. We tried a few nigiri, rolls, teri beef sliders, garlic edamame, ahi poke, salmon katsu and malassadas. We didn't order that much but we spent 2 hours total here.  Lunch AYCE is from 11:30am-4pm for $21.95 and dinner AYCE is from 4pm-close for $26.95. There are certain items that are only available for dinner, limit 1/person, 2 desserts/person and there's a 90-minute limitfor AYCE. With service slower than molasses, you'll easily go over 90 minutes!   The food was good but the service really turned us off. My boyfriend is very calm and laidback and for him to even say something about the service says a lot. The female server was borderline rude. No smile on her face, no nothing. The servers don't even look up to see if anyone in the restaurant needs something. They walk around with their head down or pretending to be busy. 3 servers and 5 tables, c'mon!"}
{"text":"Husband wanted to order chicken wings but not available til 12noon (it was 11:30). He then decided on oxtail soup...that too wasn't available til after 12noon. Finally he decided on a saimin and a won ton min for me and paid the bill without even thinking about the order. When the order was delivered, we received the won ton min. Waiting a little longer, and not receiving the saimin, he looked at his receipt to find he had only paid for the won ton min. Apparently the girl didn't hear my husband order his saimin. Big fail!!  So my husband said forget it. Next time we'll go somewhere else!   Anyway, the meat in won ton tasted a bit vinegary! Is it suppose to??  Soup base slightly on the salty side but still good.  Update: No, we did not speak to the manager. We were going to but changed our mind. My wife had GI issue that night which could have been related...or not. Not to worry, we will eventually go back for another meal. One incident does not mean your place is bad. Just try again...."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Always get the mochiko chicken and combination spicy ahi from the poke stand in the back. Me and my family of 5 easily spend $60 so we don't go as often as we'd like. But well worth the price especially when you have that craving. Ate on the sushi side once and we have no complaints. Staff is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Love island sushi for the malasadas and oxtail soup.  This time is was. Little chewy but normally it's tender and flavorful.  I like that they add cilantro fish garlic and ginger.  Oh green onions too. Wish the served this all year round"}
{"text":"Our first AYCU Jap sushi/grill in our neighborhood after we moved in the area.  The restaurant itself is a little bit too causal, the decor looks like cafeteria, i think which is good for friends & family, but please, please dont take your date there lol.    We sat at the bar, ordering the dinner AYCU during lunch hours because for my love, such as sweet shrimps, uni, sashimi salad, other appetizers that we interested belongs to the dinner AYCU category.  Food is good fish is fresh, still worth the money.  I believe they have happy hour all day, which is $8 pp all you can drink either beer or hot sake.  Awesome deal right!   And great people working there! They are very helpful, teamwork, good vibes!"}
{"text":"Seriously looooove this place! Not just because I love sushi, but because everyone is so nice here! Busy and all, the workers are on point and the service is great! Not your typical all-you-can-eat buffet, which I love! Everything is made to order so you know it's fresh. All the sushi isn't made the night before and just sitting all day for you to eat it. Menu is so simple and clean and extra delicious! The servers take time to explain and recommend different items and are so quick to clear empty plates and replenish drinks. If you're in town, this is a MUST GO TO PLACE!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was a last minute, drive by decision that fit our timing on a late weekday afternoon.  What a wonderful surprise!  Our timing must have been good, cuz we got right in with no wait.  We got in on the All You Can Eat sushi lunch for 20 bucks.  The rolls were really good and the staff was super attentive.    Tiger roll, Mount Charelston roll - thumbs up.  The spicy scallop?  Seems to be a different standard out west, and not my favorite Tsu Kasa style.  The tuna was sublime.  Seaweed salad - the perfect serving size.  Shrimp Tempura - amazingly perfect.  Tried the Ikura (Salmon Roe) but realized I hadn't quite evolved that far.  I would go back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I love this place! I literally saved my appetite the whole day just for the All You Can Eat. The ordering process is pretty easy actually. They give you a pencil and paper where you mark down how much sushi rolls or entrée's you want. We ordered a lot of food for a party of 18. We were constantly ordering hamachi and sushi rolls. I haven't been this full in forever. Like I couldnt stand up.  The food came in really fast. Coming from Maui on Hawaii, I never get to eat all the hamachi I want and there is not a single AYCE restaurant in Maui. When I come to Vegas, I look forward to AYCE sushi! This is one of my favorite AYCE sushi restaurants and I am coming back!"}
{"text":"AYCE and other than AYCE food is delicious!!!   Once you walk into the doors, the right side of the restaurant is for only AYCE and you have to sign in on a sheet on a podium. The left side of the restaurant is the other food than AYCE. The first counter you'll see is the take out counter and where you can order your food. The other counter across the room, is the Poke Express. You'll find all types of Poke, definitely worth it!!   It does get really busy during lunch time, so if you're desperately hungry, try and avoid coming here during lunch hours on a Sunday."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Hawaii and have been here many times. However, the quality of their \"plate lunches\" has drastically dropped. For example, the garlic ahi was one of my favorites but now it's terrible. It's a few thin slices of ahi smothered in an awful, oily, overlooked mixture of shredded cabbage and onions. I scraped it all off and threw it away.   I was also very disappointed in the hamburger steak I ordered previously but I thought it was hard to screw up fried ahi. Boy was I wrong.   Whomever is cooking the dishes must not be tasting their cooking because the quality and flavors aren't close to what you can get at almost any eatery in Hawaii.  Response to owner: I can't remember the day I was there but it was about a week before my posting. To reiterate, fried ahi has enough taste on its own. Best to season it properly and if anything, place it on a thin bed of fresh shredded cabbage.  The ahi I got was smothered in an oily mess of overdone cabbage and onions. There was more cabbage and onions than ahi. Further, the Mac salad needs more flavor. Just mixing it in mayo doesn't cut it. Sorry for the negative rating but I was very disappointed with my meal and I remember it being better in the past. I even mentioned to my wife that you must have new fry cooks."}
{"text":"YUM this is my favorite lunch spot while in Vegas! definetly would reccomend"}
{"text":"My wife and I always make it a point to come here either by ourselves or whenever we have guests in town. This place never disappoints and has some or most of the best Hawaiian/Local style dishes outside of Hawaii. On my recent visit, they have changed up the interior decor and the format of the restaurant flow. Not that it needed it but it does make for a nicer addition and updated area. They now make Poke Bowls and have a selection of ingredients that rival the best of places in Hawaii that do the same. Their Local food selection and plate lunch variations are incredible and mighty tasty! The staff here has the best attitude and really knows how to provide the best customer service. Nothing can beat the unlimited cuisine and creativity of Hawaii restaurants but thank you for existing here in Vegas because you make me miss Hawaii food less and less."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Good and fast service, but the rolls are nothing to write home about. In fact, most of them are tempura shrimp based so there is not much true variety if you think about it. The tempura banana desert is really good, so if you find yourself eating here, make sure you get it."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have never been disappointed. The AYCE special is very extensive and the people here are very friendly. The sushi is amazing quality, a cut above many other places I have been to lately. Get here early around 6 and sit at the bar, all the chefs are super nice."}
{"text":"We just ate here the other night for the first time and it was SO good!  We often go to Poke Express and get their Poke Bowl, which is amazing, but my husband and I wanted to go out to sushi for our date night and decided to give Island Sushi and Grill a shot.  We were not disappointed at all, and it surpassed any expectation I had.  The staff was so incredibly nice and helpful.  They also were attentive and made sure everyone was taken care of.  Their wasn't an open seat in the place and I didn't feel that they were rushed or too busy for us (unlike other sushi places were you get your one order in and then your lucky to get ahold of the staff prior to getting your bill).  Another part I really liked was the way their seats are spread out.  It isn't a huge place, but I didn't have to share any elbow space with the table next to me.  Another big plus compared to other places.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We came here because of poke express.  I personally didn't like it as much.  The mochiko chicken was kind of bland.  The Kalbi was good according to my son.  The fried noodles need the extra add on.  It was kind of soft noodle and not chewy the way I like it.  We only got the food because we were there for the poke.  Oh we got the Malasada and they get 1 star.  They had a grease taste and nothing like Leonards.  I might try the guava cake it looked really good."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot when I was in town and have sent a ton of friends here. I also used to bring groups of my co workers and have a sushi outings here.  Bringing a large group and trying to finish your meal in the 1/ 1/2 time limit is a little tough. Your trying to enjoy the food and socialize at the same time not just scarf food down fast as I can because of the time restraint. When there are 20 plus in your group the food takes a while to come out also.   My friends who used to love Islands, also have had some bad experiences as the service not being as good as it used to be when they first opened up.    The food is pretty decent but because of the time restraint, it's not a good place for large groups in my opinion since I have tried. I know most Vegas sushi places the have a time limit for all you can eat and Islands is a little more generous with the time but huge groups it doesn't help.  I prefer to go to Sin city sushi across the street, even though Sin city is tiny there is no time limit on the all you can eat and we can relax socialize and enjoy the food without any pressure to hurry.  The food is just as good as Islands or better. The fish being fresher in my opinion."}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday & it was the worst place I have ever been to.    I ordered some sort of egg plate and a roll (I forgot what roll it was), but the taste of the plate was INCREDIBLY horrible and tasted spoiled! I took three bites and I had to put my fork down.  The rolls were not that great either. It was stale, bland, and unappealing.  The service was mediocre. However, thee price we paid was too overpriced.  I would never step into this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Lunch AYCE is reasonable at $20.95, but compared to other sushi places the list of rolls, nigiri, and appetizers are minimal. I know that quantity is not a substitution for quality, but Island was lacking.   The fish to rice ratio was good. Some of the fish came out at an alarming temperature. Felt that they were dangerously warm, as if they were not properly stored. The nigiri are smaller than other places, but that is usually better. If you like something, you can just order more, instead of getting a huge lump of rice. The rice also fell apart easily.   The one roll I tried, the croc, was small. I am used to soft shell crab rolls to be bigger and filled to the brim with crustacean-y goodness.   The best dishes were the side dishes. The ahi poke, garlic chicken, and seaweed salad were delicious, but can be found elsewhere.   The service was decent. Our waitress put in our order in a timely fashion, got refills once in a while, and took away dirty plates promptly."}
{"text":"Fine sushi & fantastic prices during happy hour but a mess of a customer service experience. Waaay understaffed. When I went you had to wait in line for 20 minutes to place an order & then wait again for it to be brought out to you. Not sure if that's always the set up but if so it needs to be rethought stat."}
{"text":"What a nice break from the restaurants on the strip!  Buffet lunch is completely worth it.  Fish quality is great.  Service is great.  Just word of advice: make sure u read the whole menu and choose what u most want first before u fill ur belly up with ur 2nd tier options."}
{"text":"it's been a week since our vegas trip and our friend is still dreaming (literally) about their poke.  found this little unassuming place through yelp and we will definitely be coming back.  the lunch price was 20.95/person and includes hot appetizers, sushi rolls, and nigiri.  i love how this place is all-you-can-ORDER and not all-you-can-pick-through-leftovers-that's-been-sitting-there-for-god-knows-how-long.  the hot appetizer comes out hot because it's made to order.  you have to get the poke.  it was the highlight of my appetizer, entree, and dessert.  they even have a poke bar where you can buy poke by weight and that looked pretty delicious.  the rolls are not very big so you can try a bigger variety w/o being filled up after 1 roll.  i do think they can use a little more filling in the rolls though.  i would review each roll individually but the truth is that we had so many that i don't remember which was what.  the one that stood out to me was the one topped with slices of jalapeno peppers.. that was pretty yummy.  we tried the fried geso (whole octopus - head, tentacles and all) and that was interesting.  it's very chewy, more so than calamari, but it tasted pretty good.  i preferred the chicken with mochiko breading over the garlic chicken.  the mochiko chicken were lightly breaded, more lean, not as fried, flat pieces of chicken.  the garlic chicken looked like popcorn chicken and when i bit into it, all i saw were chunks of fat.  no thank you.  the gyoza was fried all over also, not pan fried.  i prefer the latter.  well actually i prefer the poke, i wish i had filled up the space the gyoza took with poke.  quality of the nigiri was pretty good as well.  the size of the slices of sashimi was decently proportioned to the amount of rice.  it is not top quality but you are also not paying $5-$10 per order of nigiri either.  if you wish you had more fish and less rice, then just order some more poke.  for desser we had the choice of ice cream, tempura ice cream, or the 808 special.  we just got ice cream cuz we were so full by the end of the meal and the 808 special just sounded too crazy: fried tempura banana with ice cream and whip cream etc.  it sounded like a meal in itself.  all in all we were very satisfied with our meal and glad we took the 15-min trip off the strip.  5 stars for getting what we got for the price we paid.  definitely come here with a group so you can try more stuff.  did i mention the poke was the bomb?"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but it was just alright. For one, the atmosphere is really bleh and the customer service is also bleh. But that's alright.   I got the poke nachos because I saw really yummy photos of them. It was my first time trying anything poke and i'll definitely be eating more of it. I don't think the portion size was worth $12. I wish there was more of it. I did enjoy the taste, a lot, though!  I'll be back to try something else. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Walked in for my 1st Island sushi experience and immediately felt transported to Hawaii. Was guided through a side doorway into a second room where the sushi is served. We chose to eat at the bar so my companion could see the sushi cooks do there thing. It was her 1st time and are guide, sushi cook Jesus didn't let us down. He took us on a guided journey through the world of \"Island Sushi\" and all its tastes and flavors. We had both hot and cold saki. We tried both of their Japanese beer selections. We chose the all you can eat menu, and that we did. We ate spider rolls, spicy tuna, fried oysters, tempura shrimp, mussels, soft shell crab, mochi, tempura ice cream and my personal favorite the Kahlua pork tacos. We ate more but I dont have the space here to list all of our nights conquests. Needless to say we weren't hungry when we left. The food was amazing but the service was even better. The attention Jesus gave to me and my companion, even speaking to her in Spanish was above and beyond. He made us laugh he made us happy. We met the manager who stepped in and gave me the recommendation of the night, the Kahlua pork tacos. I just can't say enough about this place and the prices were very reasonable. Ill definitely be back for some more Island Sushi."}
{"text":"One word...WOW! My husband and I happened upon this place after being told there was a 1.5 hour wait to be seated at what \"use to be\" our favorite sushi place. (Sushi Mon) The food is out of this world, the service is top notch, and we even found some new favorites. We will be back again when the sushi hunger strikes, which for us is usually every couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Island Sushi and its partner business next door, Poke Express, many times, but my most recent trip reminded me that I MUST leave a Yelp review.   Had a craving for sushi while out shopping on a Sunday. Island Sushi was nearby so we stopped. SO glad we did. I had never been here for AYCE Sunday brunch and it was to die for. In addition to AYCE sushi covering most of the menu (including apps and cooked food), they also had a huge list of additional offerings including breakfast mains, Hawaiian favorites, special sushi rolls and desserts - all part of the AYCE menu. Banana bread french toast with coconut syrup? Yes, please. Spam omlette? Yes, please. Malasadas with guava syrup? Yes!  I am a very picky sushi eater, but every time I have been to Island Sushi the fish has been very fresh. I also appreciate they dont give you these huge clumps of sushi rice with AYCE in a cheap attempt to fill you up. The staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is relaxed. Overall, for the money, quality and service I dont think you can beat Island Sushi for sushi. Make sure you go for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Went for the first time by suggestion from my friend who is a regular. They offer $8 all you can drink beer which is fantastic. We went for the all you can eat option which I don't normally do because at most places it is just too darn limited. Not here! I was pleased to see we could still get almost the entire menu including collar. They also have a yummy looking bakery with all kinds of Hawaiian treats. I was too stuffed to even think about it, but I will DEFINATELY pick something up next time!"}
{"text":"The second day of debauchery in Vegas involved the all-you-can-eat sushi lunch buffet. This place was absolutely amazing. For $20.99 for lunch, you can eat unlimited appetizers, unlimited sushi rolls and nigiri, and one dessert.  We came here STARVING. It was around 2pm, and we had just come back from swimming in the nice pool garden at the Venetian. So believe me when I say that we were incredibly hungry. The server took our order for appetizers, and we got miso soup, edamame, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura, and maybe a few other things I don't remember. The shrimp tempura is only two pieces per order, so order several if you actually want to eat a decent amount. And who cares, it's unlimited anyway.  Notable rolls: Black Widow and the Mauna Loa. Although to be honest, we tried everything that had soft shell crab in it and that was amazing too. We must have put through a gajillion orders of rolls and they got vanquished within two minutes of being placed on the table. The nigiri came last, and avoid the squid because it's super rubbery. The salmon was decent, and that's pretty much all I tried because I was saving room for dessert.  I have made quite the convenient pairing, because the boyfriend doesn't like dessert and doesn't believe in always having room for it. I, meanwhile, had room for two desserts (I learned my lesson after the Mirage incident, see previous review). So I took my tempura ice cream (with vanilla ice cream, it was delicious) and then I took his green tea ice cream, which was a great way to round out the meal. After that, boy, was I full.  I would come here again in a heartbeat. The fish is great, the sweet sauce they use to cover it is not too overbearing, and for all you can eat, this can't be beat. I would take a taxi from the strip and endure the $$$$ cab ride just to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has changed with their quality of food. Their desserts is not good at all besides their malasadas. We ordered one dozen of coco puffs that was stale and soggy, we threw it all away. This was always our stop before we head back on the road to AZ and get our fix for ono plate lunches. We ordered their katsu curry which was good- mochiko chicken which was bland, the kids needed ketchup- garlic chicken, which need more flavor-  Fried noodles, which was okay just need more garnishes. We really loved their food here but I am not sure what happened. Either they have different cooks or new owners. We will be trying this place again because we love the service and the malasadas."}
{"text":"customer service - GREAT! HELPFUL! FRIENDLY! Prices- best during happy hour -- HALF OFF ROLLS!  Food - very yummy. Being from San Jose, CA, it's hard to find good poke outside of the islands. Island sushi brought it! Thanks.  I think Monday through Wednesday is happy hour all day which means their sushi rolls are half off. I have become a regular so partner and i tried their all you can eat lunch for 21.95 and tasted (and finished) 6 different rolls and our favorites are: Mauna Kana, Island Special, and the Croc! Unagi on the Croc is crispy... MMMMM!!  Ahi poke bedded on seaweed salad is delicious but at times can be too chewy (possibly not cut correctly?).  Salmon sashimi orgasm is pretty good too. The mussels have too much mayo on it and was too chewy. kinda felt light headed after from that. I honestly have never ate at a sushi testaurant that cut the salmon so lean. Now for the dessert...  Malassadas with vanilla ice cream drizzled with guava sauce and cinnamin crisps was ok but I wouldnt order it again. The ice cream banana tempura smothered in chocolate was better.   If you check in on yelp the Plum bottle of wine was half off. My partner liked it but I personally am not fond of Plum wine."}
{"text":"Boy things have gone down hill :( We went Friday about 3:30 pm. Counter girl was too busy doing other things to even finish taking my order and letting me pay. We ordered: pork loco, eggplant and chicken, cheeseburger combo and 1/2 lb poke. Pork loco so dry the meat and so little bit, chicken eggplant was all fatty pieces and swimming in oil (this was so junk) and damn we paid $1.25 extra just for brown rice! Most places are free or maybe .50 charge....this seems so excessive! Everything else was ok....we used to rate this place pretty good but just seems with the service and prep that they don't really care anymore. I dunno I don't think we will be back anytime soon.  Island Flavors is closer to is and their poke is way better and no extra charge for brown rice."}
{"text":"Awesome everything.  Best poke outside of Hawaii.  Good portions.  Malasadas are a must-get every time.  Friendly and accommodating staff.  The seating is a bit confusing, but they will help you figure it out."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Island Sushi for a good 6 or 7 years long before I ever Yelped. The Island atmosphere and sushi keep me coming back at least two to three times per year. I come most often with my work colleagues during lunch and they consistently get us in and out for a power AYCE lunch in less than an hour during the busiest times. The efficiency at lunch, the poke, and the desserts separate Island from some of the other AYCE sushi places.  I came for Tuesday lunch with my wife on my most recent visit and we had a very enjoyable meal. A California roll is the closest thing to sushi my wife will eat, but she still has plenty to choose from. The teishoku combination B is plenty of food for $14 (see picture). For AYCE, the ahi poke is a must. When I'm with my buddies, they order more rolls which are pretty standard at lunch, but I stick with nigiri. I'm not a sauce person for much of anything, and while the sake with orgasm sauce isn't quite orgasmic, it's a sauce that's creamy with some tart that I'll definitely make an exception for. The garlic tuna is another nigiri that we all like that is better than most places. I do like the white fishes like red snapper and halibut, but unfortunately, they don't carry these.  Make sure you save room for dessert too. I'll usually get the \"808\" Special and green tea ice cream. The tempura ice cream is solid, the creme brulee is a favorite of my daughter, and the malassada sundae is a dessert that is unique to Island.  Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. They have discounted rolls and drinks during happy hour along with AYCD house sake for AYCE patrons. Service is mostly friendly and accommodating, as it was on our last visit. We've had occasional visits where service has been slow and I think that is completely dependent on who is serving you and if they are on island time or not.  The dining room is small and the sushi bar has about 5 or 6 seats so expect a wait during the peak times for dinner. A crowded lot with no spots will be the best indication of their volume. The longest we've waited was 30 minutes on a Friday night after we signed our name on the list. The advantage of coming in for dinner is that you get to have many of the items that are not available at lunch such as the raw crab poke, raw tako wasabi, and the kalbi ribs.  Island Sushi has been consistent for me for years and here's to many more."}
{"text":"What a fun surprise to walk into!  We have driven by this restaurant probably a million times and decided to try it after a recommendation from a friend.  Food: We loved the option to get $26 all you can eat! The sushi is delicious (even cooked options since I'm pregnant) and the portions are small enough that you can try an assortment of different things without completely stuffing yourself! I love the dynamite, kalbi beef, and crunchy shrimp roll.  You can eat plenty of food for the price and their rules (no sharing, no leaving food behind) worked out well.  Service: servers were friendly and helpful  Atmosphere: We liked how there was a takeout/to-go area near the front of the building and then there was also the sit down area. There was plenty of space and room for everyone to be comfortable.  We definitely want to come back and experience more of the all-you-can-eat menu!"}
{"text":"Took us back to our Hawaii trip ! Loved the poke and the desserts ! The Limu ahi wasn't a favorite though..  It tastes very authentic ! We tried it as a take out place, can't wait to try dining in and all the other dishes they offer !"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and I keep coming back. All the menu items are delicious and nothing has really disappointed me and I usually order from the plate lunch aka carte menu. My favorites are the spicy tuna bowl and the fried saimin.   I've also done the all you can eat sushi and it's ok. The fried rolls and anything fried is too greasy and oily for me. The raw items are ok not as fresh as I'm used to at other sushi places. But their specialty rolls are awesome and that kept me full. Their dessert options are also good my favorite being the malassada sundae.   Will be back for the plate lunches and ala carte menu items."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Vegas. I usually eat on the grill side of the restaurant, and I've only been on the sushi side once, so this review is mostly about the plates they have.  I usually get a 2-item combo which is a dollar more than highest priced item...  Usually it's garlic chicken and and the chicken or pork with eggplant.  The garlic chicken is just perfect.  It's fried, and I want to drink the garlicky soy sauce that it's smothered in.  The eggplant is also really good and they can make it spicy for you.  I'm usually pretty sensitive to spicy food, but the spicyness isn't overwhelming and provides a tiny kick to your muth.  Your plate is really full of the food you order with two scoops of rice and a mac salad.  I've also tried the kalua pig and mochicko chicken.  I'm not from Hawaii, so I don't know how the kalua pig compares, but it's alright...  The mochicko chicken is really similar to the garlic chicken, but it's good in its own way.   There isn't much to say about the service since the grill side is more of a help yourself out, but the guys behind the register are all really cool, and if they were servers, I'm sure they'd be really good.  Also, the malasadas are great especially if they're fresh, and you can get them filled with custard, chocolate, or haupia cream.  They also have a ton of desserts displayed when you first walked in, and somehow I've managed to avoid them (usually because I'm too full to think of dessert when I'm done), but from the way they look, I'm sure they're great.  As for the sushi side, I've only gone once and didn't do the AYCE since back then they had a special for 50% off sushi on Mondays (I'm not sure if it's still there, but I doubt it).   It's been a while, but I think I really enjoyed the Hawaiian roll.  And the food and service on the sushi side is just as good as the grill side...  I can't wait to come back here and am always willing to drive across town to come here."}
{"text":"AYCE for ~$27 per person (dinner) = completely worth it. Our table of four ended up with a total of 68 items ordered & we would have paid significantly more anywhere else but did not have to sacrifice the quality. Glad I live in Henderson!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since its inception and it NEVER disappoints. The best combination of all you can eat sushi, local Hawaiian flare on \"bar food\", great service and relaxed dining. Whether we come for lunch or dinner, mid week or weekend, bring small or large groups, our friends and family are always impressed.   The only downside is the small dining area, so call ahead to find out wait times."}
{"text":"I love this place so much,  but sometimes the service sucks. Most recently we went on a weeknight and it took almost 45 min for my first roll to come out. Was quite disappointed. The server didn't really seem to care and had no problem charging our small party gratuity. Thankfully that was the only time the service has ever been that bad.  Typically service is great,  especially if you sit at the sushi bar.    Now on to the food...my favorite rolls are the Japanese lasagna, maui wowie, and tempura rolls. For apps I like beef teri, and the tempura.  When you go for brunch,  try the spam pancakes.  They're incredible. For finishers, I'm a big fan of the Malasada sundae. Sooo goooood."}
{"text":"K, so dis status goin be all da kine cuz apparently das da only way dis place going listen to you.  Da firs time I came hea I was all stoked cuz da peepo on da bento/poke side when sound like me and was brown like me!  Since I when leave da 8o8 I been real homesick.  Brah, I was so happy I when find dis place!  Dey when rep aloha and I couldn't wait for go back. And deeen I went back.  Except dis time we went da sushi side.  Aye lawd, these chicks lucky my potagee maddah nevah come wit me cuz she woulda had one field day wit da pilau customer service.  We did da all you can eat sushi, but first da wahine when embarrass us, announcing to da whole place dat we when order choke food.  Den da rest of our visit, she when fly da plates at us and  den grab da empty ones off our table without sayin one word!  She nevah ask us if we like order more, she never ask us if we like more watah, nevah ask us if we like napkin, nothin!  She when drop/grab da plates den run away!  Da two wahines workin dat night only when cater to da peepo reppin da 808 shirts or all moked out.  Real unreal, i trip. As fo da grindz, was okay.  Get fat pieces in da rolls, and da soups is winnahz.  But if you like drink watah, bettah wear your aloha shirt or else nevah mine!   IN OTHER WORDS:  The customer service on the sushi side sucked.  If you want good customer service, you better wear an HI/AlohaArmy or a tribal print shirt.  Where the food lacked in quality, they made up for it in quantity (the rolls are pretty large).  I recommend the the miso and udon, they're pretty good.  Their desserts are cute and tasty, wish I got to try the malasadas!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened and I absolutely love the owner and Chui the sushi chef!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've had in town. The staff is very friendly and the fish is fresh every time. Their all you can eat menu is generous with appetizers, rolls, and even terrific desserts. Fair prices too!"}
{"text":"Waste of money, I got the salmon poke. It's not good. Kinda tastes like glue. Also the miso soup tastes like water."}
{"text":"Food and half priced specials are great, but poor customer service at times is the only reason why it's missing a star.   After reading about their mochiko chicken, I decided to give it a try. Ask for spicy mayo on the side to give it more flavor!  Favorite rolls are salmon lover, island special and pauhana!"}
{"text":"We found the reviews on Yelp about Island Sushi and wanted to try it.   We arrived in Vegas on Wednesday, 8/19/09 and went for an early dinner.  We had the Laihana Roll, Tempura California Roll and Cucumber Salad and Shrimp Tempura  The salad was fresh and enough for two people, mind you it is only cucumbers, sliced thin and a sesame dressing, but very good.  The Laihana Roll was awesome!  A California Roll topped with chicken and mushrooms and a special mayo sauce.    The Tempura California Roll was fantastic as was the Shrimp Tempura.  The tempura batter was not greasy, it was light and crispy!   All ingredients used were fresh, flavorful and abundant.    Price was average and well worth every penny, services was excellent and staff friendly.!"}
{"text":"The AYCE eat here is the best in town!  Service is fast and food is great!  A few items a bit spicy for me but I am a wimp.  ;)"}
{"text":"May I add, the worst sushi I've ever had . Went for all you can eat sushi with a friend . The first round we ordered had no taste , so we decided my friend decided to order another round . After we both had some figured it was time to cut our loses . After we told the cook we didn't like it he said he would \"see what he could do with out bill .\" Their solution was to All a cart our bill to \"make it cheaper.\" Which didn't quite work . To make this short . I'll never come back . Too many other options  in this town with a lot better taste ."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service but the ahi bowls taste great. Not too big of a fan of their sushi. Desserts are yummy."}
{"text":"Island Sushi is my go to for ayce sushi! They never disappoint! I love that I can get malasadas here! So good!"}
{"text":"First impression. 3 stars. We entered around 6pm on a Monday. We noticed the Please Wait to be Seated sign with a sign-in log. It was confusing because we stood there...a family of 6 just standing there for a few minutes that felt like 15minutes. We were completely ignored as if the workers were deliberately not looking up just so that they don't have to acknowledge us. After a few minutes of awkward standing...my husband walks up to the guy by the register to ask what the deal is. Then he readily explains to my husband how it works. First off, it would have been nice to have been acknowledged. I understand things get busy but I come from a background of customer service that no matter how busy you are...you should keep a constant habit of looking up at your surroundings. I almost walked out, but hell...we drove from the North side, traffic and all, just to eat dinner there for my son's birthday...I was going to stick it out.  So, apparently the please wait to be seated sign along with the put your name down is for their sushi side. When we wrote our names down it was like magic. Someone came and sat us down. We opted to eat at the sushi side because we were planning on some sushi anyways. I honestly don't know if on the grill side you have to wait to be seated. I'm assuming you'd just order then sit at whatever tables are available.  Once seated, the servers were completely friendly and homely feeling. However, I couldn't shake off this weird vibe I was getting in there. Don't know if it was the aftershock from standing around waiting part, but whatever, and so we ordered.  Kids collectively ordered the classic Loco moco, mini chicken katsu, and side order of fries. I decided for just the spam saimin, while the husband ordered spicy tuna, spicy hamachi, and the spicy salmon roll. M-W is all day happy hour. 50% off their sushi rolls with the exception of their nigiris and hand rolls. That is an awesome deal! Such deal made their sushi taste even better. The husband enjoyed his. Typical.  My saimin was pretty much....saimin. There was nothing extra special or memorable. But, I wasn't expecting anything magical considering it's simply a spam saimin. I did wish my saimin was a little less mushy. It did the job on my saimin crave, though.   I can't tell you what the katsu tasted like but the husband said twas legit. My oldest kanacked off his Loco moco. He opted for all rice and boy was that plate serious. Couldn't tell you what that tasted like, but it looked homely put together.   The fries tasted like the frozen seasoned french fries you can buy yourself. I don't mind that taste so no biggy. It was nice and crispy and that's all the mattered.  Overall, we spent about 34bucks. The server that took care of us was right-on with it. It made up for what had lacked. Once you figure out what happens when you enter...you'll pretty much be taken care of. I did notice it was a man's world that evening. Male chefs, cooks, servers...thought that was kinda cool because that's not something I aways come across. Plus, they all seemed super nice.  I'd return for sure especially for their sushi happy hour if we are in the area or feel like going on a drive. I think it's great that our family has options. The kids can get their 808 fix while the hubs and I can get our sushi on. Overall, I can only give 3 stars because it honestly was just mediocre to me. Maybe in the future I can up a star.  Definitely kid friendly. Highchairs with working buckles, yay! But leave your stroller in the trunk especially if it's busy. For a Monday night...they were poppin'."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go-to sushi place! & let me just say that I could eat sushi for breakfast lunch and dinner. Island sushi always has amazing staff members who are kind and helpful! They seem to be always busy, but we never have to wait long to be seated. The restaurant is a little small and at times I feel cramped next to the party next to me, but it is a busy place! I wish they could move to a bigger location or combine the grill and restaurant together for a bigger space! Anyways, you must try their dragon roll and baked salmon roll! Both a must have. Also they have happy hour pretty much every day! I'm not sure the exact times, but just call and find out!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and I'm so glad that they have maintained their quality throughout the years. I went here often when I lived in Vegas, and I always try to come back when I visit. The fish is fresh and delicious, comparable to sushi I eat when visiting Cali.   Service is always prompt, and the AYCE menu is very comprehensive. I love that appetizers are included. The rolls are creative without being unappetizing, which unfortunately happens at a lot of \"creative\" sushi joints.  I always recommend sitting at the bar, and try to sit in front of Chuy if you can. All the chefs are great, but he is so sociable and nice! I don't think he remembers me from when I used to come here, but he acts like he does. And, that's more than I could ever ask for. Super nice dude.  What makes this place stand out from the rest is that there is a separate side of the restaurant devoted to Hawaiian/Pacific Islander type foods, like butter mochi. You can also buy poke, there!  In short, just go eat there. It's awesome and affordable."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but I have my favorite sushi spot so its always hard to compare. It takes a few visits to a sushi place to know what you will like. But I took advantage of the great check in deal they had, all you can drink sake yummmm"}
{"text":"I haven't been in a few year and needed a quick bite to eat while working so I opted for a poke bowl and it was so ono! The cucumber salad was crisp, cold, and refreshing and the taro chips were a great textural variety in the bowl. The poke itself was fresh and perfectly seasoned, not overly salty but just right. The ratio of rice to poke/topping was good, at least that what I judge when I get poke bowls."}
{"text":"I normally stay away majorly from all-you-can-eat sushi but I have been wanting to try this place for awhile because of the good reviews, and it is literally down the street from where I live.  I wasn't planning on getting sushi, just a grill item, but when I saw the all-you-can-eat menu included appetizer portions of all the grill items I wanted to try, I dragged my husband in to try it.  He doesn't eat sushi or fish, but we both did AYCE and both ate tons of food.  Other than Spicy Tuna, this is my other favorite sushi place.  Everything was fresh and delicious, especially that garlic chicken."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great location, awesome food and service! Island Sushi and Grill is my goto place when craving Hawaiian local food or Poke from Poke Express. It's my favorite AYCE sushi joint too!   Grill side - Breakfast, great choices of plate lunches mini or regular sizes, bentos, daily specials and desserts!!!   Poke Express - many varieties of poke!!! One of my favorite is the Spicy Ahi Poke! Yummy!!!  Sushi - all time favorite AYCE! Incredible menu with my favorites of soft shell crab, geso, hamachi collar, salmon skin hand roll, and many many more!"}
{"text":"Environment: 1/5 Food: 2/5 Cost: 4/5 Employees: 5/5 Parking: 5/5 Total: 17/25  Synopsis:  So my best friend who I have known for 15 years is getting married.  So she decided to have her bachelorette in none-other, VEGAS!!!   Our first meal there was at Island Sushi. It was an L&L look alike.  Why we came here, I have no idea.  I can get this at home, really.  The food was not noteworthy.  However, what was disturbing was inside the restaurant.  The place looked so drabbed down I wouldn't want to be found dead here.  The question remains as to whether or not I would come back here again. The answer is probably no because I don't prefer plate lunches.  Environment: When you come here, it resembles so much like Hawai'i.  Didn't you know Las Vegas is the new safe house for former Hawai'i residents, who can't afford to live there?  Once inside, it wasn't too appealing in color.  You see all the metallic refrigerators, kitchen area.  The floors are drab, the walls are dark tinted yellow.  It is certainly meant for a quick and run kind of sit-in place.   Food: I had the Garlic Ahi and all brown rice.  It looked like 3 pieces of 3 oz of grilled ahi, once slice of lemon, and 2 cups of brown rice.  This will fill you up for the price.  The Garlic Ahi was a bit bland.  I would recommend having a garlic sauce to go with it to make it jump from mediocre to awesome. I should have opted out for the mini plate on this one, but because I was starving I didn't care. 3/5  Poke: Although, I didn't have this, the fish didn't look fresh.  It didn't have that shiny, unslimmy, I-Was-Just-Placed-Here kind of look to it.  Yikes! Joe and Phil decided to get it anyway.  Luckily, they chose something that was a little fresher, but the taste was not Hawai'I or my father's level of greatness. 2/5  Cost: My plate came out to be 9.95.  That's cheap, considering the brown rice was an extra $1.25.  Ridiculous.  However, what was uber expensive was the poke. $16.99 a pound!  Jesus Christ!  And if you read the latter information, you would know you were being gypped.   Employees: They were very nice.  The girl at the desk greeted with a smile.  Very courteous, it almost made me forget that the place was a POS.  Parking: This was by far the best feature of this place.  Because it's Vegas, meaning more land space, we had prime real estate, also known as right in front of the doors."}
{"text":"Didn't have the all you can eat, but their banana dessert looked delish. People I went with did all you can eat, and ordered alot...i mean ALOT of sushi...  People seemed down to earth and since I went with people from Hawaii everything seem to be goodtimes...  I would go back for their all you can eat sushi and good times w/ good company."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite place to go for sushi. But we have found if you go on 1/2 price rolls nights it takes very long for rolls (like over a hour) we watched as the\"all you can eat crowed had multiple rolls.   Also the Booths are very worn and i normally ask for a table instead."}
{"text":"This place is really South of the strip, and if you're in Vegas for vacation, you'd probably have to take a taxi to get here, because taking the bus is a long journey. But this place is so worth the trip! All you can eat sushi, and they include a lot of fancy rolls! The quality is great and unlike other all-you-can-eat sushi joints, they don't leave out a lot of the more expensive choices! I definitely plan on going here every Vegas trip!   On a side note, this place is joined together with a Hawaiian plate restaurant that looks pretty decent itself. I might have to try it out next time. Nice Hawaiian music playing in the background too!"}
{"text":"When you're as big of a sushi glutton as I am, the prospect of all-you-can-eat sushi is really tempting. But when you're as big of a sushi glutton as I am, you've tried it already and know it isn't very good or very fresh. Most places are run by indifferent Chinese or Korean people who just want to give you whatever can pass for sushi and then charge you as much as they can for it, or deep fry everything to mask the fact that none of the fish is very fresh.  Island Sushi is different. As far as I can tell, everything was nice and fresh, service was good, the appetizers were amazing (thus providing a more diversified AYCE experience than just eating roll after roll), and of course they still have to cut their losses somehow so there is a 90 minute time limit which I am totally okay with.  We stumbled out of this place satisfied and not feeling cheated, and went off to digest while firing AK47s at the Gun Store. Perfect day! :)"}
{"text":"That mochiko chicken is really good. Pair it with a can or 2 of lychee green tea and you're golden. I ordered the mini mochiko chicken bowl, spam musubi and a lychee green tea on my recent trip to Las Vegas. I had heard of Island Sushi a while back but had never been until then. I'm glad I finally went as the food, service and vibe of the place is what I look for when I seek out local food in Vegas. It's a chill place with good food. That's what I seek.  Located along Eastern Ave near the 215 FWY and in the same plaza as Red Rice. Parking lot is shared with the other businesses so just avoid the 30 min only parking spots.  The mochiko chicken was tasty. It had a seasoned batter on it and I really liked that the chicken was still moist on the inside. The only thing I would change is maybe dip the chicken in some katsu or teriyaki sauce next time. Other than that, I really liked it. It came with about 5-6 pieces of chicken, 1 scoop of rice and a side of mac salad. I recommend it for sure. The spam musubi was good and tasty. Cant go wrong with a musubi... The lychee green tea is my favorite of all the Hawaiian Sun drinks. So good. It's like the best flavor, best water ever.   Service is friendly. Food is cooked to order so dont mind the wait, it will be worth it. But definitely prepare to wait a little while especially during the lunch rush. Good food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ono grinds!!! Best island style food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Besides the AYCE sushi, we have tried the hamburger steak (great!), fried saimin (good) and won ton mein (real good).  AYCE menu is good and diverse. Did not care for the Mickey's Rice and IMO, if you are doing AYCE, you want to stay away from this because it is filling. Son loves the mochiko chicken and gets at least 2 each visit. My favorite roll is the Chuy. Favorite dessert is the 808 Special but the Brownie Delight comes in a close second.  Sometimes service seems a little slow and/or unorganized.  Sushi Chefs are always welcoming and greet many of the guests. Expect to wait at peak times as seating area is small. Any items besides the rolls may take a bit to get to the table it seems so order those ASAP before choosing your sushi so it can get started."}
{"text":"I hate to write a 3 star review for this place... but I prolly wont come back again after my recent visit.  I was a huge fan of SUSHI Mon on Sahara ave earlier.  been there a total of 3 times and on the 3rd time, the sashimi on the rice was thin and lacking.  The food wasnt prepared right... some of the hot items were lukewarm instead.  Nigiri was falling apart so I went to Island Sushi after friend's suggestion.  Been there now the 5th time.  Same thing is happening.  At first, I love this place for its rolls.  It has all sorts of amazing sushi rolls... deep fried sushi with cream cheese, or Las Vegas rolls.  Its sashimi portion was generous while the rice was minimal.  No rice pushing.    The AYCE menu is awesome with many choices... typically the one time order for Uni, Sweet Shrimp and you can always put the sweet shrimp into the soup.  In addition, you can also have the POKE dishes which are awesome, i love the many cool items such as fish head, shrimp tempura.  On this visit, the rice was increasing and sashimi didnt look fresh.  The items came but it wasnt as appetizing as before.  The Unagi was horribly made, it was just a clump of fish and rice and wasnt beautifully presented like before.  Alot of rice in the hand rolls and overall food quality isnt as great.  Im afraid to say, maybe it was an off day, but I did notice an overall decrease in quality.  Its still good, just not as good.  So I will give a 2 star!"}
{"text":"I have been to the sushi side of island sushi quite a few times and it is decent sushi, not great but decent. The only time I go there is during happy hour when stuff is 50% off. If you want great sushi go to Yama Sushi.  As for the grill side, the food is horrible. I had the Kalbi ribs and the teriyaki chicken. The Kalbi ribs tasted like old meat... it was gross. The teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki flavor whatsoever and it did not even come with teriyaki sauce. Also, the macaroni salad was the worst Hawaiian mac salad I have ever tasted. It was extremely bland. The food was so horrible it seemed as if it was prepared this way on purpose to keep people away. I just don't see how they could make the food so bad!  If you want good Hawaiian food go to Aloha Kitchen. I have tried tons of other Hawaiian joints and I keep going back to Aloha.  As for the service, it is decent. It does seem as if the service is steadily declining though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found ourselves visiting Las Vegas again and we knew that we must go to Island Sushi for AYCE sushi again. This time we went for lunch on a Wednesday and it was a little busy. The sushi was great and again the Nigiri was fresh. After enjoying our rolls and Nigiri we had the 808 special. It tasted even better than last time. Island Sushi you lived up to what we had been craving since we visited last year. If you are looking for a good AYCE sushi place this is THE place to go in Las Vegas. We will go back to Island Sushi again next time we visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"not sure what's happening with ISG but my last visit was terrible. this review is based solely on my visit on 7-20 @ 9:05pm I was craving a nice HOT bowl of saimin, hubby was agreeable so we stopped in at ISG. we both ordered the saimin deluxe with 4 extra wontons each and 6 vanilla malasadas. we sat ourselves and waited for our soup. and waited. and waited. 20 mins later we got of food. I understand if it was busy, but we were the only ones waiting and the other table was already eating. okay, whatever. I can get past this because their food is good. grabbed my spoon and dug in. and said WTF?!!??! this was lukewarm broth with cold wontons and cold char siu. I couldn't take another bite and took my bowl back up to the counter and asked them to please do something with this cause it's not hot. got it back 5 mins later - soup was warmer but a few wontons were still cold and stuck together. I just shook my head and ate. hubby's soup was no better but he was starving and just ate the noodles and char siu, left everything else.     it's so disappointing especially when you expect a certain level of service and quality of food. I don't think HOT soup is too much to ask for, no matter what time you come into an establishment. I'm sure each item/ingredient was refrigerated and heated as needed/per order, and that's fine, but what's not okay and unacceptable is to serve soup without making sure everything has come to proper temperature and is out of the food danger zone."}
{"text":"Great place nice happy hour. Waiter was extremely kind and knowledgeable he had a little bit of an accent hard to understand at times but great service and comfortable place."}
{"text":"My friend took me here a few weeks ago for the bentos. I had the garlic chicken and I was hooked after the 1st bite. I lived on Oahu for a few years and this place takes me back. I had the chicken katsu curry yesterday and that also was a hit. The bonus of both visits were the malasada's which reminds me of Leonard's Bakery on Kapahulu ave...yeah, they\"re that good. Ono grinds for sure"}
{"text":"So Cal Residents going to Vegas enjoying a lunch buffet ... this would probably be the least expected buffet place that someone would think of going to.. but trust me... it is worth it! I wouldn't say this place is sushi heaven but ... for an all you can eat $25 a person, sure enough-- this definitely lives beyond its expectation.   5 girls, in our late 20's- ate 67 plates! YuP, we have a proof of what we ate from the final check. That's right we had 67 plates.   Here are what I thought was a must try:  - Sweet shrimp ( its limited 1 per person)  - Uni * Get it but its not 100% recommended, not as fresh as I wanted it to be *  - Egg plant tempura  - Their Dessert with Fried Banana and Ice Cream ( make sure you get it without the whip cream ) this is to DIE FOR! Definitely try this.   All of the other rolls and appetizers are all pretty decent but as far as what i thought was really good are what I had listed above.   Try this place, Its worth a try and experience."}
{"text":"I can't really explain how awesome this sushi place!! You have to come and try out EVERYTHING it will not disappoint you I promise."}
{"text":"Coming from beach area in Southern CA, we are somewhat sushi snobs as it is quite fresh where we are. That being said, we have always been a bit hesitant to try sushi in the middle of a desert! At the request of a friend, we did finally try Island Sushi and now wish we could get there every week from So. Cal!!! Nothing beats it and the all-you-can-eat price ROCKS! Food was awesome! Service was wonderful and they encouraged us to try some new things that were so good! Worth every penny! Our new favorite place in town! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Very great sushi and reasonably priced. The poke is awesome and the service was terrific"}
{"text":"Island Sushi was good. They had really good sushi. Went here for happy hour and AYCE for the first of 3 engagement parties. There were about 20 of us so it took a while to get started with food orders. We had to get drink orders first. Once that was out of the way, we were able to get started.  Once we put in our food order, it started coming out fast. The food was fresh and it was delicious. I would definitely come here again. The servers were nice and attentive and we were a busy group ordering a bunch of drinks and a lot of food. Topped it off with tempura ice cream and we were too full to party after. It was a good night."}
{"text":"This sushi place was recommended to me as I live about 30 miles out of Henderson. I was very impressed with the menu and our server (possibly the owner) was quick to offer suggestions and brought me multiple sauces to compliment my order. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The all you can eat dinner special is so worth it! Definitely get your moneys worth. The food is so good! One of the best sushi places I've been too."}
{"text":"Food was good except for one of the fish being slimy so I sent it back.  There were 5 plus a 6 month old baby, and service charge was added.  Really with a baby occupied a seat there was a service added?"}
{"text":"We came with a group and there were at least 20 of us. I asked about a specific roll because I am allergic to shrimp and crab. Not only did she double check, she would warn me each time she place a dish down that had either shrimp or crab. With so many people ordering, that was really going above and beyond. The food quality is very good. I was a little nervous going into an AYCE but it was really fresh. Everyone was happy with the food.There was not a bad dish on the table. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Las Vegas. Thank you Island Sushi and Grill!"}
{"text":"We love this place :) They do it right. Great sushi, nice environment, and the staff is friendly and attentive. But our favorite part is the malasadas for desert. Soooooo good! Fried Polynesian doughnuts filled with your choice of chocolate, coconut, or custard.. AMAZING! We've been here too many times to count and we'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I found this place doing a Yelp search while planning my trip to LV.  And the lovely thing was my cousin and LV resident, highly recommended this place for AYCE sushi.  The great thing about this place (to me) is that it's away from the LV Strip.  Been there, done that, y'know? Sometimes off the beaten track is best and Island Sushi did not disappoint!  This place is a hole-in-the-wall. No doubt about that.  You want a Zen or tranquil or a sleek sushi house experience, this ain't it.  This is get-down-to-business-eat-your-sushi-or-Hawaiian-favorites kinda joint.   We had a fantastic experience.  The servers were great. Always checking on us, clearing plates, refilling glasses and making sure if we wanted more sushi--and not in a \"hurry up and order\" kind of way, but in a genuine \"would you like more to eat?\" kind of way.    This was my first time doing AYCE sushi (other than Todai which I hated, so I won't count that).  We made sure we understood the rules and then we ordered well.  Very well.  Everything was delicious. Well made and fresh.   We ordered Ahi Poke and Hammachi Kama.  The Ahi Poke was my favorite--the flavors so fresh. I wish I could re-create it at home because I'd eat it at least once a week. The Hammachi was delicious too. It reminded me of the grilled fish my dad serves.  Nigiri: Tuna, Cajun Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Super White Tuna, Albacore, Hammachi, Salmon, Ebi and Unagi.  Some we loved so much we ordered them twice (and 3 times in the case of Garlic Tuna)    Maki: Tiger, Spicy Mexican, Joe's Special.  All so good. If you like Jalapeno and Siracha, the Mexican roll is for you.  For me, it had a nice heat, not too spicy.  The Tiger Roll was my favorite because I love shrimp tempura and spicy tuna--well made and tasty. Joe's Special--I don't know who Joe is, but this is also a fine roll--shrimp tempura, cucumber and ahi.   Save room for dessert.  In fact, if you're full, order dessert anyway.  They're not huge portions but are certainly delicious.  I had the Malassada sundae, made with warm malassada donuts, vanilla ice cream, strawberries and guava sauce drizzle. Every bite was delicious.  I also got to try the warm brownie sundae--also very good. The brownie is dense and rich, almost like a flourless chocolate cake.   The bro is good at math so I had him check our AYCE price versus if we just paid a la carte--the AYCE is definitely a steal.  This is certainly better than any buffet style AYCE sushi because you can order off of 3 different pages of Nigiri and Maki and side dishes and everything is fresh to order."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, customer service, ambience and music! We enjoyed the comfort we immediately received upon entering.  This place is just simple and sweet!"}
{"text":"So after eating at Island Sushi this is now my go to place for AYCE sushi and Hawaiian food.  When one of our friends that lives in Vegas brought us here we were  a bit hesitant about this place.  We walked in and I swear it felt like I just walked into a cafe from Hawaii.  The smell of the malasadas were awesome.  I love how there's a bakery on one side and the restaurant on the other.  So we sat down, a party of 14, and  all ordered AYCE... The faces on the sushi chefs were classic. Hahaha We ordered pretty much every roll they had and every single one was bomb.  I cant remember the names but damn they were good.  The one that got me was the Uni and kimchee fried rice.  Damn that uni was damn good.  I could eat tons of that kimchee fried rice.  So we came to the desert and first thing i see is the malasada ice cream sundae.  WHAT! oh hell yes I will take one pls.  Their malasada was so good we ordered 2 dozen before we left. Hahahaha not as good as Leonards in Hawaii but pretty damn close. The service was the best as close as you can get to the aloha spirit of Hawaii.  Some even still have their pidgin accent. Awesome.   I will definitely be coming here again.. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I'd really love to give this place five stars because the food is so bomb and the service on the dine-in side was so fun but I can't because I am 0 for 2 ordering food at the take out side.   First the good: the sushi here is SO GOOD. They have specialty rolls and during happy hour all rolls are half off. I would actually argue that this is as good if not a better deal than their AYCE option. With AYCE you feel obligated to stuff yourself and that hardly ever ends well for anyone. 50% off allows you to try a few things that you'll enjoy and if you stop at a reasonable point, you'll end up spending less than you would for all you can eat.   The service is also good on the restaurant side. Though I had some issues when I was there a couple weeks ago. We had AYCE and the wait staff sometimes took ages to bring out our food and sometimes put the order in twice so two of a given dish would come out (and with all you can eat there's some hazard to double ordering..). Anyway, both of those things happened twice which I didn't care for but the staff were all super sweet so it's hard to get annoyed.   The food is solid though and definitely the #1 reason I keep coming back. This is my favorite place for local food in this area..so give it a try! They also have daily specials on the take out side and some of them look REALLY good. Though if I'm here I like to do sushi. Yum."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype! This place is as average as they come. We came in with a large group. Service was super crappy & the pregnant girl ( being me ) ordered 4 rolls and never got any of it. One of my cousins paid $27 all you can eat sushi she only received kapa roll seaweed salad and miso soup . Only thing that was good was the mochi ice cream packaged most likely. I will take my ass back to the bay and get some real sushi"}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is wonderful the customer service is great the location is on point all around this place is off the chain. I will let all my friends and family know about this great restaurant"}
{"text":"Service: I name this first because this is where they lacked so much. It was like \"waiving your hand in class\" kind of service. The servers acted like they were burdened when asking something from them. There is no friendliness and smiles only when they were chitchatting in the corner.  Food: I asked them if they served a lot of rice with their nigiri and they told me no and believe me they serve a lot of rice. The sushi flavor is ok. Not the best that I tasted. Presentation: crap! You are serving food. And they are presenting food. It's not just to scarf down. It looked like they just plopped it on the plate. And also for desert they just scooped it in the bowl.  Come on people. Let's get it together."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! I was so excited to see that you now can order online and have it delivered. If only every restaurant did that. Way to adhere to customer needs!! Food is always hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Aloha LV Yelpers!  Came to Island Sushi about 3 years ago when I was visiting Vegas... stopped by to pick up a plate lunch to go...   3 years later... I'm back at Island Sushi as a Las Vegas resident! Came here the other night... AYCE!!!  I'm a huge fan! Everything I love from seaweed salad, poke, lomi salmon, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, teri beef, malasada, coco puffs, unique rolls with fun names... I'm sold!  I wish I.S. was closer to me... I would be there weekly for sure!   If you're looking for Hawaiian food and sushi with a local twist... Island Sushi is the hot spot!  I feel at home when I'm here... locals everywhere... Big Island pictures on the wall... including Hilo my hometown... one of the girls working there as a server is from Hilo... I love being around Hawaii people!  I'll be back for my Hawaiian fix... AYCE works for me!   A must while in Vegas!  Mahalo Island Sushi! -Miss Yelp 2011"}
{"text":"No clue why this place has some good reviews. I'll chalk it up to unrefined sushi palates. This place was terrrrrrribble. The grocery store sushi has more flavor than this place! I'm so confused at what I just paid for. Oh, I know: Rice and Sysco MAYONNAISE. There was ZERO flavor here, and frankly, the temperature of the fish was disconcerting. Don't waste your money or risk your health.     In response to Terrance: You seem confused. Did you read my review?? I said your sushi was *COVERED* in mayonnaise and sauces. How is that protecting the \"integrity\" of your fish? I couldn't even taste the fish! All I could taste was that it was cheap quality and warm. Yuck. Go to Sushi Mon and see what a real, quality standard sushi place looks and tastes like."}
{"text":"We ate at the sushi part of the restaurant. At first, we were confused with the restaurant's set-up. 1 entrance door, but 3 different restaurants. One was Hawaiian food, the other was a Poke place, and the other was Sushi.  Our servers were Johnny and Mac. They are both very nice. Mac is so attentive and great with his customer service.  The food was very good, but I ordered Uni and it did not taste fresh. And for the AYCE, you only get 2 rounds to order food. Am used to having 3 rounds in other places. Some of the items on their menu, you get to only get to order once."}
{"text":"By far the BEST AYCE sushi in Vegas!!   My husband and I have done AYCE several times at other restaurants and have been cheated. Every time we hit $30 worth of sushi the servers quit serving us. At Island Sushi they kept the food coming and it was AWESOME! Good lord their shrimp tempura was soooo goodddd! Like melt in your mouth good! The baked mussel was a bit spicy but still good! Japanese lasagna? GOOD! The servers were super nice and attentive! They kept asking us if we needed anything and would bring us anything we needed. They were also super nice about allowing us share with our 2 year old. Granted we didn't share everything with her, just the dessert, but still it was nice of them to allow us to share. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get hawaiian style poke and malasadas."}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi. The fish is always fresh and yummy, many good selection choices for the value you spend here. You can order boxed Japanese style with one up to three choices . Miso soup comes with your meal.  This is a small place so if they are busy you have to wait. Sometimes you'll get lucky and get to sit up at sushi bar and watch them make your sushi rolls. It is a place you'll see a lot of local people from hawaii in here as it is so called the 9th Island for a reason. Just keep the conversation going and hear the pigeon come out in most of the people in the Restruant.  Nothing like good food, mokes, hanging out with friends and family. This is how we normally do it the islands anyways. Enjoy the great sushi and service....... ALOHA! and Mahalos for letting me share."}
{"text":"Island Sushi has a lot of potential to it, but unfortunately to me it seemed like just another ordinary sushi bar. The service here is nice, but it's more of the dishes that are bland. Nothing over the top or colorful. This is more of a neighborhood sushi bar to get your fix with sushi if you're not looking for anything over the top.  Came here twice with a group of friends who sat in the dining area and with a friend who sat at the bar. Both times seating was ready and available. Waitresses were nice and so were the chefs at the bar. The only dispute I have is with the miso soup. Way, *way* too salty for its own good. Everything else tasted great, though. Even though Island Sushi is A-OK, I wouldn't mind stopping by here again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This used to be one of favorite Hawaiian/sushi places but the last few times I have ordered, the food wasn't that great.  The rice was over cooked, so mushy which made everything soak into it. For example the loco moco, the gravy soaked into the rice and made it even more mushy. Same with the sushi, the rice wasn't as great as other sushi joints, it lacked love and flavor. It could've been a bad day and that's ok, we all have our off days.   I believe the hardest way to keep the flavor and the food the best is when it's delivered. Postmates is a God send but the food doesn't taste as if I sat down there to eat a good meal.   My girlfriend and I order a lot of food from this place, whether it's the sushi, the desserts, the entrees or the poke, it varies.   I do have to say the poke is some of the best!"}
{"text":"Huge menu with a large dining room. Take out is fast and easy. The freshest sushi around."}
{"text":"So ono!  We live in Texas so we had to load up on all our favorites!  Super flavorful, authentic,  friendly and helpful staff.  Be sure to hit the poke bar, and take some musubi and malasadas to go after you fill up."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem while out and about. Sushi was excellent quality, great taste and very fresh!! Menu choices were plenty. Service was speedy, food arrived very quickly. Waitstaff was extremely attentive, taking the time to recommend items based on our choices, and recommendations were always on par!! Prices were reasonable. Would definitely recommend to friends and will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"The only thing I ever eat here is pork and eggplant, it's good but today I asked for easy grilled onions bcuz it's flooded with half an onion and it came out with HALF an ONION! Disappointed! Drove 30 minutes."}
{"text":"It was a little comfort home food since we haven't been home to Hawaii in over a year and Texas has almost no good Hawaii food. Bought some chantilly coco puffs, chantilly wasn't as good as zippy's but it was good enough. The fried noodles was alright and so was the mochiko chicken. My husband likes his eggs sunny side but when his loco moco came it was more like over easy-medium. He still ate it and enjoyed it because the closest he has on the road as a truck driver is custom ordering a hamburger steak and everything else on the side."}
{"text":"Love this side of Island Grill that has great fresh poke and great tasting Hawaiian grinds (eats). The Island Sushi side is always great for great, creative sushi and more. Best of both food worlds: Hawaiian Food and Sushi!"}
{"text":"Wow! Blown away with the service and tasty food across the board. First time having all you can eat- great value - you get unlimited apps, sides, rolls and 2 desserts. The baked mussels were great, my favorite roll was the Mauna Kea and both my desserts- strawberry mochi & creme brûlée were sooo good!! The best part was the fantastic service. We sat at the sushi bar and got the pleasure of meeting the owner Terry & another sushi chef named Jason - they made me a custom spicy sauce to top my rolls with and were so sweet about getting us anything we needed. Very fast service, we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of AYCE sushi but we were invited to a birthday party dinner here.  The drink deals were awesome but I wouldn't return for the food.  None of the sushi stood out as fantastic.  The poke was good and if I was in the mode for poke only, I might return."}
{"text":"Used to be super good place but hired new people and the service is terrible. Food is amazing but wish the same people still work here"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday evening with my family and when we walked in we were not greeted nor acknowledged. We stood there for about 5 minutes reading the menu that's posted above the register. Everyone seemed busy and I was trying to make eye contact with someone so we could place an order but no one bothered to ask. We walked out after 10 minutes of being IGNORED.   Fast forward to a few days later, I decided to give this place another chance for lunch and order to go since we live across the street. I called and the guy who answered the phone said \"please hold\". I was on hold for about 5 mins before I hung up and tried calling again. I received another \"please hold\" and continued to hold for another 5 minutes. At this point I'm just furious. I call back a third time and get the same \"please hold\" I ask the guy on the phone if they are even taking to go orders right now because it seems like they are not wanting any business. He says sorry that he had a big group come in and asked me to \"please hold\" once again. I hung up and will never ever bother trying this place. Don't waste your time. DON'T COME HERE!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Grill part of Island Sushi & Grill.  There's a huge difference between the two.    You walk into this restaurant and unless you know the drill, it can be a bit confusing.  The menu is plastered on the flat screen with a good variety of Hawaiian eats.  Then you look to the right and there's a curtain leading into the Sushi side of the restaurant, where you need to sign your name and wait for a greeter to come out.  We have yet to try the sushi, so I can't comment.   Back to the Grill.  You can always mix the plates for two meats, add brown rice for a fee.  Chicken katsu curry- breaded with panko, fried to a beautiful brown, then a scoopful of curry spread over the chicken.  The chicken evenly sliced and you could see a good cut of meat with just enough panko crust for a good crisp texture.   Lau Lau- Last I heard, they do fly it in from Hawaii, so you can't mess this one up since it's from a trusted brand.  Good chunk of meat, good small bit of butterfish and love the taro leaves.  Kalua Pork- This is one of my favorite.  It has a nice smokey flavor, good shredded pork and a small amount of cabbage (some times more cabbage, which I like).  A simple, yet flavorful and satisfying dish.  Come for saimin, oxtail soup, local moco, musubi or Korean bbq.  So far, this is my favorite place for authentic Hawaiian flavors.    They have malasadas (not a fan), haupia desserts, chocolate this, banana that, a whole display case that can be quite luring.    Pay $2 for the frequent customer loyalty card.  After you spend $250, they credit $25 for food here. (This card is not good for the poke counter, just for the kitchen food and sushi from the restaurant)."}
{"text":"Was really hoping to enjoy this place like most of the yelpers.  Food was ok.  Katsu was hard.  We think oil was too high so Katsu was really on the dark side.  Sushi was kinda bad.  Seemed most rolls were trenched in a sauce.  Probably would be really good without soaking it.  I really wanted to like this place since the service was AWESOME.  They were so nice, but they did forget a couple of our rolls."}
{"text":"I was put off by the location and ambiance, but wow did they shut me up. A clear example as to why you shouldn't \"judge a book by it's cover.\" Probably the best all you can eat sushi you can find. Every single roll was amazing and memorable.  All you can eat for $20? this place is at least worth $40!  Great value. Great Sushi. Great service."}
{"text":"when we walked into island sushi, the first people we saw were some local looking people from hawaii.  so already, this is a GOOD sign! the food gotta be good here if people from home are eating here!  we felt like we were still in hawaii at this place, even our nice waitress looked like one local.  my wife did her research which is why we ended up here.  she already knew what she was gonna order so she starts rattling off a whole bunch of stuff to our waitress who goes, \"you sure you no like get the all you can eat? most of those things are on the all you can eat menu.\".   so we went that route.    ordered 2 orders of teri beef, 2 orders salmon katsu, 2 orders of poke, vegetable tempura, edamame, miso soup, and somen salad.  for the rolls, we got the katsu roll, ahi fever roll, lahaina roll, california roll, poke roll, island special roll, and 007 roll.  our favorite was the the katsu roll.  i almost thought we werent gonna finish everything, but we did! every last bit.  and for dessert we got green tea ice cream (it comes with the ayce!).  by then, we were so full so we just shared one.  check out their website, it describes all the rolls on there.    will definitely be back here again next time we come to vegas."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi. Usually all you can eat places lack quality of food, but Island sushi did not. I love there Mochi chicken and sushi. I think it was $20 a person which is a steal when eating sushi. The service was prompt and the facility was clean. Definitely going back when I'm in Vegas again visiting my bf's family"}
{"text":"LOVE IT.    You know a Hawaiian place is good when almost everyone who eats there is obviously from Hawaii.  Haven't had the sushi yet, but I've gone back a few times for the oyako donburi, which is fabulous.  The loco moco is delicious, too.    But the best thing going for this place is the malasadas!  As far as I know it's the only place in Vegas to get them and they are GOOOOOOD!  Okay, so they're not Leonard's, but they are almost as good.  Just a little more dense.  And they keep well, too.  (My husband actually thinks they're better than Leonard's because even after sitting for several hours, the sugar doesn't dissolve into the malasada.)"}
{"text":"Bad service!!! I called to place an order and when I was picking it up I stand right in front of the register for almost 5 mins and no body even told me that they will be with me for a second!!! And to make matters worse another guy cut right in front of me and they service him real fast!!! I'm never coming to this place again the employees are horrible and management too"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the sushi here ! I love to stuff my self with the all you can eat. it is nice to be able to go to have sushi with my husband because he will not eat sushi but loves their spam and eggs and yes I married him any way . If I cant stay to eat I love to get take out from the poke bar my favorite is the salmon poke . I am always happy with my meal and the service."}
{"text":"This review is for the Loco Moco.  It was okay. The patty was a little too over cooked and I left eating less than half of it. The salad it came with was pretty yummy. I liked the dressing. It's really small inside but pretty busy so they must have some pretty good stuff. What I chose wasn't a winner so if I do go back I'll definitely try something different."}
{"text":"I'm pretty loyal to my regular sushi joint and I don't care for AYCE but after hearing so many good things about Island sushi I decided to give them a try.  The theme of the evening was: small. Maybe Im not used to the AYCE portion sizes but the nigiri sushi and rolls were really small. Even my malasada sundae was small with only a little scoop of ice cream in a little cup.   Island sushi has a strict policy that you must pay for anything you don't finish so not sure why the portions are small. The fish was fresh and the rolls were good, nothing spectacular though. We also ordered the hamachi Kama which was nice to see on the menu (1 per person). You are also able to order many non-sushi items.  The service was very good and I also thought it was a pretty good value for $26.95 pp for dinner so that raised my rating to 3 stars. None of the sushi was outstanding or blew me away though.  I guess AYCE just isn't for me."}
{"text":"There are so many AYCE sushi options in Las Vegas, and there are a few good ones that I have found, but this place is one of my favorites, in spite of it being really out of the way from where I live.   I actually came here with classmates awhile back, and I was hooked on the friendly atmosphere and service, and the great food!  I love the mochiko chicken appetizer, even though I know I should be getting my belly full on the sushi and the rolls.  It is definitely a restaurant that is best to visit with at least 3+ friends, so everyone can order and sample more variety of their specialty rolls.  There has also been a 1/3 ownership change in the past few months, and minor menu update with additional items added to the menu offering. So when you go, try the new items and see if any will become your new favorites.  For me, I love the fried baby octopus and the dipping sauce that it is served with.  I dare say that it is the BEST baby squid dish of Las Vegas and would totally fit in on the menu of izakaya restaurants like Ichicha or Ita-Cho (in Los Angeles).  AYCE Price: Lunch-$20.99 Dinner-$24.95  Sundays from 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM Sushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch All you can eat sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95 (Have yet to try this, but hopefully I will soon)  They also have a Hawaiian lunch plate style restaurant, which you would actually walk into before going through the entry way on the right into the sushi bar part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"omg, I LOVE POKE!!! It was awesome. I don't remember what it was called but I had the spicy avocado poke and omg I DIED!! then i had Hawaiian food which was pretty much spam, rice, eggs and of course as a Korean-American that's delicious/comforting. I also had HI soda AND Portuguese donut. It was delicious.  Everything was less than $20 and delicious and plentiful, if I'm back in Vegas I'm soo coming here."}
{"text":"YUM.    that's the first word that pops into my head when i think of islands sushi. this restaurant has become one of my favorites in vegas.  i don't really like being reminded of home when i'm on vacation, but the food, family-friendly atmosphere & service has been totally awesome, like restaurants back in hawaii.  it's hard to find exceptionally great sushi/local food on the mainland.  if i were to move here to the 9th island, i wouldn't be too sad.  my last visit was great, but not as satisfying only because of pregnancy.  i can't tolerate certain smells and i certainly don't eat much at this point. i was also told to stay away from sashimi, which is fine since i'm not a huge fan.  i like to make the most of buffets and i just couldn't do it, so i decided to not take advantage of the all-you-can-eat deal and instead got a bento box.   i didn't make a mistake. it was very yummy!  i chose the bento box a - teri beef w/furikake rice, yakisoba, spam and choice of chicken.  i went with the garlic chicken.  it was a lot of food for $8.25. i had to take it home.  didn't eat much of the chicken (i think i had an aversion to it) but pounded the spam and half of the teri beef.  my son enjoyed it too.  i was surprised that he sat still and ate good.   the 808 special is the bomb. i missed that, some of the rolls and basically just the all you can eat deal. i'm definitely looking forward to it next time 'cause i won't be pregnant when i come back (i think).  almost forgot.. their malasadas are good too :)"}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last month cause I'm in Vegas for work and this place is amazing! The staff is always friendly and helpful and I feel like I'm back in Hawaii with the aloha spirit and island music! The food is consistently delicious and I love getting the teishoku or all you can eat sushi! The teishoku comes with a main dish (or 2 or 3 choices for a main), salad, California roll, miso soup, edamame and a dessert all for $11!! WHAT?!? Crazy reasonable ($11 is for a one choice) and I always have food to take home! There are a number of desserts to choose from to pair with your teishoku and I can never decide.  The alll-you-can-eat is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. Great deals no matter what as the food is always tasty and fresh and the service is fabulous! They have a bakery section when you first enter the restaurant with favorites of Hawaii, such as dobash cakes, cream puffs, chocolate and butter mochi by the slice, guava cake, custard pie, and several other goodies!!  If I could give 10 stars I would!! We'll be back for our sushi fix!!"}
{"text":"Daniel was a great help and assisted with our meal. The punch bowl was fabulous n sushi was great for my tummy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times before and only had sushi. This time I tried the mochiko chicken and garlic ahi...I think I'll stick with their sushi. Garlic Ahi was rubbery and over cooked. Mochiko Chicken had no flavor at all!!! The mochiko chicken I'm used to is nothing like this.   On the other hand the Hiyako was good. But no one could screw that up. Lol."}
{"text":"So disappointing cause the food is pretty decent but the place and service kills it.   You enter from the Hawaiian place to another doorway to the sushi place. Although they claim to be combined restaurants you are not allowed to eat in either one unless you're ordering from there.. even if there's no more room. We were already seated with water and they told us to get up and move.. And there was no people on that side. We ended up leaving.  The waiters on the sushi side are not nice at all and can't even accommodate you..  On the Hawaiian food side, I always ordering from a particular Asian girl with tats. She just doesn't make you feel welcome and comfortable and it's just seems like you're a hassle when she's taking your order.  Me and my friends pledged never to go there mainly because of the service"}
{"text":"I've heard mixed things about this sushi spot over the years, so I finally ventured over with my OG for some all you can eat sushi action and see for myself.  The wait was pretty long but they were able to seat us quickly if we sat at the bar. The restaurant is very small and cramped. The seating was especially tight at the bar.   I figured sitting at the bar, service would be better since we had direct access to the sushi chef, but I was wrong. It was hard to get his attention to order anything and there was a number of items we ordered and never received. The service from the kitchen was the same. Slow and on several occasions they brought out what we ordered to another table only to let us know and we were forced to wait a little longer for our items.   The service issues were enough to make me not interested in returning, but the food didn't really do it for me either. No standouts and almost every dish was something I've had better versions of at other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"My cousin took us here for dinner at Island Sushi... this hole in the wall place has tasty sushi, yummy Hawaiian food and the BEST malasadas in the mainland!   Wiped out a rainbow roll, chicken katsu and the 808 Special (a humongous dessert with deep fried bananas, 2 scoops of ice cream, fruits and whipped cream).  Did I mention that their malasadas are the best that I've had on the mainland?  Cause they are!!  Okay, I've only been here one, but for that one visit....oh man!  They were so good!  I hope that the next time we go here, there malasadas are still scrumptiously divinely yummy!!  It is located off of the Strip so if you're visiting Vegas, then you'll have to drive or take a taxi.  It is worth it though!  If you are from Vegas, then check them out for yourself."}
{"text":"Island Sushi is by far one of the best Hawaiian style sushi restaurants in the entire city of Las Vegas and Henderson. The all-you-can-eat menu is awesome and I highly recommend them. The only thing you need to arrive with is a empty stomach"}
{"text":"Island sushi is one of the local hotspots.Food, service and environment is always great! We had no complaints. The food doesn't take long to make and the servers are always attentive and understanding!! Mac is our favorite server because he is the best!!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. It's really gone downhill. I did the all you can eat and the sushi tasted fishy and like a refrigerator. I talked to the manager and he insisted on charging me the full all you can eat price for just 4 pieces of sushi because I couldn't continue eating with such poor quality. What happened to Island sushi?"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas, I have to eat here!  The sushi is amazing and the staff is great!  I love the half price sushi if you come in late!"}
