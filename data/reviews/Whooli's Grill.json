{"text":"Used to go here all the time in its original location...  Apparantly on the other side of Independence the prices doubled..  Strolled in the other Saturday not knowing they had moved a few years ago.  Wanted a good sandwich and fries..  Well the fries dont come with a sandwich and cost $2.50 extra !  A Cheesesteak and Fries cost me around 12 smackers pre tip..  The food was pretty good but come on...  15 bucks for a decent lunch at a bar with no beer ordered?"}
{"text":"Best bar in town. Really friendly staff and great liquor selections. Food is amazing as well. It looks like a hole in the wall but is actually my favorite hangout to play pool, and watch games. Has a Huge 135\" projector screen TV."}
{"text":"The food here will shock and amaze you.  I have been going here for almost 10 years and have never been less than pleased for my order or the service.  The wings are great don't miss the whooli sauce and the teriyaki with wasabi ranch for dipping.  My favorite sandwich is the grilled Monterrey Chicken with bacon, mushroom, swiss and ranch, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  On Fridays don't miss the Prime-rib sandwich cooked to order and served with au jus and horseradish.  The beer on tap is always cold and fresh and affordable as well.  Over all you can't go wrong I could sit here and write all day about the huge club sandwiches, Rubens, in house made soups, buffalo shrimp but now I am getting hungry."}
{"text":"This place is never open and they dont answer the phone. I admit that I eat a late lunch. But this is the 3rd time either the doors are locked or the kitchen is not open."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, quality food, Prime Rib on Friday. Better get your order in in early! Pool tables and outdoor area to enjoy as well. Very enjoyable atmosphere to chill!"}
{"text":"The wings are outstanding.  Also have great potato skins and shrimp.  Their staff is great and always a relaxing place to go have a cold beer.  Must stop there to get some wings!!!"}
{"text":"Great! Love his place! Been around forever The wings are awesome and everybody is super nice."}
{"text":"Been a LONG time Whooli's customer(nearly 10 years), though I only recently started going regularly again. As Scarlett said, Whooli's has THE best wings around, period. Order them extra crispy for the full effect. The staff is very friendly if you're new, or very fun if you're a regular, they like to joke around and have a little fun with everybody. I go here primarily for the wings and the always-fresh Yeungling on draft, but everything else I have tried was absolutely top notch just like the wings. You cannot go wrong with Whooli's."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The service is great, everybody is friendly and they make the place feel very \"homey.\" Best wings I've ever had. Killians and Shiner Bock on draft, along with some normal domestics. Cheap beer prices, cheaper if you're paying cash. I've had wings, shrimp, salads, curly fries, potato wedges, chicken fingers, everything is great. Sandwiches are always good here. Generous helpings."}
{"text":"I love this place! In regards to the most recent comment \"there was a dog walking around\" the owners dog is blind she can't watch you while you're eating a**hole! She is a sweet little dog that's there once in a blue moon for maybe 20 minutes or so and did I mention she is also a therapy dog and has a license! I absolutely adore the Monterey chicken sandwich it is so good!!! It has this pretzel bun on it that is freshly baked it makes the sandwich. They no longer have those buffalo sliders you can only get it in a chicken sandwich. Make sure that when you order something to go via Internet and it asks you what type of bread put in the comments whatever usually goes on it because if you put white they will actually give you white toast or wheat toast etc.  I've never had a bad experience here and if you were to have an issue just talk to the owners they are always there and they will make things right. Give this place a chance it's been around forever for a reason :-)"}
{"text":"Not what you'd expect! I had just moved from Atlanta and was looking for some really good local food. My daughter and I kinda stumbled upon Whoolis and it was an instant hit. The wings, the Whoolis burger and the French dip are off the charts. It is a very welcoming atmosphere for all people. Don't sleep on this place."}
{"text":"Found this place thru a yelp lookup. After looking at some pictures decided to give them a chance. Ordered lemon pepper wings and the sesame teriyaki mixed with hot buffalo. Drove home to find missing items called in and they had already realized the mistake. They through in a couple of extra wings for the trouble. The wings were worth the drive. Crispy and sauced perfectly just the way we asked. Great wings right off independence."}
{"text":"I am working. Per Staller Painting solution.  The best  Company. On nc state. The best. Cruw friendly.   The. Best contract. Greg. Good. Person ????"}
{"text":"Read good reviews and was so disappointed.  Went there for lunch. Service was slow (there were only a few people there) and the food was terrible (not cooked well and no flavor)."}
{"text":"What a great place. Employees are friendly, fun and attentive. The clientele is nice and good people. Karaoke on Tuesday nights. The food is spectacular...burgers are the bomb! Potato skins are good and the wings. Lots of tvs. 2 pool tables and a great jukebox. Have fun!"}
{"text":"You can not beat the Garlic Teriyaki Shrimp with sesame seeds with Wasabi Ranch to dip them in!  It is a must have!  They also have cajun shrimp that are awesome too.  The wings are unbelievable and they are not small! The Whooli's sauce will light you up.. it is hot.  I love this place!!  Oh and Kelly is the BOMB!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but I had it on my radar because someone told me their burgers were great. Well, I can confirm that to be true!!! I got the Whooli\"s Special with xtra cheese...Amazing!! Not only did it look absolutely delicious, it tasted more Amazing! i don't say that lightly, I am very critical of burgers, well cuz their my favorite! Whooli's has become my 1st go to when Im in a tasty burger mood!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim this evening with my wife and my niece.  Ordered some wings, had some fried  cauliflower,ordered a burger. Had a few beers ( Beer was very cold).  Food was really good for regular pub food. I was pleased. The waitress was very nice. Down to earth and kindly  It was an extremely pleasant experience. It was also very clean, not crowded and very townie. I will be coming back.\""}
{"text":"The food is always good and the place has a great vibe. The bartender was great. Will definitely be coming back. Had a great time."}
{"text":"MOVED TO #7206  -on the WEST side of E. Independence plus you can't see the entrance to the parking lot unless you are on the wrong side of the blvd. PITA , the umpteenth time that I drive somewhere only to find the info is obsolete - I notified Yelp about Mily and Lalo two weeks ago and they still haven't corrected it. 

The decor is strictly pool tables, lots of tvs and metal chairs, yikes! I sat at the bar. First let down this \"grill\" doesn't have a liquor license, just beer. Ok at least they have New Castle brown and it's cheap not too bad. 

The food must be awesome, the barmaid said so! She said it three times in fact.  Well, if your idea of awesome is standard bar fare served in a plastic baskets it is. I ordered the Ruben - which I never do - because I wasn't in the mood to be picky, it was very good and reasonably priced. The fries were over salty I couldn't eat more than half of it. This no gastro-pub: burgers, chicken wings and the traditional sandwiches, no plates - I honestly don't get the raving five star reviews, they raised my expectations way too high. The barmaid was pleasant enough, I ate some peanuts. 

All in all I think it's a good place to refuel, have a beer and a bite. That's it."}
{"text":"WIIINGGGGS! I have to say I came here from a suggestion from a friend. Note, this location is a little different and lets say it's a little harder to get in here unless you know exactly where it's at. As you probably have read from the other reviews, it's right across the street from Super G Mart and adjacent to the gas station and the ABC store. 

Anyways onto the food. We got the 50 wing platter (which was a ton!) and drenched the sauce of teriyaki garlic sauce and the whooli's sauce. My table purely enjoyed the Whooli's sauce over the teriyaki sauce because it was a little too salty. But, if you want to try out both and determine it yourself I say go 50/50!

Other dishes we ordered here were the Potato Skins, Nachos, and the Roast Beef Sandwich. The sandwich was sort of massive if you asked me. Stacked up to 4 layers, it will definitely fill you up. The Potato Skins and the Nachos were appetizers and they also filled you up quickly.  My table definitely did not finish our meal and ended up packing it up to go into the fridge for a quick midnight snack.

Overall, I loved the service and the ambiance. It was a easy bar (with not so many beer selections) and it had a couple of pool tables. When we went there was even a league playing so we got a chance to watch some playing, which I thought was entertaining. Come and have some wings and come out filled and happy!"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier with the experience here. The banana bread French toast is Foodgasmic and will have your taste buds begging for more. To accommodate the continued sensation Manmosas were a fantastic complement. Finally to top it off the bartender, Tiffany, had a lively personally that makes you feel like you've been life long friends. A must visit if you're ever in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Whooli's has great wings . Whooli sauce is excellent. I went back after about 5 years since I no longer live in Charlotte and was in town for a visit. They have since moved across the street to a nicer location. Excellent service. I have only gotten Wings, potato skins, and beer here.  All Excellent. KUDOS!!"}
{"text":"Hey guys, how's it going? I just wanted you to know that my very picky daughter eats your whooli's sauce with a spoon. Keep up the good work and I hope to see y'all soon."}
{"text":"Love love love Whooli's!  Husband and I have been going there for years bc the food is great!  They now have a full bar which can be a plus. Their Philly cheese is to die for, hubbie loves the fried mushrooms, and I have a fondness for the potato skins w jalapeños. Whatever you select from the menu is sure to be yummy!  Irish pub so get your Irish on at Whooli's. :)"}
{"text":"Whooli's is just a great place to go have great wings and sandwiches with unbeatable service. They easily have the best wings in town and their hot sandwiches are WONDERFUL. The wait staff is not only fast and friendly, but they get to know you and greet you BY NAME when you walk in the door. LOVE THIS PLACE!

Highlights:
NFL All Access Pass
WINGS
Beer specials
Delicious food
2 pool tables"}
{"text":"I finally dropped in here at a friend/coworker told me about this place months ago.  It's a table and chairs restaurant with a bar so it's not my typical place to dine or hang.  I wanted to find a good sandwich or and/or burger spot but kept laying it off for some other type of food.  I was going to order the Italian sub but decided to ask what was the top sandwich/sub there.  The friendly and helpful waitress, Emily suggested the Whooli special (medium).  When she said it had all kinds of meat.  I was sold and thought it would be flavor.  Indeed it was and wasn't disappointed.  I ordered a side of fries.  A large would have been too much even without the fries.  And I usually have a big appetite.  The chips were tasty.  The fries were good.  Definitely coming back.9"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there Friday. Yes it was primarily a bar with TVs, pool tables and a wonderful old juke box. They were a little slow bringing our pitcher of beer but the frosted glasses were awesome. We shared 12 wings and their specialty burger. Both were absolutely delicious and we left stuffed and satisfied. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been there in a while and was there with coworkers at lunch. The food was wonderful with some great additions. The fries and sweet potato fries were yum. I had the chicken Monterey sandwich - great as I remembered with a different bun that I liked. The guys had the whoolis burger which they totally enjoyed. The fried chips was an added bonus. My friend wanted a burger but told her to try the baby whoolis burger, which she enjoyed as it was the size she wanted - quarter pound. If you get the regular, It's a half pound of yumminess, but I would have to take half home. Jana our server was great and made sure our drinks were full and if we needed anything. Try this place for lunch or to get your favorite drink. Pool tables are there too. What a find!!"}
{"text":"Yummy bar food! Great atmosphere, not loud and dirty like other bars. Fantastic service!!! I love the wings and the Cajun shrimp wrap!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave no stars. Please DO NOT GO TO WHOOLI'S GRILL. The service is terrible and they had a dog in the restaurant that was walking around and watching me eat once my food was brought to me. The employees here, except for the cook, were all rude and very sarcastic when we placed out order. As we were about to leave and pay for our food one of the employees was unable to work the POS system, so the other employee came over. it took a little minute for all of us to get rung up because this employee also had an attitude when we asked for our checks to be split up. She tried to flip the script and say that one of my friends was rolling her eyes and yelled at all of us and told us we can get the f*%# out. she also told us we could pay and that we cou come back for whatever reason."}
{"text":"Wife and I visited for the first time under new owners. Food was great as usual. Service was horrible as it took 15 mins to get acknowledged when we arrived, only to take 50 minutes to get our order as there was a screw up in getting our order to the cook.  We were starving and filled up on peanuts.  They gave us a coupon for 6 free wings next time, how about at a minimum comping some of the food?  Experience was pretty bad and If this is indicative of the new ownership this place won't be around long.  We might try them one more time for the benefit of the doubt...... Good luck"}
{"text":"They moved across 74 from their old location, right next to the gas station and ABC store. I like this location better. It seems larger, more clean, and less smoke-filled. Its a very casual atmosphere.  They have several pool tables and enough TV's. You have seating choices- a picnic table, table with metal chairs, or up at the bar. So don't wear a dress or skirt...getting in and out of the picnic table seating can get embarrassing. 

I've had their wings with the Whoolies sauce because that is what everyone says to get, they were good, not my favorite,  but good. I've also had the Whoolies burger (watch out, if you want cheese it will almost be a dollar extra) and it was fine,  again nothing to write home about. The other sandwiches are huge, I can never finish one. I like the curly fries here, the other fries can get a little too salty for me. They only have a few beer selections, but they are decently priced. The staff is friendly enough. They know some people by name and those people get paid attention to the most.  

I like how quiet it is on a Saturday afternoon,  so that's when I'd go for a couple of wings and a cheap beer."}
{"text":"The more times I come here, the more I realize how much of a gem this place is.  I really enjoy coming in, grabbing a table and a couple of brews (very affordable) and getting some awesome food served in huge portions.

My new favorite item on the menu is the Monterrey Sandwich:  Blackened chicken breast with mushrooms and bacon and ranch on top.... I was in heaven eating this sandwich.  I upgraded my chips to fries and they were served piping hot.  Unfortunately I was unable to eat all of them....  that was the saddest part about my meal was not being able to finish it.

The place is all very unassuming and is located \"on the fringe\" of Charlotte right before you hit the Matthews town/city limits.  The service is very personal and is great - I love coming here for the laid back atmosphere and great bar food.  My stomach is thankful for living so close to this place."}
{"text":"Whooli's used to be across the street, next to Bi-Lo, which is now Super G.  In that location, they were a bit more homey, but it was also an incredibly smoke-filled joint that could be tough to walk into.  I can see why they moved (though I have no idea if this is why they moved, it makes for a nice excuse).

Now they are across the street in a smaller strip mall, with what appears to be a bit larger space, where they have lost the friendly, divey feel - and the smoke-filled sensation as well, since they moved after the smoking ban took effect - and they gained a place that is a bit more difficult to get into.  In the larger lot, there are multiple access points.  Not so here.

Once you make it, however, the joint is generally decent, and service is friendly once you get it, but even on a slowish Saturday afternoon it can be somewhat spotty.  Larger tables or those who are ordering more alcohol are more likely to get better service (nothing unusual here, just pointing it out).

As to the food, it is served up quickly and while not fancy, does the job well.  Definitely a good alternative to somewhere like Applebee's, and a huge upgrade to Burger King."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems along Independence Boulevard. 

Whooli's isn't fancy. It's a total dive, and you know how much I love dive bars. You'll see regulars in here day and night. Everyone (workers, patrons, cook) is so laid back and friendly. 

I had to bring Jon B here for lunch to pop his Whooli's cherry. Our order: a dozen wings (garlic parm and buffalo), a chicken philly, the special Whooli burger, homemade chips, and fries. It was all delicious. I'll tell you right now, that burger is one of the best I've had in Charlotte. Warning: it's a 1/2 lb and two patties. Next time, I'll see if I can do a baby Whooli version of it. Loved how the fries came in a little basket. Also, in case you were wondering, this was in fact way too much food for us. However, it was worth every calorie and being stuffed all day. I'm also a big fan of the Whooli's Special (it's like an Italian type sub). All the food I've had here has been pretty solid. 

Bonus: you can order pick up here via Yelp and Eat 24. They also have brunch."}
{"text":"This place is a true diamond in the rough. It's a hole in the wall, heck they don't even have a soda fountain but the food is fantastic! I had the wings Whooli's style and the Whooli Special which is a hot Italian sandwich and I was blown away. Very good! If you are passing by and get turned off by the building or are skeptical about the location I urge you to stop and eat at Whooli's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our first visit here to Whooli's Bar and Grill, nice place for lunch, burgers were good and fries were great!  The highlight of our visit was meeting out waitress, Emily!  Friendly, attentive and right on cue.  Loved her.  To top it off, we met Andres, one of the new owners who took the time to sit and chat with us.  Very positive experience overall."}
{"text":"No, that's not a fresh burger, gotta be frozen. I know my meat . Fuk atta here!!  It was disappointing. Tasted in the old side. Service excellent, cool place for the younger crowd. Grab some beers. Play cards and pool. Fried mushrooms delish. Let em cool, otherwise you'll burn ur balls off. My wings were delicious. No batter or anything to hide the flavor, just really good, different flavors available. Homemade ranch, I think. Good for mushrooms, blue for my wings. I wouldn't go back. It was a stop for food on the way to somewhere. But it's a bar, so what are you gonna do? Overall, it was good. New owners tryin to make a living. Loved the dog, so cute."}
{"text":"I've been going to Whooli's for over 19 years and it has the Best sandwiches around. I've lived in 8 different states and eaten at hundreds of restaurants and Whooli's is the best hands down. Great local spot to take the family for lunch or dinner. I give it 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I thought it was appropriate to give my review two stars because there were only two things I liked here:

1.  The server was very friendly and affable.
2.  The Whooli wings were good.  Although it was annoying that the wing prices had changed.

There were several disappointing things in the rest of the meal:

1.  The cheesesteak my wife ate was tough and had a bad flavor.  Also, the condiments were very poor.  No Hellman's mayo and no Heinz ketchup.  House Recipe brand sucks!
2.  The hot dog I ordered had an OK flavor but they put it on a bun that had way to much bread.  A hot dog should not be served on a cheesesteak roll.  I just ate the dog without the bun.
3.  Server didn't know how to pour a Guiness.  It should be hard poured (bottle directly upside down) and not titled to the side.  You want a rich creamy head and you don't get it by tilting.
4.  The fries were soggy."}
{"text":"This is my hot dog heaven.  I have been coming here for years only for their Whooli's Jumbo dog with chili, cheddar cheese, and lots and lots of onions.  It's sad that this is the only thing I get, the owner, Guy, knows that's the only thing I order.  He's determined to get me to try something else, but how can I say no to so much deliciousness?  

The place has moved from their original spot, and I quite enjoy the new place. The bar is a lot bigger, and they have a few tv's located around the restaurant for you to watch a game while waiting for your take out.  I love the little detail at the bar that they have their little Irish man ironed/burned (?) into the wood of the bar.  Small details like that are nice.  The place has a homey feel that you're just chilling with friends.  Some of the tables there are picnic tables, so I like that.  

The atmosphere is friendly, but sometimes it felt like it can get a little too loud.  But everyone is just there for a good time, so no hard feelings.  There's is also a pool table located there which you can test your skills at.  

Try this place out if you're looking for a nice relaxing bar to wind down at for the end of the day!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and had heard great things. The pictures posted in Yelp made it look impressive. I knew to expect a hole in the wall type place and that didn't disappoint. The food was good- they must order from a great food rep. It wasn't anything that exactly stood out. I was a bit put off by the owner's dog walking around and sitting next to us begging for food. Don't health departments frown on that type of thing??? So, I've tried it, check it off the list and I'll keep moving down the road."}
{"text":"Walking into a dive bar never fails to take me back to my college days of getting carded at the bar and beer-pong tournaments under the umbrellas out back.  This place fits that feeling like a glove.  It's trying to be a sports bar, and is overwhelmingly local, complete with bowling trophies, little league sponsorships, and bar stool occupants who haven't moved since the internet was born.

The Reuben I had, which was recommended by the gal running the front of the house, was good, it wasn't as great as she hyped it up to be.  There was another local stopping by and picking up some wings to go, which looking back after reading my fellow yelpers, I regret not ordering.  

Don't expect much and this place could pleasantly surprise you."}
{"text":"The BEST grilled chicken salad I've ever had !!!

Asked the waitress to make the grilled chicken sandwich with peppers, onions and cheese and put atop the Garden salad.  

Was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times for drinks, but this past weekend was my first time trying their food. Being a vegetarian, I asked if they would make me a rueben with sauteed mushrooms instead of meat and it was absolutely delicious!!! I had a side of their horsey sauce with the fries, nice and spicy! Tiffany behind the bar is awesome, the drinks are good, and the vibe is laid back. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The Service:
Horrible. We live near Whoolis for 2 years now and have always been eager to try them out. 
My fiance and I had not ate yet that day it being 5pm we had just got home from work. He went to Whoolis and ordered two Philly steak and cheese with fries at 5:05. At 5:45 he asked how much longer on the order, she stated the cook had not started the order another 15min. By 6 pm I had to call the store and ask why my order takes 1 hour and no one thought to inform my fiance any at all. No courtesy to the customers what so ever. One hour and 15 min for 2 phillys. Rediculous. And they were not busy at all. On a Monday. By then I told him to get the money back. 
We went up Independence to Showmars and they were temporarily closed due to renovations. We ended up eating Mcdonalds we were so furious and still craving Philly cheese steaks. We did not eat dinner that night until 7pm. Whoolis truly ruined our day."}
