{"text":"Went to check out Core last night. Split a couple of appys and a main course with a friend. Service was top notch, plus the bread...omg, that bread. We tried the onion tart which was tasty, and really quite beautifully plated, then we had the mushroom salad which couldn't decide whether it wanted to be tangy or tarragony (is that a word?). Was just ok. Our main was the cod, which was pretty good. My only complaint was the 30.00 price tag for the cod. I'm not sure how they justify 30 bucks for 2 carrots and a small piece of cod."}
{"text":"Came to the newly opened Core restaurant in the Leslieville area for dinner. The restaurant has only been opened for a month, so was excited to see what they had to offer.

They do have a five-course tasting menu for $65, but we opted to order individual dishes instead. After ordering, we got some nice soft bread with homemade butter. We also were surprised with a two-item complimentary amuse bouche. One was smelt on a fried potato base, and the other was beef tartar. Both were very delicious, but I especially enjoyed the smelt. The smelt was incredibly fresh and the crispiness from the fried potato strings added some nice texture. Was a great start to the meal. 

APPETIZERS:

Spanish Mackerel, broccoli, sea asparagus, pearl onion ($15). The mackerel was cooked beautifully with a nice crisp skin and super moist on the inside. 

Celeriac en Croute, rutabaga, celery, mustard ($14). Delicious root vegetables cooked in a nice crisp puff pastry. Both appetizers were delicious, but I thought this was extraordinary. Highly recommended. 

MAIN COURSE:

Dry Aged Duck Breast, beets, watercress, juniper ($30). The duck was cooked to perfection with a nice moist dark pink centre with a crisp outer skin. The thin layer of fat really gave it some additional flavor. This duck was comparable in quality to the ones from Cafe Boulud, Bacchanal, and Canis. Highly recommended. 

Beef Flat Iron, parsnip, walnut ($29). The steak was very tender and delicious. Definitely worth trying if there are others to share the dish with. However, if I had to choose a single entree, I would go with the duck. 

Ricotta Gnocchi, squash, pumpkin seeds, grana padano ($23) with additional Duck Confit (+$4). The gnocchi was prepared beautifully with just the right consistency of potatoes to flour and cooked to a nice golden brown. The shredded duck confit adds some nice richness and flavors to the gnocchi and the pumpkin seeds add a little crunch. Very well thought out dish, and was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion of this dish. 

The food here is absolutely delicious, and we were very satisfied with every dish we ordered. All our dishes were prepared promptly with minimal wait time between courses. The service here is also excellent. Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable on the menu, and came by often to check on us. The dining atmosphere is nice, although I find some of the tables are a little too close together for comfort. Also would like to see a more extensive beer menu as they only have two options to choose from. Overall, was very happy with our dining experience and would definitely come back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. I was sad to see Skin + Bones closed but am glad there's a new restaurant in the neighbourhood.

Pro-tip: their bread is to die for. One of the best bread I've ever had."}
{"text":"Core scores again! Two weeks ago, my husband (and food and wine writer) Glenn called dinner \"the best I've ever had in Leslieville\". This week, he changed it to \"the best dinner ever East of Jarvis.\"

The occasion was a wine-pairing dinner featuring Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir. Lewis Robinson, Core's Chef de Cuisine's dishes were inventive and flavorful. The selections were superb. The price was ridiculously low considering that one of the wines is usually priced at around $300 a bottle. Owner Mark Moffatt told us, \"There are definitely more wine dinners to come.\"

The east end  has its fine dining for foodies spot. My prediction is Core will soon be as crowded at dinner as Lady Marmalade is at lunch."}
