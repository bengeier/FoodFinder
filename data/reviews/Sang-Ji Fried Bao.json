{"text":"For a place that only has two items ( I would pray that is temporary), they make the tastiest impromptu meal I have eaten since I have started blogging.  I was taken aback of how fried baos can have such a rich broth yet maintain that crunchy texture.  Do take heed in their instructions on how to best eat this morsels of joy - make a small hole, slurp the broth and munch away.  The broth is satisfyingly hot (as in scalding in you just watched them place it in front of you, so take care!).  I think I am going to come back here regularly.  One more addition to my regular list of Yonge&Finch comfort foods :)"}
{"text":"Super small place. Obviously known for their sang-ji baos. Tbh i didnt enjoy their baos.. but others did. Their dry noodles were lacking flavour and was super oily. Only good part was the texture of the noodles.   Their service though, horrible. The guy taking my order barely spoke english, but still understood everything.   I told him initially I wanted take out because there was no seats.  Halfway through ordering, another guy behind me says he ordered through the phone earlier.  And so the guy taking my order decides to continue with him.. HELLOO?? You were just helping me how can you just..??! I stood there stupidly in between their conversation.  Long after, FINALLY comes back to my order. I then told him that we would be staying for here, because we ended up getting a table.  He said \"OK\". We sat for 10 minutes waiting for our food and the same guy comes out and said \"are you eating here?\" And we said yes of course. And he says \"you cannot. You got take out. This is dine in only.\"  I told him that I already said I wanted to dine in instead, but he continued to tell us to leave, that we said to go though. He also said \"the boss said you can't stay\". woowowoow. Definitely never coming back then.  Literally, wtf. How hard is it? You made a mistake. Whats the big deal regardless? Just put the food on a damn plate. Because you missed out on your tips? Well ya damn right you will now because of that trash attitude towards customers.   Trash ass service, trash sang ji baos, tiny ass place."}
{"text":"These guys make bao's as good as you'd get in China. Among the best you'll get anywhere."}
{"text":"This place has no air condition, only has a fan, eating inside is hot in summer time, food is okay, but is not same taste as the one I eat in Shanghai, service is okay."}
{"text":"After reading good reviews on Yelp I decided to try this new dumpling joint. The dumplings (bao) were decent size and delicious as it was written on yelp. If you like pan fried dumplings this place is a good place to try the Chinese style pan fried dumplings. I ordered two orders of bao since each order only has 4 baos but two orders was bit too much for myself. I wish they serve 6 baos per order. Overall I really appreciated the opportunity to try more authentic Chinese dumping. If you are in town give it a shot. The place is really small so be aware."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST sang ji bao GTA.  cons: no credit card! But I can bear it for such good sang ji  :)"}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars. Usually, I hate bao, or anything bread related. The second I hear bao, I run. This bao, I run towards it. The bao was $6.99 for 4. I had to order another round. This place is a new hidden gem, the outside of the bao was not too thick, and you take a little bite of it, the soup inside was so flavourful. It was piping hot. For the beginners, there is instructions. The dumpling wrap was a little thicker than expected. But the soup was good. Will definitely be back. A great addition to the hood."}
{"text":"I rarely eat at Chinese restaurants mainly because of their long lists of foreign items that might or might not be good. This place as I understood specializes in one dish, and that made this place stand out in my mind amidst the plethora of Chinese restaurants around North York. For many nights I passed by this small place, and see a large chaotic crowd of people waiting for, presumably, takeouts or seats. Today I got lucky, came at 3 and no one was dining in, and got my order of Sang-Ji after 10 minutes of wait.  All that said my expectation for the Baos are really high, and honestly the look of them is interesting but not all that eventful. The taste of the Baos tho, or should I say the process of tasting the Baos, went above and beyond what I could expect. There is a fun procedure to eat them (they were nice enough to give me an instruction card, else I might now be in a clinic): poke a hole, drink the soup, and eat the Baos. The top of the Baos has a rice noodle wrap texture and the flavour of it is infused with the fragrance of sesame and scallion. The soup that oozes from within is thick and porky. The filling is a tender and juicy meat ball, again rich in porkiness. For me however, what rounds the dish up is the crispy bottom that adds so much depth and complexity to the texture profile.  Eating it is such a fun and eye opening experience. If only I could rate more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"The Sang-ji fried bao were as good as they were in China. Thin bao and hot soup fills the soul."}
{"text":"Too much dough and not enough fillings. Very soupy. Kinda pricy. Looks cute. Got take out. May taste better if consumed fresh."}
{"text":"Wasn't worth the $6.99 when the bao was burnt and the dry noodle with scallion oil and peanuts were bland (for $7.99). Service was poor. They seated us outside in the heat even though there were a few seats inside their air conditioned place. The tables outside were slanted as the sidewalk is uneven and the bowls, cutlery and cups kept slipping. Halfway through our meal the server offered to move the table more into the sidewalk.... such an inconvenience. They neglected us outside on one of the hottest days of the summer. Water was not refilled until we asked and we left dinner parched. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a Shanghai style pan fried bao joint and they only serve bao and wonton for now.  Their fried bao are superb, and they are the best. The dough wrappers have the perfect thickness, and the bao are steamed and pan fried until the bottom are crisp browned.  The pork filling and broth are both flavorful.   $6.99 for 4 worth every penny.  Place is tiny and service is good."}
{"text":"If you're a bao person...this place should be on your go to list. This tiny joint opened recently so they only have 2 items on their menu now - sang ji bao and wonton soup. We ordered both to try. This is definitely more of a snacking place and not for the hungry. The soup in the bao was nice..not burning hot. There's a sweetness to the soup inside the bao. Hubs is more of the dumpling/bao person and he said he enjoyed it. The wonton soup was good. You could see a film of oil in the broth yet it doesn't taste greasy/oily/heavy (if you know what i mean).   Would we come back? Yes!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed that Big Beef Bowl had been taken over by Sang-Ji Bao completely; however, the baos are pretty good (particularly when fresh)!  I've been here twice and tried the baos only for takeout--their menu is limited, only a few items, including the baos and wontons.  There's soup inside the baos so be careful when eating it!  Bite a small hole in it first so that the soup doesn't splatter everywhere (like I've done before).  Small place--seats maybe 10-12 people at a time including outdoor patio table.  They do takeout as well but make sure you eat it soon after ordering as the baos are best when they're fresh and can get soggy if left out too long. They do poke holes in the takeout box though for ventilation.  It was a bit pricey for four pieces--it came up to $7.90 for an order of 4 pieces, pretty much $2 per piece. I'll definitely come back though when I'm up for a snack!"}
{"text":"LOVE THE PAN FRIED SOUP DUMPLINGS (fried bao). they were large, the thick skin was crispy but but greasy at all. The seasame seeds on top was even more crispy. Soup inside was delicious. I would go back here just for the fried bao but my sister didn't think it was that great. The 4 fried bao were $6.99.   We also each got the wonton soup ($7.99) which we both did not like. The broth was clear and rich with not much else aside from the cilantro and wontons. I could taste the shrimp in them though. Fried bao tasted like pork.  Two items coming soon: duck soup and dry noodle dish?"}
{"text":"It's coming in hot! Ordered these bad boys and man the dumpling filling is flavourful and the soup inside is amazing. Second time having these dumpling and I would say they're better than XLB IMO.  $6.99 for 4 pcs"}
{"text":"Really good baos! Broth inside is so yummy, meat is also good! Can't wait to try their upcoming orders. Their wonton soups is good but I prefer their baos over"}
{"text":"I was so sad when Sang Ji Bao ended their collaboration with Big Beef Bowl since I could no longer get my hands on their delicious Shanghainese Sang Ji Bao (?????) anymore. But no more tears - Sang Ji Bao is back at their own brick and mortar location near Yonge and Finch.  Located where the Big Beef Noodle used to be, Sang Ji Bao is a very small store front on the corner of Yonge and Bing. There are four tables and the space probably seats about 15 people max. If coming with a bigger group, they will probably split you up so it might not be ideal if you want a place to chat and hang out. We arrived within the first hour of opening and the place was full. But given the type of food on the menu, many people just come in for a quick bite and don't linger. We were seated within 5 minutes.  Currently they are in the soft opening phase and only have two things on the menu. Their infamous Sang-Ji Bao ($6.99/4 pcs) and a Bite-Size Wonton Soup ($7.99) but it looks like they'll be expanding their menu soon with two more additions: Dry Noodles + Scallion Oil ($7.99) and Duck Soup & Vermicelli ($8.25).  I got a double order of their Sang-Ji Bao and it was everything I remember (and maybe even better). The dumplings were large with a nice thick skin which was pan fried to a crispy, toasty, golden brown on the bottom and soft and steamed on the top. I liked that it was fried perfectly so that I could actually pick up the bao from the bottom and not have the dumpling sag or break while still having the dumpling wrapper retain a soft, moist and chewy texture. The inside of the bao is filled with the most delicious soup and a sizeable ball of pork. The fat from the pork adds an intense richness to the soup and makes the meat incredibly succulent and juicy.  Pro tip: make sure to eat the bao by nibbling a small hole at the side and sucking out all the soup first! Otherwise, you may find that the soup explodes all over you and all that exquisite broth would have gone to waste!"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot when you have a craving. The combination of the crispy Bao and the delicate wonton soup works well together. Surprisingly, there is actually a real depth of flavor in each of these dishes. I will definitely be back."}
