{"text":"Amazing food!  I live Mexican food, but Puerto Rican food.... Wow!  Try the pernil and empanadas!  Malta Goya and flan was great too!  Definitely coming back with friends!"}
{"text":"Good food, the service was shaky...
Our server forgot our tostones until we were half way through our entrees and she brought the wrong shrimp dish, but apart from that it was great.
The owner/manager apologized and took time to visit with us."}
{"text":"It was a pleasure to find a restaurant with great service, I decided that I will be a regular client. Thank you for the amazing food. I am on cloud nine.. 

Hope everyone gives this place a try...you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Horrible. Not organized at all. I ordered to go when I got their they couldn't find my ticket and so I had to tell her what I ordered it was a lot of stuff so I suggested she used common since and look in the bag. The Pasteles were ok, Pastelillos tasted like they were store bought, Pechuga de Pollo A La Parrilla had no flavor and was over cooked, Pollo Frito was good but the size of the pollo was a joke. Nothing was seasoned right and everything was over cooked the Arroz con Gandules tasted like Mexican rice. I would not suggest going here unless you want to be upset. By the way the food looks nothing like what is on the website. The website says the owner lived in Boston no PR food in Boston taste like what they gave me... What a shame. I could of cooked better PR food at home myself and I am Black. My kids are Purto Rican or as I call them Black Rican and they were disappointed as well. I wont ever write what my husband thought and he was born and raised in PR. Lets just say he took one bite and tossed the rest in the trash."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. We were there almost three hours waiting (...for a table, water, a server, our drinks, our food...). Practically ignored. I got my margarita after waiting 25 minutes for it and it arrived with two melting ice cubes and what looked like several sips missing (compared it to my husband's, which arrived 5 minutes after mine). Very friendly staff, just not good  at taking care of tables. Food is very well seasoned. Tasty. But way oversalted. It arrived cold, and the meat is very dry on the outside. Ordered two appetizers and they were yummy, but only one came after waiting forever, and the second one came twenty minutes later. Our daughter's food arrived, and then ten minutes later my food came, and then it took the owner walking by to see that my husband's food hadn't yet arrived---and then it was at least another 10 minutes more wait.
 So that was just crazy. The portions are fair, but the shrimp creole is way overpriced for only getting six medium shrimp. They were clean and fresh, though. Not sure I'd go out of my way to return to this place."}
{"text":"Flan to end all flans. Excellent service and the best lunch deal in town. Easy to find, we'll be back. Your new friends from Idaho."}
{"text":"Oh, where to start...3 of us stopped in for dinner. Place was busy, we were seated right away. Husband ordered a Blue Moon and was told they didn't have any oranges for garnish, he opted for a lemon. Our food took forever to arrive at our table. We ordered shredded pork, which was fatty....fried chicken, which was dry and stringy and included indistinguishable chicken parts. I saw a leg and a wing and then there were several things that looked like ....tails? I don't know. There wasn't much meat on most of it. I ordered white rice & beans and all I got was rice, no beans. My daughter ordered the grilled chicken and it arrived swimming in grease. It was disgusting...made her stomach hurt just looking at it. The \"salad with every dinner\" is a joke. It's more of a hefty garnish of iceberg lettuce with a token tomato slice on top. 
We did enjoy the fried plantains, my daughter loved the creamy sauce that came with them. That was the best thing of the whole meal.
For $50 I could have found much better food elsewhere. Which is what I will do next time."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the hubby here and this place never disappoints.  We live their food and the customer service is great!

This place isn't in the best area but it's worth finding for sure!  

Pernil and mofongo are always good!  Yum- plus lunch prices are great!  Try and experience the taste of Puerto Rican cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"Not very good service- one waitress and 2 cooks for the entire restaurant. So food took awhile and the waitress never checked on us or refilled our drinks.

Was really excited to find puerto rican food in AZ and drove quite a bit to get here. The food is mediocre and the service is pretty non-existent. Had the mofongo camarones al aljillo and the mofongo wasnt a great texture- not like the mofongo I'm used to having. Plus it was pretty dry and tasted like nothing other than a lot of butter! The person I was with had the carne guisada and it tasted like it came out of a can. Definitely not worth the high prices they charge."}
{"text":"I went to this place for a to go order. While waiting for my food I watch the cook preparing the food without any gloves and he kept taking his hat off stroking his hair. If I were a health food inspector they wouldn't have done very good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the only PRican restaurant that we had in Tucson closed down a while ago, so one day when we were visiting our son in Phoenix, we decided to try out this place. Starting with the pastellilos (similar to empanadas but fried) the meat was so well seasoned, it tasted like my abuelitas cooking.  My husband had an alcapurria, which he loved. We had the appetizer platter, it had tostones, amarillos, fried chicken and fries. The chicken was so tasty, crispy and good. For dinner three of us ordered mofongo (which is my all time favorite dish, everytime we go to the island, we order it)   My hubs had it with the garlic shrimp and I had it with the pork, It was moist, garlicky goodness, Delicioso! we also ordered carne guisada (beef stew) with rice and beans, and biftec encebollado with arroz con gandules. Everybody enjoyed their food. We also got the flan which was superb. The beers were ice cold too. The server was very attentive and we also met the owner whch sat down and chatted. He is thinking about expanding to Tucson, all I can say is yes and hurry up!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a different feel tonight so decided to go with a recommendation from a stranger. I've heard slot about mofongo but never tried it even when I visited Puerto Rico but it was great. I had Mofongo De Carne Frita and moscato to drink. Customer service was great! Chef came out o ask how our meal was and said I was missing something!! Brought me a side of chicken broth moisten my mofongo,. Fyi mofongo is smashed plantains with herbs & seasoning"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I feel like I'm back home in Puerto Rico! Best carne frita around! Plus pasteles!"}
{"text":"The food was bland, their empanadas had no flavor! I had the steak, onions combo with rice; the rice was good. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Very very grateful to have this restaurant when I am so far from home"}
{"text":"First time eating here, highly recommended by a Puerto Rican friend. Spouse had the steak and yucca. I had pollo guisado with rice and we shared a side of mofongo. The mofongo is pretty awesome. Waitress was great, made recommendations. Owner made the rounds. Food was a little slow to reach the table, but everything seemed fresh and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Had the Mofongo with Carne Frita and it was delicious! Loved the very calm and relaxing environment."}
{"text":"I'm taking
A Latin American class in college and for 3 cultural hours. We were given the option to try different food. I googled it of course looking for a reasonable place and discovered this spot. The food was on point everything so good and tasty. I would go here again and bring a friend. I went early afternoon Sunday not to many people just how I like
It thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent Puerto Rican food! Very pleased with all the appetizers, Pernil and Shrimp! Loved the empanada and tostones with garlic sauce! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"7 of us met for dinner. What a wonderful time. Everyone enjoyed their choices. Empanadas, Mofongo, Pernil, Shrimp in garlic and in Creole sauce, fried plantains with garlic sauce, Rice and beans and more. Authentic Puerto Rican food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I moved from orlando, Florida and was really missing the cultural food experience that you could find anywhere.  After trying this restaurant, hands down it beats any place I've tried before. I no longer miss my orlando spot. The portions are very generous and the price is reasonable. Anything you order will explode in flavor on your first bite. Sofrito is made from scratch and any dish you order will be satisfying. To top it all off the service is genuine and exceptional!  The owner sat us down, and the server vicki was more than pleasant. She is very personable and overall it was a fun experience.  It is like stepping into the island itself!  If you are looking for a genuine latin experience you must stop in."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I received such bad service.  Looking to travel to Puerto Rico and Cuba next year, I thought I would get an early taste for the food.  The restaurant's food was edible; the service was horrible.

I was seated moments after walking through the door and promptly, apparently forgotten.  It took so long before the 'waitress' arrived to take my order that I started staring at the ceiling and walls.  She was impersonal, colder than the A/C.  I asked for a drink and water; I got the drink only.  The meal finally arrived and so did the salad dressing only after the 'waitress' checked on two other tables (in the meantime).  She didn't check on me once.  A male came from the kitchen area and proceeded to engage every table, but mine.  

At the register, the 'waitress' asked me how was the meal. I shrugged and marked through the tip line.  She felt the need to apologize.  For what, I don't know.  It appears to me to be business as usual. This first impression is my last (ing) impression."}
{"text":"The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of the wait. Service and food was excellent. Loved this place. Will definitely go back if I return to Arizona."}
{"text":"As you taste each bite, you close your eyes and remember people in your life that are no longer with you. I don't cook PR food and rarely cook Dominican food so imagine the pleasant surprise when the smell and taste takes you back. My husband turns to me and says, \"Food is supposed to make you happy, not cry!\" Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"born and raised in NY and use to eating at cuchifritos then  moving to Arizona first thing I did was search for a Spanish restaurant... Besides my cooking this place is the closest to a cuchifrito youll get too. The arroz con gandules and pernil was good, The alcapurria tasted like one but was very very thin ( not small and fat) The platanos shouldve been  crispier and the \" mojo\" shouldve had mojo not just olive oil. Besides the little things it was good....along with the Spanish music:)
Not sure i would eat here again because its too far."}
{"text":"The most difficult task for my husband and I coming from NY and moving to Arizona has been to find Caribbean food, Dominican, Puerto Rican, even Colombian. This place was a gem to find. You can call it a mom and pop kind of place, nothing fancy. We met the owner, very nice gentleman and pleaded with him to remain in business atleast until we went back to the east coast."}
{"text":"Really good and authentic Puerto Rican restaurant. Tried the carne frita con mofongo, and it was really good. The carne frita was a little dry on the outside but really tender on the inside, just the way it was cooked in PR years ago. Most times people who try to cook it that way end up over cooking it and make them too dry inside and out. The mofongo was just perfect! Not too dry, not too soft; really flavorful with just the right amount of garlic flavor. Service was awesome, super friendly; it was our first time there and I we were treated like if we were long time clients. The prices are also really good and considering the portions size I got to say, pretty affordable. I gave them only four stars because we all ordered the same plate and I didn't have a chance to see or try anything else. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"The best Puerto Rican Restaurant ever! From the minute you step in you are welcomed in and treated as if you are family.The food is authentically delicious and fresh to order.The establishment is very clean and cozy with great salsa music playing.The one word to describe this place...Amazing!"}
{"text":"I had to give them one star because ZERO was not available. This was the first time trying this place and the LAST. The customer service was horrible. I asked for something on the menu and the waiter had no idea what I had just ordered. It took over 30 minutes to get our appetizer and ended walking out after waiting for an additional 30 minutes and our food wasn't even ready. We never got refills even when we asked. This has to be the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out, and YES YES YES, had a pastelillo, pasteles, & pernil with arroz y gandules. Everything was great, not like mom's but who can cook like mom right? The thing that stood out the most was the pastele OMG it tasted like it was just made and the seasoning was dead on. The rest was great, the only thing was the pernil was a little salty than I am used but not where I could not enjoy it, Clean place and the bathroom was spotless. I will go again!!!"}
{"text":"I gave the restaurant a 5 star because of the food after all that's what's most important.  The food is the best Puerto Rican food I've had next to my Mom's.  But there are three suggestions I would like to make to improve on the service and ambience.  The first suggestion is to be more attentive of people waiting to be seated.  This time around I had to seek out the waitress before we got seated.  This is no big deal for me but I know some people that walk out of a restaurant if not seated shortly after they arrive.  Some people might even think they are being ignored intentionally because of their race, etc. - which I know is not true of the people working there but that is part of America's history and psyche.  The second suggestion is to do a better job of keeping things in stock.  You seem to be improving on this.  Keep up the good work.  Last suggestion is about the volume of the music.  The music while we were there went from way too loud -to- loud -to- finally OK.  What can I say - I am old.  Love your food.  Love the service once I got your attention.  Work on these few suggestions because your restaurant is great."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. We were here for a birthday party and were pleasantly surprised. The service was great, considering two very large parties. They were friendly and made recommendations that were spot on. It's in a rough area, but on the inside you totally feel at home. Good people. The owner made his rounds and took care with both parties. 

I'm planning on stopping in for lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Would go back.
You could probably eat off the floor it was so clean!
Plenty of seating.

Menu is limited, but I figured that."}
{"text":"I recently moved from Bronx NY to Arizona withmy husband and kids. I tell you I was so stressed out, I was upset and having a tantrum that their were no puerto rican resturants. I was in furiated til one day i made it my mission to find a resturant no matter how far it was. I found Puerto Rico Bar and Grill online just googling. I decided thats where i was going to go. So my entire family went and my father who is a native from PR loved the place. The food was amazing I mean i didnt feel as home sick. Now all I need is to find a salsa club, with my salseras im not no pro but I love my salsa music. I am still adjusting to Arizona. its been 7 months."}
{"text":"I do not normal post bad reviews but the service was terrible here. It took about 30 minutes to get a cup of water, the people who cleaned the tables were the one to give me a menu, and it took over an hour to get our meal. There were people that got there after me that were getting served before me. Me and my fiance ordered rice and beans and when they brought out the food only one of us had beans. I told the lady and she said oh yea okay. I wasn't going to wait until my food to get cold to eat my food so me and my fiance shared the beans. She never came back! I came for 2 reasons alcapurrias y pasteles just to find out they were out of the alcapurrias. When we checked out the lady that was suppose to give me my beans never even took the time to apologize. No one apologized for anything. There should be more people working on a Saturday, there were only 2 ladies there taking orders and checking people out. I am so disappointed as this is 1 of 2 places in Arizona that sell Puerto Rican food."}
{"text":"This place felt like home. The owner was friendly.The staff was amazing. The food is authentic.what more could a girl ask for."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic food. Haven't has a bad dish yet. I do mostly take out cause I prefer to eat in a quieter setting...but it's definitely a cool little spot. Service can be iffy...but patience. Food is worth it. Plenty of parking, easy access. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The restaurant was spotless, the service was outstanding and friendly. The food was authentic and the price was reasonable. I've already recommended it to three of my close friends."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a friend.  We were hungry so we ordered lots of stuff including tostones, alcapurrias @ $3.50 a piece (OUCH!),  the lunch special carne guisada (beef stew) and white rice and kidney beans, fried pork chunks with mofongo, a cocktail and a tembleque (coconut dessert).  The beans had no salt!  I spoke to the waitress and she said it's because there are people with high blood pressure and the owner can't eat too much salt.  Well folks,  this is NOT A HOSPITAL it is a restaurant.  You have to season food or it doesn't taste like much.  AND ADDING SALT AFTER THE FACT IS WORSE FOR YOUR HEALTH.  You have to up the salt--not saying make it salty---saying make it normal.  The beef stew lacked salt as well but it was not as bad as the problem with the beans.  The fried pork was good and the mofongo that came with it.  I still crave a good sauce for the mofongo.  They gave me this watery stuff that looked like it came from their chicken stew.  Not thick enough.  I make a magnificent sauce for my mofongo and I crave it when I order it out.  The tostones were nicely prepared and came with garlic sauce and mayo-ketchup (mix of mayo and ketchup AKA french dressing ).  The star of the show was the dessert.  The tembleque was not too sweet and had an amazing texture.  Loved it.  
We we got the bill I got sticker shock.  Two of us: $57+.  What???  Upon checking the bill I noted that an additional $12.95 entree had been added to our bill.  It's always good to check your bill.  The server was apologetic but I would have been stuck with an additional $15+ (with tax and tip) had I not done an item by item review.  
So here are my recommendations:
1.  UP the salt on your beans and other dishes, you will thank me for it.
2.  Add more lunch specials as currently there are only 3.
3.  Bring back your 15% discount cards.  I would be here more often if you brought them back.  You have to admit that for a latino place you are on the high end of the spectrum.  The discount card takes a little of the sting out of the final bill.  
Buena Suerte!"}
{"text":"Mi Gente! It was pretty close to home cooking. The arroz amarillo was soft and flakey, the tostones were fresh and crispy.  The lechón was seasoned perfectly, just enough salt to keep you wanting more.I'm looking forward to returning and tasting some more Boricua island food. The service was a little slow but the food made up for it. Had the Mofongo and loved it.  It's a spot i would recommend once  every so often to truly appreciate its niche. Spanish Afro Taino flavors in one place. Rico! Interior needs some updates but overall nice and relaxed."}
{"text":"Don't let the area fool you, this is a great place with a unique twist on latin food! We went for dinner on a Wednesday and had no problems getting there or with parking. It is very informal and relaxed, so don't worry about dress code. The staff was polite and I experienced no problems with my order. We started with the plantains, and they were fantastic- smooth and sweet, making a nice appetizer, or even a healthier desert. I ordered the Steak and Onions with traditional rice. The rice was very good, with a unique twist. It had a few beans mixed it and a very pleasant flavor. The steak was also very nice. I really like how they pile a lot of onion on it as I love cooked onion! The flavor of the steak was smooth and mellow, making for a delightful flavor combination when mixed with onion! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This little boricua is a little gem in Phoenix. It is very nondescript but the service was friendly and the food was very tasty and authentic. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I loved the wall mural when I first walked in and the music playing in the background. I went to PR for the first time 2 yrs ago so the wall brought back some very fond memories. The waitress greeted us right away and service was quick. I thought the food was delicious - we had a sample plater and the pernil was a bit salty but still very tasty.

We had the pleasure of meeting the owner before we left - very kind man and he shared some fun stories with us about his Puerto Rico vacations. I can't wait to go back with my friends so they can get a taste of Puerto Rican food."}
{"text":"I have a tip for the owner and manager, i wouldnt post on facebook that you're only looking for waitresses, it gives the male employees there a bad look, almost perverted and im sure there's respectful gentlemen working there. This post on facebook sounds very sexist and like you're willing to only hire females who are young only to exploit them and only bring in more cheap regulars who are perverted. Why try to atract a negative crowd when you can hire who ever male or female who is skilled enough to bring in professionals such as buisness owners, surgeons, officers etc vs a guy who might end up stalking a female employee here? I consider this horrible management. I hope every female walking in your doors gets the respect they deserve and i hope every female employee is a hard worker and gets recognized for her work and not her body and i hope that every female hired here was hired for her intelligence and skills and not for her body and age."}
{"text":"First let me start with the owners and staff and just so friendly just like family!!..We hosted my daughters graduation dinner there 15 of us and they took great care of us!
MOFONGO!! soo good I have tried almost every dish now and cant get enought. I was raised on this food and was so happy to find them...a must try!!"}
{"text":"I'm literally eating their food right now, and I wish I had an endless buffet of it.

They are catering a luncheon that I'm attending for work, and they brought with them the most insanely delicious beans I've ever eaten in my life! And trust me when I say that- I'm a bean connoisseur. 

I've never been to the restaurant, or even heard of them before this luncheon, but you better believe I just bookmarked this place to come back this weekend! My belly is fat and happy :)"}
{"text":"I ate here last month and finally getting around to my review. I love the decor and the spaciousness of the restaurant. The vibe is definitely there. 

The food was definitely legit. Familiar smells and aromas of the good ole island of PR. I had a nice conversation with some other patrons who are expats of NYC and I felt like I never left the city. That is until I was done and got into my Uber and noticed it was still over 100 degrees outside. 

I really liked the food and will of course be back as much as I can. If you are in the mood for some authentic Puerto Rican food, you should check them out!"}
{"text":"My kids can be difficult to eat sometimes but not here because when you have some comida Borinquen that's done right, oh they'll eat.  I can always go for some good mofongo."}
{"text":"Over rated. Service for us was inviting and friendly though. Our server was Lydia. To start we ordered the Canoa. It was delicious. For our entrees we ordered The Pollo Frito (fried chicken) & Pechuga de Pollo a la parrilla (grilled chicken). The ticket time was fast, a little too fast because as soon as we began to eat our appetizer, seconds later our entrees arrived. Unfortunately the Fried chicken was yesterday's left overs and way over cooked. My husband is an executive chef so he knew what to look for not only outer appearance but by cracking the bones and looking at the bone marrow. The grilled chicken was breast only and it too was over cooked and of course dry, and greasy. The arroz con gandules and Arroz Blanco y Habichuelas were good. So really we only ate the Canoa, rice, and salad included with our entrees. Sigh. Without telling our server we didn't like our chicken she already knew and gave us a discount on our bill, but the lesson here is if you see chicken over cooked and/or old, before serving it to your guests, take that time to bring it to the cooks attention and have them remake it, we wouldn't have minded the wait because we were enjoying our appetizer. 1st impression is a lasting impression and we will not be returning. You cannot charge your customers these prices, serve them lousy food, and expect them to come back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and authentic, and the staff was lovely.  The owner came over and immediately made us feel welcome, and that feeling continued with the server. Portions are huge, so we've got a second meal waiting in the fridge.  Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"This place has been the first and only place I ever been to to try Puerto Rican Cuisine. I fell in LOVE with their Camarones Al Ajillo (Shrimp with garlic) Entree with Mofongo (mashed plantain) as the side. 
If you enjoy the strong flavor of garlic, and this dish is NOT for the people who do not like garlic.
Their Platanos Maduros appetizer is really good as well.
The Arroz con Gandules is soooo tasty.

I'm a creature of habit, so since the first dish I ever tried was Mofongo and I loved it, I haven't tried much else (I'm ashamed but then again I'm not)

The servers are very welcoming, and the ambiance is really uplifting. The music that they play during the day makes you wanna start dancing in the middle of the restaurant. 
It is for sure a restaurant I will refer any Puerto Rican Cuisine virgins to :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from a Seattle. What an amazing restaurant!! The food was soo delicious! I really felt like I was back home in PUERTO RICO! My husband had the pastel-pero que sabor!! Delicioso!! I had an alcapurria and man the flavors were so on point! For dinner I had pollo frito with arroz con gandules! Wooooo -def lots of flavor and tasted as if my mom had made it! My husband had the pernil with the same rice and again we were super pleased! The staff was great-and although our food took a little longer than expected to be served-we walked out full and happy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the fried chicken here! This place is always full of Puerto Rican people enjoying their meals, that's how you can tell that it's authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a meal this weekend and were especially looking to finding some fresh yucca. We arrived and were greeted then seated. We ordered appetizers and browsed the menu.

We ordered an empanada and a canoa for starters. The empanada was hot, flakey flour crust and a full of ground beef. The canoa was huge...filled with ground beef and covered with hot melted cheese. Both were delicious!

For our main entre we both ordered the pernil. To our delight they also offered the yucca we were craving. We rounded out the order with fried sweet plantains. This was not intended to be a weight watcher meal.

The food arrived after we had eaten our fill of the appetizers. The pernil was steaming hot and seasoned just right. The plantains were sweet and flavorful. The yucca were...heavenly. It is so hard to find good, properly prepared yucca in the valley. It was golden, steaming hot and crispy on the outside. It was simply perfect.

So unable to bear leaving perfectly prepared yucca behind for the indeterminate future, we ordered another platter of pernil to go. This brings me to the portions. They were excellent. On leaving we departed with four to-go boxes. It looked like we had been grocery shopping. The food was just as good the next day after reheating. 

So it is easy to recommend PRLG to anyone craving island food. We look forward to the next chance we'll have to stop by and sample some more of their excellence offerings."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a little bit of home. The service is always friendly as well as the owner. And their mofongo with shrimp is amazing!  Would go more often if it was closer."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely awesome!!! Staff was so friendly and helpful!!! Elizabeth was our waitress and she was professional, courteous, and very sweet to my kids.. Everyone should try this gem of Phoenix!!! A must stop!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great tasting food at great prices. Will definitely recommend this place. This is the only place I have had that tastes just like my moms!  Try the pernil with yellow rice.  The flan is also to die for!"}
{"text":"It was like being at home with my Mami cooking traditional Puerto Rican food. Of course I had to peak at the Chef and to my surprise she looked like a teenager. She did the damn thing... no better way to describe it. The flan.... geez... don't forget to order you some flan! And the staff... I swear it was like being back in NY with family."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here today thinking she might be impressed that Phoenix actually has a Puerto Rican restaurant but man was I let down. The place was just about empty at the peak of the lunch hour and now I know why. Not that they have to be, but the cook and server were not Puerto Rican. I mention that because the food was absolutely flavorless. This is quite embarrassing if anyone comes here thinking they are eating Puerto Rican food. Down to the side salad on the plate with no dressing, I had to pour the Louisiana hot sauce over the rice and beans and pernil. Food was not expensive so I didn't have much heartache. Good lesson to know, not a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I am a Puerto Rican from NY and I know real PR food !!!!! I moved to AZ a few months ago and was super tired of everyone telling me that Mexican Food was Spanish food !!!!!! Yes it is Spanish food technically, but it is a very different type of food than what I as a PR is use to. I was on the hunt to find some authentic PR food. I googled it and there are only 2 places, this one and a food truck located in Phoenix. I asked my co workers if they wanted to have some of my kind of Spanish food and they were super excited. We went that Friday night and let me tell you it did not disappoint !!!! As soon as we got there we were seated, the owner came over introduced himself and went over all the items on to menu. The girls I went with had no idea what anything was so it was great that he actually took the time to explain every item to them. We put in our orders, had a few beers, and had a absolutely wonderful experience. The food was incredible took me right back home !!!! The alcapurrias OMG OMG OMG. Great music, great staff, outstanding food !!!!! Trust me you will love it !!!"}
{"text":"If you love Rican food, this place is a MUST! Super friendly staff, mi gente, the owner is always there assisting and talking to guests.  Felt like being home for sure, love the wall art with the cities and towns from Puerto Rico.  Everything I've tried is amazing, good job guys! Thanks for bringing home to us in AZ!"}
{"text":"Best rice ever. I wish the portions were bigger but their rice and beef stew is very yummy! The decor inside is beautiful reminds of NYC back east. I can't wait to try other foods on the menu."}
{"text":"Hubby is from the island and he confirmed the food is authenti. Yes service is slow but the owner is very attentive and sweet to his clients. Husband spoke to him nicely and they reminisced about the island. Owner made sure we got treated well and waiters were on point with service and food. Ambience is cozy and definitely has that Puerto Rican feel. We ordered everything on their menu and it was all equally delicious! Can't wait to come back again and again."}
{"text":"As soon as we walk in we get greeted by the hostess, and the whole staff is all smiles which is a good sign. We get seated immediately and the waitress comes in and gets our drinks and once the drinks come in we order our food. I order the pernil arroz con gandul and mg fiancé got the fried chicken with white rice. All in all, it all came out great !"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! However they aren't open half the times they say they are or only serve certain customers during certain times. Today I was denied a table at 7 despite their hours being till 10. But another gentleman was offered and allowed to get a take out order but I was offered nothing but to leave"}
{"text":"Omg. So good. The cod was perfect. The side of mashed plantains with garlic was to die for. The owner was awesome and our waitress was so nice! We had a perfect experience."}
{"text":"A group of us came in for a lunch after looking this place up on Yelp. We are all visiting from different locations and Latinos. The employees are wonderful and very attentive. The food - oh my...As a Puerto Rican I give this place two thumbs up. They made us mofongo de yuca and we tried chuletas, masitas, alcapurrias, pernil and tembleque. What a surprise to find that you can buy a bottle of coquito. Highly recommend Puerto Rican  Latin Grill!!!"}
{"text":"As I write this, Puerto Rico is suffering through an unimaginable catastrophe.  Hurricane Maria, one of the most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricanes in recorded history, delivered a direct hit to the island with Category 5 ferocity.  Hundreds have been killed and all power on the island been wiped out, cutting off survivors literally and figuratively from the rest of the world.  Imagine having no power, no utilities and scant food supplies while dealing with tropical heat for weeks.  I never thought I could see a humanitarian crisis like this play out on U.S. soil again after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.  And yet here we are again.  And just so we're clear, Puerto Rico is part of the United States.  They are not a state, no, but a commonwealth and a US territory just like Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.  So yes, these are US citizens we're talking about and we should respond to their plight accordingly.

Shortly after the hurricane, the AZ Republic ran a story about the valley's Puerto Rican population and their response to the devastation.  Arizona is home to about 11,000 Puerto Rican born residents (one of whom is a friend from work) and there are more than 60,000 of Puerto Rican descent.  While Puerto Rican owned businesses in the valley are relatively small in number, virtually all have been accepting donations from the public to send to the rescue and relief efforts on the island.  One such business Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill.  While I've read up a little on the history of Puerto Rico, I admittedly knew virtually nothing about Puerto Rican cuisine.  So like a good Yelper I did my research, learned about the restaurant and what they serve, and then subsequently made my way here for a bite.

This unique valley restaurant can be found on the north side Thomas Road just a block west of 27th Avenue.  The restaurant lies across the parking lot from Carl's Jr in a building that backs up to the train tracks.  The outside doesn't look like much, but the interior is a laid back fiesta of color.  Flags from island nations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean drape the walls and the ceilings in this relatively quaint but spacious restaurant with seating for about 50 to 60 patrons.  Lively Latin dance music plays in the background and a TV on the wall shows a slideshow of photos of the island before the hurricane hit.  I came here for an early dinner on Thursday and brought a bunch of bottled water to donate.  Turns out they had a massive pile of donations going in the back as people had turned out to help all day.  Heartened, I sat down for dinner.

Like I said I'd done my research in advance so I settled on three distinct dishes for my first go here.  First off the Pasteles.  Tamales made with starch roots, olives, plantains, milk, squash, and filled with pork.  Its apparently the Christmas dish of choice in Puerto Rico and its a tasty one.  A super soft, delicate exterior with a good chunk of shredded pork inside.  For the main dish, I went big.  A Jibarito de Pernil sandwich with a side of the iconic Mofongo.  The Jibarito is a sandwich filled with pulled pork, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and onions with fried plantains substituting for the bread.  The Mofongo is basically mashed plantains that are seasoned with garlic, butter, and chicken broth and then formed.  Fantastic entree all around as the fried plantain added a great texture contrast to the pulled pork on the sandwich and the garlic and butter flavors popped throughout every bite of the Mofongo.  Finally, I got the dessert of choice in Puerto Rico.  The Tembleque.  Essentially coconut pudding doused with cinnamon.  I'm honestly not a big fan of coconut, but this was the most savory delicious rendition of a coconut I can remember.  A super smooth and creamy texture with a little extra kick from that cinnamon.  Total cost for the food, water, tax, & tip came to about $25.

I cannot give this place better than a four star rating due to one thing other Yelpers have correctly pointed out.  The service can at times be slower than it should be.  I'll give them a little bit of a pass today since the staff was busy balancing customers & moving donations around.  But even still my visit here took almost 90 minutes when it should've taken half that time.  To owner Wesley Andujar's credit, he personally came by & thanked me for my water donation & apologized for the disorganization of his staff.  

I ended up speaking at length with Wesley about his family & friends in Puerto Rico whom he still hasn't heard from & hopes they're still alive.  Not surprisingly he looked as though he hadn't slept for days out of concern.  And perhaps that's a good reminder for me and to everyone to keep the people of Puerto Rico your thoughts and in your hearts.  Puerto Rico may be an island, but the people there are just as American as we are.  The island, the people, & their cuisine are national treasures worthy of our efforts to save"}
{"text":"Authentic, good Puerto Rican food. It is a drive for me, but I come as often as I can. Very close to my mothers food. If you've never had Puerto Rican food this is the place to try it."}
{"text":"As soon as I heard that there was a puertorrican restaurant in Phoenix i knew  i had to go as soon as possible to try it even though I reside in Tucson. Once you go in you forget you are in phoenix and will feel transported back to Puerto Rico. The place is really colorful and feels really familiar to being in the island of enchantment. I am used to Puertorrican food since I AM from Puerto Rico so my expectations were high enough. The food was average, not that bad, but not that good either. I had the Mofongo with Carne Frita and it was great, but my friends had the Bistec with rice and beans. There was barely any flavor in that steak (it was over cooked) and the beans were barren and not flavorful at all, even when mixed with the rice. When we asked for some of the beverages on the menu they told us they ran out of them ( coquito, malta India, kola champagne). The prices were a little too high for what we received. All in all, it was not a bad experience but not a great one either."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!  I always enjoy the food. My biggest complaints would be they never offer refills on drinks and the waitresses aren't the friendliest."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff and nice atmosphere. We started off with delicious crispy beef & potato empanadas. I give those a 10. Next we had some beef stuffed plantains, those too were amazing. 
For main course we had two different shrimp dishes; one with garlic shrimp and a mashed plantain. The other dish was shrimp sautéed with onions, sofrito, peppers w/ rice & peas. 
Food was good, good, good!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is is the best Puerto Rican restaurant that I have  had so far in the United States!!! The pernil and pork chops were so tasty and well seasoned! The bacalao and guneos guisado were great and made me feel like I was right in Puerto Rico again:) It really took me back home!!! Great food!..A treasure here in Phoenix! Glad I came:)"}
{"text":"Having been to Puerto Rico twice with my ex who was born and raised on the island, I know authentic Puerto Rican food. 

Omg it's so good... just go try it.

Celiac/gluten free note: most items on their menu are naturally gluten free. 

Food breakdown:

Tostones: thousand island type dressing or a green garlic. Mix them
Mofongo w/ pork: sauce was fantastic, pork awesome, a ton of mofongo
Mofongo w/shrimp: very garlicky... good if you like garlic

Side salad came from the store with ranch. Good to offset the richness of the mofongo.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Food is okay, but we didn't even have an actual server. The manager (who is pleasant) took our order then after that got barely any service after our food was served. Not one server stopped to see if we needed anything, gave us a refill on our drinks, and most of all had to ask twice for our bill after waiting 40 minutes ! We were ready to walk out. We got an apology from the manager a couple times telling us they were slammed. They only had 3 other tables getting served. They need a much bigger staff if they consider that being slammed. If this was our first experience there I would give them the benefit of the doubt that they were having a bad day. But we came here previously a few months ago and had an almost identical experience. We didn't leave a tip because there was absolutely no service whatsoever. Never coming back here again ."}
{"text":"This was my first trip and I will definitely be back.  

I had the mofongo with shrimp and it was amazing!  I think I just found my new favorite food! The hubby had the pernil which was very most and came with yellow rice. Good,  but not as good as mine.  ;)

We had the flan for dessert which was very good also. It was thick and creamy rather than the thin kind you get in Mexican food restaurants.  

The only reason I gave 4 instead of five stars is that I watched the busser wipe down the table with his hand. Lol now that's classy!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends that were visiting out of state. It was my 2nd time there and I was happy to be back. The server was by herself as others were in the kitchen, so the service was slow, but the food was excellent and didn't disappoint. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of options for real Caribbean food in Arizona. Especially on the west side of Phoenix. So, when I first heard about this place I was a little skeptical. But, the food is amazing. Just like my mother makes it. It's weird that they don't have sofrito. But, I love this place. Actual Puerto Ricans running a Puerto Rican restaurant in Phoenix. It's awesome. I could use bigger portions, though. Haha. WEPA!!!"}
{"text":"Well, we were sooo exited to go to an authentic Puertorican restaurant. We are from Puerto Rico so you can imagine how happy we were to find this place. I would not have  given even one star to this place. But cannot post if I don't. My husband and I entered the restaurant, my son, his wife and two babies came in after us. There were quite a few customers.  We just stood there, no one greeted us, there was no sign that said seat yourself, there was a chef that could see us from where he was, did not acknowledge us. 
Then out came a young man, with a tee shirt and a soiled rag on his shoulder. Pointed us to a table. A couple came in after us and were served drinks and given menus. We asked the young man if we could have menus, and he said he would look for some! He came back, took the other couple's order and we still were without menus. We got up and proceeded to leave. Not a sound from anyone, the server did not ask why we were leaving, or if there was anything wrong. No customer service at all. What a disappointment !!! Definitely, sadly, we will not return. Puertoricans  are famous for being friendly and welcoming. None of that here!!"}
{"text":"I have to give it a 4 star due to the 'cooked to perfection' tostones with the garlic dip... Delicious and just how they make it back home... My husband had the pernil with beans and rice, and he devoured the whole thing (stated it was delicious). Great portions too! I had the guisado chicken and I didn't like it (in Panama we cook this dish with a thick tomato base sauce but here it was like a soup). Overall I enjoyed my meal. Word of caution, they ask you if you want avocado with your meal but they don't mention that is 2$ extra."}
{"text":"First off WOW is that a great margarita! I met the owner and he is a total sweet heart! All of the appetizers are to die for and they really give you a taste of Puerto rico! There is even a tv playing pictures of Puerto rico visits with real pictures I love the ambience the art and the tasty food def one of my favs."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch and it was so yummy! The staff was super friendly and personable. We ordered the plantain with beef and cheese, the pork entree and the Creole shrimp plate. left full and happy :) will be back."}
{"text":"I've been missing Puerto Rican food since I moved to the west coast 7 years ago. I am so happy that I found this place!! It feels like home the moment you walk in. If you are lucky enough to get the owner as your waiter he's very personable and it makes the experience awesome! I had the pasteles and the mofongo and my husband had the pernil. The food was perfectly prepared and we had plenty for leftovers the next day! They definitely run on Puerto Rican time, but relax - it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Yelp featured this spot recently, and I went out of my way to grab lunch with my family on a Saturday. We had a the canoa, yuca, mofongo, tostones, empanadas, pernil, and pollo frito. Everything was amazing and authentic!

Staff is bilingual and friendly. It seemed every other guest was Hispanic, which is a sign of the quality Latin American experience. They seem to offer night entertainment (bands, etc).

This place certainly qualifies as one of the best Puerto Rican restaurants in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp my wife and I have been trying a new restaurant each weekend. This weekend we tried Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill. We were very impressed with the quality and taste of the food. We had the Mofongo Carne Frita (mashed plantains with fried pork chunks) and Tostones Al Mojo (twice fried plantain chips with garlic sauce). They were delicious. We had Flan for desert, AWSOME. The restaurant was a true treasure to find. The owner came to the table and we had a great chat. This place was very clean and the food was very affordable. We will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Oh my Lord! It's been a while since I've gone out for Puerto Rican food!! The drive from Scottsdale (45 mins) was definitely worth it!! The food took a while, (most of it freshly made) so I wasn't complaining even though my wife was. Just don't go there when you're starving and you'll be ok. Plenty of food and We even had left overs."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat Puerto Rican Food 
Arroz con Candules, permit de puerco Adela's tienen platano maduro, tostones and more..."}
{"text":"WEPA!! Fun little place.  It was apparent when we arrived that they can get pretty busy.  The two (sisters?) were hard at work bussing a recently vacated group of tables for at least 20 people, and so we had to wait a little while to be seated and then for the server to take our orders.

We ordered appetizers that appeared on the menu as \"empandas\" (there was only 1 served), \"alcapurrias\" (1) and pasteles (1), see the pattern?  Very tasty and authentic flavors (reference road-side food trucks in Luquillo)...however TINY serving size.  Especially the alcapurria (think skinny taquito). I could eat another 5 of those easy.

We also ordered the Bistec Encebollado and the Camarones al Ajillo, Arroz con Gandules and the Mofongo for sides.  I didn't care the for shrimp (pretty much a scampi) but the latin-style steak con cebollas was pretty good.  The arroz con ganules and the mofongo were really excellent.  For dessert we split a coconut tembleque, which because it was served cold really hit the spot.

Overall a very fun spot to check out.  The flavors, salsa music playing, banderas, and nice people took us away to Puerto Rico for just a minute. Go, and check this place out!  I'll be back again for sure"}
{"text":"Very uncomfortable experience.  My visit was the only time I've ever walked out of a restaurant.  Upon entering, there was nobody to greet us, so after standing for a minute or two, we grabbed our own menus and sat ourselves.  Even though there were two servers and only six tables of people, nobody acknowledged us.  No hello, no waters, nothing.  After 22 minutes seated with no service, we left.

My girlfriend is Puerto Rican and was dying to show me authentic food.  We drove 45 minutes from south Chandler specifically to eat at the best place in Phoenix.  She had been telling me about it all week, about specific things she'd get us.  It's a shame that my first experience was so negative, but I'll have to try some of the other authentic options (closer to home.)

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Especially if you live in the East Valley."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was horrible. They need more servers and the servers need to do better in the customer service department. Not many options for Puertorican food in the area, so I will definitely visit again. Hopefully they improve the service since it's a common theme throughout the reviews. The carne frita con mofongo was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience with the way they cook real original caribian and of course Puerto Rican way....mmmmm
The owner need to bring live music ...salsa n reggeton artist ..."}
{"text":"Super authentic food here all very fresh and delicious!  I had pork it was cooked to perfection my wife had chicken stew also delicious.  Got best sweet plantains in PHX!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they've all been excellent dining experiences. They have the best pork in the valley hands down. Great ambiance and a sexy waitress lol."}
{"text":"What an amazing place, staff and owner. The food is superb ! and the prices are reasonable for such a great homestyle cuisine . I enjoy the ambiance as much as the food being served. The owner going around ensuring everything  is going well really is a nice touch. I will be coming here more often with friends to show them what Puerto Rican cuisine is all about"}
{"text":"I love authentic Latin American food. My wife is in love with the empanadas. FYI these are real empanadas to us, because they are savory not sweet and filled with tasty beef. It took me back to when I was in Ecuador and when my wife was in Argentina."}
{"text":"As a guy raised on the island, I can definitively say this is authentic Puertorican food. El Sofrito is strong with this one. The service was a little slow, but we forgot the wait as soon as the food arrived."}
{"text":"Went for late lunch today. Restaurant only had one waitress and two cooks on duty. Food was good but service was very bad. Also they only have can drinks so there are no refills. Bistec was a bit chewy as there was a lot of grizzle on it. Tostones were delicious big portions. May try it again someday."}
{"text":"Phoenix Friends!! If any of you are craving the wonderful cuisine of Puerto Rico , I would recommend this place hands down! By far the best I've had since being on the beautiful island . 

Canoa was SO good!! The sweet plantain was cooked perfectly along with perfectly seasoned meat and melted cheese (about to drool thinking about it). I had the beef stew and my friend had the chicken stew. We tried each others and both meats were tender and very flavorful. Each entree was offered mofongo or rice with beans. Of course, we did not pass up the mofongo which was served with perfect garlic sauce. 

This place is now one of my favorites in this hot desertcity.

{"text":"Went there for lunch today with a friend. The place was empty except for us and I don't really understand why. We ordered a couple appetizers to share. My favorite was the fried plantains. I ordered the Pernil which is a slow roasted pork dish and I had the yellow rice with it. It also came with a side salad which is a nice touch. The pork was delicious although it didn't seem to have as much flavor as it did the first time I came. Also there was some fat in it that I had to scrape out. It wasn't a lot but enough  for me to mention it here. My friend ordered the fried chicken and yellow rice. She enjoyed it and said she would definitely come back. I love that they have the Coco Rico soda to drink. This is a coconut flavored soda that I really like. I can't speak to the authenticity of the food as I am not an expert on Puerto Rican food but I can say it's delicious and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots to get Puerto Rican good just like my great-grandmother makes it! 
It is amazing every time I eat it! I love the restaurant and pricing is also good! 
Lunch special is pretty inexpensive as well and a good portion, so if you are on a budget I recommend coming for lunch.
Service is good and the servers and owners are really nice and always make us feel welcomed! I really enjoy coming here to get my fix on some great Puerto Rican food! 
Yum!! :)"}
{"text":"Good solid Puerto Rican dishes. Wished more options were available. Oddly their alcapurias are very oblong but didn't take away from the taste.  Definitely worth the visit. Free pen to boot!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience the aroma, sight, and taste of authentic Puerto Rican cuisine without the cost of jumping on a plane, you have to try the food here. The service is a little slow, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Realized I just had to start making reviews on this service because of a nasty food experience at this restaurant last week.  This is my first Yelp review.  I had something that tasted like overcooked mystery meat with mofongo at dinner here.  Nothing really had much flavor and they only give you little sample size condiments one at a time. The real surprise came later. . . if you all know what I mean.  This place is trying to pass itself off as some kind of authentic PR experience but it's just sub par to go food. Stay away from this place, your digestive system will thank you later."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful environment, the waitstaff is very courteous,the food is just so delicious."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Wesley, Elizabeth & staff never miss a beat!!! Como dicen lo Cubanos...\", ÑOOOOOOO!!!! Phenomenal place to push back and savor Great Puerto Rican food. The pernil and arroz con gandules is the REAL DEAL!!!! Love this place!!!

Danny MOJITO Gonzalez"}
{"text":"Not only is the food authentic, the people are too! I ordered the mofongo with fried beef and I was in heaven. Half way through eating it one of the guys walks over and gives me a little caldo from the carne  guisada he was making to put on my mofongo...dude that's something I have never experienced anywhere else except with family!  After that I had to order a side of the arroz con gandules!

With Hector Lavoe and Rey Ruiz in the background I felt like I was in a restaurant in Puerto Rico. I live in LA and this place is worth the 1 hour flight or 5 hour drive....YES....it's that good!!

Check this place out...you'll see what it feels like for Puerto Ricans to visit family since that's how I felt when I was there...and it was my first time,"}
{"text":"Unfortunately i was quite disappointed with this service. I have friends that cook Puertorican food and it is incredible. Which is why I wanted to try this place out when I saw it on yelp. When I walked in, there was no one on site and it took them a pretty minute to actually come and tell me where I could sit. When the chick did, She asked if she could get me something to drink. I got the Coco Rico which was possibly the tastiest thing of the menu. The recommended plate of Mofongo and Pernil, were tasteless and bland. I am used to Latin food having a whole lot of taste and it is why I like it so much. This place, was disappointing. It needs a lot more flavor to the food and more from the employees. The whole meal cost me $20 and this too was disappointing as i did not find the food up to par. It will be a long time before i am willing to give this place a shot. Good selections, just needs better cooking and better spices used."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but I had the worst service here. Servers only paid attention to their assigned tables and big groups. Service was super slow, even for a soda refill. Appetizer came out the same time as our meal which was 45mins after we ordered. Not good when the hanger kicks in. When I went, I guess the owner had his family there as well so the kids were going crazy on the drums. It was loud and uncomfortable because it made me feel out of place, especially when I'm barely getting any service. 

Other than that, the food was good when we finally got it. The place was descent with good parking and design inside."}
{"text":"So amazing! We tried this place when we first came to Phx 5 yrs ago-ahhh wasn't great- over did it with garlic! Tried it again my sister in law loves this place so we decided to give it another try!!! Food is amazing! A great touch of Puerto Rican flavor and warm hospitality! I had the Canoa very yummy and flavorful, along with Pastele (hope I spelled it right) but ohhh so yummy! My husband had Pernil and the Mofongo So yummy!!! Food was really good! Definitely going back so much better- then the first time and this place deserve a second look if you tried it years ago and it want good! 
They definitely stepped up their food quality and flavor! If you looking for some great Puerto Rican food! Definitely try this place out! Very affordable! Food was too yummy I didn't even get a chance to take pics!:)"}
{"text":"I wanted a taste from home without cooking. So I looked online and found this place. Once we got there it felt like home. The mofongo is delicious. Pasteles are great. If you have never had Puerto Rican food it is the place to go. I recommend the pork shoulder and mofongo platters. My best friend is Puerto Rican so I know authentic. Aside from her kitchen it will give you a good starting point."}
{"text":"Great place and great food, everything is authentic(trust me a real Puerto Rican brought me here). I had the mofongo with shrimp and of course some tostones. Everything was very flavorful. Service took a little long but it's expected since practically everything needs to be made to order, these dishes can't sit out. The exterior isn't very inviting but it's beautiful inside. The decor is really colorful, ethnic and fun. I enjoyed the slide show of photos the screen was showing and the owner was very nice and introduced himself when we walked in. I will definitely be back and will recommend to anyone looking for an authentic Puerto Rican meal! Great job!"}
{"text":"Eating here was like having dinner with family or friends - thanks to the owners and servers!  I came in from Houston to hire and train new volunteers for our non-profit organization.  The next incentive we are offering volunteers is a trip to Puerto Rico so I wanted to get them in the mood by going to a Puerto Rican restaurant.  The food was good (appetizers are crazy cheap!  So we got one of each) but service even better - they treated us like royalty.  Ben broke out the guitar and sang to us and Wesley and Ben even got us dancing before we left. We'll go back and take more friends."}
{"text":"Stood at the door for 15 minutes. Nobody bothered to help us or let us know what to do. Would have liked to try the food. Oh well."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough, great authentic food good service. Definitely a must try if in Phoenix. They lost a star because the platano maduro wasn't completely ripe and that's one of my favorites but still very good."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!! With truly Puertorican flavor!!! Clean facilities.  However, the service is not good.  Also, if you are not Puertorican, the menu may be confusing.  If they could improve those two things, and  be a little more friendly, I would give them a 5 star. Really good food (though very very garlicky!!!)"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Coming from Las Vegas where there is no Puerto Rican food. It was nice to eat some authentic PR food. Would definitely come again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Thank God for this place! Finally a well run, Clean, Delicious, and  Authentic Puerto Rican Restraunt in Arizona. Keep up the great job! I enjoyed it so much..... That I to go back the following day to get some more!!!  \"Vaya Mi Gente Sigue  Adelante\""}
{"text":"Walked in Saturday evening expecting a great meal. I was recommended to thiz place by a born and raised nuyorican. Reviews show food is phenomenal. Unfortunately I can't agree. We waited at the front door for about 10 minutes and nobody greeted us. The three people in the kitchen kept looking out at us but never nodded or offered any type of acknowledgement. As everyone already seated stared at us waiting to be seated, I noticed every single one of the 8 tables did not have food. Needless to say, after 10 more agonizing minutes of waiting at the front door, 10 we left."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great food and great mission -- to be the very best Puerto Rican restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always repin' @frijolitosmobilecoffee in the #AZ. Enjoying our local #PR restaurant when moms out of town!!! This is the closest thing to home cookin'!! Even when mom is tired of cookin' it up for the familia, mom gets treated like a PR Queen here, so....when in don't, Puerto Rican Latin Grill is the place to visit!!! Mmmmmmm.... Delicious!"}
{"text":"Puerto Rican food doesn't get much worse than this--and way way overpriced too!  My spouse and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon.  I ordered the pork which was dry and flavorless, just like the yellow rice it was served with.  He ordered the mofongo relleno carne asada, and although the mofongo itself was very edible, the carne asada was deep-fried to the point of being hard and flavorless.  We also ordered a mixed appetizer plate to share, which was a big mistake as I could run down to the grocery store and get frozen items out of a box that are far more tasty.  I felt at one point like I was eating leftovers out of someone's fridge. I did appreciate that both the dining room and bathroom were clean.  But frankly, just about amateur cook could make better food than we were served at PR Bar and Grill.  Their prices are pretty proud for some pretty disrespectable food."}
{"text":"Good Service. Great food. So grateful to have this place in Arizona,  so far away from PR"}
{"text":"excellent restaurant. outstanding latin food. great music and atmosphere. they love baseball in this place."}
{"text":"I used a groupon here and the food was pretty good. I probably would not go here again unless I had a discount or coupon though. The steak was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is great, but I couldn't give it five stars because they take too long to serve you. This is my first review -- not my first visit. It was so good the first time that I had to return with the familia. 

I had the \"Jibarito\" sandwich, which consists of delicious, thinly sliced steak with lettuce tomato and ketchup and mayo sauce -- ready for the kicker? Instead of bread they use long, thin and crispy plantains. These are like \"tostones on steroids\" . My side dish was white rice and red beans, also delish! 

The owner and staff are exactly what you'd expect from my Puerto Rican people, sweetness! My only wish is that they get more help in the kitchen and at least on more server. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Plátanos maduros were cooked with too much oil.  Yucca was cooked in too much oil and butter, empanada meat was poor quality.  Arroz con guandules had too much salt and spice."}
{"text":"Food is great- full of flavor and reminds me of living in New York. The service, on the other hand is really lacking. At times, the restaurant will be closed without notice and there is no answering machine when calling. It is frustrating to want pernil and attempt calling for over an hour, just to drive down and realize they are closed (no sign- just locked doors). I love the tostones, pernil, arroz con gandules, but eveything seems to run on island time, instead of NYC speed."}
{"text":"Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill and I love my Puerto Rican food, my only wish is to this place near me. It's a 30 minute drive from my point to Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill, but I have to say worth the drive every time. 
- Food and appetizers was delicious
- It is super clean
- The Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill team member is super friendly
- Bathroom super clean
- Menu items reasonably price
- Decor is very typical Puerto Rican and clean
- Great place to just chill out with friends or romantic"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying mofongo and it had a good garlicky flavor. I was surprised that it worked together. The fired pork was just okay - it didn't leave a WOW impression with me; however, their yellow rice with peas...is AMAZING! The Bistec is good...the only complaint is that I wish there was more meat! The meat was super tender and flavor was tasty! I also tried the Coco Rico which is like coconut soda...it was different (it was great nor terrible), but it's not really for me. 

So why the 3 star only? The service is s...u...p...e...r s...l...o...w! When I entered the restaurant, there was a large group leaving. I understand that it could take some time to get things situated; however, it took like 10-15 minutes for someone to approach me to let me know. A few other staff saw me and didn't even bother to acknowledge me or the other customers that came after me. Then I was told to follow one of the workers (which I think was an owner) and then he got distracted with other people and forgot about me until he made eye contact. And when it came to paying, the lady said she would be back to pick up the payment, but after 10-15 minutes, I decided to just walk up front to pay. I left this place more wondering, what kind of customer service they have here..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Puertorrican food !!! Tostones, carne frita, biftec, mofongo, etc ! Ah and coquito !!"}
{"text":"¡Dios Mio!  Easily the best Puerto Rican food in Phoenix!  

I otderee the beef-stuffed (and I mean stuffed!) empanada.  I initially thought $3 was a but much... until I took my first bite.  And then doors to a whole new world opened up... and lights inside my brain that had been missing bulbs for years suddenly turned on!

Excellent empanada!

I also ordered the Jibarito.  This was actually the reason for my visit... and it was a thing if perfection.  Perfectly toasted plaintains... just the right proportion of each ingredient... and the most amazingly delicious jibarito this side of the Atlantic Ocean (or at least in the State of Arizona)!

Bookmark this restaurant and then go here!  Or go here and then bookmark it if that's your style... but either way be sure to put this on your short list of restaurants to try!

FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and family atmosphere. My four year old and grandmother wiped their dishes clean. We had the pork shoulder and garlic shrimp. They both took a while to come out (came out fresh). Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Minis stars I need less stars this place sucks ass waited more than 20 minutes no one took my order I got up and left disappointed.."}
{"text":"I came here just to get out and find these great restaurants. Found this place and thought I would give it a try. The place does represent the a lot of nations especially Puerto Rico with all the flags they hang up. The place does look nice with the bright colors around it. I had a waitress who did enhance the experience, she seemed sweet and kind. The chicken I ordered came out longer than it should have. The food here is excellent and I really love the flavoring it has. This is a good spot to settle down to get some food."}
{"text":"The food is authentic PR fare like mom makes it. The service isn't super fast, but c'mon- we are on island time here. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted to badly to love this place, but I didn't.
I visited Puerto Rico and had wonderful food there. This place is not up to par.

The service is good, and the owners are VERY nice.
The food was overcooked and dry. I couldn't eat most of the mofongo because I couldn't swallow it because it was so dry.

In 6 months or so, I might give them another try, and I will update my review then."}
{"text":"This place never dissappoints when I get homesick for Tampa I love to come here. The people are so nice every time. Food is great mofongo is perfect the Carne Frita is just it is in Ponce. I recommend this place for great food."}
{"text":"I'm in a happy, fat food coma right now. Today, my husband and I were trying to decide on take-out and I came across a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment book. Score and done deal! I was glad to see they had a website with the menu listed. The menu does the trick but it would be nice if the pictures listed the name of the entrée. The menu looked to be identical to the previous restaurant which was fine by me. 

We ordered the Tostones al mojo, 2 alcapurrias, pernil with yellow and gandules (pigeon peas), and the beef stew with rice and a side of red beans. Everything was very delicious. The rice definitely had some crunchy parts (as another reviewer mentioned) which didn't bother me. I am Puerto-Rican and grew up used to the rice intentionally being cooked that way. I can see how it could be off-putting to others, though. My husband thought the pernil was slightly bland but I thought it was just fine. 

The bill was $32 before coupon, and after coupon, came out to $19. I guess we were the first to use this BOGO coupon and the guy spent some time trying to figure it out. He was very apologetic, though. Overall, great value even without the coupon, as we have plenty of leftovers. Will definitely be back for some PR comfort food."}
{"text":"Puerto Rican Latin Bar and Grill is cultura! The owner Wesley makes it feel like you are right on the Island..... The Steak Guisado is my favorite... Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. I had the carne guisada lunch special with mofongo. My husband had the pernil with mofongo special. And of course, tostones. Coco Rico to drink. Elizabeth was our waitress. Super friendly. They need to open a place in South Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious food from Puerto Rico.  Definitely have some tostones, empanadillas and wash them down with either a Malta India or a Coco Rico. That is just to start off. Then select any of the delicious meals on the menu. For dessert either a Flan or Tembleque. Great food and good environment."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and mostly all were positive. There were a few comments about service and it appears that that is no longer the case. I was greeted immediately and seated. I came in during lunch and there were quite a few people. I ordered one of the special options....pernil, rice and beans. It came out super fast. It was very good. Pernil was a tad salty but very good. I will come again. 

Just a note to the Puerto Ricans out there and the PR food lovers. I've lived in AZ over 15 years and there have been a few attempts by people to open and run PR restaurants in the past. I want a good place to eat and a place to remind me of home and mom. If you slam the place on yelp without letting the ownership know your concern then you are damming the place and ensuring that it will not remain. Make sure that your comments are voiced to the ones that can make the changes and let's give them the support and chance to succeed."}
{"text":"Went to enjoy I thought would be good Puerto Rican food big disappointment fried Platanos were thick , Platanos Madura weren't even sweet small pieces over fried,French fries not homemade which I never knew was a staple for Puerto Rican food, empanada fall of under seasoned meat the masa of the acapuria was good Do Not waste your money everything I tried I could've made at home but I just wanted to be served."}
{"text":"So I get a random craving for arroz con gandules while running on the treadmill at the gym. So what do I do? Finish my run, go out to my car and yelp - puerto rican food near me. Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill pops up so I call and place a pick up order. 

Arroz con gandule, lechon, alcapurrias and a couple pastelillos. After the treadmill this is obviously counterproductive but a craving for arroz is.....well if you've ever had one you totally get it. 

The food was ready QUICK! The restaurant was only 15mins from my gym and when I got there it was just about ready. The arroz was perfection. The lechon was moist and seasoned well! The alcapurrias and pastelillos were yummy - but then again if you're a REAL authentic PR restaurant it is pretty difficult to screw these two menu items up! The portion size was so much so that I had enough for myself, my boyfriend, and then lunch for myself the next day. 

The owner rang me up and chatted w/ me a little bit. He was super friendly and you can tell he really cares about the success of his business. I highly recommend this place...especially if you're familiar w/ PR food. The owner gave me a coupon to use when I return. I will be taking my PR family back to try this. Caribbean cuisine in the desert...I couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when it comes to getting a home cooked meal that reminds me of home. The food is good, cooked in the same manner I grew up with, being here in AZ for 9 years now this is the closet I'll get to back home food.

Wes is great and the staff is always great, sometimes they will have special offerings too. Listen, if you don't feel like buying a whole pork shoulder and cooking that for 6 hours just come here! Pernil is good! 

While writing this it's been a while since I've went, well I know what's for dinner tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We went based on the reviews.  I can say the service and experience was horrible.  We had to ask for dressing for our salads, refills for our drinks. The place was packed enough that the owner should of got off his azz to help instead of sit watching TV. Service means more then the food sometimes you pay  money for service and experience... MY HUSBAND AND WOULD NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. My family and I came tonight for my birthday and we all enjoyed ourselves. The service was stellar and the food was very tasty. The mofongo is my favorite. It's filled with so much flavor and the consistency is just right. The empanadas were delightful. The owner, Wesley, is a super nice guy and checked on us often. If you're tired of eating the same things and looking for something different in Phoenix, check this place out"}
{"text":"I'm puerto Rican and was so happy to find a Puerto Rican restaurant moderately close to where I live. I usually go to Mili's Cafe all the way out in Mesa but found this place that was much closer. They do not have any customer service experience whatsoever. Don't expect to be seated when you enter just grab a seat. Is a constant hassle trying to flag down the waitress for a refill or a little more mayoketchup. It takes forever to get anything in this place. It takes forever to receive a menu, it takes forever to get a drink after you get your menus, and it takes forever for the food to come out. And the food doesn't even come out in order or at the same time. Is very disappointed because I love Puerto Rican food. The food itself is OK the pernil was super dry. if service was better than this place would be the shit."}
{"text":"Visited this place today for late lunch, LIVE IT, we add appetizers, pasteles, alcapurrias., and I had mofongo with pork meat on the side, amazing.  Service was good, I love Lidia, and the owner was very pleasant  too, thank you for the yuca pasteles, we will be back"}
{"text":"Service and food is great. If your a whiner and full of yourself like a recent post, lets call her Chulla whatever that means, stay home. This is a real family environment like being in PR or Cuba and like when I lived in Miami. Nice people serving authentic PR food..Enjoy and support PR in this time of need."}
{"text":"My husband & I love this place. We came here before the new owners. But since the new owners, we have been there more frequently. Wesley, the owner, is an amazing person and this place is his baby! You can taste it in the food for sure! Family owned and operated so you know it's going to be amazing. It's the best Puerto Rican food in Phoenix, hands down. My husband always gets the mofongo y pernil with a side of garlic oil for the mofongo (likes to keep the vampires away I think). I like to change it up and get something diff each time. I love the chuletas, alcapurrias, and the ambience the most. We make it a point to come at least 2x/month but if it were up to me, it would be a daily visit. 
Thank you for your amazing service and food each time."}
