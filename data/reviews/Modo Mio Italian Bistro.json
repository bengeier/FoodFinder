{"text":"Just had the most perfect lunch at Modo Mio this afternoon! The food was phenomenal and the service spot on. We (husband and I with our two year old - they are super kid friendly and gave our son crayons to keep busy) had the grilled calamari, kale Caesar salad, calzone and pasta a la vodka. The portions were generous, the flavours fantastic, and everything come quickly and was fresh. i highly recommend this place! We will be back often and will likely order takeout regularly as I already crave the calzone!"}
{"text":"What can I say other then amazing. We ordered almost half the menu and there was not a thing I could complain about. On top of that the service was amazing and the restaurant is nice and small so you feel warm and cozy. What really blew me away was their customer service. A huge recommend from me!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service.  We will be back.   Not sure which was our favorite the gnocchi or the lasagna.  Make sure to save room for the tiramisu"}
{"text":"I went to Modo Mio for lunch and a fantastic experience. I had a veal sandwich with nothing extra on it. It was incredible. There was the perfect amount of meat. The bread was fresh and delicious and the fried calamari was amazing. 
The food is made from scratch, the bread is picked up daily, the aura is very comfortable and friendly. 

The service was awesome. The man who worked there was very nice and friendly. He told us all about how the food is fresh. 

They deliver!

I would give them 6/5 stars if I could. I would recommend Modo Mio to everyone. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! Staff is extremely approachable, friendly and the lovely server remembered us from our order. We visited after 2 months and she remembered us. You can also find parking beside the baskin Robbins in the corner where there are residences. 

They've been in business for not too long but this place definitely deserves more love. This place should be packed with the kind of fresh food and amazing staff they have! Definitely going to be one of my regular go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"The food in this place is good. Delicious, if slightly under-seasoned. However, the service was horrible and it really ruined the experience. Waited over one hour for our mains (the restaurant was only about 30% full), to find they brought the wrong order: A pasta dish that wasn't even on the menu. After the waitress tries to convince me to take the dish, even though I explicitly said I didn't like the ingredients on it (and it wasn't what I ordered), she runs back and forth a few times, finally realizing she had given us an outdated menu. I select a new dish, they take another 20 minutes, I eat. I was particularly annoying that nobody came to apologize or even offered to waive the cost of the dish. No matter how delicious food is, nothing offsets poor service. And the food here is definitely not good enough to have compensated for a bad experience.

PS: The other three tables in the restaurant also waited roughly the same amount of time for their foods. I saw one other patron send a dish back. And finally the lady in the table next to me had to go all the way into the kitchen to remind the waitress to bring her meal. So I wasn't alone!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from Modo Mio! The food was absolutely delicious and portions were perfectly sized. VERY reasonably priced. We had the chicken parmigiana sandwich, margherita pizza, and giardino salad. You could tell everything was made fresh in house.I will definitely be back and I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Casual Italian place on Avenue.  Very friendly staff.  Seated quickly.  Food was good.  Tried the bruschetta, fried calamari, pizza, and pasta carbonara. Especially like the pizza... thin with a crispy crust."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs, best in recent memory!  Soft, well seasoned meat, tomato sauce on all my noodles, really decent with the Parmesan.   Polenta appetizer sticks was a first for me. Served with fresh, spicy crushed chili's and oils on the side.  Fried crispy, served hot.  Soft, refrigerated tiramisu made by the owner! Excellent. Italian ambiance, tasteful decor, clean, cozy and warm. Lit candles on every table.  Oil paintings of old Italy on the walls.  Attention to details such as when the server notices your table rocks slightly and fixes it for you. Above and beyond what you might expect. At least 3 Italian bottled beers to choose from, (no draught) and wines. Great for a date night, doesn't break the bank.  Some outdoor seating for the warmer months."}
{"text":"We went to Modo mio and had a great experience.  Bought the Groupon for $30.
The food: white bean and kale side - beans were tender and kale was not over cooked or soggy. Good side dish
4 cheese gnocchi - one of the best I have had, fluffy and and creamy without being too dense or heavy. Delicious!
Spaghetti and meatballs-my husband had this dish, it had 2 large meatballs cut into halves. Pasta was al dente and meatballs were well seasoned. He really enjoyed this dish.
We were really looking forward to trying the tiramisu but they were sold out (we came in for dinner pretty late). We shared the cheesecake instead. It was okay, nothing special...it was light and creamy and the coulis paired well with it.
Atomosphere: cute bistro. Clean and uncluttered. There is a small street patio as well.  There is street meter parking in front 

Definitely looking forward to coming again and hopefully before they run out of tiramisu! Will update review then."}
{"text":"Try the Rustica pizza, lasgana, grilled calamari and tiramisu! So delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect.  Nicest staff, delicious food. We ate outside with our two little kids.  Panzerotto was unreal."}
{"text":"Food was all very good, other than the polenta fries, which could have been more corny tasting. Tiramisu was as good as the nonna made versions I have had. Panzerotto was devoured. 

Attentive service."}
{"text":"We visited them for dinner last night. The food was very good and made from the freshest ingredients as far as we could tell.
We tried the rosemary polenta fries, pizza margherita and tagliatelle modo mio pasta. 
Rosemary Polenta Fries were served with spicy marinara sauce mixed with some olive oil. They were good.
The Pizza Margherita was very nice with very tasty, savoury and tangy tomato sauce on the base with oregano topped with mozzarella. Loved it.
The Tagliatelle modo mio was cooked al dente with cherry tomatoes, spinach, zucchini, basil and EVOO. It was good too but we liked pizza the best.

The service was warm, friendly and attentive. During the course of an hour the waitress checked on us 4-5 times.
The location is not too far for us and the paid street parking is available right in front of the restaurant on both sides of the street. 
The prices were reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients and the preparation.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"went with a co-worker a few months ago and to start off the place was empty except for a  couple who the owner doted on the whole time they were there. he had no contact with me and my friend/co worker. it took forever to receive our food, (which was okay but nothing special)..45 minutes with only two other people in the restaurant (for lunch). there are much nicer restaurants out there..do yourselves a favour and do not visit this restaurant"}
{"text":"The Italian pasta is made from scratch, fresh! 
Don't let the modest sign and storefront fool you, the food here is excellent! 
I had the veal parm and it was melt in your mouth soft and very tasty! 
Service is fast and friendly. The owner is caring and very active. I highly recommended Modo Mio for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"excellent italian food, carbonara was very juicy. however, service was a bit slow (20-25 min wait) when there was no diners at the restaurant. like others have said, younger server seems a bit lost/awkward (no hate). would recommend 8/10"}
{"text":"Over the weekend my friend and I visited Modo Mio and had a really good experience. We ordered 4 different dishes so we could enjoy our Italian meal in a tapas meal format. 

We ordered grilled calamari, beet salad, grilled peppers/zucchini and a gluten free rotini cacciatore pasta. 

The waitress asked us if she should bring everything together or as it was made and we opted for her to bring it when it is fresh out of the oven. 

Dish 1: Grilled Calamari 
The first dish our waitress brought to our table was the grilled calamari. It was presented really well but was a little over cooked. It was a little too chewy for our liking but it was still very flavourful. 

Dish 2: Grilled Peppers/Zucchini 
Next our waitress brought us the grilled vegetables. They were absolutely fantastic! The zucchini and peppers were cooked perfectly. They had tons of flavour and weren't too soft or too hard; they were just right like goldilocks portage in the story of the three bears.

Dish 3: Spinach Beet Salad
The spinach and beet salad was really good. It featured beets, apple, fennel, candied pecans and goat cheese, which we asked to be placed on the side. The dressing was really sweet and it complemented the salad perfectly.

Dish 4: Gluten Free Rotini Cacciatore. This dish was delightful! It tasted exquisite with the combination of the Italian sausage, peppers, onions, fresh tomatoes, and San Marzano tomato sauce. My only complaint would be that it didn't come with a lot of sausage. We were told this was a really meaty dish so I expected more. With that being said the past sauce was extremely flavourful. 

All over, I would return to this restaurant but I hope the pasta has more sausage next time."}
{"text":"Modo Mio is definitely a gem in the neighbourhood! It's food quality is consistently beyond expectations, which allows the Mr. and myself to walk out with our bellies full!  To date, we have tried a variety of their menu items but unfortunately, we always end up ordering and eating all their savoury items with no space for dessert (I'll make it a priority to try their desserts next time!)

As for their savoury items, we've had the following over a number of visits:
Grilled Calamari - tender, juicy, yummy is all I remember about this dish.

Fried Calamari - this is by far one of the best tasting fried calamari dish that I've had in town.  They use a different type of batter (I think they used peameal) before frying.  It's crispy yet light.  Can I say more? 

Rosemary Polenta Fries - it's hot, fresh and most definitely made to order!  We absolutely love the sauce that comes with it because it's got a bit of a kick to it and doesn't overpower the taste of the polenta fries itself.

Insalata Modo Mio - the kitchen staff put a nice twist to this. I have to admit, I was a tad disappointed when it came with orange as opposed to peaches as stated on the menu (I presume peaches weren't in season at the time).  For this, I'll have to come back again some day to give this another try.

Vodka Pasta (Rigatoni a la Vodka) - I swear, if they gave me some bread, I would clear off the plate off by dipping the bread into the sauce!

Modo Mio pizza - again, the kitchen staff does a great job putting this pizza together. The crust is thin and crispy, and the toppings are plentiful.

Saporito pizza - I'm not going to lie, but I'm not a huge fan of olives...but after having the Saporito pizza, I'd be willing to have olives on my food.  As usual, the pizza is thin and crispy, and the flavour of the toppings makes a great combination to indulge in.  The Italian salami, olives and capers give a \"just right\" flavour, not being overly salty where I would need glasses of water to balance my palette.

I definitely have more good things to say, but I'll have to save it for another time.  All in all, the food is great and we are always lucky enough to get seated right away (hehe a part of me wants Modo Mio to remain a hidden gem so we can keep coming back for quality food)."}
{"text":"My rating for this restaurant remains a firm 4 star for its incredible customer service. Our waitress consistently provided us with refills of water, carefully took my boyfriend's allergy into consideration and reassured us with every dish brought to us. Most importantly, she did it with a smile! She was such a sweetheart and really made our first time here enjoyable. 

The setting is rustic and more on the smaller side, with dimmed lights to create a more romantic environment! 

On another note, the food portions are small. You pay for quality instead of quantity. The Gnocchi I ordered was homemade and had a soft chewy texture. The appetizer, Fried Calamari, had a light texture and wasn't too heavy - the tomato sauce served with it really complimented its flavour.

Still had a great time and would come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and owner Rick was very nice too!  Tried the lasagna and insalata modo mia with grilled chicken and they were both delicious.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food but service was a bit slow. I don't mind because I wasn't in a rush but the kids got really hungry waiting for the pizza."}
{"text":"Bought a $30 value deal from Groupon. I ordered the 4 cheese gnocchi and my boyfriend ordered the Rotini Cacciatore. The food were 3/5. His pasta could have been homemade by ourselves and my gnocchi 4 cheese were not flavorful enough and lacked some taste. 
Service was good, which I'd give 5/5.
When  it gets darker in the evening, they dim the lights and light up a candle on each table."}
{"text":"I had the margherita pizza.The cheese was a bit dry and too salty making the pizza taste like a regular fast food pizza. However, I liked the cappucino."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! I've had their pasta a few times and loved it, and just tried their pizza. One of the best pizzas I've had in the area! Authentic Italian flavors and very friendly service. I love that they're open 7 days a week until 10:30pm!"}
{"text":"Simply great food and great service. We had the spaghetti and meatballs and it's was delicious. Priced right also. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal at Modo Mio. There was only one server for the small dining room (Sam) but he really did a great job keeping everyone happy. He was very friendly and warm, which really makes such a difference with the whole dining experience. 

The grilled calamari was really nice, as was their pizza Bianca (we added soprasetta and mushrooms) although I was expecting the pizza to be a lot cheesier than it was. I really love it when the cheese is super melty (is that a word?) so when you take a bite, the cheese turns stringy as you pull it away from your mouth. Not the case with this pizza, which is why I couldn't give this visit 5 stars. 

The real star of the night was the 4-cheese gnocchi. So flavourful and the texture was spot-on - super light and pillowy. I would definitely return for that dish alone!! 

We finished our meal with tiramisu, which is made in house - I believe the owner's mother makes it. I was too full to finish mine, but it was very good. 

Prices are very good for the quality of food. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This nice, cozy bistro is not to be missed. Five of us went this evening and the words amazing, excellent, incredible and awesome were understatements to the food that was presented to us.

Reviews no matter how positive do not do this place justice, you need to experience it firsthand. First of all, servers are great at describing the food making it quite clear most of the ingredients are made from scratch.

Special diets were easily accommodated and anything that wasn't meeting expectations were corrected as soon as possible.

Personally I had the gnocchi 4 cheese, the gnocchi and sauce were smooth and creamy. The waiter brought fresh, warm bread to soak up any residual sauce after the gnocchi were all gone.

I couldn't resist trying some of the spaghetti and pomodore sauce. It was also incredible. Tasted homemade.

Although full, the words 'homemade cheesecake' peaked my interest. My friend and I both ordered a slice and it was well worth it. Once again, very creamy.

Overall, even though the weather didn't cooperate, the meal was fabulous. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, service fast, and helpful, and Sam our waiter was special, attentative and friendly. The place is small, painted orange and yellow, but the food authentic Italian. We will return often. BEST REGARDS"}
{"text":"A wonderful casual dining place in the neighborhood.  Friendly and attentive service. Fried calamari was great, as were the pizzas."}
{"text":"As everyone else has said in previous reviews, the food is absolutely amazing here. My boyfriend and I checked this place out because they have a $15 for $30 worth of food for 2 on Groupon. It's located about 5 minutes from Yorkdale Mall so it's convenient if you're in the area. 

We went on a Sunday night and it was empty. The decor is a bit sparse and random with a Ducati in the front window but the ambiance was nice with candles on each table. The waitress was attentive although she looked a bit lost. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive but it was so delicious that it made up for it. I ordered the rotini cacciatore ($14.75) and my boyfriend got the spaghetti carbonara ($13.50). Both were so good and they were big portions. I would definitely recommend this place for the food although the service and atmosphere could do with some improvement though."}
{"text":"It was such a great experience that my boyfriend and I have decided to come back soon!

Service (5 stars) - EXCELLENT!! Our server, Sam, was very helpful, friendly, and constantly refill my coffee without me asking. 

Food and Drink:
Coffee ($2) way better quality than what I had expected. Free refill and always fresh and hot. My boyfriend had ordered a glass of red wine.
Gnocchi 4 Cheese - AMAZING!! 5 stars - the best we have had! 
Maverick Pizza (Fresh tomatoes, grilled steak, red onion, mushroom, provolone, arugula) 5 stars - Love it!! The grilled steak was so tender and juicy. The pizza was cooked to perfection - crispy and not burnt like some places. I hate it when the bottom of the pizza is black (burnt). 
Cheesecake - very very smooth and creamy...light like a mousse. Not much cheese taste, but my boyfriend likes it because it is not too sweet. 
Tiramisu (Homemade Family Recipe) - different than the other ones I have had at other places. I like this one the best! Not too sweet! 
I would recommend ordering their espresso to go with the dessert. My boyfriend ordered a double espresso and he said it is very good quality.
Overall, we find the food here is very good, fresh, and healthy. 

Price - decent. We bought a $30 value deal from Groupon, but the food and service definitely worth the full price on their menu. 

Atmosphere - causal, comfy seating, cozy and warm, clean and neat!

We will definitely come back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Ok in all fairness, we drove from north of Bayview & Sheppard for this place b/c of the 4/5 stars reviews... perhaps if we lived in the neighbourhood and needed delivery then I guess I would have given it a star more... 
First and foremost the service was superb! (The restaurant is very lucky to have such dedicated, loyal & hard working staff!) 
The gnocchi was really good- soft and they melt in your mouth! (I wish they gave the option of tomato sauce-more authentic. The creamy sauce was good but nothing to brag about.) 
We ordered: the Grilled calamari, gnocchi, spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna & Modo pizza. 
Unfortunately the food was mediocre for us... sorry!  to say but the spaghetti & meatballs were the most disappointing dish- I couldn't finish it (only ate 1/3 of the plate) nor did I doggy bag it to go... it truly lacked flavour like the rest of the meals. Although my husband enjoyed their pizza but he says that \"Il Fornello from across the street would have been a better choice for the same price.\" And I agree. 
All the best to the restaurant."}
{"text":"What a superb experience. Special shout out to our server Sara who was genuinely friendly in welcoming us and very helpful in recommending dishes. She also mentioned they do take out which is great. A great server makes for a memorable experience.

We ordered gnocchi which was excellent. Very soft and great flavour. Highly recommended. Pizza was well made, with the perfect amount of sauce and toppings. The linguine with clam was perfect. Again, not too much sauce or oil which really detracts at some other places. Topped off the meal with the best tiramisu cake I've ever had. Sam the manager was terrific as well. 

This place is a local gem. Excellent service and fantastic meal. I even got a parking spot right outside the restaurant (lucky for me, as there is limited street-parking). An instant favourite!

5 stars out of 5.

{"text":"Great friendly service! The panzerotto makes for a good lunch and are made and baked in-house. You can pick and choose what toppings you want to go into your panzerotto.

The veal cutlet bun was probably less filling and was about average. Adding toppings makes it a lot better, so I suggest cheese and mushrooms!

Service was great, but it takes a while to make the food so it was difficult having lunch within the hour. Free parking is also a considerable walk away from deep in the nearby residential streets. The WiFi password is pizzapasta"}
{"text":"This was a very nice restaurant.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The staff were very courteous."}
{"text":"Pizza, pasta and salad was amazing! Pizza was oven baked to a perfect crisp. The pizza is a family recipe and I could taste the love poured into making it. The pasta was perfectly aldente cooked and their penne al a vodka is my go to and fave thing to eat! The caprese salad is just right and would highly recommend it as a starter. I would recommend this eatery and recommend it over and over again because it was amazing! Friendly staff, family friendly ambience, reasonable prices and great food! Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Disappointing! Came here based solely on the Yelp! Reviews and was not impressed. The service was extremely slow and a bit cold, despite the fact that restaurant was almost empty on a Friday night.

Our party put up with the slow service, by telling ourselves that the food was going to be worth the wait ... It wasn't! The food was under seasoned, bland and frankly nothing special. 

Definitely wouldn't return and I'd say the Yelp average should be a 3 rather than the 4.5 we saw when we selected it.  Scoring a 1 in order to help bring the average down to where it should be."}
{"text":"Stopped in with kids and friends for a quick bite; good food, great service and Rick took great care of us. Pizza was good and lasagna was great!"}
{"text":"This is a down to earth neighbourhood italian restaurant that serves delicious essential selections of Italian food.  You will learn that they don't have a drinks menu, but the basic good Italian wines are written on a board on the wall, like chianti.  
No bread served, so you gotta reign in your hunger pangs until the food arrives.  We ordered several appertizers along with an entree to share between us, and this is what we thought of the dishes:
insalata Modo Mio: fresh greens with slices of oranges and cheese.  It was ok tasting but the texture of the cheese reminds me of Styrofoam. 
Grilled Calamari: nicely presented and tasted superb with a touch of herbs.
Gamberi: Another delicious side dish of jumbo tiger shrimp sauteed in white wine, citrus and herbs.
Veal Parmigiana: The veal was ok.  But the spaghetti that came with it was the surprise of the evening.  Who knew that spaghetti can taste so good with chilli flakes!!!!!!!  i was not a spaghetti fan before, but now i am.... with the help of chilli flakes!  
Service was good and our server was friendly.
Will definitely go back for more.  
Another good thing is that you can park on the side streets for free!!!"}
