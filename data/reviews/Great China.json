{"text":"Phone person has no personality have to repeat 3 times still don't get it right food is ok years ago it was a lot better changed owners 3 times in the last several years"}
{"text":"Great China has the best Chinese food in town, closest thing to NY Chinese I've found in my 18 yrs here. Always good- previous owner & current. The steamed chicken & broccoli is yum!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place for some fast chinese food.  We always order General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Chicken fried rice, cheicken/vegitable lo mein and crab rangoon.  Our order arrives in 25-30 minutes and is piping hot and delicious! for $25, you cant complain. This is our new go-to for Sesame Chicken cravings!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent when I first moved here. It's undergone three changes in ownership. The food got awful, then slightly better, and now it's pretty good. Not as good as originally but really, all the good places keep closing. It'll do for now in a pinch."}
{"text":"Ick, Sorry, I did give you 2 stars for politeness.  Food was awful!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, food is okay but not great. I ordered chow mein which is a fried noodle dish and their food description says \"with white rice and fried noodles.\" Instead, I got a chicken and cabbage dish in some sort of soupy sauce which tasted gross. I called to ask about the mistake and they said they sent the right dish and there are no noodles in chow mein. Umm... google chow mein and see what comes up. Even then, their own description says fried noodles, but they wouldn't admit they messed up! Refused to give me a refund for the dish or acknowledge this was their mistake. Their website still says fried noodles and I have pictures. The other food was okay. Terrible experience, do not order from here."}
{"text":"We actually like this place. It's close to our house & have never really had any issues with the service or the food. I normally get the chicken lo mein and you get a lot. 

Granted, this is take-out Chinese. This is not PF Chang's and you are getting what you pay for. We have always liked what we get from Great China. 

Will say, the menu that is online when you google Great China is incorrect. So you may want to ask the price for what you are ordering to make sure you know what you are paying."}
{"text":"Clean; fresh food great selection. Outstanding service. We got here at 11 am all food was fresh and will come back. We learned to stay away from buffets towards the end of the day.  Be first.   We are stuffed. :)"}
{"text":"it tastes good! It make me slobber."}
{"text":"I ordered Cashew Chicken and Crab Ragoon for delivery. The crab ragoon was not that bad, but the cashew chicken just was not good. The sauce was so thick and tasted differently than what I am used to. It wasn't horrible, but I've had better from numerous other Chinese restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped by in a hurry and hungry on my way home after getting off work Monday night. For 13$ I got a quart of beef lo mein and a order of 8 crab rangoons. Basically just your average run of the mill Chinese food, nothing stood out. What did stand out was the look on the lady's face who was taking my order and running the counter. She did NOT look very happy to be there. No smiles or friendly greeting or farewell, she barely even looked up at me. Oh well though, maybe she had a rough day. Probably won't be returning regardless. 3 stars"}
{"text":"It's super close to my house so I always get my Chinese there and I haven't been disappointed so far! The owners live in my neighborhood and they seem like very nice hard working people."}
{"text":"Good butter cabbage.  Has soft ice cream on cone."}
{"text":"I find Chinese food in the Charlotte area to be sub part, but this place is much closer to the Chinese food I'm used to eating up North. Great lo mein too!"}
{"text":"Very predictable and never had problem with orders. Egg rolls, fried rice and pork Lo Mein are good and Order frequently. Just had chicken chop seuy and found to be tasty and not overwhelming."}
{"text":"It's near by, it's fast, and it's easy.  It's never exceptional but it's never bad.  They mess up my order sometimes but I've never cared enough to take it back.  It's pretty overall okay.  Nothing phenominal but always hits the spot and I know what to expect.  Service is fast and friendly.  I grab food here once every few weeks and am always \"satisfied\"."}
{"text":"It's more Carry out place, I order large Hot and Sour
soup with mushy pork for lunch. Soup was good, lot better than most of Chinese buffet in town. Mushu pork skin for rapping was only 4 sheets then every edge corner were dry, pork was candy sweet.
I hope Wisconsin state governor don't try here."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch at about 11:45am in order to beat the lunch crowd. No need, there is plenty of seating. There is some shaded parking in the big lot, and several handicapped parking spaces right next to the sidewalk leading to the door, which faces north. 

I really liked it here. Clean, friendly servers, lots of varied choices, and nice fresh food. IMO they need more dessert choices, but really there's so much food that I couldn't even get to one of the islands (salad) because I was too stuffed after 2 passes at the other islands. 

I think there are 5 maybe 6 islands, all full of delicious-looking food. There should be something for everyone here, including kids. Nothing looked too exotic or icky. The condiments were good. The salad bar looked varied and quite adequate (couldn't get to it; too stuffed).

The only down side was that I just read a review below indicating there is a senior discount. I am a senior and so was my companion, but we paid full price ($10 for lunch). I will definitely be asking for the senior discount when we go back. I live fairly close to it so will probably go once or twice a month. Since the other Chinese buffets within 10 miles didn't get nearly as high a rating I'm glad it's close.

One a side note: 
The restaurant was playing authentic Chinese music when we walked in, but it switched very soon to American muzak. I would have preferred to keep hearing the Chinese music. I appreciate when an ethnic restaurant plays the music of its own country. A nicer, more authentic touch.

One final note: 
One reviewer here said this restaurant doesn't have clams. I saw some yesterday, had a couple, they were small and delicious."}
{"text":"Extremely fast delivery if you live on the North side. Food is what I expect for Chinese food. Sometimes it's fine. Rarely it's bad. Dumplings are great. If you are a food snob don't go to their location..."}
{"text":"I ordered from Great China last night and had the worst food ever. I ordered general tsao's chicken and house special friend rice. The food was delivered 40+ minutes after the order, was barely warm and had little to no flavor. I am also pretty sure the rice was old. For $22 dollars this was no where near satisfactory.  I will not be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre. Don't expect anything, then you won't be disappointed. Not recommended for eating in, they'll bring your meal in delivery boxes and plastic silver to your table."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery!

We were looking for some delivery options on NYE, and we decided to give Great China a shot. They delivered the food faster than advertised. They said about 45-50 minutes and they were here closer to 30.

The egg drop soup was pretty good. Thick consistency, good amount of egg bits. We ordered a tofu garlic dish and a chicken broccoli dish and were disappointed to see that they were basically the same dishes sauce and veggie-wise just with different proteins. Both dishes were not terribly impressive. Both sauces were a little too sweet for my taste and could have used some more peppers or other flavorings. Overall, mostly a standard cheap take-out/delivery fare."}
{"text":"I love it broccoli and garlic sauce my absolute favorite. My other half enjoys the honey wings so good. Hands down my favorite fast food chinese restaurant in town. Dont expect any frills just good food and good value"}
{"text":"live on the north side  such a food desert  anyway ordered chicken cashew for pickup. Tons of food enough for two meals  the chicken was minimal as was the cashews the sauce was non existent guys throw some fresh ginger and garlic in your sauce maybe add some 3crabs fish sauce in the end food was ok sauce no good easy fix by bumping up the sauce"}
{"text":"Awful service.  Ordered online.  My card was charged.  Waited 2 1/2 hours for delivery.  Called multiple times and told \"we busy\".  Recommend avoiding this restaurant.   Never got the food"}
{"text":"Abysmal atmosphere. White fluorescent lights, sad vinyl booths where you can watch the fish tank of turtles swimming furiously around, wishing THEY were on the menu so they could just stop swimming already, a self-serve water pitcher in the cold case containing canned sodas. 
Menu/food: Sadly subpar, even for Midwestern Chinese food. Sesame chicken was breading lumps with sketch meat inside (suicidal turtles?) and an orange sauce that wished it were as good as Panda Express's standard, Orange Chicken, egg rolls that were more skin than filling, and pork lo mein than tasted only of salt. The basic flavor of all dishes was... SALT. Maybe those are sea turtles...?
In short, this place is like Pong (with a broken screen) when what you want is a Nintendo 64."}
{"text":"I'm not a total snob. 

I lied, I'm kinda a snob, particularly about ethnic food. The most ethnic thing about this place is the name, it's that bad. 

I would have been quite confused even if I were not a snob.

Long story short, chow mein with no noodles. WHAT? I have never in my life heard this. Chow mein literally means \"fried noodles\". I ordered shrimp fried noodles and got grocery store frozen shrimp on saucy lettuce with rice. 

Best part of this meal was the mountain dew. Don't judge me for drinking Dew either. This was my work lunch and the sugar/caffiene combo kick in the face was a valid need. 

I think my egg roll committed suicide. Just now. 

I'm totally eating this food as I write this and I'm only becoming more and more convinced that I ordered this food as some sort of punishment. The fact that it's this bad and I'm still eating it tells me I need to see my therapist again because self-harm is wrong."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place you would want to go for carry out or delivery only. There's a few tables inside, but no atmosphere whatsoever. That being said, we order from great China on a fairly regular basis and find it to be consistent. They have never messed up our order and normally say 30-45 minutes for delivery, but it ends up being more like 15-20 minutes, which is great. Delivery is free ($10 minimum order) and they always have coupons on their menu for free crab rangoons or fried rice (depending on how much your order was). I've heard that other Chinese restaurants in the area tatse better, but they are also a bit more expensive. I'm not a Chinese food connoisseur, so  for me this is just fine and I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Just... meh. Less greasy than Chang Jiang, but not as good as China Inn. Pretty run of the mill, average food. Decent delivery time."}
{"text":"Tried this food when in the in-laws wanted to pick up Chinese and come hang out. What a nightmare, food all tastes the same from Chx w/cashews, to beef lo mien, it literally tasted like everything was made in the same generic \"Chinese\" sauce meant to satisfy the masses. No thanks.....

Will be looking elsewhere for Chinese in the Stallings, IT area"}
{"text":"1) Where's the meat?  These dishes are all veggies and sauce.  Completely disappointed in the quantity of the meat!
2) is this meat?  Or is it rubber?  The struggle is real.  Completely disappointed in the quality of the meat.
3) what are these flavors? Salt and ginger for the chicken with cashews.  Salt and ginger for the beef in oyster sauce.  Salt and ginger on everything and way too much of it."}
{"text":"Fried rice is very dry and the General Tso isn't really spicy. Portions are pretty good size. Never had them mess up my order which is good. Delivery is on part with other places."}
{"text":"I used to order takeout from Great China all the time. The food is good, and so are the prices.

However, I'm giving a low rating because I had back-to-back experiences where my food arrived much later than they said and the food was cold. Both times I was told that my food would arrive in 45-50 minutes, but it didn't actually arrive until after I called back 1-2 times and an hour and a half or more had passed. The most disappointing thing is that even though they knew I was a loyal customer, they didn't do much to remedy the situation.

Since having these experiences, I've decided to vote with my dollar and take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is solid. 

Gotten delivery a good handful of times and it hasn't disappointed. They have a slick ordering site, the portions are ridiculously huge, and they literally are ringing the doorbell in like 20 minutes. I've had Culver's take longer and Great China brings it to my house."}
{"text":"This place was the ABSOLUTE PITS!!!
I've been to Great China many times in the past, but my last few visits definitely left a NOT SO G-R-E-A-T taste in my mouth. 
In particularly my visit to them last night, 06/23/2009. 
The place was closing in an hour, and being a buffet I assumed that had NO BEARING on the quality of food or the customer service value. 
When we got there, there was NO food left in the trays, NO sushi and the beef and broccoli was nothing more than a garden of broccoli. 
When I asked for more food to be placed out, it was like pulling teeth as I waited for them for at least 15 more minutes to put out some more food. When i got the food, there seemed to be a gelatinous goo (beef sauce?) covering the beef and broccoli! 
When I finally said something to the lady at the register, she replied, \"Well, did you eat the food or not? If you ate it, you pay, and if you don't like the food DON'T COME BACK!\" 
You can BET ON IT LADY!!! 
I will NOT be back EVER, and I will NEVER recommend \"NOT-SO-Great China\" to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this joint since 2005 and honestly- I love it. I used to live right near it and just ordered out of convenience but I've moved away now and any time I'm coming through the area I love to grab something. We just had the Beef & Broccoli tonight and I love that it had thinly sliced carrots in it- excellent veggies (along with TONS of broccoli) and delicious meat. I pretty much stick with Beef & Broccoli and Cashew Chicken anywhere I go (I am a creature of habit and I fully own that...I like to enjoy familiar things). And these guys? They got those nailed. The place itself is nothing fancy but the staff is nice and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's with the negative reviews, everything I've had from here has been excellent! The prices are fantastic and the food is great, what else would anyone expect? I had the orange chicken combo platter loved it. I've also had the general Tsos,  spare rib tips, wonton soup, chicken and cashews, and a few other dishes. The lady was perfectly nice and actually gave me a cup of free mustard, which in most places they will not. I plan on coming back from now on."}
{"text":"I think myself pretty patient, but enough already. I ordered delivery.The food came on time, but it was more expensive than it should have been for lunch specials- so clearly I was charged full price.  when  I went to sign the credit card receipt I crossed out the tip line, planning on tipping in cash. The guy took the receipt out of my hand and before I could pull cash out of my pocket said \"no tip? I am loosing money coming here!?\" Is it just me or is that really rude? 

After all that the food is only OK- I ordered the chicken and garlic sauce with fried rice. The rice was too salty and there was barely any chicken. The vegetable lo mein was OK. I will not order here again."}
{"text":"I finally found interesting vegetarian sushi options!! I honestly can't comment on any of the Chinese cuisine here, as the last 3 times I've been I've gotten the same thing: seaweed salad, the peanut & avocado sushi, and the sweet potato tempura roll. I've really liked them each time. Great taste, pretty fresh.

The interior isn't great, but I think this place is meant for delivery & take-out.

Really nice people. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good and very cheap for both lunch and dinner. Best cheap chinese food in the area! Crab rangoon free with lunches. Bought dinner for four people, lo mein noodles, chicken egg foo young, chicken fried rice, and general tso's chicken, and it was less than $30 bucks."}
{"text":"The name says it all- G*R*E*A*T!

About $10 a person and by far THE BEST CHINESE buffet I have ever been.  All the foods were made fresh and restocked continuously.  Typically I run from the sushi at these places, but Great China's sushi was actually ok.  They even had Dim Sum that was done right.  The lo mein was perfect.  There was a huge variety of veggies, chicken dishes, beef dishes, shrimp, fish dishes-- all were superb.  The egg rolls were delicious and made to perfection.  I was very happy with Great China.

You must try this place."}
