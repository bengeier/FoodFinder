{"text":"This place is amazing. Service unbelievable. Get Chris' Classic! We had a nice conversation with the owner and son. Great passionate folks. Pizza delicious."}
{"text":"Doug was soggy on pizza. Wings were a joke. Also only enough ranch at bottom of empty container for a 1/2 full condiment cup she was able to squeeze out. $25.00 later."}
{"text":"The service from Gators Pizza exceeded my expectations. They called to let me know they may be a few minutes late on our delivery. They ended up being early! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The pizza we had tonight  was extremely  good.  I would  definitely  recommend  trying it out.  Everything  was so fresh, and the crust was perfect."}
{"text":"First time ordering and also the last time. Looked and tasted like 7-Eleven food but 4 times the price. It's a shame because I love a mom and pop shop but the QUALITY has to be there or I'm heading to Pizza Rock instead. 

Ordered a 12 inch pepperoni and an order of ten hot wings. $24, say what?!  I asked for well done and it was sadly not. I've had better at Little Caesars for $5.  I asked for saucy wings and they were puffy and weird looking. Got a side of hot sauce so I'm guessing that's what they consider saucy. Again, you took the idea from 7-Eleven. At least steal a good idea!

If you're looking for your next favorite shop, outside of a chain, keep looking. Sorry to burst your bubble but this place is the cheapest tasting, looking, and smelling than gas station pie but nowhere near the price."}
{"text":"Gator pizza is very great pizza. It has free arcade games you can play while you wait for your pizza."}
{"text":"This place is across from my daughter's school. I've passed it many times and never went in. I am so glad that my daughter suggested Gators pizza for dinner.  

Rarely do I ever give a pizza place 5 stars, but the service is amazing. The gentleman behind the counter is very friendly. There was a line when I came in and he took the time to give us a menu while the guest in front of is ordered. Many times, people just make you wait til it's your turn or rarely even make eye contact.   The personal touch definitely goes a long way. 

There is many tasty things to choose from on the menu. My daughter and I ordered the personal pan pizzas. Very good, just as good as the service. The wait time for my food wasn't long at all. They have several videos available to occupy your time while you wait.  The arcade games are free. That's right, FREE! 

The food was awesome. I took pictures of the pizza, but ate the wings before I remembered to get a picture of them. They were that good. I wish that I would have ordered a larger pizza. I had no idea when I got home,  my unexpected company was going to absolutely love their pizza. They suggested we go and get another, but they had already closed.This will be my lunch spot for tomorrow and my go to pizza place from now on.

As you can tell by now, I love this place."}
{"text":"The gentleman who took my order was very pleasant. I'm assuming he was the the owner because he told me his son would be delivering. He informed me that my order would arrive in 45 minutes...

1.5  hours later, I had still not received my order nor had anyone communicated with me about it. When I called, the same person told me that the delivery guy was right around the corner. I literally live .03 of a mile around the corner from the pizzeria, so that made me chuckle.

When the pizza arrived, it was clear that the order had been forgotten--or maybe pushed to the back of the line due to the close proximity?--and made in a rush after my phone call. The pizza was not even cooked all the way. The cheese was melted on top, but the bottom and center were still raw dough. I put it in the oven to finish cooking it, which of course just made all the oily cheese ooze everywhere through the slice-cuts.

Maybe it was a fluke as they seem to have perfect reviews--and I wouldn't have even minded waiting for a good pie!--but I doubt anyone would return after being lied to about their order status and then receiving a box of inedible goop."}
{"text":"New establishment, family run.  Ordered pizza delivery.. Delicious.  Fresh fresh ingredients.  They have vintage pac man and other arcade games in the store.  Good prices.  Calzones and paninis.  Will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Came in for some New York Pizza got some slices pepperoni and cheese thin crust it was excellent good customers attitudes great owner very responsible and very good at his job very clean atmosphere I will return"}
{"text":"Great place to spend time! Very friendly staff, and the food is great. My pizza crust was perfectly crispy! Free games too! It is worth checking out. I have always enjoyed visiting Gators Pizza and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. A+!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza and Panini's  !  Also FREE arcade games - What's not to like !"}
{"text":"I'm giving Gator Pizza 2 stars ONLY because the owner is so nice (the food deserves 1 star). I always try patronize locally owned businesses when possible. The owner is nice, and the free video games are a nice touch, but I cannot recommend the food.

I ordered plain boneless wings and half Hawaiian half supreme pizza.

Wings: The wings were soggy, but more importantly they were insanely hot. I like spicy food, but for something with no sauce, these were ridiculous. I even told the guy I didn't wasn't spicy because the kids can't handle it. These were terrible.

Pizza: The flavor or the pizza was good enough, but the crust was super soggy. Shouldn't crust have a bit of crispiness to it? They need to cook it just a bit more.

I don't think I'll be returning...
-------------------------------------
Update:  The owner commented to this review and sent me a message.  For him to say I simply posted a \"bad\" review is less than fair.  I have never posted any review on Yelp or anywhere else that was not well thought out.  

He did not tell me the wings were spicy, rather he said they had some zest, but would be fine for kids.  Second, the pizza crust was not soft but very soggy.  I paid $35 including tip.  I'm sorry to say I would've been better off getting pizza and wings somewhere else... They would've been better tasting, unsoggy, and much less expensive."}
{"text":"Good pizza and a very friendly proprietor. The free retro arcade games help pass the time if you have to wait. I will eat there again."}
{"text":"The employees were the only good part of the place. I placed an order online for the pizza and 20 wings special. About 5 mins later they called me back and said they ran out of wings but could give me curly fries or a discount. No big deal and I opted for the fries. When I picked the order up the chicken was store bought Tyson bonless chicken and the fries were out of a bag bought out of the store. The pizza was under cooked as well. For $30 I would expect more than frozen food and undercooked pizza."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered Gators Pizza after Alfredo ( the owner) personally handed me a menu and a point card and invited me to his restaurant. Within a few minutes I was standing inside Gators ordering a pizza for my family and the service was perfect in every aspect. The pizza was prepared quickly and Alfredo along with his son were so kind and welcoming. The really took the time to get to know me and I appreciated it very much. Additionally,there were arcade games all around that were free so I was able to play a few rounds of some classic games before I left...and then comes the pizza, it was absolutely amazing! My family loved It and I don't see us ordering from anywhere else. It was easily the best pizza I've ever had and I've already returned a second time to order one of their lunch specials. This place is the type of restaurant that we need more of here in Vegas and I highly recommend that everyone try it!"}
{"text":"What a fun pizza place! They have old school arcade games that are all free. Fun to play pac man! The pizza was delicious and we had a lot of fun eating a quick lunch here. The slices were big  and soooo good!"}
{"text":"Wow! The service in this place is amazing. The owner and a young man (maybe his son?) were working when we arrived. They greeted us warmly as soon as we walked in,  then asked if we'd ever been there before. I told him we placed an order online. The owner then told us we were welcome to play on the complimentary video games while we waited for our order to finish up! He even came over to the game console I was at and showed me how to navigate through the 410 available games. Crazy good service!

As for the pizza, 5 stars for sure. Possibly the best pizza I've ever had. I ordered a couple 16 inchers for a social gathering and we all kept commenting on how fresh the dough was! Ratio of sauce, cheese and toppings was perfect. Oh and not at all greasy. We have definitely found our new pizza place

Ten stars for Gators Pizza!!"}
{"text":"As one reviewer already stated, this place exceeded my expectations. Outstanding customer service. Very friendly staff. Encouraged us to play (free) video games while we waited for him to make our order fresh. Fresh chunks of garlic, onions and bell pepper added so much flavor. 

Having just come back from NY our taste for good pizza has changed quite a bit. I would not call this NY style, but the crust was very tasty. No left over crust pieces for the dog tonight! Will absolutely be back. 

Owner told us of his former employment with Disney and it showed in how he went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Offered his store for kids to do homework after school if they needed a safe place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, amazing ingredients, amazing service, and amazing games... Just rename it awesome pizza place."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else, I do agree that the owner and his son are very pleasant people. Always very welcoming and give the best customer service. With that said I honestly can't say a lot about the food. The boneless wings are out of a frozen Tyson bag you can get from the store. Same with the curly fries. They taste like the ones your mom would make for you in the oven. In my personal opinion I would have invested money into a soda fountain and a fryer then arcade games, but that's just me. Also the wait time is unnecessarily long. With no one else ordering, it shouldn't take over 30 minutes to complete an order. 

The \"Chris Classic\" pizza and there stromboli's are very good. I definitely recommend both. Other then that I always leave feeling hungry and feeling like I ate food from home. 

Very nice and humble people, hopefully they can work on making the quality a bit better."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the owner and his son. Super nice people that make you want to come back. We ordered the Chris' Classic pizza and it was excellent. Very fresh and high quality ingredients. It's all on a very thin crust that is still soft and chewy. Most places give you a crispy, overcooked, thin crust that is like eating pizza toppings on a cracker. But Gators some how manages to keep their thin crust soft.  We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have been seeing this sign out front \"gators pizza\" before they opened.  Thought that was such a clever, sweet idea being as they are across st from gvhs the \"gv gators\".  I was nearby and owner personally invited us to their pizza shop with a brochure.  And we returned a couple hours later for lunch.  Owner present - best customer service aspect!  He builds a relationship with you, which I Love to get that small town feel and friendly neighborhood joint which is all too rare in this town.  Pizza was good & ready quickly.  Arcade games fill room amongst some dining tables, and they are free to play.  Really.rootin' for this new business!  And encourage you to give it a try! Thanks Gators Pizza for not disappointing!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try Gators Pizza, I am a pizza lover! I entered the store, and was very disappointed to see a moving belt type pizza oven. In my opinion and experience, these ovens don't get hot enough to cook the dough the way I like it. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and ordered two slices and a soda. The owner was friendly and efficient, and in just a few minutes, my slices rolled off the assembly line, I mean the came out of the oven. I got the slices to go, and went out to the car to test them out. As expected, the slices were limp and doughy. I like a nice thin (NYC thin) crisp crust with the cheese and toppings turning a nice brown color in spots. I always give a new place 2 try's, so next time it will be a fresh pie eaten in store to give it the best shot. There are several pizza joints in Vegas that turn out an above average pie that does not travel well. Hopefully, I will be pleasantly surprised on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had! I love discovering small businesses in the neighborhood so when gators pizza opened, I was really excited to try it and man oh man they did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The pizza was plain. Told me I would love the 5 cheese blend but the pizza is not special at all. The owner is nice and the arcades are awesome but if your a pizza place and I can't even give it a 2 star just on the pizza, you know it's not good."}
{"text":"Pizza is one my faves. Chains and local pizza joints that I go to are usually salty enough to make my lips pruney and my body feel bloated. This place is my new favorite local spot. Gator tastes home made from the crust to the sauce, leaves no trace of oil on my plate (vegetarian pizza) considering cheese is oily and has minimal salt compared to all the other places so I am impressed. 

Our new spot!"}
{"text":"Man I was really skeptical at first but this place is BOMB! The BEST pizza in the green valley/Henderson area hands down. Kills any other small or large pizza place I've had in a LONG time! Glad they are here"}
{"text":"Honest to goodness the best pizza I've ever had. The owner, Alfredo, takes great pride in the fact that only the best ingredients are used. You can definitely taste the difference of his phenomenal pizza versus the subpar pizza that so many others sell. I also love the fact that the video games in his restaurant are free for his customers. It's the little things, like that, that make a difference. His customer service is top notch and by the time we left, my girls loved his \"bowling\" video game lessons and he felt like family. We will be going back, as he made regular customers of us!"}
{"text":"Gator's Pizza is family owned and operated. Alfredo and his son do a wonderful job. The pizza is amazing and the customer service is top notch. I would highly recommend them. This is the kind of pizza you eat and want to come back for more."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very hearty and filling. If you want something thats close and easy then this place should satisfy that."}
