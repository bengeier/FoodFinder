{"text":"Of the several places to get bagels in Oakland, these bagels are the best. Really fresh and tasty and they taste homemade.

However, I wasn't crazy about their bagel and egg sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great breakfast bagel but the service was what made it a 5 star experience! Thanks to Tanarus Henry for being so kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"I grab my breakfast from Brueggers on Cedar Road in Cleveland Heights at least three days a week. Typically I order a breakfast bagel, with egg and cheese, and it's just dandy.

Is there something special about the bagels at this Brueggers, as compared to other Brueggers? I doubt it. But the people who work here are good at what they do; they come to recognize you if you're a regular and they start your food before you even get to the counter. Also, for the most part, they are a friendly and up-beat crowd.

One thing I appreciate as well, is that they do a great job of slicing your bagel, so that both halves are pretty much the same size. I have watched the manager teach this skill to new employees, and it results in a bagel that is more enjoyable to eat, than one that is extremely lop-sided.

If you live in the Cedar-Fairmount neighborhood, this is the place for bagels."}
{"text":"I love bagels and thought I would try this place since I was driving by but when I pulled in they said they had closed - sign said bad economy..... bummer"}
{"text":"The staff here was friendly and even offered to show me nutritional information when I asked questions.  My bagel was decent, similar to other bagels I've had from bagel chain places.

But this place is dirty,  at least in the customer areas.  The bathroom toilet did not look cleaned for many days.  The same with the stairs where dust and dirt checked in to the step corners. I saw an employee clean a table using nothing but his hand and arm. Nasty."}
{"text":"This is not a New York bagel shop.  It is not a Miami Beach bagel shop.  I have too little experience with bagel chains to compare this one with the others.

But, lacking access to New York bagels or Miami bagels, these are not bad.  More important, I want to say, the shop always appears clean and the servers (come to think of it I am not sure I have ever seen the same person there twice) are always friendly and efficient.

So, kudos to Bruegger's Bagel Bakery in Cornelius."}
{"text":"No internet connection. Maybe the owner doesn't want you hanging out and taking up space. Go in get your food and get out."}
{"text":"Worst service ive ever had at a \"fast food\" place.  Staff is slow, careless, ghetto.  Im confident that  this was not just a bad day...everyday at this brueggers is the same disgraceful service.  AVOID."}
{"text":"We have bagels and muffins delivered at my work place and lately the muffins were burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Today the box of muffins look like they fell on the floor and someone tried to put them together. They keep sending bagels that no one asked for. We end up throwing them away."}
{"text":"This brueggs kinda sucks. Every time I've come they are out of multiple kinds of bagels so someone isn't doing their counts correctly (use to work at a brueggers). The service is lousy. Also apparently brueggers discontinued sprouts-not this stores fault but wtf?! Sprouts are awesome. Going to Poppy's next time."}
{"text":"Horrible. This used to be a great place to grab some great breakfast and coffee, and despite it always being busy, the lines moved very quick and efficient.  

It appears now they have an entire new crew including new managers.  Service quality and speed went way down.  I've tried coming back several times thinking the new staff will eventually improve, but each time, I wait longer and longer in much shorter lines, and a majority of the bagel baskets are frequently empty, leaving only 2 or three choices.

It's clear I'm not the only one who has given up coming here frequently; this used to be a fun hangout spot as well, but now the few people that come in just get there food to go, as it is always empty (yet service is still very slow)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location.. the food is always hot and fresh & the employees are just wonderful! This store is always clean, and I really couldn't be any happier. The food is great, and you get a lot for your money. I keep comming back because of the wonderful service. Aaron, Sharona, and Amanda are some of my favorite people. They always put a smile on my face first thing in the morning! :)  HIGHLY recommend if you out this way!"}
{"text":"Ghostbusters I have been to quite often.Never the same people that work there are there the next time I go. They either have a high turnover of employees there or something. I went in yesterday on 05-01-15 and only one person trying to make food,some teenage boy. While checking out I inquired to the last ringing me up that there are never the same people when I go there and do they have a high turnover rate. She never answered my question and when as  he returned around. Not facing me to make my soda,I could hear her calling
 me a b word under her breath. I am not going to this location anymore and their service has done down there. I was charged 11dollars for a Turkey in the slaw sandwich, chips and a small drink. I could have a betterment else here for that price.They are a joke with the high prices for some dumb bagel store."}
{"text":"We really appreciated what cheerful, efficient service we experienced at Bruegger's Bagels at Cleveland airport.  And glad to be able to get a decent breakfast bagel early in the morning.  Nice way to start our trip."}
{"text":"Really like the bagels and bagel sandwiches here.  I get breakfast 3-5 times a week!  I've never had a bad food experience.  I normally get eggwhite/cheese on a bagel, western omelet sandwich (excellent, but Weight Watchers folks beware - it's like 24 points!), the cinnamon sugar bagel (love it!), tuna sandwiches, turkey sandwiches, very good chicken spaetzel soup also!  The staff is friendly and very customer-focused; whenever I've had an order that was missing something, I just called and they said they'd make it up on the next order - and they have EVERY time!  I even got a card from them when I was in an accident!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Bruegger's Bagels.  I wish they would come to Chicago.  Regardless of the time of day, I order the same thing, the turkey sandwich with garlic cream cheese and dried tomato spread.  So good, I wish I had one right now.  My cousins thought I was odd for wanting to come here, but I told him to take a bite of my sandwich and yes, indeed, he did agree, it was good.  Friendly service and spacious seating all added to another great Bruegger's experience."}
{"text":"I'm a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, but I was fortunate to find a program offered entirely online except for a once-a-semester visit to the main campus.  When I do make the trip to Pitt, I always stop by Bruegger's Bagels on Forbes Avenue for their bagel sandwiches and coffee, both of which are delicious.  I usually order a sesame seed bagel with lettuce, tomato, and cheddar cheese, and the food is always fresh and tasty.  The house coffee is great, as well.  It's not overpowering like Starbuck's, and it's always piping hot.  Great place to relax between classes."}
{"text":"They definitely have staffing issues. Don't go on weekedays or you will have to wait 15 minutes, even when there isn't a big line. The current staff is nice (but lots of turnover - probably 12-15 new faces in 4-5 months) . Today I arrived at 6:30 and they had only half of the bagel options available. Two people actually walked out  and there were only 5 ppl in the whole place.  One person does bagels, coffee, and cashier, while the other one is still making bagels.  It's not their fault, but managers are never around."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff on a Saturday morning! They love their regulars and were very sweet and funny."}
{"text":"My family and I went at brunch to check out South Side and try this bagel shop that we've been seeing all over Pittsburgh. Apparently all of the bagels are vegan (shout out to the baker's knowledge!) except the Asiago Parmesan; this made me (the only vegan in the family) happy. I got a plain sesame, which was normal, filling. The rest of the fam got egg sandwiches and had similar comments - normal breakfast flavors. Nothing spectacular, but convenient. The staff was friendly. 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh about a month ago and stopped in Bruegger's on S Aiken. We are from New York so we're quite needy with our bagel orders. Justice took our (complicated) order and made it to perfection. Thank you for your patience and kindness!"}
{"text":"The only positive comment I have is that their bagels are usually cooked correctly, with a delightful texture and flavor.

The customer service at this location is absolutely terrible. If the general manager isn't working mistakes abound. No eggs prepared for sandwiches, no sausage cooked and ready to serve, countless times of being served the incorrect sauce on my sandwich unless you watch the entire process, and condescending comments from the assistant manager, all coupled with a general apathetic attitude of some of the high school students working there for the summer.

Today's visit was the final straw as they were out of eggs and no longer carry the only cheese I like. This was my favorite place to treat myself to breakfast out during the week, as the food was satisfying, now to find a new place to patron."}
{"text":"This place would usually be 4 or 5 stars, but this morning the girl making my sandwich was either stoned or hung over. There was only meat on one half. Also she was leaning on the prep counter on one elbow while she lackadaisically made my sandwich with the other hand. She couldn't have conveyed any better that she did not care to be there or the quality of my $7.50 sandwich. If I had not cared about the quality of service and my food this morning I would have gone to McDonald's. This place is normally a favorite. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Stopped in early this morning for breakfast, want to compliment the staff and Kathy for great customer service and excellent food as always.  Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"The Gist:
Your usual bagel place w/ sandwiches, self serve coffee and the usual.
***X-tra plus - they have free wifi!!!!***

The Story:
Came here as waited for Acura inspection to be done as it is down the street and figured we needed bkfst

The Order:
Got the smoked salmon on wheat bagel w/ red onion, capers, cream cheese & tomato. 

Tip: 
*  Don't forget to say \"Please toast my bagel\" ...in my early mornin' blur, pre-coffee - forgot to say that for some reason and assumed the bagel would magically come toasted in my mind....

*  Free WiFi..comfy seats...perfect for study/read/waiting for car"}
{"text":"The selection is practically endless, only restriction is what you don't want on your bagel. Down fall of this specific location is the staff, the they do not pay attention to customers, get orders wrong (a few co workers ordered from there last week and all but two orders were wrong out of 6 orders) , and make snarky comments about customers that visit regularly. . Before they even walk into the store. And they say this as your standing in front of them. Like I said great food , horrible manners from staff. 3 stars ."}
{"text":"I hardly ever have bagels because of the carbs, but decided to treat myself today.  I requested my bagel \"toasted extra brown\" and it wasn't even minimally brown!  I could have asked for a redo but thought I should just get over myself...should have, because I really didn't enjoy my treat as much as I was expecting and now mad that I spent the calories!  Bagel Bin in Ballantyne is the only place I will go now...it's owned by New Yorkers and you can tell!!"}
{"text":"Best bagels and very consistent service! Always fresh and workers are very friendly. I can eat here any time of the day! Even the soup is delicious. Fast service and very clean environment!"}
{"text":"My teenage son likes to eat here before school. He always orders a breakfast wrap and the OJ. The food quality is good."}
{"text":"For a bagel shop, they don't seem to have many bagels.  I was there at 8 am on a Saturday and 3/4 of the bagel racks were empty.  Given that the racks were clean and free of crumbs, I don't think they were OUT of bagels, I don't think they made very many in the first place.  

I asked the young lady behind the counter \"no onion bagels today?\" and without even looking at me she said \"what you see is what we got.\"  I had the impression she had been answering that question a LOT.

It's a shame.  The store is in a good location and it's always clean and bright, so I don't think management has given up.  I'll try again soon to see if maybe this was an anomaly."}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's bagels! The menu gives you a lot of different sandwich options and there is nothing like stopping for a hot sandwich in the morning. I haven't been back to this particular location as the girl behind the counter who was mopping the floor tried to accuse me of stealing a chocolate milk that my friend had already paid for. She never apologized. But it's cool, I still love my Bruegger's, I just won't go to this location anymore."}
{"text":"GREAT bagels! And the everything bagels were LOADED!

The two girls working were really nice and gave great service!

This place might be 30 minutes from my house, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Bagel was warm at best, not toasted like it should be for a Bruegger's bagel.  Stop there often and it's just an ok place. Server not very friendly but the cashier was nice."}
{"text":"Visiting Cornelius and wanted to stop for breakfast. Looked on their menu online before going, when we got there and ordered they said that they don't have what we wanted. Ordered 2 bagels and the associate we had was rude. We mistakenly thought he grabbed 2 of the same bagel, which we didn't want and he went on to say that's crap. They should get better nicer people and update their menu."}
{"text":"I visited this particular location for the first time this week. I'm not sure if the service I received was because I stopped in 20 minutes before closing, but the woman behind the counter clearly was not happy to see me. I asked what soups were available,  and she said they were all out of soup. (I suspect the soups had already been put away, and they weren't sold out. I was there on a Wednesday, not a weekend, and I've never known a chain to completely run out of every single soup available.) I ordered a toasted Turkey Chipotle Club to go, and when I got back in my car, I realized the sandwich was cold and had never been toasted or warmed in any way. Again, I suspect I was being rushed out. The server was not nasty, but had no pleasantries for me as I left. The sandwich was okay as I warmed it up when I got home, so I'll give them two stars. I'll continue to visit other locations that have better service, but there are plenty of restaurants in this area for me to not need to return to this one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whoever makes the bagels every morning is really great at his or her job! I wish the food here wasn't so expensive, but I think the quality is worth the price."}
{"text":"The bagels here are delicious!  The staff was a little bit flighty and unprofessional, but I had minimal interaction with them.  The food was great!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Jacob for making my day fantastic. His enthusiasm and charisma convinced that he is happy to be here, which made me happy. Glad to see his smile. Definitely a future customer!"}
{"text":"This is the place for bagels in Strongsville. The service is always friendly and attentive. The bagels are tasty. I'm not a coffee drinker but my wife is and she says it's the best around."}
{"text":"Good bagels (when they're made early enough) but workers are slow and manager is very unfriendly. Gives you a hard time and attitude for asking to use a coupon from Bruegger's inc."}
{"text":"These guys are so nice! They really went out of their way to make me smile after I was exhausted from a long day of traveling. The food was as delicious as ever and prices were lower than the other restaurants around. Go to this Bruggers!"}
{"text":"Bruegger's Breakfast bagel with scrambled egg and swiss cheese is tops for me!   I like either a pumpernickel or a plain bagel.  I don't get cream cheese because I can't digest any brand.

Beet salad is also good - although they overload the greens.

I frequent the Squirrel Hill location weekly."}
{"text":"I stopped going to Bruegger's a few years ago, because of service issues. I found Einstein's Market Square to have much better service, but I still prefer the bagels at Bruegger's. I stop at the McKnight Road store once in a while, but hadn't been to the Market Square Bruegger's in years. Today I thought I'd give them a try. The man behind the counter took my order and I paid for it. I waited, then someone behind me got their sandwich ahead of me. When I asked, the man was all confused. They always screw up my order somehow. I AM NEVER GOING TO THE MARKET SQUARE BRUEGGER'S AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Love their bagels! There's so many so it's always nice to try something new, but my all time favorite is the cinnamon sugar! Lots of cream cheeses as well, all delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is okay- sandwiches and bagels.  Absolutely nothing special.  But the service is so incredibly awful.  I fly through PIT all the time and often stop here because it is the most convenient place to grab food.  Last time I came I wanted a salad- turns out the only thing they had to make that salad was the lettuce!  She starts making it and then says oh we are out of that- and that- and that!!  Ridiculous!  Today I felt like how dare I ask for food that they have to make.  It was such an imposition!  Terribly rude and lazy staff.  My sandwich maker and cashier was Christina.  I'm calling you out on your rude behavior and terrible service.  I'm done with this place- I will walk further for my food then have to deal with this place."}
{"text":"Well, this is a really nice bagel shop, as close as you can get if you aren't picking up bagels from the West Side Highway bagel factory in Manhattan.But for some reason when I tried to get to the Caribou Coffee website for Mooresville NC I got this web site. Just be aware that Carabou Coffee isn't next door to Bruegger's, hasn't been for years."}
{"text":"I'm adding a review just because I think it deserves more than 3 stars. The people working here are friendly and the bagels are just really good. My suggestion is that smoked salmon is really good!!"}
{"text":"Went in this morning to grab bagels for my office.  Bakers dozen was listed as $9 on the menu.  I requested the bagels be toasted.  I was charged nearly double the listed price.  Of course I asked why.  I was told that if I want the bagels sliced and toasted it was considered a catering order.  SERIOUSLY?  You're a bagel place and you charge for toasting your cornerstone product?  Nickel and dime job.  I didn't have time to protest, but I will likely choose a less fussy place for company breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Their bagels and coffee are as good as almost anyplace else; I have no criticisms of the food. The prices, however, are another story. 
Lured in by a coupon to try a sandwich, I ordered a salmon bagel sandwich. It tasted good -- but was little more than a bagel and cream cheese, plus a couple thin slices of salmon, and a garnish or two. I generally don't have a large appetite, but easily finished it. (I consider it more of a \"glorified bagel & cream cheese\" than a substantial sandwich.) The price was about $7.
Had I paid the regular bagel price and ordered a small coffee, it would have cost over $9, before tax. I know prices of everything keep going up, but at $9+ for a (garnished) bagel and coffee, I won't be rushing back to Bruegger's."}
{"text":"As I wait outside for my family to bring food out to this what could be a lovely outdoor spot ... There is garbage everywhere a string smell of urine . What a shame , the weather is so beautiful and i have my dog so I can't go inside . Have note even  Had the  food and so disappint"}
{"text":"My poor rating has to do with customer service. 

I had a flight on Christmas Eve and ordered an egg sandwich and coffee. Both which tasted fine. However, when I went up to the counter to order, no one paid me any mind, greeted me, or even stated \"we will be right with you.\" I eventually wandered back to the cashier after a couple minutes who stated, \"no, you order over there.\" When I was finally helped by someone she asked what bagel I would like. I ordered the \"skinny\" zesty egg, which I thought came with a preset skinny bagel. So I answered, \"the skinny bagel\". I don't have their menu memorized, and no one explained to me that ANY bagel can be made skinny. When I answered the worker she screamed at me again, \"WHAT BAGEL DO YOU WANT\". Someone else had to explain it to me because I guess she wasn't in the \"mood.\" Needless to say, I felt embarrassed to be yelled at like a small child. I had half a mind to let the manager know, but hopefully he/she is reading this. Terrible customer service and general lack of social skills."}
{"text":"The bagel sandwiches are delicious, we come here at least once a week! The employees are always quick, nice and conscientious."}
{"text":"Smaller than most Bengal shops but the service was great and so were the bagels. 

The cinnamon sugar was the best began I ever had!"}
{"text":"It's a chain bagel place so what do you expect. Just watch out for the posse of blue hairs on any weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"Worst bacon egg and cheese bagel i ever had"}
{"text":"Cream cheese is $1.50 per bagel.  Make sure you order a tub for $3.00 .  Check prices.  We ordered three bagels and we're charged $4.50 for cream cheese at drive through.  The person at the window was nice to drop the cream cheese down to the tub price.  Bagels are very good."}
{"text":"So, so. Short on the meat for sandwich and bit pricey for what you get. I think next time I will go two doors down to Subway..."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, and tastes pretty good to me! The bagels are fresh, and the bagel sandwiches are yummy too. They serve a couple soups daily, and also give a few bagel bites when you order it. That was nice."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many many times over the years. But the last visit was at least a year prior. 

I was shocked by the outside condition of the restaurant. This place definitely looks like it's falling apart on the outside. 

I didn't stay there to eat, but from what little that I  saw, the inside looked fine. My toasted bagel with cream cheese was okay, but there wasn't a napkin in the bag. Seems like a silly oversight."}
{"text":"Bagels are not as good as in New York but they are tasty.  Not worth going out of your way for. 

The place was very clean!  Even the restroom. 

There service was polite and detailed but at a very casual speed."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Recently things have changed.  All new employees and always out of flavored coffee.  Like every time I come here in the morning I have to wait while they brew a new pot?  New rules with the bottomless mugs.  Place just isn't what it used to be..bummer!"}
{"text":"I experienced the worst customer service in my life; unprofessional and disrespectful. The lady at the Cleveland Airport refused to give me her name and she didn't wear a name tag so I couldn't capture it to report her ghetto/professionalism. The lady was an older black lady wearing fake eyelashes. When I approached the counter to pay for my bagel and hot chocolate for my daughter, she was loud and pointed to something or someplace down past the cash register. Because she was loud and talked fast, I couldn't understand what she said. When I inquired and asked her, \"Where do you want me to stand?\" In an unprofessional/ghetto tone said, \"Do I look like I'm going to jump over or around this counter to give you your food?\" I looked at her shocked. The pilot who was a customer ahead of me looked at her shocked. He looked at me and said, \"Wow.! It's took early for this.\" When I moved down to wait for my purchase, she didn't even hand me the food items! She placed in on the counter and did not say one word! Her demeanor, tone, inflection in WHAT and HOW she said it was epic. As a vice principal of a school, customer service to all stakeholders is key and critical everyday. I will share my story with other colleagues because this is a bagel spot I will never eat at again. This lady needs additional training relative to etiquette with her customers."}
{"text":"Good bagels, but it had horrible customer service. One of the workers commented on my friend's outfit in a negative manner... Saying her outfit was \"fun\" than proceeded to laugh. There was a lot of gossip that happened while we were sitting there. It was just a toxic environment and most likely will not be back. It did satisfy the breakfast sandwich need but other than that not a great experience."}
{"text":"I stop at Brueggers at least three times a week for coffee in the morning and in the afternoon. The staff are friendly and coffee & bagels are wonderful. I do their bottomless mug (it's a great deal if you drink coffee/tea/soda the deal comes out in December.). 

Herby Turkey is one of my favorite sandwiches. I like it without onions. And an Asiago bagel toasted with light veggie cream cheese is my go to for breakfast."}
{"text":"Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich,  Got decaf tea instead of regular tea even though he was told black tea.  Usually you have to ask for decaf. 
However, lots of seats since the place was empty.  We left Einstein's because it was  crowded.
They Missed an opportunity to impress a new customer.  Guess it's back to Einstein's."}
{"text":"These folk always make my day at least 20% better. Always kind, thoughtful, and professional. Today I was lucky and showed up just as the Everything bagels came out of the oven. There is nothing quite like an untoasted Bruegger's bagel fresh out of the oven. Mine had the salmon cream cheese. Yum. Add the sunny disposition of the staff and you have a great place for quick eats. The coffee is good too. Free wifi."}
{"text":"Not the best place. The floor was all wet and dirty and the staff seemed extremely irritated with being there. It wasn't that busy, me and my mom and maybe two other people were there at 8:30 AM. My bagel had burnt pieces of another bagel on it and my moms was greasy and chewey and her coffee had coffee grinds in it. And then the man who made our food mopped the floor, and then went back to making bagels and didn't wash his hands. But damn the honey walnut spread is good. I'll be going back, just not to this location!"}
{"text":"Brueggers is a good spot for lunch. It offers sandwiches and salads, the basic lunch menu. I had a very good Herby Turkey sandwich on a plain softwich, which is softer than their rubbery bagels. They offer great chips in a variety of flavors, as well as drinks and dessert. You can also get a coffee buzz here. There is outside seating, although you are almost in the parking lot. My biggest problem with Brueggers is that they load too much cream cheese on their sandwiches. But that's just my personal opinion, as I'm not a huge cream cheese fan. I recommend Brueggers for stopping in for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Began my Yelp account in hopes of reminiscing and offering reviews on all my old favorite spots upon my return visit home. Have to say I'm more than disappointed with how downhill this Brueggers has gone. Great food, yet tables upstairs sat dirty for hours during our meeting. In addition, hearing employees discuss smoking weed and other things from right up the stairs was truly disappointing. Terrible service overall."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm, fresh and tasty.

Next I thought I would try one of their Green Mountain coffees - the Island Coconut flavor.  I know what your thinking but stop right there .... give it a whirl.  Wow it is good!  I got so excited about it I craved it for a whole week.

Its such a nice change to a greasy fried breakfast.  I'm glad I went and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a toasted pumpernickel with red onion, tomato, green bell pepper, lettuce, and hummus. It was outta-control-delicious! The bagel was perfectly toasted, the veg was fresh and delicious, and the hummus was outstanding. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fresh bagels, free wifi. I'm not sure what more there is to ask for in a bagel joint! I tried one of the breakfast wraps with turkey sausage and it was good enough. They don't toast their bagel sandwiches, however."}
{"text":"I love a good bagel, and I got a good bagel there. However, another guest was ordering and saw a massive spider crawling in the lettuce container. She decided not to eat there and when she left the staff joked that it happens all the time and what did she expect from something that grows outside. I understand that this does happen, but the spider shouldn't have made it all the way to the food line, neither should the staff have made fun of the guest for being too grossed out to eat there."}
{"text":"Just look at the string of 1 star or lower ratings of recent postings. I agree with all if them. This used to be my favorite coffee shop in town. Our many international visitors used to love to go to brueggers when here in cornelius. Now it is truly an embarrassment. I do not know hoe brueggers corporate could allow this to happen. Hoping they can close-refurbish-retool the staff- and be a place worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Tim the manager is great. Always chatting you up as he makes your meal and making it fun."}
{"text":"We came at a busy time and had to wait a bit to order, but it was worth the wait. My friend and I both got the Leonardo de Veggie. I recommend it with the Rosemary olive oil bagel. I also tried the blueberry Greek joghurt cream cheese and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Love coming here, fresh food, pretty quick to order and relaxing atmosphere - plus it shares the same space as Carabou!"}
{"text":"The other day, I had been itching for a bagel and hoped since they had Bagel in their name that they would actually have perfected the bagel. Well, not so much. 
They lacked the variety of bagels and Cream cheeses I am used to seeing. No Tofu Cream Cheese? Wha? Usually, I can at least find a Whole Wheat Everything Bagel so that was lacking too. As, for the line I'm not sure what that was about cause I think I could've gotten a better bagel at Starbucks. Guessing it was some of the other lunch options."}
{"text":"Bagels are good, service is slow as molasses. Don't come here if you are hungry, because you will get hangry quick. Good bagels but not worth the pain a suffering you will experience waiting in line."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Consistently delicious bagels (get anything with their bacon) and quick service. Their coffee is decent - but I'd recommend visiting the Caribou that shares this storefront if you have the time.

Plenty of booths and free wifi. Great place to meet and catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"I got a bagel and peanut butter, the bagel was cold and chewy as a chewing gum. 

Music too loud too."}
{"text":"I give this location 2 stars and dropping. In the last two months the dough or preparation quality has dropped considerably. I'm finding large holes in the bagels - not small ones as expected, but large enough to swallow quarters and more. Reports to the company only received replies of \"we'll look into it\" but meanwhile the holes get worse. I expect more when I pay for premium bagels, and unfortunately it's time to move on from Bruegger's. Sad as they have been good until recently."}
{"text":"For those that don't like it, it's a bagel place, What are you expecting? Service has always been fine,a little pricey, but you get what you pay for here. Excellent bagels. Really enjoy the breakfast bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but everything else is.  The last two times they've provided a dreadful experience.  The time before we visited, they gave us the wrong order, which was marked on the bag correctly.  When it was confirmed by us at the cashier, it was looked at, and confirmed, only to be taken back and wrong.  When we came back, there was no apology, but they did fix the order.  I wrote it off as a fluke.  Today, after about a month, went back and ordered two sandwiches.  One was wrong again, and the other for my child was not cut like normally, and they forgot to toast it.  Also, there was three employees in front, and at least one in the back that I could see, and between my two sandwiches and the other two customers, it took them over 10 minutes to prepare an incorrect order."}
{"text":"Exceptionally nice service!  Cashiers are friendly.  Bagels are good.  The French Toast Coffee which is a special right now is awesome.  I hung out for 4 hours doing schoolwork and everyone was friendly!"}
{"text":"Disgusting!
I'm going to try to upload a picture of the \"lettuce\" that was in my salad. I've been to this location twice, both times ordering a salad. The first time, there were a few pieces of lettuce that looked old, but I thought maybe it was an off day so I tried again today. Big mistake. I get to the bottom of the salad, and the lettuce is so old it's black and gooey! I will post an update if I actually get sick from this. Gross."}
{"text":"The cashier Beverly is almost always in a bad mood . She is terrible.

The Staffs never looks happy."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have few seats outside and on the first floor, but there is more seating upstairs. They have some really nice photos of (bagels, of course) that get you in the mood. They even have a cute window with a nice view up there. The whole place is really cute!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cinn sugar bagel and they sliced it with a knife they just cut an onion bagel with so my cinn sugar tasted like onion.  Every flavor bagel should have its own knife ."}
{"text":"Not enough meat on my bagle or on the other no enough cream cheese and the employees are smug it not worth how much it cost!"}
{"text":"The first bad experience at a Brueggers.  Lazy unfriendly staff , such a small amount of cream cheese on my bagel at first glance I thought they forgot. Not so much as a smile either. Airport service I guess.  Travel is hard enough, a good bagel experience could have helped..."}
{"text":"Being a transplant from NJ to NC, I come from the state that makes the best Bagels! This place is the closest I have found to NJ bagels. The staff is awesome! So kind and tends to the needs of each patron. Thank you again for all the hard work. Customer service is not an easy job!"}
{"text":"At 8am they don't have any (zero) bagels prepared yet, even though they \"open\" at 6am.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I asked the server to suggest me a good vegetable breakfast sandwich, she replied : \"You can get anything as long as you pay for it!!!!!\" (The server next to her, also finds it humorous) What bull shit! I wasn't asking her for a free sandwich anyways! If I was the owner of this place, I would fire such people right away. Not the way you talk to your customers."}
{"text":"Did I just pay $8 for a bagel thin sandwich and an unsweetened iced tea?  Why yes, I did, and I'm going to enjoy it's toasty goodness in moderation.  

The service here is spot-on.  Super fast, friendly and the order is always made just the way you like it.  I enjoy the rosemary bagel (made into a \"thin\" where the center is cut out.  BTW: I wonder where the insides go...am I allowed to take it home?  I will ask next time.) with light veggie cream cheese, smoked salmon, extra red onion, extra tomato, no capers. The bagels are nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Mmmm carb heaven. 

A BIG plus is the free Wi-Fi and the access to seating/outlets."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Lot of options in bagels. But I like the bread better. It is a small place to have grab a quicky."}
{"text":"Love Bruegger's Bakery even if it is a chain.  The bagels are good and the service comes with a smile."}
{"text":"I like Bruggers, however this morning I was bummed out when I got there around 5:35 and the doors were not yet unlocked. There were people inside working, but both the front and back doors were still locked. It won't keep me from going back, however I won't be able to rely on them being open when I am needing coffee early."}
{"text":"After today, I am done going to Bruegger's. This location has been getting progressively worse as the years go on. I believe there was a change in management last year, and you can certainly tell. Staff used to be overly friendly and accommodating and now they are pretty rude. Also, Bruegger's in general is very overpriced. For example, I just paid $10 for the smallest bagel I've ever seen, a juice and a watered down coffee. This is not the first time I have paid too much for a sub par breakfast. I've been a customer of Bruegger's for the last four years and will unfortunately no longer spend my money there."}
{"text":"I would definitely need some bad service for a bagel place to get less than four stars from me. Bruegger's has always been my go to bagel chain. Wow...did I just say I have a \"go to bagel chain\"? Dang...I guess I did. 

The bagels are fresh, the coffee is better than average and you can get less bagel (skinny) for fewer calories. Who am I kidding, who eats bagels with cream cheese if they're counting calories?

The service at Bruegger's has always been good and the food has always been consistent.


Try: The sun dried tomato bagel with plain cream cheese

Avoid: The fortified brick foundation bagel (like you went to Bruegger's for health food!)"}
{"text":"Stopped in today quick to get something to go, and man is it good! I got the smoked salmon and egg salad on pumpernickel and it was great! Really clean establishment, and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My dad would always take me to this place when I was little. It was a nice way to start off a school day. We hadn't gone there in a while and we were planning on going back. Well, one day, we were in a hurry to go somewhere and my dad suggested we get brueggers.... Of course  we went through the drive thru and the lady who took our order was snobby. To make matters worse, we pulled up to the window and no one was there, my dad said that they would probably be there in a second, but after ten minutes, my dad and I left. And because of that, we were nine minutes late. We were very upset!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food is good, but not worth the trials and tribulations of poor, rude, inefficient, and condescending service.  This used a great place. New management? They seem to mess up small and large orders alike as well as make every attempt to ruin your day.  Don't do it!  Not the only bagels in town anymore."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am disappointed. Their bagels are like hockey pucks. It is however convenient and if you want to be the new favorite employee at work Wednesdays they have bakers dozen for $6. Not for me but if you are feeling generous/cruel I'd def treat my employees to some."}
{"text":"Cream cheese skimp alert!! We pay ~$7 per smoked salmon bagel and they put the cream cheese on like people butter their toast. They have no clue what the word \"toasted\" means. It really is just warming the bagel. The lox bagels are not even made open face. Not going back again."}
{"text":"I always go to this Brueggers and am usually very happy. But, today, the employee who made my sandwich didn't put it in a bag, only wrapped up in the plastic wrap they use. No big deal until as I was paying, I picked up my sandwich and half fell out onto the counter. My fault for not paying attention, but the employee cashing me out didn't say a SINGLE WORD. She was silent as she watched me clean it up myself. Even though it was my fault, i work in the service industry and would NEVER EVER EVER let one of my guests leave as unhappy as I am right now. Terrible, terrible customer service on her part."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review after I returned to this location after 9 months or so had passed. I went in and was immediately greeted by a sweet, energetic employee who was a great face for the company. I should have gotten her name. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and a bagel to be toasted and both were exactly the quality we had been used. 

The reason I'm giving five stars is because of how accommodating your friendly employee was. This location was out of the cold brew coffee, which I had never had before. Instead of letting me walk out without a coffee, the sweet employee immediately suggested making me an iced coffee with whatever flavor they had available. Some might over look this as not a big deal, but in sales and customer relations, being able to retain your customer and still make the sale is a big deal. Kudos. Very happy to see that change was made. And of course we enjoyed our food and coffee too. Also, this location has a patio. Bonus."}
{"text":"I work near this place so come here a couple times a week for blueberry bagels and coffee. I prefer their bagels over other chains like Einsteins. I've only had a breakfast bagel sandwich once (The Benedict) and it was very good and hit the spot. This place is normally busy so you can expect a short wait since the staff is pretty quick and they are also very nice.

Their dark roast and hazelnut coffees are good, and during the fall they have a pumpkin one that rocks. Although I prefer to mix the flavored ones with the dark roast so the flavor doesn't punch me in the face."}
{"text":"Needed something quick for breakfast on my way to work and stopped at Brueggers. Sesame bagel was fresh, soft and warm. Perfectly cooked and a great way to start my day. Would definitely recommend for anyone!!"}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry, don't come here. They crawl at a snail's pace. VERY SLOW.  I've been standing in line for 15 min. Finally got to order and I tell the guy \"sausage and egg on a plain bagel, no cheese\". 

You'd think my order was so complex. He couldn't remember what I ordered. 

If you're in a hurry don't come here."}
{"text":"The only thing worse than ignoring social media is giving an identical canned response to all slightly negative reviews.

A carbon copy auto-response by \"Aaron T\" to all postings does not improve dining experiences, nor is a viable \"social media reputation management strategy\" or whatever they think he is doing.  In fact it makes the company look more out of touch; I emailed \"social@brueggers.com\" and no response.

Sigh.  I guess I will stop in after a few months to the store several times and report back if any improvement, which is really all we want.  With relatively small improvements to the store, staff training, and small drop in prices this could be a nice neighborhood bagel place.

I'll anticipate \"Aaron's\" next response and save him the trouble!

{"text":"Agh!  Ordered a bagel with cream cheese and thought it was the jalapenos that were funky til I realized the cream cheese was SOUR!!!! If they are not busy enough to sell plain cream cheese before it sours..."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick cheap dinner here and was very satisfied. I had the roast beef panini on ciabatta bread and it was actually really fresh-tasting and delicious. The restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and professional. No complaints!"}
{"text":"If this is stepped up, I don't want to know what it was before.  The egg material was cold, the bacon tastes like chorizo, and the bagels are merely ok.  The very definition of mediocre."}
{"text":"Stopped by when on a biz trip. Good food and friendly staff. I highly recommend. Enjoy."}
{"text":"A proper bagel must be boiled to have the right bite and texture. These are, most others in town are not. You can watch them being made and you can taste the difference. Get any bagel marked \"Hot\"  and thank me later. Their everything bagels are out of this world and probably among the best I have ever had (yes I've had bagels in NYC). Definitely worth a stop when you need your bagel fix."}
{"text":"By far the hardest bagel to eat- had a great taste but definitely gave my jaw a workout. Also the staff was unpleasant and seemed unamused to be there."}
{"text":"Admittedly, the grump factor is high in some of my Yelp reviews.  In my defense, that's because my priority when reading others' reviews is to take note of the bad places and avoid them and I try to return the favor.

That said, I'm happy to click five stars for this location and would give them a sixth if I could.  Unfailingly helpful, polite, friendly and efficient, the crew lineup at this store has been remarkably stable - it makes one confident of getting the same excellent product and service regardless of the day of the week and despite the brutal early morning hours including weekends.  They are never shorthanded.

The bagels themselves are unmatched in the local market and in the Bruegger's chain overall.  The whole 'thank you baker' routine is a bit contrived but this one deserves the gratitude from staff and customers alike.

I'm not crazy about have to stand in a queue to get a quick bag of bagels and a to-go coffee waiting for others to place intricate eat-in orders but that's generally a problem only on the weekends.

This location has the self-serve coffee bar which also saves time and headaches for all.

I'm roughly equidistant from a few Bruegger's locations.  I occasionally visit other locations and am consistently disappointed, especially in the Park Road store (see other review). I'm a slow learner, I suppose, but grateful that one location does it right."}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out.  Nine strikes and the inning's over.

This location's problems are mostly of its own making but the intense foot traffic only exacerbates them.

The bagels are usually acceptable but, compared to other locations, occasionally skimpy and/or undercooked.

Unfortunately, staff turnover at this store seems to be a way of life and through circumstance or choice they are shorthanded by at least one counter person every visit.  The predictable result is long waits.  Placing the coffee urns behind the counter means yet more delays as staff must do the pouring.  They've got plenty of room at the coffee/tea station and it's well past time to move the coffee urns out there even if it means hauling them back to make fresh coffee occasionally, just as Panera et al must do.

This store really is the devil's candy - great location, expansive seating area, outdoor tables - but the slowness of service invariably causes one to ask 'Why bother?' especially when other Bruegger's locations without these problems are nearby."}
{"text":"Decided to pop into Bruegger's Bagels for lunch after shopping. I hadn't had Bruegger's Bagels in around 5 or 6 years, so I was excited to try them again. When I and the 2 people I was with walked in, it was pretty crowded and loud. There was a line of around 5 or 6 people, and overall the wait was around 10-15 minutes for 3 bagels. I had an Everything bagel with smoked salmon cream cheese, and it was very good. The cream cheese was not bright pink (it actually looked like plain cream cheese at first), but it was bursting with salmon flavor! The bagel was a little bitter, although most of the toppings rolled off, which I think was because they were hot and just made. I was lucky enough to have a freshly baked bagel- I thought they had run out of Everything bagels, but as soon as I ordered a new batch of bagels were made. One person in my company had a tuna salad sandwich with mayo on a plain bagel, which was good. The other person had a smoked salmon sandwich with cream cheese, lox, onions, and tomato. We had our bagels to go, and they were a bit crushed on the way home. I didn't have my bagel toasted, but it was warm and crushed from being on the bottom. The cream cheese was melty and the bagel was soft and chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside. It was really good! The only problems were that it was pretty crowded in a small space (which is to be expected at 1:00 on a Saturday), and the menu board was illegible. You could only see the \"bagels and cream cheese\" part where you order, and you can't see any of the sandwiches, salads, or build your own bagels. I would go here again, but I'd look on the online menu first."}
{"text":"love the fresh bagels and the seasonal changes in flavors and cream cheese. my husband and I like to get the last night bagels (Buy 2 get 1 free 6 packs) and freezing them."}
{"text":"For being a typical chain bagel shop, Brueggars is a decent place to grab a bagel in the morning because of its location in the Epicenter. This location also seems super slow though. I feel like I wait in line so long whenever I go! Regardless, I usually order the same exact thing......bacon and egg on a skiny wheat bagel. (FYI- The egg is premade). Nothing spectacular, but gets the job down when I need a quick-ish breakfast and don't wanna cook myself!

PS- The coffee is actually pretty good. They have seasonal types like pumkin, kahula, and coconut!"}
{"text":"While visiting from Atlanta I went to this Bagel restaurant and to my surprise at 9:00 AM they were out of bagels.  Poor management.  How can you have a bagel restaurant \" without bagels\"

{"text":"They doin their best up in here... but I always find Bruegger's to be a cluster-mess of ordering confusion. It is a Sunday morning and additionally Christmas Eve, so all of Matthews is out here trying to get their brunch fix. I just wish Bruegger's would come up with a more organized and efficient ordering system like... make a line for people ordering only bulk bags of bagels and a line for people ordering customized sandwiches and hand these people a ticket number or a written copy of the order to pass along to the cashier. REGARDLESS ... after my painfully slow 20 minute wait in line, my skinny zesty bagel sandwich on everything was the Bomb and I'll be back to endure the wait again some other Sunday"}
{"text":"I have had it with this location! The staff are nice, but I come here on occasion to get a bagel with cream cheese for late afternoon lunches, and so many times after returning to my office in the neighborhood, I open up my bagel wrapper to find a smear of butter on one half and a smear of cream cheese on the other...other times, like today, the barely-there smear of butter on one half, cream cheese on the other half ended up in me eating basically just bread. I shouldn't have to oversee the process just so I ensure I'm not eating half butter bread. Why is it so hard?"}
{"text":"They've got a nice bagel at a good price-- the jalapeno cream cheese is delicious! Always a clean store."}
{"text":"I love the variety of bagels and cream cheese! It's a quick stop in the morning to grab my favorite bagel combo. The breakfast sandwiches are also delicious. A little pricey, but good quality. I just wish their coffee was better so it was a one stop morning."}
{"text":"Great place! Get breakfast here almost every weekend, asiago is my favorite. Staff is very polite and helpful. The managers are great too, always on top of things supporting their staff. Continue to go back as much as I can. Highly recommend them for breakfast or light lunch."}
{"text":"They got my order, and my girlfriend's order, wrong on the same day. Do not expect to get what you order."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked out of there completely dumbfounded.  First we were greeted with a very loud and abrupt \"r u ready to order?!\"  Then I ordered the Leonardo de veggie and the woman looked at me like I was crazy and whipped her head around to find it on the menu.  After she read the ingredients she said rudely \"we don't have a any red onion!\"  At that point I just ordered a bagel with cream cheese as I felt she didn't want to make what I wanted.  The best part of the whole experience was when my husband went to hand the cashier his debit card she pushed his hand away and exclaimed \"you paid six dollars for a drink!? Keep your money!  (Noticing his Jamba Juice smoothie in his other hand). So we left there with two free sandwiches but it didn't make up for the really obnoxious service."}
{"text":"This place has really good (and relatively inexpensive) breakfast. They make everything fresh and the workers are very nice! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Truly one of the BEST bagels I have ever had. I got the Veggie Asiago Bagel and it was worth every calorie. I was very please with the kindness of the employees as well. Definitely gonna be my go to spot for bagels in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best bagels around only problem is coffee temperature.  I like hot coffee but the coffee here was undrinkable. Took the top off and ice cubes yet still burnt my mouth."}
{"text":"This Bruegger's in Bethel Park is my favorite location in Pgh. First off, the location is so convenient to where I work. It is very clean inside, nothing is ever out of stock such as napkins, straws, etc. Most of the workers are very friendly! I go there so often, the one girl actually knows my order without me even having to order it lol...(kinda embarrassing I know) They are a little more expensive than a basic fast food restaurant such as McDonalds or Burger King. However, I believe the quality is a lot better and you're getting better, fresher ingredients that you actually see them put on your sandwich or salad right in front of you. This is definitely a lunch break regular spot for me lol"}
{"text":"This review is from Mr. Ted who does not have a yelp account but asked me to post this awesome experience on his behalf!

I want to thank and acknowledge the Assistant Manager, Maevyn, and her staff at Bruegger's Bagels at the McKnight-Seibert Shopping Mall location! On Friday, May 5th I had a large order of Bagels to be picked up at 6:30 a.m. At 6:15 all the power went out to whole mall area, including Bruegger's. Maevyn and her team called every customer who pre-ordered to inform us the power was out but our orders were filled and we could indeed pick them up! The staff was courteous and kind. Let me say, that \"IT SAVED MY DAY!\" 100 people got their Bagels!

Thank You Maevyn and Team!

Ted O."}
{"text":"Nothing has changed here. Looks like management never did anything to effect change at our neighborhood bagel joint.  Employees arguing in front of customers and coffee/condiment area is filthy! We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Bruegger's but I still keep coming back here, quite regularly in fact.

Favorite thing about Bruegger's? The Jalepeno Cheese speciaty bagel. Yummy, chewy, cheesey, and spicy... all at once! Sometimes I get it with just cream cheese, sometimes as a breakfast bagel with egg. But usually I get it with hummus, veggie cream cheese, and lotsa fresh veggies.

Worst thing about Bruegger's? I think it's over priced. The hummus sandwich mentioned above it around $5. It just seems like a lot for what It is. They actually used to have this sandwich as a menu item back in the day, but now I have to itemize it and I guess that's what jacks up the price.

I know it's a fast food of sorts, but most of the employees here are young airheads who look at me like I'm crazy when I ask for hummus (because maybe no one else orders it?) Give me a big smile, courtesey and a little enthusiasm when you're taking my hard earned money... please?

Oh, and the decor/cleanliness could use a little UMPH."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast at least once a week.. sometimes up to 3 or 4 times a week. I'm a sucker for a bagel. I wish I could say I'm adventurous but I always get an egg and cheese bagel. There's usually only a 2-5 minute wait & the staff is always friendly. I don't drink coffee but they have a pretty good coffee special for bottomless coffee for the entire year. Wowza."}
{"text":"This place has one of those setups where you have to order in one place and then walk to another place to tell them yet again what you ordered and pay. I'm a big fan of the order, wait in the same spot or pick up in another spot procedure. I dislike saying my order twice. In addition, I've found that if I come in here for just a water or coffee and i don't want to order a bagel, i get ignored in favor of another customer who came in behind me who is standing at the \"correct\" spot to order. This has happened to me in more than one location. Why do I have to order my bottled juice from the bagel guy? That's right, I don't. But when I go right to the register, people think I'm confused. Which, to be fair, I am a good amount of the time, but not when it comes to ordering bagels.

In the other hand, I kinda think their bagels are slightly better than Einstein Bros. But I'd really have to do a side-by- side visual and taste comparison in order to make that claim with any certainty."}
{"text":"Toasted smoked salmon bagel for breakfast is excellent."}
{"text":"After never coming to this restaurant, I found myself here twice in two days. Once for lunch for a turkey sandwich in an everything bagel, and once for a breakfast sandwich.

I've never been a big bagel guy in general. Give me a good donut any day and I'll be happy. And while both sandwiches were in fact on a bagel, I couldn't tell if they were good or not. The sandwich ingredients were seriously lacking as was the wait time with little to no people in line.

Definitely avoid the bag of chips with your sandwich as they cost $1.35 and contain about 8 chips."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss. I am never overly impressed with Bruegger's, but it gets the job done when it comes to coffee and bagels. Unfortunately, the drive thru line takes FOREVER. I wanted to get out of line and drive off, but since the drive thru loops around to the back of the building & it is a 1 way, there is no room to get though when there are cars in line. 
Yesterday, I waited in line for 24 minutes for an iced coffee and bagel. Like seriously? I could have went somewhere else. Ordered, sat down to eat, and been done faster. After the long wait, I discovered my order was totally wrong, not to mention I didn't even get a single napkin in the bag with my food. I ordered my coffee with milk and equal. It was full of cream it actually looked like a milkshake, & was not sweetened at all. No sweetener in the bag...Total disappointment. After the long wait, I was already late to where I was going so no chance I was going back to wait another 24 minutes for them to fix it. 
The employees are always friendly, I'll give them that, but it's kind of price. $10.59 for a chipotle turkey bagel with hardly any meat at all & a Medium iced coffee? Another plus, Champagne dressing is pretty good if you get a salad. After yesterday's experience, i don't think I'll be going back anytime."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly. No matter how busy it is, the wait is never long. My food is always fresh and I've never had a bad experience! Great place all around"}
{"text":"I come here because it's close to where I work but every time I've been greeted with terrible attitudes. Today specifically I had to wait for the cashier to come back from texting in the little closet area. She finally came and rang me up and then proceeded to start texting again at the register so I just walked away. She then yelled if I wanted my receipt. Service is just always horrendous. In previous visits I've had employees look at me as I walked up, then go back to finishing their conversation about their weekend before coming to take my order."}
{"text":"Bruegger's is a great bagel option that's close to my apartment and fairly priced. I have no idea why I'm not here at least once a week. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are delicious and a somewhat healthier (or at least it feels like it) choice than a McD's bagel sandwich. Sure, the calorie count is probably up there, but the ingredients are fresh(er) and not weighed down by grease. 

The staff has always been super friendly with me, even if my eyes are still half shut and I can't seem to get my order out of my mouth in a way that makes any sort of sense. High five for working the early shift and dealing with sleepy folks and those grumps that haven't gotten their coffee yet! 

Bruegger's also runs a lot of coupons, and since I'm a runner, I come across them at nearly all of the races I run. Definitely a nice little perk and a great way to motivate me to actually come here as much as my taste buds want me to."}
{"text":"Bruegger's bagels are good but there is no good tea in here. Convenient location with comfortable sitting and free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I come here to study pretty frequently. The location is good and near both parking and public transportation.

The food is decent: it's your typical chain bagel store. Nothing more and nothing less. The service can be really friendly or just....not. I think it depends on who is working that day.

I sort of wish they had more outlets around the place. It's clearly a spot where you can sit for awhile so having very few outlets makes it tough for anyone connected to technology.

The music is usually okay: typical background stuff from the 90s through today. A bit eclectic. 

Overall, a decent place to grab a bagel and do some work if you like working with a little bit of noise in the background."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of different brueggers locations. It's always tasty. But this location is the best. Everyone is exceptionally nice. Especially the girl who works at the cash register. I wish there was a tip jar so I could give her a tip."}
{"text":"Terrible over heated and dry. Run to another place"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels! Staff was very efficient and friendly, will be back here many times!"}
{"text":"It's a crisp morning with a slight chill. I was in the mood for a bagel and coffee and came across this place on a tuesday. Interior is contemporary. I went with the salmon and my choice of bagel sandwich. Overall, not a bad place to start the morning.  For a morning start, the bagel didn't seem \"fresh\", texture wise but then take note I usually get the bagels from the grocery store. The sandwich was composed of salmon, capers, ad red onion as far as I can tell, and it seems to be the suggested way to enjoy your salmon from what I've seen from foodie tv shows hehe."}
{"text":"Great bagels. Unfortunately the pastrami sandwich has 2 slices of meat. For $7.00 they could be a little more generous. Maybe the one piece of cheese on the sandwich should have filled me up."}
{"text":"Inconsistent service but management is working on it.  If given the option Missy is a senior member of the staff with excellent customer service skills. ... AND accurately completes my order.

Big fan of the Leonardo di veggie.

-------------------

UPDATE:  Missy is still an excellent employee great representative of the company.  There is still high employee turnover.  Unfortunately this type of employer attracts a transient staff who do not see themselves as long term employees and it shows.

Do they make a good bagel? Yes.  Do you have to watch for accuracy? Yes Do I pick up a bagel weekly? Yes"}
{"text":"It was terrible, terrible, terrible. The lady preparing the bagel for my daughter  couldn't even make a straight cut, the peanut-butter and jelly was all over the place. How hard is it to prepare an appealing peanut-butter and jelly bagel???? The end result looked like she just threw up all over it. My bagel wasn't fresh and when she pulled out the humus, it had a crust on it like an old product would have. It was one of the most terrible Sunday breakfasts I've ever had. I will never ever return!"}
{"text":"Bruegger's is decent when you have a jonesing for a bagel but my experience there has never really been memorable. Maybe b/c Bruegger's Bagels really doesn't roll well off the tongue? Who knows.  This location always seems to be more busy then they are able to handle but they offer a pretty sweet selection of lunch sandwiches, soups and salads with pick two combo's like other establishments. They main reason I go there is because they have frequent bagel specials if you sign up for their email club (this is the main reason I am giving them three stars as opposed to two). If I can get three bagels for free, I'm a fan and will visit your establishment. I've never been too impressed their coffee, which is sad."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I like stopping here on our early (okay 2PM) Saturday adventures. Close to where we live is this Shadyside location right on the edge of bustling Walnut Street. When we've gone later in the day you may find lesser stock of bagel varieties but nothing that is too off-putting. The service is average but the staff are nice enough and the food is prepared fresh to order. The location itself could use some better cleaning at times but it seems like they have 2-3 people working at a time. 

Another poster commented on the parking situation, I've always parked in the large lot next to Bruegger's (Walnut and Aiken) without issue. I've actually never even seen a parking attendant in the area, maybe it's just a weekday thing. 

Overall an acceptable place to grab a quick bite, good overall taste and quality!"}
{"text":"I come in on a regular basis for weekend bagels. The bagels taste good but I am usually disappointed in the size. Bagels should be dessert plate size but Bruegger's usually use a hockey puck for the template. If there were a better place in the neighborhood I would not come here for that reason. The price is fair and if you get the bakers dozen you get two of the house cream cheese's tossed in."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed.  This place has gone downhill.  I understand that taking the roast beef away was corporate decision, but to replace it with frozen hamburger patties??? 
This location is slack... I was there for well over an hour and they were not busy and no one wiped up the tea area where the napkins are.  I know someone saw it b/c I waited to be rung up while they filled the napkins when I first came in. The trash is overflowing... Don't think I'll be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bagels are the best I've ever had. I don't know what someone was talking about in their review because they have a huge selection of bagels. The staff is super friendly and on Wednesdays they have 2 dollars off bagel bundles. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Rude service and gross coffee, as for the bagels... I'm a New Yorker, so these bagel-shaped bread things being called \"bagels\" are laughable to me. Also, why are they charging an arm and a leg for basic bagels + eggs, things that are supposed to be cheap?? No, thanks."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my visit here the other morning! It's a cute little bagel shop with a modern, retro feel, a decent amount of seating (booths and tables), a clean, peaceful atmosphere and super friendly & quick service! Oh and they have restrooms, a necessity for us coffee guzzlers. ;-)

I got the whole wheat bagel with maple walnut cream cheese on one side and bacon scallion on the other (since I had a terrible mental debate deciding between the two). A rather fine bagel I must say. Very wholesome. The maple walnut cream cheese is delicately sweet and has tiny walnut chunks in it, a pleasant surprise!

The coconut coffee (a seasonal flavor) was deliciously flavored and was brewed pretty strong/dark, which I like. Perfect with some milk.

1 star amiss just for the lack of coffee \"condiments\", and that the coffee isn't self-serve. Einstein Bros (around the corner) has all their coffee out on the bar so you can try every flavor and go back for seconds, along with spices for your tea and coffee. I would've loved to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to my coconut coffee (and refill it multiple times) at Bruegger's, but def not a big deal! I would so go back/recommend to all bagel lovers! A great, fairly inexpensive ($1.70 for coffee in your own thermos) place for breakfast/lunch with friends or even your jolly 'ol self."}
{"text":"Pamela is a bad representation of this location! Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this \"employee.\" I will not return."}
{"text":"Bruegger's Bagels is definitely the best place to get breakfast at the Cleveland Airport. I ordered fresh squeeze orange juice and the smoked salmon, plain cheese, tomato, red onion and capers breakfast sandwich but I substitute a regular bagel with the jalapeño cheddar bagel. When I was about to take take my first bite, a lady said, \"That looks look! What is it?\" She ordered the same thing. Haha
I don't know what possessed me to order the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich in the middle of Cleveland, but I'm glad I did because it was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Brueggers ever. It doesn't matter if I am the only one in the store or in a like out the door, the staff is slow and does not care that they are slow. They frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there. The food is okay/typical Brueggers quality usually which is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of the 1."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast! Only 1 baker and 1 cashier were working, wow just wow! They were both busting their butts off and still maintained giving fantastic customer service (it was insanely busy too). If you ever come here for breakfast I recommend you try the Western sandwich! It is fantastic."}
{"text":"Preface: I LOVE Brueggers bagels. 


Airport food is always bad but this was really bad. The woman behind the counter was SO so rude I really wanted to ask her where her manners were. Aside from that the quality of the food is not what I've had at other Brueggers locations. Wishing I went somewhere else. Slimey chicken and limp lettuce. I couldn't even eat it (and I can eat most anything) Not to mention it costs a fortune more than it should....."}
{"text":"I was greeted when I walked in the door, the restaurant was very clean and the bagels were fresh and still warm. I ordered the salmon bagel and it was incredibly tasty.

I had a good experience and will be returning here again. In particular the girl at the cash register was very friendly and made conversation past your basic hello."}
{"text":"I come her often, but I don't know when I'll be back since my taste buds have been burnt off, thanks to the Sriracha sandwich I tried to eat, the bagel looked like it was shot this morning, so much Sriracha I'm surprised that this place has any left. I have been meaning to make a review of this location for a while now and time after time I keep coming up with the same reasons. The staff here sucks, I hate to say it because I understand working in a \"deli\", I put myself through college working in an actual one and its not sunshine and smiles all the time. However, this staff is terrible. Not a single one actually give a crap that they're at work, the attitudes are rude and just plain nasty. They also have no idea what they are doing. I have witnessed the staff here wipe down the entire counter, and then use the same rag to wipe down a coffee lid that was given to a customer. I've seen the staff use the same utensils after wiping them off with said rag and sticking them right back into the cream cheese. I once pre ordered a dozen bagels for a work function and even called the day ahead to remind this location that I was coming, what time and what I wanted. Got there at the right time, and nothing was ready. They didn't even know I had an order, and when I did talk to the manager he \"kinda\" remembered. Once I did finally get my order had the bagels been cut or toasted as asked...nope, just tossed in the smallest bag possible.

same yourself some time and go to Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Not to be negative, but Bruegger's is no Stalwart Murray's, but if your in Mentor its a pretty good pick. They have fresh traditional bagels, bialy's and flat breads with every topping you could want. The establishment is clean and simple, not really a walk through NY shop, but a basic grab and eat with a cup of joe kinda place. Decent bagels, fast service, and I wouldn't hesitate to say its probably the best coffee in Mentor. Great place for a snack or to grab a dozen for home on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I had the everything bagel with roast beef. The bagel was great and had plenty of toppings. The vegetables and roast beef were fresh and tasty. Overall if you are looking for something that is somewhat healthy then give this place a try. The staff was not real professional but overall a good place to grab a bite while at the airport food court"}
{"text":"I haven't visited the Bruegger's on East Blvd in quite a few years.  This past weekend, I was reminded why. 

I went during lunchtime on Saturday.  It took me awhile to decide what I wanted.  $6 for a plain ol' sandwich?  Yikes.  I could get a sub from Harris Teeter for half that.  I opted for the under $4 spinach, egg, and cheese breakfast bagel.  The guy behind the counter seemed like he was stoned; it took him awhile to assemble the simple sandwich.  Once I was on my way, I stopped by the unkempt beverage station to fill up my cup.  It needed restocking and a wipe-up in a major way.  

Then I went to sit down...and had a flashback.  This was exactly what I remember from last time, and why I hadn't come back.  There was no line at the counter, the dining room had less than a handful of tables occupied, and yet as I looked around, every table was dirty.  Crumbs, spills, and general dishevel.  I wanted to sit down...but I was afraid.  It was close to 90 degrees outside, but I took my sandwich outside to eat anyway.  

The sandwich was pretty good, but I can get a good assembled breakfast sandwich at Starbucks, too, and not have to fight my way through all the filth.  Clean up your act, Bruegger's!"}
{"text":"I work next door and get the sausage egg and cheese bagel all the time which is very delicious. The coffee is always fresh. Most importantly the employees and management team are extremely nice and welcoming. I highly recommend eating here. Thank you."}
{"text":"Bagels nothing special. Lady asked employee how she was doing, employee sharply replied \"SICK, that's how I'm doing! Cream cheese?\" I Laugh so hard I dropped my phone."}
{"text":"A nice bagel shop with WIFI available. Coffee options aren't ''Starbucks-esque'' but is sufficient. They have seasonal flavors for bagels that are pretty yummy. Price wise? Pretty typical for a bagel shop. A bagel & coffee will run you about $4."}
{"text":"Oh, Bruegger's, you had me at \"Hello, please try our Cheese and Jalapeño bagel with extra cream cheese.\" It's portable nachos.

This close to Davidson you have to watch out for the frat-daddies in perfectly frayed baseball hats, rainbow sandals, Ray-Ban wayfarers, Ralph Lauren \"Big Pony\" polos, madras shorts, nautical-themed belts, and sunglass-tans. Just kidding, I love your pickup truck."}
{"text":"Bagels are nice and fresh. You can get one with cream cheese for under $3 tax in. Tables are not clean but this is like any other fast food joint. Service is fine but can slow down as everything is made to order. 

Airport location is similar. I also tried the Parisian and the breakfast bagel. Not cheap but does a good job when you're on the run and more healthy than eating junk in the food court. 

Beats Tim Horton's!"}
{"text":"In the Pineville area and need a quick breakfast meeting meal for the office? Here you go! Call ahead and within 15 minutes, your dozen bagels (sliced) and Box of Coffee is ready to go. Comes with 2 cream cheeses and the staff was very friendly about the order. Sometimes places, during breakfast, get irritated with large orders like this...not here. The place was busy and they were very helpful. The inside was larger than expected too!"}
{"text":"I wished this Bruegger's would be open on weekends. I really do. I RRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLYYYYY DO!!! Please open for weekends.

Please, make this location open on weekends."}
{"text":"This is my local Bruegger's Bagels because the Norman Center and Peters Township locations closed. This Bruegger's is in Scott Township and is located near Greentree Road."}
{"text":"My local Bruegger's Bagels, which was this one and one other one, closed on Dec. 10, 2017. The Pleasant Hills Bruegger's also closed as well as the 411 Seventh Avenue
Location."}
{"text":"Strangely, I have eaten here several times and never had a bagel. Sometimes I have even gone with the explicit intention of getting a bagel, but it has never happened. Typically I am diverted by their sandwiches which, based on the other reviews, are much better than their bagels. The food has never been bad, but the store does have a strange vibe to it. This corner of the EpiCentre is usually quiet and although the store is new it has a lonely and neglected feeling to it. I don't mean that there is something acutely wrong, but I always feel as if I should be going somewhere else. Somewhere populated."}
{"text":"Slow and error-prone service, not up to Bruegger's normal standards, nor with the new CLE airport image.  After several visits, I now count on being up-sized in my drink request, and challenged in communicating with the counter staff.  If you choose the yogurt and granola, check for sogginess before parting with your cash.  If you are in a hurry to catch a flight, it may be too late to reconcile your order, or to discuss why they are out of medium size cups -- and why it was necessary to charge you for a large drink rather than serve a medium in a large cup.  I love Bruegger's, but this franchise is lacking."}
{"text":"Although the bagels are decent, the food prep area and its surroundings are shameful. Looks like the place hasn't been cleaned in years. Also, prepare to clean your own table and don't ask for a wet cloth or napkin to do so. They won't provide anything, so bring your own or sit and eat on dirty tables smudged with others food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love my morning stop at Bruegger's for a Bacon, Egg, & Cheese on a Rosemary Olive Oil bagel... breaks up the monotony of my morning. 

I stopped in for lunch today - got the Sundrenched Tomato & Bagel salad... I'll give my selection an A+, its delish!

The decor of the place makes me feel at home - it's nice & quaint. As for the staff - everyone has always been very nice to me... I read the other guy's review - & if they're rude it's probably because of the attitude you come in with. Working in a bank for five years taught me how to communicate more effectively with people in the service industry - it's called patience! :)

On Wednesdays (at least right now) you can get a dozen bagels for $5.99. Fantastic deal. My favorites are definitely the jalapeño cheddar, cinnamon sugar, & rosemary olive oil.

In the past I've had wraps, soups, & various sandwiches (bagel-wiches) from Bruegger's & everything has always been tasty & fresh.

5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Bruegger's Westlake, if I compare you to the Brecksville location you just don't measure up.

But that's okay because you're close to home, convenient, quick, and don't make me show my Bottomless card every time I want to grab a quick Diet Coke.

The staff at this location isn't super friendly but the food is decent. Whether it's a bagel breakfast sandwich or a café salad in the afternoon all selections have been up to my standards. The food selection is a pretty good variety and not bad at all for grabbing a quick bite at lunch-time. Sometimes they will have fresh fruit cups available for purchase - which is a refreshing treat.

This Bruegger's has free WiFi and as with all Bruegger's locations I've encountered, the atmosphere is inviting (kind of a bit of a homey-feel). The music volume isn't too loud so it's a good place to study or get some work done. I've never seen the the place packed but my suggestion for a good study area is to the very right when you enter the establishment - there are only a few tables in that area and it seems to be the quietest and most private place.

If you're interested in catering, they do that - so come on in and order some bagels (or salads, or muffins, or beverages) for your next gathering or meeting. 

My number one suggestion? Get a Bottomless card. They go on sale around the holidays and offer unlimited pop, tea, and coffee to card holders. In addition, there is a monthly special only for Bottomless Card members (such as $1 off breakfast sandwiches, or free bagel with a purchase of another bagel, etc.)."}
{"text":"The toppings on my salad were barely there.
I never had the bacon I asked for. The salad dressing was watered down... The salad has been greatly reduced in size. 
I used to love their salad... Not anymore. Cutting too many corners."}
{"text":"Time to rant. I go to this Bruegger's location often since I work in the area. I go for lunch though, since I am not a bagel person. Their sandwich's are actually pretty good. 

Two things that bother me here. When I tell the person making my sandwich what I want, why do they have to use those red or black grease pencils to write on the very paper they make my sandwich on. They write on the paper then lay the bread down almost on top of the writing. And then that gooky grease pen stuff gets on your bread. Who's idea was this? It's terrible and sends a bad message. 

The other issue I have here is the cleanliness and readiness of the dining area. I was there at 2pm, so it wasn't crowded at all. Employees standing around doing nothing. Yet, the condiments bar was totally out of napkins and the trash was overflowing. And EVERY SINGLE TABLE that wasn't being used was dirty. So, I am left to sit at a crumb filled table left over from some stranger. After spending about 20 minutes there, not once did someone come out to clean.."}
{"text":"Delicious hot bagels!

Absolutely packed, so there was quite a wait time, but I liked the food."}
{"text":"The bagels are too hit and miss for my taste. Some days they're perfectly fine, and I appreciate their flavored cream cheese, especially the honey walnut. But I've also had a few total lame ducks - just lukewarm bagels with not much of a smear. 

So basically your run of the mill chain bagel place, which is fine. The prices are good, the hazelnut coffee has caffeine, and the setting on Cedar Rd is convenient."}
{"text":"Fresh hot coffee at its best!! I had a regular bagel with cream cheese... Sooooo FRESH!! My first visit but far from my last!"}
{"text":"Honest moment here: I've only been here twice. Both times I got the amazing chicken spaetzle soup. So to be fair, this review would probably be a 5-star if it was based purely on that soup. 

However, this time I thought I'd go cray cray and get the half Turkastrami on Rye sandwich (with the soup of course). This nutso-sounding concoction is turkey and pastrami on rye with arugula, tomato slices, honey mustard and cheddar cheese.

Now, I'm not one to blame the workers usually. I'm not sure if the young lady was just having a bad day or what but she was all out of sorts. I had to tell her what type of sandwich I wanted 3 times, first time she grabbed the wrong bread and second time she forgot the pastrami. When it was finally going the right way she accidentally dropped it on the floor. Woops! I had asked to sub spicy mustard for the honey mustard bc I'm not much of a honey mustard fan. I ended up getting honey mustard anyway. :( 

By the time I finally got back to work my sandwich was cold and soggy. I will definitely be back for the soup but not so sure about the sandwiches. I'll update my review later!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years and the EVERYTIME it has been amazing. The people are always amazing and friendly.

The people that work at this location are truly amazing and for that I am thankful. Always there to help you if you have questions about the process 
I bought the sausage - egg and cheese on a toasted plain bagel (definitely suggest)
and their orange juice...refreshing

Being from New York, this place is the best place to get a Norther quality breakfast 

Their entire menu is great on the run or to eat in. Especially in the morning it can get busy but the line moves quickly since everyone knows exactly what to do.

When I want to eat out for a great breakfast that is good for you, this is the place that I go.

-Wally"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome!

The bagels are fresh, hot and delicious! I've tried several flavors including whole wheat, sesame and asiago cheese but my favorite by far is the everything bagel! It's delicious with so many different flavors!

They have a great combo option which includes a bagel sandwich and either soup or a salad and some chips. It's a great deal for only $6.99.

Also, great news is that on Wednesdays they have a Baker's dozen for $5.99 and that's a great deal for 13 bagels!

The employees are friendly and the food is great and its a great option for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Another average bagel place that's located on Murray in the heart of Squirrel Hill. I've stopped in here a few times while shopping in the neighborhood or before/after a movie at the Manor. One thing I don't like is that they close pretty early from what I remember (maybe 5 or so).  Otherwise, make sure to Grab a bag of day old bagels, which I think are only $2.99."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague. Never have I ever walked a more consistently inconsistent Brueggers than this one. 

Today when I came in, it was the cashier who initially took my order, then handed it off to one of the workers on the line. This is where my order may have gotten lost. Since everything gets rung up at the end, there is no real system keeping track of what was ordered (including any modifications and allergies), making it easy to mess things up. The toasted asiago bagel with onion and chive cream cheese I ordered then became an untoasted cinnamon bagel with onion and chive. Ultimately I had to toss my entire bagel since I was already at my destination and could not get it remade.

The real issue here is the lack of a proper ordering system and a reliance on verbal communication between workers. If I had any real allergies (like a nut or dairy allergy) I would not trust this place to handle it. 

If you like weird bagel combinations and living life on the edge, this location is for you. For me, I'll be sticking to better places nearby."}
{"text":"Good bagels, friendly service, and a good price.  I've been to Bruegger's a few times and have always enjoyed their bagels.  They are a good size and have a decent variety of both cream cheese and bagels.  The staff is generally pretty friendly too.   This location is in a fun spot right downtown as well.

I don't have them by me, so I usually stock up when I'm near one.  I like being able to grab a few packs to take home and they sell the batch from the previous night, $3.50 for 6."}
{"text":"In town for a convention looking for a brunch type local.  Brueggers bagels hit the spot.  I ordered the \"Western\" breakfast bagel. Egg, bacon, cheddar cheese and fresh red onions & green/red peppers toasted together.   Fresh OJ on the side.  Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Average, run-of-the-mill chain bagel place in Oakland.  The staff is really nice and I typically get the \"day-old bagel\" deal, which is great. I'm always upset that this place closes so early, because I've wanted to stop in here for dinner for a late-night bite many times and it has been closed. Therefore, they just lose my business and I walk over to Panera down the street."}
{"text":"I use this Bruegger's each time I'm feeding a large group. They make it really easy to order a large quantity of bagels, large containers of coffee, and tubs of cream cheese. I highly recommend using them for this especially because they open early."}
{"text":"As much as I typically avoid bigger industry-type chains, I've always enjoyed stopping in here while hanging out in Shadyside. It's at the perfect location at the end of Walnut (though technically on Aiken) to grab something on your way into Shadyside or on your way out. I walked in today and the manager greeted me sweetly. I just picked up a bag of day-old bagels (who can beat a bag of 6 for less than 3 bucks?) and a soda, and the woman was nice enough to offer a free bag of bagels to me! I don't even care if they had to get rid of them by the end of the afternoon, it was an incredibly nice gesture which almost guarantees a stop in the next time I need a quick breakfast or lunch sometime soon. Great upstairs area with Wifi (though limited outlets) to eat and work."}
{"text":"This place is good for breakfast and coffee. Very consistent every visit.  They seem to always have a line, but it goes quickly.  I tried the smoky brisket, pastrami, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.  Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give them a half star but was not an option sort of like the options in town!  Customers love this place but it's the only choice.  They only have 8 bagels to choose from, the sign says that there sandwiches has a fresh cracked eggs.  That is the farthest from the truth.  These eggs are pre cooked then heated in the oven when.  If you ask for your bagel toasted they consider the warming in the oven toasting!  The staff was vey pushy when I was looking over the menu and no one even waiting behind me, in fact there was only one other person in the store.  I feel really feel bad for the residence of them near by area that have no other choice then this place!  Most mom n pop bagel places are usually the best bagels around but if a chain moves in these place wouldn't stand an even remote chance of surviving!

BTW Flavors of the bagels not very good, don't know how you get that wrong."}
{"text":"Busy place!  Fun to watch them making the bagels in the big vat.  Good food.  Great place to meet one or two people to chat."}
{"text":"DONT GO! I usually really love Breuggers. I eat it in my hometown almost every week. This experience was terrible. The staff was exceedingly unkind. When I asked for more of a product on my sandwich the lady making it rolled her eyes. The experience only got better as I got to the register and was dismissed and told that I could bag my sandwiches if I wanted to. Afterwards, my husband was given the wrong sandwiches. The customer service at this location was completely horrific. Unfortunately it seemed like the manager also had a chip on her shoulder. I love this company but I'm really disappointed in how this store handles its customers."}
{"text":"The only reason to bother is that the food is decent.  The service, as nearly every review has noted, is terrible. I went in to get a sandwich just a few minutes ago. Three people working, one person ahead of me being served.  Took a good while to be acknowledged- no eye contact.  The gentleman waiting on me wanted to be anywhere but there and I don't know if it is humanly possible to outwardly project any more disdain for his job.  Someone who was perhaps was a manager was dropping f-bombs in a friendly conversation with a customer, and then disappeared to the back. I received my hot sandwich, then stood at the register akwardly while the person who had made my sandwich walked away.  I was trying to make eye contact with the two remaining employees to get rung up before my food got cold, but it still took awhile before one finally walked over to ring me up. 
I've complained to corporate many times before, and it's always the same. I used to visit a lot more often, but now seldom do. Today's visit reminded me why.  Don't bother. Plenty of other places to eat nearby."}
{"text":"Bad Java this morning.  Hopefully an anomaly.  Their house blend coffee usually superb.  Not sure if I just got the bottom of the container or what but it was as awful."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Bruegger's Bagels, I'm asking myself WHY????  Nice location,  plenty of yummy choices.  The guy behind the counter was a hoot :)  i tried the everthing bagel with veggie garden cream cheese,  I had him throw in an egg. For protein; ) . Definitely be back. .give then a try!"}
{"text":"Similar to what others have said, this place just doesn't have it down yet. Line moves very slowly. Seems like they need more workers for efficiency. Everyone was pleasant but the line is a major issue. Bagel quality: 2.5/5. It needed a lot more flavor and cheese. The western comes with a chipotle sauce, which I couldn't taste. I even got the pumpkin bagel, and it is probably the least pumpkin tasting bagel I've ever had. I wouldn't have known it was pumpkin otherwise. Bummed out."}
{"text":"Old school jams, super friendly staff, great fresh food and free Wi-Fi, Come on...how could this place not be worth the five stars?!?!?!

What an excellent selection of bagels and varieties at this location! I stopped in for lunch and to catch up on some work and was more than pleasantly surprised with my visit.

I walked up to the counter and everyone was smiling and singing to the music, very happy to help and that is what will keep me coming back as a customer! I ordered the trio, by far the best deal on the menu...you get any bagel sandwich, soup or chips and a drink for $6.99. 

I chose the turkey chipotle (turkey and peppered bacon) on a rosemary and olive oil bagel with lettuce, jalapeños, onions and chipotle mayo. Toasted, of course with chips as my side. I asked that they make the bacon extra crispy and they were more than happy to oblige :) 

The sandwich was absolutely delish! Loved the rosemary and olive oil bagel and they piled on the toppings! The chips are all kettle cooked, my absolute favorite so I was clearly a fan!

Best thing about this place outside of that customer service and yummy food was the abundance of outlet plugs and booths for everyone to enjoy the free Wi-Fi!!! Everywhere I looked there was a chair or booth and outlet which was wonderful! And I don't know if it a regular thing but the tunes today were amazing...nothing but old school classics...I could help but bop my head and jam on....

That my friends is as good as it gets! Can't wait to go back!!

Don't forget about the specials on Wednesdays, so be sure to drop in!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick breakfast San which- had the wrap with eggs and turkey sausage.. this was probably one of the most tasteless breakfast wraps I have ever had.. and no option to add any veggies? Pass."}
{"text":"I've never been to a brueggers where I had to wait 15-20 mins in the drive thru for a bagel with cream cheese. Regardless if you're inside or out you will wait forever."}
{"text":"I love this Bruegger's location. The staff is super friendly. The coffee is always fresh. They have never messed up an order and are always prompt. I can't say enough about the staff. I know it's just a bagel shop but customer service at most other places I visit is sub par compared to this Bruegger's."}
{"text":"Yummy.  It's a chain so I refrain from 5 stars.  The food is always good whether it be breakfast or lunch (I love their bagle sandwiches).   This particular Brueggers has always been clean, friendly and fresh.  One time I walked it on an employee meeting and the manager seemed a bit harsh.  I guess the Brueggers chain has a thing about nail polish and hair color which wasn't going over well with the pink haired girl.  
I haven't been in a while.  It got to the point that I went there so often that the staff got to know me and started to know what I was going to order before I even placed the order and then started to engage in conversation with me.  Normal people would like a friendly staff like that, but at 6am I prefer not to make small talk.  I immediately stopped going... not to mention I moved across town ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to many Bruegger's but this ... Hmmm... The bagel was tasty. I got an everything bagel toasted with jalapeño cream cheese. It was toasted to my liking and the cream cheese was spread with a perfect amount to my liking. 
Let's get to this iced coffee...
I feel it's a bit strange because their regular coffee is, sublime. Their iced coffee is so bitter and after adding 8ounces of half and half (that's a bit extreme) I still was unable to drink it. 
My boyfriend threw his out immediately and he isn't one to waste anything. He ordered a medium iced coffee, added sugar and cream and said, \"this is the worst coffee I've ever had\". With that said, I'm certain we will never have iced coffee there again. It was certainly terrible. 
Otherwise, everything else was good. The employees were nice and quick to serve."}
{"text":"So this used to be an Einstein Brothers location and it shows...the quality of service is lacking.

I usually use the drive thru, and if there is one or two cars ahead of you...FORGET IT!  Will take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes. You almost feel as if the staff is putting the bagels in the oven the second you order it, that's how long it takes. 

 Not the best location or best drive thru. there is always Dunkin Donuts next door, if you are looking for a faster staff."}
{"text":"The slowest service I have experienced at any airport, and I fly a lot. They also apparently forgot to make my sandwich after I waited forit for 15 minutes. So, while the bagels are good, if you want to actually catch your flight you might want to visit Dunkin across the way."}
{"text":"I am a bagel lover but this place was very much MEH. I don't know what else to say but meh. I know it is a chain but this is my first experience with a bruegger's ever. I got an everything bagel with bacon egg and cheese. The bagel was really rubbery and hard to chew. It barely had any everything toppings on it. The inside of the sandwich tasted like it had maple syrup in it. It had a very peculiar taste. Alas, the quest for decent bagels in Charlotte continues... 3 stars instead of 2 stars because the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed and will not be back to this location.  There were 2 people making sandwiches, very slowly. 5 people waiting in line.Sandwich makers could not hear what customers wanted and customers had to repeat several times. Heard the counter person ask customer what the sign says of his ingredients in his sandwich since she was new and did not know! Went to bathroom and came back, line had not moved. decided to pick up may bagel order that had been called in and leave. No name on bagel order, long story short bagels were not correct and they did not have what I ordered. Asked for my money back and shift manager went to get manager. He was on phone so had to continue to wait. When he came out, he asked me for explanation and all I could say is please give me my money back and let me out of here. This whole experience took 15 minutes and I left with nothing. Very poor management and training. You will not get good help if you do not pay people what they are worth, or maybe you do...you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast so I'll review that.

This place is mediocre in every sense of the word. I decided to go a second time just to try a different item on the menu, sort of a second chance. I remain disappointed. 

The service: bland. They are less than enthusiastic. I don't expect employees to be absolutely stoked to serve me bagels, but it's as though I'm some burden on their life. Hardly any eye contact. They're all limp, tired, and annoyed. Just a bad attitude to start off. I assume this has something to do with management to an extent. It's as if these people REALLY hate their job. (I worked in food service for six years and even though most don't plan on being in food service forever, there can still be good vibes at a restaurant, but I digress).

The food: The bagels are dry and a little tough. Egg is just what you would get at a McDonald's. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, but just a heads up. You can see them add this rubbery egg disc to your sandwich, slap a few other ingredients on (unevenly), and pop it in the warming machine. The cheese is also rubbery. 

As I said before. I wasn't expecting gourmet, but this place is complete crap. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love trying new places when we're out of town, and my daughter was requesting bagels. So we popped in here for breakfast.

There were several cream cheese varieties and I was debating on which I wanted, but I finally settled on the onion & chive on an onion bagel. My daughter was basic - plain bagel with plain cream cheese. My son got a plain bagel with PB&J. And my husband had some sort of breakfast egg bagel sandwich.

It was all very good. The girls behind the counter were very nice and worked to get us served quickly."}
{"text":"This Bruegger's location has always gotten my order correct [hard not to when you're watching them making it in the line]. The staff has always been friendly, and you can get in and out with a sandwich or bagel in a matter of minutes. Great uptown location in the Epicenter for those walking through or ones who work here. 

I got the Chorizo Jack breakfast bagel [seasonal special] and that thing was dynamite. Highly suggested for anyone who likes some spice in their life. A fresh-cracked egg with pepper jack cheese, chorizo sausage and jalapeno cream cheese on a guajillo bagel.

{"text":"Holy customer service issues, batman!  Security had just opened so we were maybe 3rd in line that morning but there was little direction as to where to start the line, where to order for certain things but not others, etc.  It quickly got chaotic because of the rush after security.  The food tasted okay and prices were alright...but the chaos and lack of direction from staff was a bit much for me.  Staff barked orders at customers because of the lack of direction which really left things on a negative note with me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly service. Employees have a great team/family vibe there. Loveee the coconut coffee!"}
{"text":"I went here once because one of the Pitt clubs was doing a fundraiser here, and I'm not sure if it was just this location, but I wasn't impressed. 

I got a pumpernickel bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel was thin and pretty bland. There was barely any cream cheese on there, and what WAS there was poorly spread around. 

The location is good and it's cheap, but you'd have better luck going to Einstein's bagels, or even getting a Panera bagel- instead."}
{"text":"Although their food is FANTASTIC...my order has been consistently wrong the past 4 times I've been there. I usually go through the drive-thru on my way to work, and most of the time I don't open my bag until I sit down at my office, but I need to start checking the food before I leave the parking lot. Sigh."}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's. I'm a member of their \"Bottomless Mug Club\" which costs about $150 for the year and entitles me to unlimited free beverages for a year. Many times your receipt includes a survey to get a dollar-off coupon.

Prepared bagels and sandwiches are a bit pricey but there are a lot of coupons and promotions available. The \"Last Night's Bagels\" are a great deal and if toasted, taste almost fresh."}
{"text":"Went to get three bagels Saturday morning. Had to ask where one of the bagels was. They were toasted but it was cold. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Worst whole wheat bagel I've ever had. I was starving and still couldn't finish it. Yuck, would not recommend going here at all."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go here about once a week. We generally get the same thing. They remember our order (which is pretty complicated - everything bagel, toasted, with smoked salmon, onion, tomato, and jalapeño cream cheese) and are friendly and chatty with us while we wait. On a number of occasions, they've thrown in the coffee for free. Good for a quick breakfast spot before you crush the weekend. Just remember to check for poppy seeds in your teeth."}
{"text":"Very good if you're looking for an average bagel. Nothing like a New York bagel but probably the closest you can get in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I just hopped in this place while exploring my new area (although it's a little far from my actual 'hood) to get an iced tea and replenish those bagel carbs I missed so desperately in China. I guess timing was a little off since it was around 2 pm because there weren't a whole lot of choices and what I ended up with didn't taste incredibly fresh. I would definitely try this place again at a more normal feeding time to prove myself wrong.  In terms of sandwiches, they had some variety, but those were a little pricey."}
{"text":"Tasted just like the ones I used to eat when I lived in Upstate New York. It came with less cream cheese than it used to which is nice because it used to be to much.  Bagel was soft on the inside and had a little crunch on the outside."}
{"text":"9:45 AM on a Saturday. Super long line, and they were out of everything and sesame bagels. Out. 

When the guy finally handed me my order, the bagel was all wet. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's. Literally my favorite place to get a bagel. I may be biased because I used to work at a Bruegger's though. Anyways- every single time I'm at the airport I stop at this Bruegger's. I typically have a good experience and the food is always what I expected. Today the staff were friendly so no issues there. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the staff member that made my sandwich never wiped the knife prior to cutting my bagel. There was then cream cheese on my sandwich. I didn't say anything but I know from working at a very busy Bruegger's in Oakland many years ago it only takes a second to wipe the knife. Other than this, always a good experience. 
I usually get a make your own turkey sandwich or egg sandwich if it's breakfast time."}
{"text":"They charge a lot for a \"schemer\" of cream cheese.  You'd think they would put enough on so it could actually be tasted. I opened my bagel to see if maybe the add had been forgotten, but, no, there is was.  A film of cream cheese so thin it looked more as if the bagel had been buttered. I have eaten here many times and have never had this trouble before. Maybe this is a new policy, but, I will not eat here again to find out."}
{"text":"Well, this place used to be my favorite and now they are awful. There was a change in management maybe 1-1.5 years ago and you can really tell. The staff are now a little rude, and incredibly slow. You can have one person in front of you in line and you will definitely be waiting at least 5 minutes. Today I had the worse experience here and this is probably it for me. You can get much better bagels at Redhawk even if you can't get sandwiches.

When I went in today, it was busy, and I was waiting a bit. A staff member came in from outside and jumped right in to working. He didn't go in the back to wash his hands at all. Then he proceeds to stick an entire finger in his mouth and tried to grab gloves to start my order. When I asked him if he was going to wash his hands since he had his fingers in his mouth, he just responded \"I know. That's why I'm putting on gloves\" with such an attitude. 

I should not get a nasty attitude for asking someone who just had their fingers in their mouth right in front of me to wash their hands. This is completely unacceptable. I would definitely not recommend this location to anyone.

EDIT: The manager did call me about my feedback and was upset by the situation. She said she would deal with it immediately. I was asked if I wanted anything free, but turned that down. I am still unsure if I would return here but, I appreciated the phone call and that my feedback was taken seriously."}
{"text":"Bruegger's is Bruegger's, there no attempt at a high end faccade here.  Their staff is friendly and will know you by name if you become a regular.  The food is always good quality and on par with their pricing.  Their coffee is good and a great value as are their combos.

Hint:  on a pinch for lunch?  For a 'healthier' alternative try they whole wheat bagel & egg sandwhich loaded up with veggies."}
{"text":"Quick, convenient, clean, welcoming and reasonably priced.  This Bruegger's location is close to where I live.  Everyone there is always nice and, of course, their vast array of bagels and cream cheese are delectable!"}
{"text":"I love this Bruegger's! It's like the others in the chain so you probably either like their food or you don't. (But who doesn't like bagels?) But I find this particular Bruegger's to be exceptional. The staff is always kind and attentive, and I'm in love with their tomato caprese bagel sandwich. 

They're convenient and delicious - what more can I say or ask for?"}
{"text":"We came in with our children and were treated extremely poorly by the manager \"Jenny.\" Our toddler had a tantrum and we tried to calm her down and ended up taking her outside. As my husband was leaving I heard her exclaim something under her breath. Then my son asked for a lid for his drink and she wouldn't speak to him even though he said thank you. She was very chatty with the other customers who notably didn't have children. This is obviously not a child friendly establishment and we were not welcome there. 

As for the food, it was just okay. I had the \"skinny\" and it was obviously low calorie but I'll blame myself for that. The bagels were chewy and my son could hardly tear his with his teeth. He's five. Coffee selection includes caffeinated and decaffeinated - there are no specialty coffees. 

We're not from this area but I wouldn't come back anyway. Never insult someone's children. If you're a single adult looking to pay extra for chewy bagels with fancy names and then still make your own coffee and sit in a 55 degree restaurant then go for it. Otherwise this is a competitive market and I'm sure you can do better."}
{"text":"OK, normally for this place I'd rate a 1, I've complained to them many times about the issues all noted in other reviews. But today I'm gonna rate 3 and hope they make it back up to a 4 or 5 star.

Improvements I seen:

 1) more staff (finally) pumping out bagels and customers.. good job...
 2) more bagels in the bins (finally)  I finally had a selection to choose vs settling..good job..
 3) staff was friendly and courteous .. Good job..
 4) bagels are not as flat as they once were, improving, but needs work.. good job.

so, to get more stars here are the improvements needed:

  1) Although there were more bagels in the bin at 8:30am, volume was low and I didn't see any cooling on the racks to the left.. Keep an eye on that..But I think you got that covered..

 2) the more bagels you sell (aka: more customers you move along) the more money you make.  If some customers want to make this a social gathering with the staff and take on long winded personal conversations, stay focused on your task, still move them along quickly. Other customers don't care about your personal life..(sorry hard truth is brutal sometimes)

3) Bagels don't seem to be full shaped (as in fullness) still somewhat \"flat\" but have improved from past experiences.. see if you can improve their puffiness like a bagel should be.. but good job on working on progression..

Keep at it I'm seeking improvements. I'll finally be back again, glad I took a shot and came in this morning 8/5/17 8:30am.."}
{"text":"Great store, fresh bagels, warm welcoming environment, and nice staff. Visiting family nearby and stopped in several mornings for coffee, bagels and free wifi. Lots of locals visit and by late morning a group of seniors congregate to talk about current events. Very clean, bagels fresh and coffee hot."}
{"text":"Grabbed an early breakfast with my dad here. The guys behind the counter were so friendly and helpful ! The bagels were delicious and the service was fast plus French Toast coffee! I love it here."}
{"text":"I will totally admit it for a long time I thought Panera was king in the bagel land and drive past Bruggers - it was partly they early close hours and partly because I thought the chewy bagel was a human version of rawhide...I have evolved. 

This place has some incredible taste options and combos that you cannot get at Panera - even if you just looked at the types of cream cheese - Sriracha Honey can't go wrong, honey walnut deal, strawberry all good, garden veggie (for those plain or honey wheat bagel folks)...I mean great way to make a bagel bundle come alive some flavor and the tip of a knife. 

For the hubbs I just get 4 cinnamon raisin bagels - for the kids either the new crunchy cheddar potato one ($.60 upcharge), a blueberry or a cinnamon sugar (and haters don't start my twins are 2 ok) lol, for me the Sriracha Egg Sandwich extra red pepper extra Sriracha.  That sandwich on a Asiago Parm HR/bagel is a way to turn an entire day around - it's perfect! The sausage, the egg, that white American (let's face it no one uses that in food service and yet it's so much better that we all buy it at home) just awesome - so yeah that's my order...plus a schmear of choice depending on what's in the case (always check that first don't want tot seem like a novice). 

Remember these folks treat us super well and say good morning even when most of us prolly look like death or act nasty bc we aren't \"morning ppl\" or \"need food/coffee\" - these gate keepers deserve a smile and some serious thanks I mean they got to work about 4am for your bagel to be in your hand and PERFECT - I thank you B.B. employees because the chewy bagel is a hard learned lesson for me that it's one of love!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast sandwiches they have here - especially the Western. They also have seasonal specialty flavors of coffee that are always worth trying. My personal favorite is French toast, though you can't go wrong with the house blend. The staff is super friendly and if you come here enough, they know your order. I love coming here to study but often have trouble connecting to the wifi so don't count on that. The outside seating though usually lets you connect to other places wifi though. They also always have a great playlist playing and I find myself singing along without even realizing"}
{"text":"First time here and liking it! It is huge and offers wifi. Not sure it has more to offer than any other Brueggers, but it is a nice spot to grab some food."}
{"text":"Bruegger's is just your typical bagel shop. As a girl from NJ, I've definitely had better bagels, but it's definitely a convenient location and it doesn't taste bad! Just beware of their older bagels, they tend to become rocks overnight. 

Their prices are also a little steep for a breakfast bagel sandwich (close to 5 dollars). However, for the convenient location and the necessity of grabbing a dozen bagels for a group meeting, this is not a bad place to visit. 

If you look out for the coupons online, you can often get a few bagels for free or a coffee for cheap. One time, I got a dozen bagels for the price of one bagel. Not a bad deal at all (if you can eat all the bagels same day)."}
{"text":"LOVE their Bagels!! Great breakfast sandwiches - made with Real Eggs. My favorite is Bacon, Egg and Cheese in an Everything Bagel. 
They are always busy but the employees handle the crowds well. Very friendly employees. 
They also give a courtesy discount to airport employees. 
They also have loyalty cards - ask for one!"}
{"text":"nice friendly staff, great selections, thinking about just buying spread to put on bagels at home."}
{"text":"A simple bagel place that belongs to a chain, Bruegger's bagels are comfy and friendly.  Warm blond woods are the rule in this joint, with pleasant decor.

Bagels are made fresh, and coffee a solid, \"above average\".  Brisk, amiable service rounds out a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The employees  are very kind and sweet and efficient. The food is good.I have recently relocated here and  I finally found a breakfast bagel place!!! yay! However.....you guys need to get on board with the rest of the stores and offer the PERKA app discounts or at least a regular customer card for frequent buyers. I wish i would have know six months ago so i wouldn't have to eat Bojangle biscuits!! 
      Also I had ordered the egg and cheese sesame bagel twice and the toaster kept burning the bagel. The employee told me that it was a very OLD TOASTER and needs to be replaced. He had to push my bagel to the back in order for it not to burn. Also perhaps a local mailbox flier would let more people know you are here and that your breakfast bagels are AWESOME. Who knows....these few things could really boost your business."}
{"text":"Very friendly, good prices, delicious bagels. Nick was incredibly friendly and made our visit exceptional."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, the tables are always full or have crumbs on them which I understand because it is packed in the morning. Only thing that is off to me are the prices. 1 bagel with mayo, provolone and turkey is around 5 dollars. I highly recommended Brooklyn Water Bagel where they load your bagel up and make it worth five dollars."}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time on a whim 2 weeks ago, just hoping they had some vegan options available; luckily most of their bagels are vegan and it's currently guacamole season

The customer service was lacking a bit on my first visit, but has improved on each of my subsequent visits, which shamefully has been about 6 times since then and I'm more addicted to the onion bagel with guac each time I get it. 

Unfortunately the guacamole will be taken off the menu in September when they roll out their fall promotions so hopefully I'll be able to find a substitute that's still vegan.  

Looking forward to many more visits here"}
{"text":"Maybe I am a bagel snob - but coming from NY/NJ I think I am entitled to be so. These bagels are something that would come out of the freezer - small, overly doughy/chewy, and no flavor. Oh and if you want to get an egg sandwich - be ready for a pre-made egg that comes out of the microwave. I mean really - how long does it take to put an egg on the grill - a whole whopping 3 minutes. Are we that lazy that we need to nuke our eggs. Never again - I rather eat cold cereal (with no milk) from the hotel."}
{"text":"Being from New York, I grew up on bagel's similar to how many southerners grew up on biscuits.  So, I was more than relieved to discover that this Bruegger's was in the area and not far from my residence.  

Though I've had their bagel lunch sandwiches on many occasions, lately I seem to get there in the morning hours for breakfast - especially on the weekends.  I usually go with the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a bagel of my choosing  Their bagels are all good to me, so I usually make my decision based upon what is hot at that particular time - just look for the signs on the bagel bins. 

It has been my experience that a slight crowd can develop here later in the mornings usually between 10 - 11am, so I usually try to get there before then.  But even if you get stuck in a bit of rush - no worries!  The attendants are usually very prompt in their service and get you in and out as quickly as possible.  There is plenty of parking in the plaza and as another reviewer has stated, once upon a time they had free wi-fi though I do not know if this is still the case. 

If you live anywhere in north Charlotte or near the University Area, I really do not know where you are going to find a better bagel option than Bruegger's.  If you are an implanted northerner as many of us are, and you suddenly have a craving for a taste of home, Bruegger's is definitely a viable option."}
{"text":"Went in today at 7:50 (they open at 6am!!) and they told me they weren't open yet because they got a \"late start\". I wish I could say that to my patients at work if I decided to sleep in and show up to work late!! Totally unprofessional, won't be going back again, if you don't have to do your job why should you have business?"}
{"text":"Place is  decent enough for the price. Bagels aren't the best. Ordered everything bagel. It was undercooked and had very few seeds"}
{"text":"Very unfriendly staff and very dirty. Waiting at the counter and several of the staff walked up and looked at us but said nothing, most just standing around. Several minutes before anyone came over to help. The facility and the bathrooms were very dirty - which is funny because several of the ones who didn't help were \"cleaning\""}
{"text":"I ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese (the truest test).  Fortunately for me, mine was just out of the oven and tasted very good.  It did appear that the more exotic bagels may not have been as fresh as mine, so your experience may differ."}
{"text":"Let it be known that I am the biggest Bruegger's fan ever.  I've been a pretty steady once-a-weeker since childhood.

After all that...This is the worst Bruegger's ever.  I always think: Oh, I'm close by and it'll be fine this time.  Nope.  The staff is awful.  The bagel are stale.  The staff is so awful they don't know that the bagels are stale.

Protect your brand, Bruegger's, and get a new staff for this location."}
{"text":"Food is really good, service is good. Couple of tables could have used some wiping down when I got there, would have received a 5 if they had been."}
{"text":"Repeated my order 3 times and it still got screwed up. I had a feeling something was going to be off and sure enough...."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home. My favorite? The sesame with butter! There may be a line, but don't fret, you'll be on your way in no time!"}
{"text":"I generally don't write reviews of chains, because let's face it, you generally get what you expect at a chain. That is kind of the \"safety\" of chain eating. However, I am making an exception for this location of Brueggars. I come here regularly and the service is always friendly and upbeat. The manager (possibly owner) is almost always working, either making the sandwiches or ringing people up, or both. On slow days, he will chat up customers in a warm, welcoming manner. On busy days, he works in a hurried manner but still manages to be friendly. And I assume his employees like him and the work environment because there seems to be little employee turnover and they are also very nice and smiley whether or not he is around. The tables are always clean, something that I notice since many chains don't seem to bother to clean off tables much. 

Outside is a pretty little patio with plants and flowers, which helps soften up the sitting area. Nice place to sip your coffee when weather allows. I am a personal fan of the seasonal iced coffee. It's Coconut right now. Sea Salt and Caramel a couple months ago.

I do enjoy that Brueggars switched from pre-prepared eggs, to fresh cracked eggs. Makes a world of difference in taste. Put one of those eggs on a skinny rosemary bagel and swiss cheese...yum. Oh yeah...any bagel you want \"skinny\" can be made on the spot. They just slice out the middle along with several carbs and calories. I actually prefer it skinny because it's easier to eat. 

So there you have it. They should call this location Better than Brueggars."}
{"text":"The bagels are good but the cleanliness is very poor. The cutting boards have been sliced in them with black colored buildup and the boards are no longer white but a brown color. Also, the girl would cut the bagels then clean the knife off in a dirty cloth that was covered in crumbs, etc and didn't look like it had been cleaned in a while."}
{"text":"Confused on how to word this review as I had a bad experience but my friends have had many positive experiences with Bruegger's. I went on a Saturday around 11am. 

The food- I ordered the siracha blues bagel guy and I was very excited. Sadly the person who made mine was very flustered and didn't put any of the ingredients on the bagel other than chicken and cheese. There was no siracha or blue cheese or lettuce or anything. So my bagel was dry and boring. The chicken was also very cartilage-y. 

The line process is confusing and unorganized as each worker makes a bagel from start to finish and there was about 6 of them. Usually at places with assembly line food ordering 2-3 people help build one bagel so it's an assembly line process and you move down the line and you're use to it. Here they were shouting at people in line to move forward but people were so confused because it appeared as though they had to cut people to order their bagel.

My friends have had amazing bagels here and compared the environment and style to Tim Hortons of Canada! I plan to give it another go."}
{"text":"Bruegger's is fine, not a bad spot.  People are attentive, place is clean.  Food is warm, coffee is hot, bagels are bagels.

Sriracha Honey Sunrise - no spice at all, very sweet.  The cream cheese is good but it kind of mutes the taste of the eggs and bacon, if you can imagine.  I didn't taste the sriracha; could have dialed that up a bit, even for someone like me that can't handle much spice.

Smoked Salmon (on a wheat everything bagel) - My husband described it as \"pretty okay\"; whatever that means. :)"}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to my beloved Bruegger's...and let me preface this by saying I used to work at a Bruegger's location in Ohio when I was younger so I feel like I know how it can and should be.

When I first moved to the area many years ago this location was pretty decent and seemed on par with other Bruegger's in the US. But the quality of food has gone so far downhill I don't think I will be back to this location and that is really hard to say as a previous big fan of their food. 

Went today for a few things and all of the bagels were in this oblong, smashed down shape. It was hard for the guy to even cut the bagel to put it in the toaster, that's how thin it was. After running it through the toaster, he throws the smallest bit of cream cheese on it. Had to ask for more. So I think it's at least kind of warm. Upon paying, I reach for it and it's stone cold. Not sure what the toaster was doing but it did not actually toast or warm anything. 

Ordered a breakfast sandwich as well for a family member. On an oblong, smashed bagel. The bacon was pretty uncooked. What they now call egg I guess is this extremely sad looking egg white patty that is really slimy. Did not ask for egg white only. Then some cheese on top. The bacon, egg and cheese didn't even cover the bagel due to the shape. Half of it got thrown out at home. It was pretty inedible. 

Makes me really sad to state all of the above. I was hoping this location would turn it around but I am feeling more and more hopeless."}
{"text":"This is one of the friendliest Bruegger's I've ever been to. The cashier always make conversation with you whenever you're waiting to get your food! I'm sure you all know what bagels taste like, so I won't go into excessive details about them. But I absolutely recommend trying their smoked salmon bagel (comes with cream cheese, capers, onions, and tomatoes). It is the yummiest bagel and it's a great kick start for your day!"}
{"text":"After craving a good bagel for a while (there are no bagel shops near me) we chose to stop here while we were out of town for an event. It was no mistake! I got an asiago bagel with veggie cream cheese, which was good but I have had better. My better half got a spinach parmesan bagel made into a turkey Chipotle club that he said was very tasty. I think the issue we ran into was that the bagels were kind of tough which I believe to be caused by sitting out all day as we got there about an hour before they closed. Kind of a bummer, but still delicious. I would love to try them again when the bagels are fresher!"}
{"text":"A massive thank you to this bagel place. There was a group of 10 runners that were supposed to have a water stop set up nearby that wasn't there. The staff very kindly gave us water which made a 17 mile training run much more pleasant. Thank You and I will definitely be patronizing this shop and sending others as well!"}
{"text":"Terrible service slow line love the food hate the wait. Perhaps train to be more efficient. Instead of standing around maybe they could help the next person."}
{"text":"The staff is always pleasant when I stop in to grab my morning coffee.  I've recently been into their egg white skinny bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"I just don't know how this place is still in existence, the bagels are the worst, plain and simple.  I tried several different bagels and they're just not good and the spreads aren't much better.  I only come over when I come across a coupon and it's not even worth the time then........."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Their softwich bagels are great bread. Overall the bagels aren't the best but their cream cheese, toppings and options make up for it."}
{"text":"Bruegger's Bagels is now my new favorite bagel place! They have fairly sized bagels for a decent price, and the veggies taste fresh. Additionally, the manager is nice and service is good. 

Besides plain bagels with cream cheese, their menu does not have many vegetarian/pescatarian options. I asked if they could replace the meat for some veggies in one of their breakfast bagels, and I was told there would be an additional charge (really?! Even though veggies are cheaper than meat?!). Other bagel places I've been to will gladly substitute veggies in place of meat for free. 

I ordered a Leonardo da Veggie, which was a delicious, big bagel that I only ate half of. I also got a free bagel (courtesy of a Yelp deal - take advantage of it!) and ordered Smoked Salmon cream cheese on an Everything bagel, which I actually enjoyed more than the Leonardo da Veggie. 

I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I always love it when I have time for a bagel in the Pittsburgh airport. Bruegger's are some of the best!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, almost like a subway type place."}
{"text":"This is another one of my favorite bagel places in Madison. A little less known than Gotham and Einstein, but I'm pretty sure it's better than Einstein and up to bar with Gotham. 

I love how Bruegger's isn't just about the bagels. Their bagels and spreads are unique, and their signature bagel sandwiches are indeed hearty, fresh, and delicious. In addition, the breakfast menu is awesome and both their sandwiches and paninis are great as well. 

For coffee lovers, buy the bottomless mug. You can free refills for coffee the whole year."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. I've gone here for years and have never had a bad experience.  The dining area could be a bit bigger, but overall this place is great.  The hours of operation are perfect and the location is convenient.  Nice area as well"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were OK, but something felt \"off.\" Majority of the employees seemed upset about something. The lady who made our food looked like she hates her life."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Bruegger's. As a New Yorker, this is the best a girl in Pittsburgh is getting to a real bagel. 

I think everyone who works at this location is so friendly. Especially with the amount of students that come through and sometimes the long lines, they always have a smile on their faces and a positive attitude. It is also clean, which is surprising with the amount of people coming through. It's the best place to sit, read a book, or study!

I have an obsession for the Chai Tea, which I find to be priced pretty well. I really can't get enough!!"}
{"text":"Service is always fast, the employees are always nice and pleasant, and the food is always good.  I miss the Chai Tea machine they got rid of about a year ago - I wish it would come back!

Not the best bagels in the whole wide world, but solid!"}
{"text":"If you like chicken salad you won't be disappointed with their chicken tarragon bagel sandwich! Their bagels are soft and chewy and they have a great selection of cream cheese! A little pricey for a bagel shop but worth it!"}
{"text":"The inside is much nicer than the outside! It's hard to see unless you're already IN the parking lot of the (ugly brown) strip mall, but I have no complaints about this location. They had my favorite kind of bagel and the service was good. Clean, fast, did the job.

Siracha egg sandwich on a rosemary/olive oil bagel -- DO IT."}
{"text":"Not the best Bruegger's, but it is in an airport, so what do you expect? It has been hit or miss for me. 

PS: I always order the siracha egg sandwich on a rosemary bagel. The rosemary bagels are the reason I go to Bruegger's at all, and in my opinion they are significantly better than any other bagel there."}
{"text":"For the savvy couponer, this is an awesome breakfast shop. Approximately 1 in 3 receipts have a \"review us and get 3 free bagels\" survey. Including the receipts for the free bagels. And their bottomless coffee club is awesome."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly at this location. I love the create your own salad option, and the produce is always fresh. Skinny bagels have become quite the trend, and Brueggers does it justice. At times, the coffee can be mediocre, but the bagels are always fresh, and Brueggers really is a Pittsburgh staple. A skinny zesty egg white breakfast sandwich is the perfect way to go for a lite breakfast."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and very polite and fast. Barnyard was amazing! Chorizo jack was awesome and bagels were extremely fresh too!"}
{"text":"Next time I'm going to the McDonald's next door. Egg and bacon were heated up in a microwave. Egg was greenish, bacon was fatty and chewy...."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week to get a bagel bunch for the office.  There were 2 workers at the cash register, one for filling coffee ( I guess), the other ringing up sales.  Then they had one person down at the end taking/filling orders for everything from bagel bunches to breakfast sandwiches, to single bagels.  There was a line 6 or 7 people deep and this one poor worker trying to keep up, while the two down at the other end were kind of hanging out.  I walked up to the cashier and asked if I could order a bagel bunch from her, since she was not doing anything and could easily walk down to end and grab bagels.  She told me she could not, that I would have to wait in the line.  Since I was in a hurry I left and went over to Panera (right around the corner) and was in/out in less than 5 min.  

I like Brueggers but they really need to operate more efficiently."}
{"text":"Just an average bagel shop chain. I've been to a couple of them and the good thing this place has compared to the others is that it is spacious, that means if you plan to sit in and enjoy your bagel/breakfast/snack you can do that. 

We were there at 10am on a weekday and the staff was on top of our order. We had our breakfast sandwiches in 5 minutes, with a lot of attention given to our customizations.

One thing I missed was the Jalapeño Cheddar bagel, which is my regular go to bagel, but the remaining bagels were fresh. You know the bagels are fresh when they have a \"hot\" sign next to them. Don't forget to keep that in mind next time you visit this chain.

+space
+cleanliness
+attention to order detail
-not a lot of options for bagels when we visited (I've seen more at some of their other locations)
-lady at the register was clueless about the orders (had to explain your entire order second time)"}
{"text":"Great food great people great everything overall... only thing i would say that is negative is the line is extremely long very fast...i come early just to avoid it."}
{"text":"Every time I head down this way for grocery shopping I'll stop here afterwards for one of their Smoked Salmon bagel sandwiches. They don't skimp on the lox which is the way it should be. They also have a large parking lot next to them so you don't have to deal with parking on the street like other places. I also enjoy that they have a glass wall on one side so you can see them making the bagels!"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by anything exceptional here, but I had a nice lunch of the Smoked Salmon Bagel Sandwich and a sparking water. I had wanted to get a cup of their broccoli cheddar soup also but they were out, which was fine since it was warm out and I guess I didn't really need it... but you'd think they wouldn't already be out by only noon. 

I will give them props for putting the nutrition information on their website. It's super thorough and I think that's great. I'll probably come back if it's lunchtime and I'm hungry and shopping at the mall area it's in."}
{"text":"The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is the parking. There needs to be a better system in this area, and if there was a dedicated lot for this place, I would be there all the time. Other than this one annoyance, this place is really nice. The ladies behind the counter have always been lovely, and the Smoked Salmon bagel sandwich is definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"Had the cinnamon sugar bagel with strawberry jam. Bagel was a little too chewy for me. The chocolate chip cookie was good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is my last time going to this location. They are consistently very very slow with high turnover and brand new employees every week. Not enough people working either and the line was to the door at 9:15 am. Management must be poor to continue to allow this all of the time. There is always one poor employee who is fast and efficient who has to cover for the rest who are super slow. But that doesn't work too well...which causes long lines. Too bad."}
{"text":"Great combo of Bruegger's and Caribou...one stop shop. Free wifi and lots of business going on inside. I think I was one of the few without a laptop that day.

The employees are friendly! This is a great Bruegger's location and you don't have to feel guilty taking a long lunch break here because you can easily bring work here. They also offer a conference room to book for those out-of-the-office-private-meetings."}
{"text":"I found the staff very friendly and welcoming and my sandwich (Leonardo DaVeggie) and pickle delicious.  The iced tea was also very fresh.  I would not hesitate to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I agree...parking nightmare.  Would be better if you walked here.  Also do not attempt to go here on a Saturday or Sunday if you don't like long lines."}
{"text":"Got two of our four orders wrong. Line was not very long but servers move at snail's pace. Server not very generous with amounts of cream cheese. Probably most disturbing was server touching her face, scratching an itch or wiping away sweat, which kind of defeats the purpose of the plastic gloves."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bagel shop - this one is quite small, so seating is limited. There are four 5-top tables and two 2-tops, but lots of parties if one or two grab the big tables first. 

Service is good and the food meets my expectation, so it's good and appears fairly fresh and properly prepared."}
{"text":"So dirty let's start with that.  First time going there and thought it would be good for a company luncheon.  Service was poor but that is not the issue.  How dirty it was and cross contamination made me walk out. The  cutting boards that they make your food on are beyond dirty. Hello bleach and sanitizing! What made it even worse was the supervisor came over and cleaned it with a dirty rag. So nasty! P.s no glove changes when they touch something gross then your food. I hope the health board stops by to visit. If you don't want a food illness don't go to this dirty place ! I am embarrassed iris in Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Decent bagel place inside the airport.

Grabbed a quick smoked salmon bagel and fruit cup.

Bagel was adequate with enough cream cheese and salmon to be filling. Fruit seemed fresh.

What can you do? Not many good food options here."}
{"text":"A decent place to hang out on weekend mornings. Decent coffee, tasty bagels, and so-so bagel sandwiches. I've tried several of their sandwiches and been disappointed, but I'd still recommend this location overall. Try the upstairs seating; it's divine."}
{"text":"After shopping at The Fresh Market, I make a pit stop here to get a cup of coffee and use their free Wi-Fi while waiting for my friend to give me a ride. Bought their sleeve of 6 bagels and it was good. Like the cheese bagel and everything bagel there.

Nothing compares to bagels made in New York City. Bruegger's Bagels is a nice eatery. They have a good selection of items to choose from."}
{"text":"had a honey wheat bagel toasted with pecan honey cream cheese. very fresh. fast service. will go again for sure"}
{"text":"Ok I am giving 5 stars because they have the best Bagels around. Now the bad news. These guys used to make a Jalapeños Bagel that was to die for. The Jalapeños were baked into the Bagel.  You had to get them early because they were sold out all the time... Even the store manager was like we just can't keep them on the shelf..... So what do you do when you have a product that ROCKS and you can't keep it on the shelf?? You discontinue it and offer Jalapeños cream cheese and tell you its the same!  Guess what! Its not!!  Bring back my Bagel; please!

But for what is offered it is still the best."}
{"text":"Most incredible staff I've ever seen. Make you feel like a friend and a valuable customer. Will go above and beyond to make your visit an experience to remember! Food is also terrific."}
{"text":"Decent Bruegger's located near the Pitt campus on Forbes. As such, it tends to be pretty busy during most parts of the day & a little less clean than most locations. They do have your standard sets of bagels, sandwiches, cream cheese, and stuff that you can take to go or eat in, assuming you have the time to sit in & do so (most do not). A suitable option for breakfast and lunch. I would go somewhere else for dinner though since I don't think this place is open during the hours that most would eat dinner at."}
{"text":"Bruegger's is my reliable breakfast spot in the South Side. Always great choices for the carb lovers, dependable and friendly wait staff and a clean environment. My favorite order is a cinnamon sugar bagel toasted with cream cheese and either an iced coffee or a chai. The chai is from a bag (premade), which is a little disappointing - but if I want house made there are other coffee shops along the street.
The staff here is always accommodating and friendly - and you can't beat their delicious breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times, but I had an exceptional experience this weekend that I just had to share.  I was across the street at the Southside Food, Art & Sidewalk Fest when I decided the (finally) hot weather called for a nice iced tea.  I went inside and asked if they had iced tea, preferably green.  The one gal behind the counter said they have regular iced tea, which I was fine with, until the other employee chimed in and said \"if you want green tea, I can make it for you!\"  She actually went out of her way and took the time to steep some hot green tea for me and then put it over ice.  She said it's not on their menu, but she also loves green tea and has perfected the art of iced green tea while working there.  I know it's not an experience that everyone will have there, but I was so grateful and impressed with her offer!  Both employees were super pleasant and receiving this kind of service will definitely inspire me to frequent Bruegger's more often!"}
{"text":"The bagels are generally decent, but the service has never been quick. Normally, I don't mind waiting, but after waiting in line for ten minutes today, the two employees working the front decided that would be a good time to inform everyone in the store that they couldn't take any credit or debit, cash only. Now, I realize this isn't their fault, but that should probably be conveyed to everyone that walks in. My 2 singles weren't going to be able to purchase a $5 sandwich. Just a frustrating lack of communication."}
{"text":"My frustration varies from store to store. I'll go to the Pineville location and the staff is very attentive and friendly. I've been to this (University Charlotte) location several times, the usual guy, Logan, is very friendly. However, three times I've been here and an older man has served me, seems less interested in customer service and more interested in speed. Last time I was in he finished my bagels and wrapped them, tried to hand them to me without saying anything to me or looking at me. I asked if he could place them in a bag and he said \"no we hand them to you, the cashier can bag them up front\"... Confused as several locations and many people at this location have no problem bagging the bagels before handing them to me.

The last time I was in, same guy, same inattentiveness. And it appears based on how he talks to the staff that he is in a management role now, attitude reflects leadership. It looks like I'm in the market for a new bagel place, a shame because Bacon Scallion cream cheese on a Sun-dried bagel was my go-to start to my day."}
{"text":"I love this place, best service and best bagels. Their staff are always friendly. They have the best coffee, and it's always fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by to redeem a coupon for a big bagel bundle. Staff was very friendly, there was a large selection of bagels and cream cheese, and I had no problem redeeming the coupon.

My only complaint is that they make the bagels with large holes in the center so they are worthless for  bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"Prices and food quality vary from visit to visit.  No consistency.  If food is going to be expensive at least make sure it's hot."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good bagel. I signed up for there email so I got a coupon got a free bagel. The staff was very friendly and my order didn't take long prepare. I went with a cheese bagel lightly toasted with jalapeño cream cheese. The beagle was very good. It was warm, soft, chewy, and toasting it gave it just the right amount of crunch. It has been some time since I've been to a Bruggers and I might just need to stop by more often."}
{"text":"Needed some breakfast while I was stopping through this airport. It was the only thing that had anything breakfasty. Located in the food court area of the airport, you can get pretty much anything on their menu at any time of the day. I got the egg/sausage wrap as I don't really care for bagels... too many carbs! Lots of seating around so that you can sit down and eat your food before you run off to your flight. Free wifi!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since 2006 when our office relocated to this area. I have always enjoyed excellent service from the staff and management. I visit at least 2 times a day. One thing I couldn't and still can't  understand is why they continue to have the turn over in staff especially management. These are people who make your day and have brought a smile to my face whenever I've had a bad day. I would hire any number of them at any time. I have driven past other locations just because I enjoy the atmosphere and staff at this location. No longer. Their most recent management change has left the place without a soul. It's a change that you can sense  and see ( they did  some lite remodeling)  when you walk in the door. This was the day after her abrupt departure. This individual was always here to fill in for staff or to make sure the place was taken care of. She was here in the snow storm this year. Amazing right? 
I'm a bottomless member and got ten people from work to buy them from here bc I enjoyed this place and it's service. 
I will not be getting one next year and doubt I will frequent as much in the future. It's not the same! As I'm wiping down my own table to sit down, it is quiet and lacks the laughter,  smiles, and business I have always appreciated. 
A lesson  for senior management and owners to take to heart. Take care of your most important assets your staff! 
I hope to see a turn around but in the weeks since the change I have seen only one thing a decrease in the service and quality I've come to expect. At this time I can no longer promote this place as one I'd recommend to friends or coworkers"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Bruegger's Bagels shop and I thought it was a good experience. Only giving it 4 stars because I am used to the amazing bagels of Bagel Jay's here in my hometown but Bruegger's Bagels is the next best thing in my opinion! The bagels were fresh and the atmosphere of the place was welcoming in a read-your-Sunday-paper kind of way. Customer service was friendly. Music was obnoxious and distracting, though. Too loud and not relaxing enough for the environment."}
{"text":"Always bustling with regulars, this little breakfast joint consistently serves up excellent bagels (as confirmed by my Brooklyn friends) and a great, ever-changing variety of piping hot coffees which include seasonal treats such as pumpkin spice and toasted coconut. 

I usually purchase the everything bagel toasted with bacon, egg and cheese. It's the peppered bacon (after the bagel itself) that makes it special! They also serve up pretty nice lunch bagels.

Service is consistently friendly and sanitary rating is accepable hanging around 92-95. Been eating here for 18 years which speaks for itself. The other two south Charlotte bagel places that have comparably authentic NY bagels are Brooklyn Water Bagels and Poppy's Bagels, of which Poppy's, in my opinion, is the best overall."}
{"text":"Attitudes every time and slow service. Made to feel like an idiot every time I order here. Manager and workers both huff and puff as you order as if they don't want you there. Sanitation rating is 90 as well. Needs better management."}
{"text":"Roast beef ripoff ...

The staff here are very friendly and I've bought bagels for the office here a couple of times - everything is fresh and tasty. But, I went to grab a quick sandwich today and will not be going back for any reason in the future. 

I paid $5.49 for what they call a Deli Sandwich - since a single bagel costs 99 cents, you would expect a reasonable amount of meat for the additional $4.49 - instead, I got back to the office and found 2 small slices of roast beef and some shreds from someone else's slices composed about a 1/4 inch thick layer of meat. I immediately thought of the old slogan \"Where's the beef?\" but this was such a paltry portion, it really wasn't funny.

Since most chains set portion sizes, someone at this shop made the decision that it's okay to shortchange their customers. It's a shame, but I'm avoiding this shop and am warning others of the practice."}
{"text":"This location is always poppin in the morning from the uptown rush, but they are always pretty fast. They have a good selection of bagels and they always seems to be fresh and in-stock. My go to options are: 

1: blueberry bagel with strawberry smear
2: everything bagel with veggie smear 

You can't go wrong with these- trust me. I've tried the cinnamon sugar bagel, but nothing compares to Panera's version. 

Also if you're a coffee person they offer hot and iced coffee in a couple of flavors: regular, hazelnut, French TOAST, dark roast and vanilla (on rotation). I had the ice coffee today and it was surprisingly really good! It had a chocolate hint to it. I'll be sure to be back to get it again!"}
{"text":"Safest Place in Cornelius

You know the old joke about the Donut Shop being the safest place because that is where the police and fire always hand out?  In the case of Cornelius, that is Bruegger's Bagels.

That said, it is a popular place and they do a great job or honoring those who serve their community so no problem with that. Wish more places would do the same.

In anycase, about once a month, I'll stop by on the way to work in the morning and pick up a couple dozen bagles or mixed vareities and multiple cream cheese toppings.

The employee's love them and to be honest, so do I.

They are always fresh and plentiful and the staff courteous and helpful.

Looking to reward employee's or even yourself, not a bad stop."}
{"text":"We love Bruegger's Bagels and we drive out of our way to get to this one because, it is not only roomier than the closer Pineville location, it is also considerably cleaner. In fact, we have effectively boycotted the Pineville location because of its consistently subpar sanitary grade... but enough of that... on to the bagels!

My wife and I always eat here for breakfast only and go with the toasted everything bagel with their excellent bacon, egg and muenster.   Their bagels are some of the best around as is their coffee. Unfortunately this location however lacks both the variety and the convenience of self-serve offered by the other location. Our server was also somewhat surly and uninterested. They got us though 'cause we love their bagels and will take surly over dirty any day."}
{"text":"I was in town working on a project, and stumbled into this place looking for a cup of coffee. I noticed their bagels looked amazing, and the prices seemed reasonable. 

Normally I check Yelp before I try new places, but this trip I had zero extra time, so I just went where ever was closest. I am glad I did not look at their previous reviews, because those are some petty assed reviews. I did not experience ANY of those grievances.

When my assistant and I walked in, we were greeted on the first day by a very friendly girl who patiently waited while I decided on which of the many choices I was to select. I ordered the spinach/egg/cheese everything bagel for $3.49. Freaking delicious (slightly too salty, but I am sensitive to that kind of thing). 

My friend purchased the bacon egg and cheese bagel, and she ate hers faster than I ate mine, so had to be as good or better.

Medium coffee $2.19. Very good.

So good in fact, that even though I was late going to the airport the next day, I HAD to stop in and get a repeat. On the second day, I was greeted by an extremely friendly young man, who was just delightful. 

The entire place was spotless.

The manager was extremely friendly, as well. I could not have asked for a better experience."}
{"text":"I will be here every time I'm in the area. So wonderful. The workers were very nice and funny! 
A great and varying choice of bagels. I had the herby turkey with the rosemary & olive oil bagel. 
This is the best bagel sandwich ever. I had their coffee as well. Very good.
I'm not from around here but I will make it a point to stop in when I'm around."}
{"text":"The number of bagel stores in Pittsburgh has declined over the last five to ten years, but thank God for Brueggers.  It's the one place in Pittsburgh where I feel as though I'm getting authentic New York style bagels.  And it's one of the last bagel shops in Pittsburgh to serve SALT bagels.  Yea, I know they're bad for me, but they are so damn tasty!  

The staff is quick but friendly.  The selection can be thin if you get there after 9.00a but I certainly prefer limited options to bagels that might not be as fresh."}
{"text":"This is a frequent stop for me on any given morning of the work week. It's two streets away from the office I work in, and they have awesome coffee. I am a big fan of their egg and cheese bagels, and their hazelnut coffee is TO DIE for!! Service is always really friendly and they are super efficient."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!! Managers are rude to the workers and the customers. The only thing that keeps me coming is my kids like the bagels. Eventually I won't step in the building ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Still horrible 1/2 star needed should be given . Rude it's not just the management now everyone works slower. The sandwiches are terrible. Nothing made fresh. YUCK! Never will go back!"}
{"text":"Same food as any other Bruegger's combined with exceptionally slow service.  You have to wait forever to get your food, and then wait forever more to pay because they never have anyone at the register. If you want to wait in two lines for food, come here; you will not be disappointed.

PS: manager was complaining how nobody cleaned the night before and the restaurant was disgusting - nice added bonus.

PSS: received email from business stating: 

\"Hi Matt
  I want to apologize for the long wait at the Brueggers Market Square yesterday. I had two calls off in the morning which caused the extra long wait. I am in the process of hiring some dependable morning people, so hopefully this issue will be resolved soon.
 
Kathy Livingston                 
General Manager
Robin Dreher            
Assistant Manager
 
Bruegger's Bagel Bakery
Market Square
412.281.2515\"

Nice, but I was there and all the employees wandered around without paying attention to customers; when there are more employees behind the counter than customers in front, and everyone is doing nothing, staffing is not the issue. Basically, stay away until they resolve their issues; cleanliness and efficiency are still a future hope, not a current achievement."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. We've had trouble with Bruggers before but decided to give them another chance. Terrible organization of staff. No communication among them which resulted in a very long line of customers forming and waiting. Finally got served by a girl who was extremely rude and had no interest I was bringing my business there. Note to managers: hire people who are excited to work for you. It will bring customers back. Bagel was good but over 20 minutes for a bagel is not ok. That combined with lousy staff mean I'll be going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"The businessman in front of me and I had to wait quite a while for the employee to come back to sell us bagels, and then she was grouchy and almost silent throughout. So that was weird.  On the bright side, Bruegger's has decent quality bagels for pretty cheap, and they don't drive up their prices just because you're trapped in the airport. A normal bagel, toasted with cream cheese, is under $4, and sandwiches are under $7, which isn't a bad deal.

I'll take less-than-enthusiastic service in exchange for cheap airport grub. Not a bad place for a pre-flight snack."}
{"text":"The people at this Bruegger's were much friendlier than the ones I'm used to visiting in the Philadelphia area.

My food was served quickly and tasted fine. You won't be disappointed, but it's nothing spectacular.

The friendly employees and the good food are two reasons why you should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"The bagels are good - the line in the mornings can get a little long, especially when one person is running the register.  I wish they would not be so skimpy with the cream cheese.  Coffee is average."}
{"text":"I haven't seen one of these in quite a while.  They still have great fresh bagels."}
{"text":"As much as I'd love to give a higher star rating, I just cannot. We ordered 2 salt bagels, along with other items, and they were so salty they were pretty much inedible. I said something to the manager about how salty they were as I ordered another (plain) bagel and his response was \"They're yummy right?\" So clearly he wasn't listening to what I said. We live out of state and loved going to the BB near our previous home near Milwaukee but this trip was disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is generally clean. Bagels are fresh and sometimes you can get a bundle off bagels at a lower price. Bruegger's cream cheese are pretty decent, too. Coffee is okay. I wouldn't say it is cheap, because special recipe bagel sandwich can go quite pricy for just a breakfast."}
{"text":"Still not much to get excited about here.  But I'm taking the day off in order to get some stuff down around the house, and Brueggers is right around the corner, I thought I'd stop in & get a quick breakfast and coffee.  

The egg white & sundried tomato sandwich was definitely different and it didn't have that prefab taste that some breakfast sandwiches have.  Plus one star for the hot bagel they served it on.  It was s-o-o-o good on a cold late March morning (and what the !@#$ is up with this winter weather we've been having around here?  Isn't baseball season supposed to be starting next week?).  Coffee here is much improved, what with the Green Mountain Coffee they're now serving here. I like that it's Fair Trade Certified.  Anyone who knows me knows my motto is \"Fair Trade, not Free Trade.\""}
{"text":"2.5 Stars!

Snuck out from work this morning to get a good second cup of coffee.  Remember folks, a caffeinated supervisor is a happy supervisor and thus she's kind to her minions!

Bagels here are so-so, but Bruegger's has decent coffee."}
{"text":"I have been going here since the 90's when I was a little girl. Their bagels are THE best and I have never had a problem with service here. My family goes there about three times a month and we have never had a problem!"}
{"text":"A solid, standard Bruegger's! Consistently decent food, clean, and the windows make the inside feel very cozy! My only complaint is that there sometimes can be a policy/communication issue with refills? Sometimes they are free, other times they'll be anywhere from $1 to the cost of a small drink. Not a big deal, but could be nice to make sure all employees are aware of whatever the correct refill policy is so no one gets under/overcharged."}
{"text":"I've driven past here so many times I finally stopped. Actually it was the day after Thanksgiving and the cafeteria at my office was closed so I needed some lunch. 

I had the beef and cheddar with caramelized onions. It was VERY good. The caramelized onions are very strong. Prices are pretty reasonable too. 

Service was excellent and the place was spotless!"}
{"text":"Most of the time out of the flavor of bagel someone in my party wants.  The staff is always friendly though."}
{"text":"Went in there this morning for a cup of coffee. Just a cup of coffee, nothing major. Didn't expect to be treated like an idiot by the GM. I think his name was Jason. Condescending you know what.  I just wanted a cup of coffee. The man embarrassed me. I' not likely to ever go here again."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but as most have said as of lately the staff is kind of rude.  Also the place was mess for how slow they were."}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is good. But the place is filthy!! I can't believe how dirty the place is. I've witnessed the staff touching their face and money and dirty towels with their gloved hands then just go back to touching people's food with the same gloves still!! The management seems very awful, if they even have any at all. Just be on the look out for that!"}
{"text":"This was my first time being here so I don't know a lot about the menu, however, one bagel sold me."}
{"text":"This brueggers is top notch.  Always professional and they do an amazing job.  Worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"Bagels here are typically very good.  Love the everything, sesame, onion, and cinnamon raisin.  Only complaint is that the workers sometimes oversleep and many of the bagel varieties are not available first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"Usually a very good chain but this location seems to run out of bagels frequently. Not sure if this is a management problem or an employee problem but needs to be addressed..this is a bagel place have bagels."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful sandwich at Bruegger's bagels! What was more impressive though was the experience and the staff... they were very friendly and the woman running the cash register(Jan) went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Downtown Pittsburgh on such a nice day! Having to kill an hr, and close to lunch time. I walked passed Bruegger's. 
It was empty at first but within a few minutes the much crowed started pouring in. Located next to Oxford Building great for business breakfast or lunch. 
The bagels were Great! My granddaughter loved hers !! 
Highly recommend the bagel egg & cheese with sausage !!"}
{"text":"I'm all about a good cup of joe with my bagel. Bagels are amazing here, but don't order the iced coffee if you like to add sugar or any kind of sweetener. They add ice to the plain black coffee in front of you, so it's cold, hand it to you, and then you add your own sweetener and milk/cream if you'd like afterwards. It's strange cause I've never ordered iced coffee anywhere that just gives it to you black. Adding sugar to iced coffee doesn't mix well and just goes to the bottom of the cup, and unless you ask them to leave room so you can add milk/cream, it just gets messy having to pour it out yourself. It honestly doesn't make for a good iced coffee."}
{"text":"CLOSED!

I had a few minutes this morning and was so excited to stop by Bruegger's. How sad I was to see that they are gone. The place is cleaned out, signage and all. There is no evidence the place was ever there! [frown face] Now there is nowhere in the west shore suburbs to get a bagel made the authentic way."}
{"text":"I ordered a honey grain bagel sliced and toasted with strawberry cream cheese and a coconut iced coffee. I really dislike super hard/tough bagels but this one was perfect! Staff was friendly and helpful as I was a new patron! Pretty yummy! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Chain bagel shop - decent bagel. Chewy and not as dense as your typical bagel. Lots of cream cheese and sandwich options."}
{"text":"Does it really matter which part of the counter a paying customer orders at? It does here and they will make sure that everyone in the building hears it as they tell you the rules. New to the area and first time customer who won't be back. Order was wrong and they serve their coffee in soda cups."}
{"text":"I LOVE Bruegger's Bagels and this place had delicious bagel sandwiches but was the slowest Bruegger's I've ever been too. Pretty standard otherwise. 

Would not recommend if you are on a tight time schedule."}
{"text":"Bagels were so stale and hard, they should have never been sold. Extremely disappointed in the management for allowing this to happen."}
{"text":"Ordered a sundried tomato bagel and received something with rosemary instead. Got too far down the road before I even noticed. Manager was not the most friendly person on the planet but okay."}
{"text":"as a New Yorker, I am also picky about bagels. to my surprise, the bagels here were actually pretty decent! not the best, a little too soft for my tastes (nothing a quick toasting can't fix...as much as it pains me to toast a bagel) but at the same time, I've had shitty bagels in the heart of Manhattan, so I'm ready to \"expect the unexpected\".

they sell the day-old bagels in packages for cheap. can you say, a cost-effective way to make pizza bagels or something for your late night munchies? because I did."}
{"text":"I came here on a busy Saturday or a nice quick breakfast. The line was long but it goes fast and I decided to order a Parmesan Asiago Bagel
With bacon scallion cream cheese. The bagel was chewy warm and delicious with a nice savory coating of cheese. The bacon scallion cream cheese was savory and dense and just the perfect amount. I also like the large window looking into the kitchen as the bagels are being steamed and baked. Overall I enjoyed my bagel and I will be back, it is definitely a great breakfast place for a nice fresh bagel."}
{"text":"I came here on a very busy Sunday and all the tables were full including the outside seating. The bagel options plentiful and I ordered a Parmesan Asiago Bagel with Bacon Scallion Cream cheese. My mom ordered a Honey wheat Bagel with Honey Walnut Cream Cheese. The staff were friendly and the line went quick. There is a window to watch the bagels as they are being steamed and baked which was really fun to view. The bagel was delicious, fresh, chewy and salty. The bacon scallion cream cheese was very rich, thick and the scallion wasn't to over powering. My moms walnut cream cheese wasn't as sweet as she would have liked but still delicious."}
{"text":"Tried out these bagels this AM during their anniversary special, getting 3 for free! These bagels are average size with a crisp exterior and soft yeasty interior. Staff is super nice and service is quick. A go-to breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I think this is my first post.  Very understaffed. 4 customers left in the past 15 minutes because the wait is 30+ minutes."}
{"text":"I've been to this Bruegger's a few times recently for lunch. Back around 2005 I used to go to the Downtown Bruegger's to get a chicken bagel sandwich they had on the menu with chicken breast, lettuce, red onion, muenster cheese, and honey mustard(Their honey mustard is the best honey mustard I have ever had). Well the honey mustard is still the same which is great, but the chicken I think has gone down hill. It is not the beast chicken breast I've had to say the least. The staff is pleasant. The bagels are tasty and fresh daily. They did not have my sandwich on the menu but they had all the ingredients to still make it for me. The building has been open for a while now but is still a nice clean place. I had some soup which was also ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. 

I finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.

I feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."}
{"text":"Service extremely fast, staff very friendly, bagels were fresh, sandwiches delish. The everything bagel has just enough of , well, everything."}
{"text":"Sandwich business means you sometimes wait forever to get served (since it's order at the counter). Wednesday special, dozen bagels for $5.

Please note that Pittsburgh is neither New York nor Montreal. But Bruegger's bagels are pretty good on their own terms."}
{"text":"Bruegger's on Detroit is one of the few places I can call myself somewhat of a \"regular.\"  I frequent Bruegger's before work and have gotten to know some of the staff, who is very friendly and helpful!  They're always more than happy to share their recommendations with you.

I rotate between a bagel and cream cheese and various breakfast sandwiches.  I usually enjoy the everything bagel as my go-to, but they have amazing monthly specials that vary from pumpkin, ranch, and cheesey taters.  The breakfast sandwiches are delicious, as well.

One of my ultimate favorites from Bruegger's is their coffee.  In my opinion, this beats Starbucks and Panera by a landslide.  I particularly enjoy the hazelnut coffee, but also enjoy their monthly special flavors like french toast, pumpkin, and coconut.  Their coffee is strong, but not so bold or acidic that it is difficult to drink black.  The hazelnut in particular has a gentle sweet taste that is the perfect way to ease into the day.

The parking lot at the Crocker Park Promenade has plenty of spots, particularly in the morning, so Bruegger's is a convenient stop.  During peak morning hours, their is often a line, but it moves quickly.  I hope to stop in for lunch next to try out their lunch sandwiches!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE experience. Staff is lazy. They actually seem annoyed to have customers walk in. Then they have to put their phone down and wait on you.  Restroom floor littered with paper towels. Bad vibe all around."}
{"text":"Don't love it. Don't hate it. 

I'm from New Jersey so I am super picky when it comes to bagels. 

This place isn't bad. The service is absolutely excellent and if one of the main reasons I've gone there multiple times since moving into the area. And they're food is so much better than typical chains like Dunkin Donuts. (My boyfriend says they have the BEST bacon from a bagel place he's ever had.)

I recommend the cinnamon sugar bagel, untoasted or your hands with be so sticky, wth butter, or the bacon egg and cheese. 

While this isn't even close to a Jersey bagel place, it'll do in the meantime."}
{"text":"I had a vegetarian bagel here this morning: Hummus and veggies. It was good. Not much to be said for bagels, although I know there are those who are quite picky. For me, the hummus alternative is enough as long the bagels are good (which IMHO, it was).

The other nice feature about Brueggers is that they provide free wifi. It's evening now, the bagel store is closed, and I'm sitting in the Starbucks next door using the free Brueggers wifi rather than the paid Starbucks/T-Mobile. Thanks, Brueggers!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte!  As a new NYer I can confidently say this !  And the are served warm most of the time.  The right amount of chewiness they are delicious!  The ' schmears' are good too although the plain is my favorite .  My boys love the cinnamon raisin bagels and every other weekend we make sure to get a 'dozen' early Saturday mornings.  The service is quick and friendly.  I haven't tried any of the sandwiches but they offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches on bagels. But New Yorkers don't treAt their bagels in that manner!  But the good thing is Breugger bagels can be eaten alone.  They are that good"}
{"text":"Bruegger's Bagels makes bagels differently than typical bagels, leaving them with a hard, chewy exterior and a aerated interior. Whatever little tweak was made to the cooking process or the recipe was genius: the resulting bagel is substantial enough to support the various heavier ingredients potentially on a breakfast sandwich but light enough to be a mid-morning snack with peanut butter and jelly or cream cheese.

Conveniently located in the Epicentre, Bruegger's Bagels is light, airy and organized for efficiency. There are a few tables for any seated patrons but most seem to order their meals to go. There are breakfast and lunch options on the menu, but breakfast is defintely the star of the show. There are many different types of bagels, and the Honey Walnut cream cheese is delicious!

Bruegger's Bagels is also great to take to the office. You can call ahead and order a dozen bagels and a jug of coffee.

It may not be the most memorable restaurant, but I find myself returning regularly. Quality and convenience don't always go hand in hand, but Bruegger's Bagels has it down."}
{"text":"Nobody said hello when we approached the counter and then the guy just asked \"what do you want\" service is crap but the food is pretty decent"}
{"text":"This is one of my daily stops for coffee and breakfast.  The staff is outstanding!  Always friendly, always remember who I am and remember past conversations.  It's a pleasure to go in every morning."}
{"text":"I will continue to come to this location because it's really the only fast, cheap option on Walnut Street. Everything else is full-service/sit-down. The quality is pretty consistent. Service is spotty. When I'm given the option I'll usually choose another bagel place, but especially in Shadyside - I'll continue to come back because they really don't have any competition.

I do love the rosemary olive oil bagel. It's great toasted with butter - and something different that you can't get at many other bagel places."}
{"text":"With Panera and Dunkin down the road, Pamela's across the street, and Red Oak and Starbucks up a block, there is almost no reason to visit this location.  They are THE slowest...go in for a bagel, and you will leave ten minutes later...without the bagel and frustrated because they are the slowest group of individuals I have ever encountered.  Post Office slow...yes, that bad.  

The workers are rude also.  You would think if it took 15 minutes to make a simple salad (which was not very good and quite small for the price), you would get a sorry for the wait, but nothing....

This Breugger's needs to go....or the management."}
{"text":"Came here mid day and just ended up throwing out about half my food. i got a bagel and cream cheese. Bagel was chewy, too chewy, reminded me of a lender's bagel from the freezer. Which is neither good nor bad. It was not warm or toasted, nor did I get an option to do so.  The cream cheese was strawberry. I like that they had options but this was not particularly good. It was just sweet and pink without much taste.

I also got a chai tea which was too cloying sweet and also room temperature. I ended up just throwing it away.

Perhaps this place would be good for breakfast when bagels are still warm? But by lunchi its a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love the sundried tomato bagel and that's why I go here.  But it's always slow, a bit dirty, not organized, and poor customer service.  You have great bagel places nearby like Poppy's or Owen's who really have it together."}
{"text":"This is solely based off of the service that I just received. I have been to this location before and the staff is generally very friendly. 

Today I walked into around 10:30 to grab a quick sandwich to go. I asked the blonde behind the counter if they were serving lunch yet, she replied that they have both breakfast and lunch. I asked for the crispy chicken sandwich as I had noticed it advertised in the front entrance when I walked in. As I was waiting I noticed her grabbing an egg. That was then I realized that there were two versions - a breakfast AND lunch. I cannot stand egg, so I quickly went up to her and explained (and apologized) that I meant that lunch version not realizing that there was also a breakfast version. 

In response she told me in a blunt tone \"it's usually a breakfast sandwich at this time\". I was stunned at her reply considering the conversation that we had JUST had when I arrived. I was tempted to walk out and leave as I had lost my appetite. At this point, there were a few other customers who had walked in after me. I didn't want to create a huge scene. 

I don't care if I am at McDonalds, Bruegger's, or Capital Grille, every customer/everyone deserves respect. Unfortunately this visit has left a bad taste in my mouth due to the poor attitude of one employee."}
{"text":"I generally like Bruggers, stopped in today and decided to try the \"Crispy Chicken & Tater\" sandwich.  It was certainly not crispy chicken, it was a soggy tiny processed chicken with no flavor at all. Clearly it was kept in a steamer drawer. The breading was just sliding off. The chicken was maybe half of the bagel, and I'm being generous.  The egg was a rubbery slice, it was a cross section of some unnatural thing.  It literally was a smooth slice. Not sure it was actually an egg.   The bagel was good, thats the best I can say.  Don't waste your money,  you will be disapponted."}
{"text":"The lady who took our orders was so slow and got the 3 people behind us and before ringing us up and was rude about it all and this is the WORST Brueggers by far. The one in westlake at crocker is very friendly and the people know what they are doing unlike here."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for a quick breakfast! I've come here almost every single day for breakfast before work and the people that work here are super nice!!!! They already know my order by now :) Karis is such a sweetheart and is always up for some quick conversation!!!! The staff is awesome and did I mention the bagels!?! Extremely tasty!!!"}
{"text":"ehhh...the service here is hit or miss. On Saturdays or Sundays (depending on the week), there is one particular female employee who seems to go out of her way to be as unprofessional as possible.

Otherwise, the other staff is friendly and work to get bagels, sandwiches, drinks served up as efficiently as possible. It offers all of the normal bagel offerings, cream cheese, and green mountain flavored coffees.

Definitely recommend ordering any of the bagels that have a hot sign because they are the most delicious, regardless of flavor."}
{"text":"Very friendly guys who don't rush you to order something when you step up to the counter. They have a good variety of sandwiches to choose from so it was a little difficult for me. I ordered the skinny zesty egg white which comes on a bagel of your choice and has egg white, sun dried tomato, turkey sausage and cheese. It had good flavor although it wasn't freshly cooked. Prices weren't too steep 4.29 for the sandwich and 2.29 for the bottled tea. 


Quick and friendly service food and prices are ok."}
{"text":"Decent bagels and good coffee make this place a viable morning stop. Staff has always been polite and capable.  

They could use an extra person on weekends, but I understand they're trying to be financially viable (like any business)."}
{"text":"I grabbed the Crispy Chicken & Tater bagel sandwich for a quick breakfast, I was disappointed. The chicken is low quality and the egg was dry. 

The bagel itself was good and the staff were pleasant, but overall, this place was a bust for me. 

The bottom line: unless you NEED a bite and have time to wait, skip this one."}
{"text":"Just went this afternoon to Bruegger's instead of Which Wich because I was already in Park Road Shopping Center.  Mistake.  I was the 2nd person in line.  The guy who started to make my bagel didn't hear me the first few times I told him what I wanted (Sriracha Blues sandwich on a bagel) and kept looking back at the board to see the ingredients.  The other employee kept coming over to help him and at one point raised her voice almost to the point of yelling to show where ingredients were.  I waited between 10 and 15 minutes (by which point 8 people were in line now).  The female employee couldn't find anyone's order on the computer and attempted to hand me someone else's order.  She ended up handing the bag over instead of putting the bagel in it.  I was on the sidewalk when I opened it up and realized they gave me the sriracha egg bagel (breakfast item).  I don't eat bacon which was one problem, but if I'd had a more pleasant experience, it wouldn't have bothered me that much.  The sandwich itself was good, just not what I ordered."}
{"text":"This is a dependable Bruegger's location.  It's spacious, clean, the service is friendly, and while the food isn't mind-blowing, it's good.  People (normally transplants from you-know-where, *cough*) say that Bruegger's doesn't serve an authentic bagel, but it's probably the best that you're going to get in Matthews.

The one thing I don't like about Bruegger's is the turkey sausage.  Get the bacon, the regular sausage, or go without meat, but the turkey stuff is kind of bland.

I haven't tried their lunch menu yet, but I will one day, if I ever think of it.  Oh, also, they close at 2:00 PM."}
{"text":"sun morning staff was GREAT!!(8/21) Mon morning Awful!'!!   Majorly messed up my order! Ordered a sesame with green olive & pimento - got plain blueberry found when I got where I was going -  bad service.  Food is very good. Would go back on a Sunday'"}
{"text":"my favorite bagel place.  the Denver breakfast sandwich is delicious.  And this place's veggie cream cheese doesn't taste like puke like other places i know such as Noah's.  I never feel like the deli meat is sketchy which is something I fear at Posh's.  I wish there was a bruegger near me- it is tasty, reliable and not over priced."}
{"text":"First of all the place is smelly!  It smells like feet and wet cardborad.I bought a plain bagel with cream cheese, turkey, and tomatoe. It was decent. However, I bought chocolate milk and I did not notice it was expired until I tasted it. It was gross. They asked if I wanted to exchange it, but I noticed all the milk cartoons were expired. Then my friend ordered a cinnamon bagel and he wanted it toasted and they said no because it would \"catch on  fire cos it has sugar on top.\" Instead, they microwaved it, which left it slimy and gross! He returned it and the women seemed quiet annoyed."}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's Bagels. The staff was very friendly and I was able to get what I wanted very quickly."}
{"text":"The photo of my bagel really says it all.  I asked for cream cheese and I pretty much got nothing.  Wish I would have checked before leaving.   I'm not sure how the person making this thought this was acceptable.  

I love brueggers otherwise, but I have had issues at this location many times.  They always seem to get something wrong."}
{"text":"Bagels are good- prices are a little high.  Word to the wise: I've been standing in line for 15 minutes on Saturday morning- STAFF UP ON THE WEEKENDS.  Half of the line behind me just walked out the door."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a good rating but wow, three times in a row you guys struck out. The average wait time per customer is usually around 5 minutes... So if there's 6 people or more in front of you, allow yourself at least 20-30 minutes.

I just do NOT understand why this location is so slow... I would not recommend this spot to anyone, unless your in a real pinch."}
{"text":"When i went i had no clue what to expect but i was not expecting anything out of the ordinary. I had the most amazing bagel sandwich and a delicious soup! It was perfect and well toasted bagel. The soup was also one of the best chicken soup ever."}
{"text":"Fast service on a Saturday morning. Maybe I'm spoiled by New York, but the bagels are kind of small. They ran out of everything and cinnamon sugar bagels when we were there. They need a number system with receipts - people were grabbing wrong orders and it was chaotic. Coffee is average. Staff was half friendly / half rude"}
{"text":"Would give a zero if I could. We were there on Sunday morning, around 10. There were approximately 12 people in line in front of us (there was a race in town, you would think the management would be aware of these things and prepare accordingly?). We waited in line for over 20 minutes, which is an a unreasonable amount of time in my opinion. The person \"in charge\" was fairly rude and the other 2 people working appeared to both be in training, hence the snails pace. 

This restaurant is DIRTY. The pictures I was able to snag do not do the place justice. The debris covering the ceiling over the cash register is only multiplied over the food prep stations, and the display case with drinks can not have been cleaned within the last week. I cannot imagine this place would pass any kind of health inspection. I am really  surprised that it's in this condition, in such a busy/popular area. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Fast service! Wonderful bagels at a great price. $14 get you 13 bagels and two tubs of sour cream! I will be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"It does the job, but it's nothing special. The amount of cream cheese added can either be fabulous or lacking.. it all depends on the person making it. 

It's always busy in the morning. Waiting in line for a sandwich takes forever. Anyone who is just getting coffee cuts in the middle of the line, making the time to check out seem forever. Last week, ten minutes surprisingly wasn't enough time to grab a bagel and coffee :( I was late to work.

The blue apple salad is realllllllly good however- grilled chicken, green apples, blue cheese, cranberries & peanuts(?) maybe. It's been awhile but i remember a crunch in there besides the apples ;) .. Their champagne dressing is divine!"}
{"text":"I headed here for a quick bite before meeting up with my sister. I had like 5 minutes before my bus was due but was seriously in and out in two (phew!!)

I ordered the cinnamon raisin bagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I'm seriously obsessed with honey walnut and brought it up to the worker for small talk. He kept the convo going by agreeing with me and saying he loves it on sweet bagels. Sometimes food workers eply with a one word phrase so it was nice customer service to chat with me.

So super fast and friendly service as well as a tasty bagel. I forgot to order it toasted but that was my fault.

Also I literally LOVE their blue apple salad.. Chicken, green apple slices, blue cheese & nuts on a bed of lettuce with champagne dressing. I have no idea what champagne dressing is, but it's fabbb!!"}
{"text":"It's a Bruegger's, like all other Bruegger's. The non bagel options at this particular location are a bit more limited and the space is a tad on the small side but by and by, you get the usual Bruegger's quality with this location."}
{"text":"The staff pretty much knows me by name here (especially since I work upstairs).  The food is great...and not so hard on the pocketbook either!  Love that they have healthy options!"}
{"text":"Get the pastrami, swiss, and egg on pumpernickel. It is amazing and service is quick. Being from out of town this is so much better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"A guy that reviewed below said it perfectly:  \"Brueggers is Brueggers\".  

And that basically hits the nail on the head.  

I actually came in here as I was catching a bus from Pittsburgh to New York and had to go to the restroom really bad.  I figured I'd use theirs and order something cheap.  I ordered an everything bagel and cream cheese.  

I've recently been converting to a gluten-free diet, so I knew this would severely mess with my stomach, but I went for it anyways.

Meh.  Not a good idea.  The bagel has so much onion that it made me nauseous eating it.  And I love some onion.  I mean, it's a bagel, there is only so much I can complain about.  But I definitely wasn't impressed.

On the other hand, I did get to go to the restroom, which was nice and clean.  And the staff was SO nice.  And since they were so nice, I know they probably would have let me go to the restroom regardless of whether I ordered something or not.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I had the egg white sausage tomato and it was delish also they make the bagel skinny for you it was delish and supa supa healthy! They were  was ok for a water and lack of breakfast in the immediate are 1134 Thorn Run Rd. Extension, Coraopolis, PA 15101 area I was impressed:) I really enjoyed the Starbucks like atmosphere! They machine they use for cappuccino was down I won't gig them for that next time I will need a cappuccino with my bagel breakfast sandwich! The price was good and the service was fantastic !"}
{"text":"Today I went to this location to pick up breakfast for everyone at work, I was the only one not planning on getting any food, the. Once I heard they had gluten free I knew it was too good to be true, I looked on their website, low and behold the website said gluten free is an option, I having celiac disease and was very excited. I go to the location and start ordering everybody's food, then to double check I ask if they had gluten free(only because i didn't see any displayed) then the manager or whoever he was started laughing at me hysterically.the other employees and also myself stand there confused, the man then said \"this is a bagel place\" I say \"yes, there are such thing as gluten free bagels\", he then goes to say \"I would not take the bread out of a bagel to turn it into plastic\" then keeps laughing and I stand there, calm. Then he finishes my order and then say \"oh wait, I do have something gluten free\" he struck my interest, \"water\" he says as he keeps laughing.. I pay for my food and walk out. NEVER go to this location. Very disgusted that someone could possibly make fun of someone's DISEASE like that."}
{"text":"Seriously, How can you go bad with a bagel?

The Line is always long attesting to the deliciousness of the bagel.

Mine Everything w/Butter, Her Everything w/Plain Cream Cheese on the side and never a bad issue.

Occasionally the counter people try too hard to service everyone quickly and take on too much so they do not hear or remember what they should be doing. (ie Cream Cheese on the side becomes cream cheese on the bagel and an oops moment)

Remind Cashier about asking if you need a drink.

Minor things all in all.

But much better than any other bagel place...Nope all about the same."}
{"text":"Local site of national chain.  Generally well prepared, fresh bagels.  My only area of dissatisfaction is the breakfast eggs and sausage.  They are not prepared fresh, but microwaved.  Certainly not up to the level of other items.  Service has been up and down over time, depending upon the time of year and whether the help is new or experienced.  The bagel bundles are a good value."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for over 10 years.  It has convenience of location and early hours going for it.  Parking can be a challenge, and you usually have to park on the street and pay a meter.  The best items going for it are its bagels.  They are made fresh and are tasty.  The problem is some of the sandwich items leave something to be desired.  I love breakfast sandwiches, but having them microwave the eggs, and meat is less than desirable.  If they could be as fresh as the bagels, it would be amazing.  Other lunch sandwiches are generally better.  They also sell overpriced cold drinks.  Their coffee is very good, but if you are not a coffee drinker, not helpful.  Their best deal is their half dozen and dozen bagel deals with cream cheese.  Great to take to work or for the family on a weekend.  The service is variable.  Most employees are students, so there is turnover and seasonal variation.  Seems like once an employee is trained, they move on."}
{"text":"Very bad experience.  There was One person in front of us today (around 11:30am), and she seemed ticked. When someone Finally got around to help us, they had a look on their face like \"What Do You Want?\" I mean...horrible customer service.  Well we ordered Three breakfast sandwiches, which were literally put together as slow sack they possibly could go.  I've seen paint dry faster than these people's work ethics. Then,  once the sandwiches were done,  the manager or whoever, was in their own little world...Clueless about the whole experience before I cashed out. She seemed totally confused as to what she was even doing.  She rung me up with the wrong order. Then she started to start humming some fairy tale sounding song?? All along I kept my cool.  This was literally the most strangest and worst experience I have endured."}
{"text":"This is a classic Brueggers location with delicious bagels and sandwiches!  It is in a busy shopping plaza and is a popular breakfast spot.

A few things to keep in mind: the line is often longggg and they don't keep up with a crowd well.  They have been out of varieties (including plain) on both of my visits.  Don't have your heart set on a variety because they may be out.  Employees are not super attentive--- I overheard a customer ask \"how many do I have left\" when ordering a dozen and the employee responded \"I don't know.\"  Lol--- I guess he was just throwing them all in the bag."}
{"text":"To whom it may conern,

I regret to write to you on a serious matter concerning your salmon spread i went yesterday and got a bagel with that spread shortly after a few hours later feeling very ill vomiting a few times and on a verge of food poisoning. As a result I got very sick the salmon spread your serving has a very sour taste ad i believed to be 2 days old not fresh.   I will be addressing this serious matter with your executive offices if you care not to reply. This is a very serious matter and very severe to handle this professionally and quickly. As a result i have been Ill for 2 days and loosing work as well. I expect this matter resolved immediately. I will be rating your store and I'm very sorry to say its 1 out of 10 something must be done to prevent others getting ill.

Awaiting your reply asap

{"text":"I've been going to this location for years now. The bagels are always great. But the staff is always better! They're super friendly and always helpful. I will continues to frequent brueggars, particularly this one, for years to come"}
{"text":"I love bagels, I really do, and while I can't deny a good Bruegger's bagel, I always seem to end up disappointed with the lack of variety in flavors. They have a great cream cheese selection, but a lot of the bagel flavors are just kind of okay-looking, so I sometimes end up just getting a coffee. I would rather get a 6-pack of day old bagels for $3.50 and go grab cream cheese from the grocery store than pay almost $3.00 for one single bagel and cream cheese.
Their bagel sandwiches also look appealing, but the price point is a bit too high in my opinion for what you're getting. When you compare the experience to Chipotle or a similar fast casual restaurant, I just don't think Bruegger's stacks up as a lunch option.
I will say that if you're on their mailing list, they often send coupons like $4 a big bagel bundle! Which means you can get 13 bagels and 2 tubs of cream cheese for about $10. I am a very popular person in the office on the days when they have those coupons!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place but they serve good bagels.  On this particular visit it was crowded and loud. I think they have more people in here working on their laptops and conducting meetings than they actually have patrons.  There's also a Caribou Coffee inside the same space.  Wide selection of different types of bagels and fresh squeezed orange juice. My go to bagel is a plain bagel with light veggie cream cheese and cucumber slices.  I've been comimg here for over ten years and the service is usually fairly quick and the bagels are always fresh.  You can also build your own salad and make various sandwiches on a bagel bun.  I did have sweet tea today that wasn't very good.  Sweet tea at any restaurant can vary from batch to batch so I wasn't upset.  They were accommodating and swapped it out for a soda instead without any problems.  Will I come back here, yes.  Lots of people come here to study or work on various things on their laptops. Honestly, I think it's too loud in here to focus but it seems to work for a lot of people. The interior has been remodeled various times through out the years. Nice and clean. You can also watch the employees make fresh bagels through a large glass window. I've never had their coffee but mom says it's better than caribous coffee. There's also an area out front with tables and chairs that I've seen lots of customers being their dogs to. Ample parking available close to the Brueggars."}
{"text":"This is a great Brueggers location. It's got all the benefits of the other branches, including the delicious Everything bagel and the Leonardo da Veggie sandwich (which would get a great review for its awesome name even if it didn't offer Muenster Cheesy deliciousness). In addition to a great selection of bagels, soups, and sandwiches, however, this location doesn't seem to get nearly as crowded as some of the others. I appreciate being able to get a table and set up my stuff to work for several hours...so anybody else living out of a briefcase and a laptop, it's great freelance turf."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Leonardo di Veggie sandwich, but I like to get it without the onions so that I can still talk to clients for the rest of the week. The Brueggers red onions are a little crazy. 

This location can get a little busy around lunch time, but the staff is smart and efficient and ready to handle it. I also like Brueggers' soups, when they have one that is vegetarian. They do a lot of chicken and Italian wedding and such, which I'm sure are lovely...they just don't float my boat. 

The coffee and tea selection is also great here, which is nice. 

And best of all...the wireless is fast and free! If you get here at a time that isn't overrun by the lunch crowd, it can be a great \"office.\""}
{"text":"Service was fast and courteous, but the food is unacceptable. Totally tasteless egg sandwiches. My wife and I tried two different kinds and both needed a lot of salt to make it edible. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My favorite bagel at any bagel spot. Smoked Salmon (I ordered extra salmon) Cream cheese, capers, cucumbers, red onions. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is most visited location. I stopped here a couple days ago and they completely botched my order. I didn't realize it until I was at my destination :( I called them and they were VERY helpful in making it right. Mistakes happen and was impressed by their composure and customer service. Stand up team!"}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's and this location is no exception. The employees are always very friendly and attentive. Service is always very fast and the store is clean. They always have a nice variety of new menu items as well.

I would recommend the bagel breakfast sandwiches if you've never tried one."}
{"text":"As a bagel lover I would say that this is a very good bagel shop the quality of the bagel was good the quality of the service was good the coffee was good it was all good very impressed"}
{"text":"Is it just me? Seems every time I come here some local who doesn't own an inside voice comes to chat up a seated guest. . . Shhh it's morning time"}
{"text":"So slow!! Went here because chipotle line was too long. I could have went through the chipotle line several times before the two workers finally made my bagel. Also, found two hairs in my food. Luckily saw them right away. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"bagel's and coffee are actually quit good what lacks is the service.  I'd love to come here every morning, I live across the street.  The problem is in the morning they have only 2 people and unfortunately both are quite slow.  One is an elderly lady and the other appears to be a young teen girl.  They are both so nice but not at all equipped to handle morning rush.  They need at least two more experienced workers behind the counter.  

Also, they have a poor set-up where if you want only coffee you can cut ahead of everyone that has been waiting forever for the one loan bagel preparer to work on customers one at a very slow time.  THEN when you finally get your bagel and get to the cashier she is helping someone that got in the 'coffee' only line and have to wait for her to get their coffee and check them out. 

Too much aggravation to deal with this shop."}
{"text":"Very nice clean place. Good food. This is yhe first time I have eaten there.  I will definitely be coming bacl!"}
{"text":"I went there today and ordered a pastrami on rye with coleslaw. When I reached home to eat my sandwich it was mushy so looked between the bread to find only two slices of pastrami versus a whole wad of coleslaw. I took out meat and ate it. I will say that the meat is fresh. Lesson learned when you want a sandwich don't go to a bagel shop. If you want a sandwich go to a deli."}
{"text":"This Bruegger's is near the hotel where I was staying for a weekend, so I decided to try breakfast here one morning. I think this kind of joint is comparable to Einstein Bros, which is to say it is fairly clean and modern and a decent place to get a bagel sandwich. Prices are so-so, however, but I did like the smoked salmon breakfast sandwich that I got."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Excellent fresh bagels and lots of options.  You can also see the bagels being made which is cool.  Place is clean but could use an update and freshening but overall, a Frequent stop for me when in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast yesterday.  Line was long but moved along quickly.  It was very crowded, but not overwhelming.  At 11am they were still serving breakfast, but also had the lunch menu available.  All the staff was friendly, efficient, and helpful.  They had more of a variety and larger containers of juice than my local Bruegger's does.  I got my usual sausage, egg, and cheese on a blueberry bagel.  Very good!  Plenty of Christmas cheer in terms of decor and special gifts available.  If I lived nearby I'd go there again.  :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but this Bruegger's stands head and shoulders above the location three blocks away on Grant.  Employees are almost always in good spirits and much more efficient at taking orders.

Like most Bruegger's, they have the standard Bagel, Sandwich, Soup, Coffee and Tea selection.  They also have nice booth seating along an outside window."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a bagel. The crew was distracted, but polite. My food was well made, and the dining area was clean and orderly. Just what you crave downtown during rush hour!"}
{"text":"I've been loyally eating brueggers bagels since I moved to Pittsburgh, but in the last few months service has plummeted. I wait for at least 15 min when there is one person in front of me, and nobody seems to know what is going on. I'm very disappointed and will likely be converting to Einstein"}
{"text":"Ever notice how they can't keep staff or cut bagels.  They are always 1/8 inch thick on one side and 3/4 inch on the other.  They lay the bagel flat and aimlessly plow the blade through it.  My next trip I am going to bring my own knife and cut it.  Let me if this happens to you also.  Tired of eating lopsided sandwiches."}
{"text":"I really feel that the service here has been better lately. Friendly staff, and the bagels are still great!

Also, they have iced coconut coffee for the season! It's like liquid caffeinated summer yumminess. Try it!"}
{"text":"I love this bagel place the people are always super friendly and the food is always delicious!! My favourite place to eat in the airport! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Good bagels, quick service, friendly staff, good coffee.  Good breakfast place and we were quite satisfied.  They had lox...which is a must for me.  Can't do five stars because I've had New York bagels.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Ran in and got myself some quick take-out as I was running around town

Bacon, Egg, and Chees on a toasted onion bagel
Ham, Egg, and Cheese on a toasted onion bagel

The bagels were rubbery, but not as much as the egg.  It is amazing what can happen at different stores in the same chain.  I must say, I wasn't hungry after I was done."}
{"text":"Great bagels. Very professional and friendly staff. Love this place for a quick stop."}
{"text":"Never fails to disappoint ...
I wish they would open an Einstein bagels im officially done with this place ....."}
{"text":"Gave it one more try guess I'm a gluten for punishment .. Figured in a year it would change.. It's even worse the attitude of the employees are disgusting the health rating is a 95 figures place is falling apart and filthy... Park rd please open an einsteins or somewhere else ... I will stick to the juice bar next door give this dump a miss ..."}
{"text":"Against My better judgement I attempted to get a bagel his morning before a flight.  After 10 minutes the line hadn't moved, and the two employees working lacked any sense of urgency.  You would think an airport location would pay better attention to staffing...."}
{"text":"So somewhere in the center of the corporate bagel universe the baker demigods got together and decided that some bagel chains would be better priced for bagels with just a basic spread- like cream cheese or peanut butter, while others would get the price break for bagels with, aka the breakfast sandwich.  Why else would a some bagel shops charge $1.50 for the bagel with spread, while the others go for $2.00 plus?  And still others charge $4.00 for a bagel with egg and cheese, while other do it for $2.00?

Brueggers, as a chain, was blessed with the breakfast sandwich advantage, and they do it well.  Not only can you get an egg o'bagel for under $3.00, but you can also add spinach, mushrooms, and other fresh veggies to it for just a few shekels more.  This is not possible at your other corporate bagel stops.  If a bagel with a spread won't do, Bruegger's is a better bet.  

Add to that the fact that this store is just a doorway away from a Carribou's Coffee and this is breakfast made in heaven.  Sadly, though, I am not alone in this assessment as both sides can be quite full on weekend mornings.  This even holds true for the outside patio tables during warmer weather, where people watching is at a premium.  Sadly this can making parking a challenge too, though CMC's lot next door has helped out.

The other challenge is, as mentioned by others, cleanliness of the place.  Staff are apparently too busy serving new customers and ringing them up, as late mornings look something like a post-locust plague landscape in terms of trash and spills left along table tops.  A little gross, but easy to fix.

Weekday mornings can be just as tricky with parking, but folks are so much sitting around and drinking in the morning.  Great deal on a baker's dozen bagels on Wednesdays, which always makes you popular back in the office."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the man at the checkout counter was rude.  I'll never come back."}
{"text":"I have officially sworn off Brueggers. After 3 years of \"second chances\", I've finally decided that a bagel with cream cheese is just not worth it. The attitude of the employees is always bad, including managers at times.  I've been a witness to a manager humiliate and belittle a man who came in and asked to fill his mug with hot water because he \"always does this- comes in here and doesn't spend any money and then takes all of our napkins and stuff\"... I mean, are ya kidding me? I almost offered to pay for his water, but wait.. IT'S FREE.  The food isn't THAT great anymore, and if you find that you really just can't go without a bagel... keep walking cause Einstein Bro's is just around the corner! Better bagels and coffee, and a much, much nicer staff. 

My colleagues and I have spent so much time and money at Brueggers.. bottomless mugs, morning coffee runs for the staff, lunch orders, etc.. but none of us like going there anymore.

I'm done with you, Brueggers.

(2 stars because occasionally you'll encounter a friendly face behind the counter.. but that's few and far between. Not enough to keep me coming back anymore.)"}
{"text":"Service protocol is a bit confusing, and my bagel could have been toasted until a bit more crisp, but I like the menu, and the prices aren't too bad for an airport eatery. My egg salad & smoked salmon sandwich on a toasted pumpernickel bagel was very good."}
{"text":"Since there is no where to leave comments on the restaurants website, the following are more of suggestions/comments (let's hope they read these). The comments should be obvious to those with any common sense, but unfortunately, I find myself having to state them anyway. First and foremost, and I feel like i am stating the obvious here, the cinnamon & sugar (c&s) bagels are very sticky, especially on the bottom. With that being said:
1. Do not store c&s bagels underneath any of the following bagels: onion, poppy seed, sesame seed, everything, or any other bagel that has \"loose parts\". When the loose parts fall off  they stick to the c&s bagel. Biting into a sweet c&s bagel and getting a bite of onion (which I dislike) is AWFUL. 
2. either wipe off the counter or place a new sheet of wax paper on the counter after prepping one of the above mentioned bagels with loose parts. Again, when you place a c&s bagel on top of these loose parts, they stick to the bagel. 
3. when someone orders a tub of cream cheese to go with a c&s, please wrap the bagel. If not wrapped, the container becomes sticky and messy from coming into contact with the bagel.
I was a \"regular\" at the Market Square location before changing jobs and never had any of the above issues. The C&S bagels were kept on the top shelf and they wiped the counter off after EVERY order.The only good thing I can say about this location is that it has drive through."}
{"text":"Things must have changed since Joseph F. was there last (a year ago!); I stopped in while waiting for my buddy to get back from classes and had a simple Breakfast Bliss combo.  Your standard egg, meat and cheese sandwich on your choice bagel.  I chose bacon & cheddar on a jalapeño cheddar bagel.  wow!  The jalapeños were a nice touch, a little sweet and plenty spicy.  Add a glass of orange juice, and it was the perfect small meal.

If you want \"steakburgers\"- and an immediate trip to the bathroom afterward- stick with that.  If you want bakery-freshness and prompt service, Bruegger's is alright with me."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Brueggers in years.  This one has a great location and is probably one of the only fast service style restaurants in Walnut Street area.  

While I was here I just had a simple everything bagel toasted w/cream cheese.  It hit the spot.  Still as good as I remember them."}
{"text":"Local experience less than satisfactory. I did get in touch with corporate. They understood my concerns and have won me back. However I will not be dining at this location until there is a noticeable change."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and good customer service I didn't know what to expect I was in break just looking for something quick but not traditional fast food stop in and was pleasantly surprised I had a turkey pastrami on the it was tasty I will be back on my breaks"}
{"text":"You've been there. The 5:15 am USAir non-stop to Charlotte, with connection on to...dang, what week is it again? Jacksonville, right. Time for some coffee, and a bagel, because by the time you get to Milwau--no, Jacksonville, you'll be starving.

Brueggers: it's fast, it's nice, the food's good, and it's smack in the middle of the USAir gates...what more could you want before 5 in the morning?

PS -- it's at gate B30."}
{"text":"Of the major chains of bagel places I really like this place best. I am not a professed bagel connoisseur, far from it, but I've eaten some bagels in my life, Bruegger's is pretty darn good. Their \"everything\" bagel is the best but they also have an Everything wheat bagel and it's the best for the smoked salmon sandwich. 

When you go to the other places you might get a small slice or two of smoked salmon that you can read a newspaper through. Bruegger's isn't stingy with the salmon or the capers. And they're smart here, they put the capers on the cheese, then the salmon, so your capers don't go rolling off the bagel when you pick it up to eat it. Tomatoes and purple onions finish off this great breakfast sandwich. I lightened it up a bit with light cream cheese, but the full fat cream cheese is available, as well as flavored cream cheese. 

Bruegger's is also cheaper than the other chains, you can pick up a baker's dozen for under 10 bucks. Bruegger's is my new place for bagels."}
{"text":"Service was fast, the egg and cheese was tasty and melty, but the bagel felt like plastic and way over salted.  I plan to give it ONE more chance in case It was and old/stale bagel."}
{"text":"For it being my first time at Bruegger's Bagels, I was not impressed, at all what so ever. My experience just had to be the worst. I would like to apologize to anyone who's mother or grandmother works here because I'm about to call her out. As some of you know, my reviews can but brutally honest. 

Okay so, first time there, and I decide to get the advertised bagel. The Back Bay or Bay Back bagel. First of all, they were all out of the poppy seeded bagel fine no big deal, then I noticed that this poor older lady is the only one there and she's struggling  trying to keep up with the drive through and all ins. So when asked why was she the only one here she says because her manager went to pick up another coworker that just got a flat tire on her way to work. Okay, understandable, that sucks, shit happens. So at this point she is waiting on 2 customers. My issue is this, I asked for the Bay Back bagel and its posters hanging all around and I want it without the egg, it's a four ingredient sandwich. She makes me a bagel with Salmon cream cheese and bacon wtf? She did it so fast that I didn't notice she screwed it up until I watched her make my boyfriends bagel. He notices that she has missed two out of the five ingredients that's suppose to be on the sandwich; Salmon cream cheese, bacon, eggs, pickled onions and tomatoes. Her excuse was, \" I don't make these, no one orders them.\" Regardless on if you have made them or not or people have ordered it, that's is what's advertised as your special for the month or whatever so therefore you should know how to make it"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the well filled bagel I had for lunch prior to a flight. Good, cheap & large coffees available as you'd expect. All served pretty swiftly."}
{"text":"I love bagels and this place is pretty good. But there's one jerk who works here who takes football smack talk to an obnoxious level. Today I came in with my 2 young kids all decked out in our Gator gear excited for today's game. As I'm checking out, he says to me: are you from Gainesville? I tell him: no, but we went to UF. He said to me: that sucks...um, ok. It's the 3rd time that he's made a nasty comment to me. I'll take my Gator money elsewhere next time. Panera is right up the street."}
{"text":"There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of Thai peanut sauce. Tasty indeed however, what a large mess this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich.
With this said, the staff was very nice. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches...."}
{"text":"My fave place for a quick \"fast food\" lunch that doesn't taste like fast food!

My only complaint(s):
- Manager needs to make sure orders are made so they don't  run out of ingredients. I don't know how many times I've gone in and they've been outta coleslaw. I don't even order, I just leave. 
- The menu needs more consistency. Just as I get used to something, they pull it from the line-up. 
- Quality control. There are times that I don't think anyone cares what the food looks like.  

Despite it all, the majority of the time my order is perfect.  When items are unavailable I'm often offered free products. I've rarely had a run in with an employee at this facility that was not pleasant."}
{"text":"Well, I've stopped by here dozens of times (lol) to pick up a baker's dozen bagels to take in for my office staff, and a few times for lunch bagels, etc.   Always friendly staff, always great bagles and cream cheeses.   I was really happy to see this place open up so close to my office as it was a quick stop on the way in at 6:45am to grab a quick treat for the team.   

Unfortunately, I went to grab a dozen this morning and the location is closed.  Confirmed with another store that this store closed it's doors on 10/6/13.   I'm sad."}
{"text":"This is usually one of my favorite bagel shops. But when you run out of the majority of varitey bagels....you should make more!! BUT instead at 11am, they aren't making anymore...very disappointing. Now I'm on the hunt for a new bagel place......really sad."}
{"text":"The Cinnamon-Sugar bagel is TO DIE FOR! I live in St. Louis so I'm pretty loyal to St. Louis Bread Company's (Panera Bread) Cinnamom Crunch bagel, but this one blows it out of the water! I also love how quick this place is; they are always ready for the morning rush. I will be going back to try other things on the menu as well; wish we had some up north!"}
{"text":"These guys were great.   We were leaving on the 7.30 train from Pittsburgh to NY and would need breakfast and lunch.  I phoned in an order for bagels, sandwiches, and salads at 5:45 and picked it up 15 min later.  On the train now and everything tastes great.  Thanks, guys!!"}
{"text":"Brueggers Bagels when hot and fresh the bagel are good. I don't like the fact that they ask if you want the bagel toasted that is already hot or warm. Being from Jersey this is not a question asked in the early morning hours by any of the bagel shops. They really rip you off with their drink prices so grab a water at the gas station and save a buck."}
{"text":"Our bagels were good but the service was not. The girl taking our orders did not listen well and rung some of our bagel sandwiches in incorrectly. When she was corrected she didn't take any steps to ensure that we received our correct orders. They still ended up wrong. The men making the bagels moved slowly and called the orders out very quietly. When my order was ready he just said \"everything bagel.\" I asked if it had cream cheese and he said yes, but did not specify which kind and seemed annoyed when I kept asking clarifying questions. We had also ordered coffees but did not receive the cups so we thought someone was making them for us. After 10 minutes we finally asked where our coffee was and they handed us cups and said it was self serve. Everyone there just seemed like they had better things to do. Overall it was not a very good experience"}
{"text":"It's always good to walk into a place and hear people raving about how someone here makes their favorite item. I was going to just get a cream cheese bagel but switched to a western omelette bagel after speaking with One if the patrons and man was I glad. The western omelette bagel was off the hook, I added veggies and picked up a salad for lunch. The young man and lady who worked there were friendly. Looking forward to coming back."}

{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SLAMMED ALL THE TIME! Never without a line, I'm currently addicted to the Sun Dried Tomato bagel and it's worth the wait, but it's good to note to never go here on a weekend if you're on a specific time frame. 

Fresh bagels, with all the standards and a few surprises and good cream cheese - I am excited to try Poppy's soon but this will always be a great place in Cotswold to get some carb lobving :)"}
{"text":"In love with this place! Stopped in for my first time and got a turkey bagel sandwich. It was to die for!! I will definitely be returning. Probably weekly. Haha"}
{"text":"I also grabbed a Salmon Bagel during my layover. The gentleman was friendly and suggested the Rosemary Bagel which was delicious. I would suggest you take the walk over to Concourse C."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place stays in business. There is always a line and the service is slow slow slow. Guess it only stays open because it is in the shopping center."}
{"text":"I have tried this Bruegger's several times since beginning my job downtown this spring. I generally get takeout, eat at my desk, and then feel extremely disappointed afterwards. I have ordered the egg, cheese, and bagel sandwich a couple times. Even though egg sandwiches constitute nearly half of the menu, I think the eggs taste very fake and spongy. Not only is the food mediocre, but so are the employees. They act relatively depressed to be working at Bruegger's."}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's Bagels, another east coast based company that reminds me of home.

This location is inside the Cleveland International Airport in Concourse C and I make sure I hit it up when I can even though I am usually disappointed when I make my order.

Since this Bruegger's is located in the airport, seating is more open to other restaurants as well as this place too. The area is typically clean, just depends on the time of day I guess.

The workers never seem that happy when taking or making orders which is not typical for a Bruegger's Bagels but I chalk it up to it's the airport. Lol

The bagels never seem to be stocked. I have yet to order specifically what I would like to order, always having to settle for something else. Very disappointing. They never seem to wipe off their knives when using different spreads either which sucks. They have Pepsi products by the bottle as well as out of a fountain and various juices/milk for drinks.

Overall, it is an ok location to pick up bagels or a sandwich as long as you are not expecting good customer service or what you came here for originally. Come in with low expectations and you will be fine."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this Bruegger's because the staff are so nice and manage to get your through as quickly as possible. I always forget about their delicious sandwich options, so if I go in planning to just get a bagel, I always end up dithering about maybe getting a sandwich instead! 

Protips: cinnamon sugar bagels are only tasty when truly hot. The bacon scallion cream cheese is awesome on Asiago! Grab a drink if you get an everything bagel; the everythings truly have everything, including salt! Pumpkin bagels with pumpkin cream cheese taste exactly like pumpkin pie :)"}
{"text":"Bagels are good but the manager is grumpy all the time. If he makes your order it is usually screwed up. The other staff are good but there usually aren't enough of them to handle the crowds."}
{"text":"I walked into the office this morning (with slight post-Super Bowl haze) and quickly realized that it was my turn to bring in breakfast.  D'OH!   Panic mode.  The good folks at Bruegger's on the Southside helped me to recover with an amazing quick turnaround after my high-speed jaunt across the Birmingham Bridge.  Excellent bagels and some other options like muffins, cookies, great sandwiches and more.  I love the fact that these bagels taste like \"real bagels\" compared to Panera.  I also love the fact that they have Smoked Salmon cream cheese (even though I might be in the minority on that one)!   Thanks Bruegger's - I got hammered and harrassed by co-workers but it could have been worse."}
{"text":"Love their bagels! Not a great coffee selections and the actual store front needs improvement."}
{"text":"When I have to come down off the mountain to work in corporate HQ I sometimes find myself hitting this place to grab a little breakfast before work.

It can get quite busy in the AM, so I suggest you get there early to avoid the crowds.

I'm not going over the food...it is the same just about everyone one you go to, but here I find they get your food ready REALLY fast and are really open to whipping up something not on their menu....I like flexibility *grin*.

Big corporate eatery....YEP!  But I still like grabbing a bite to eat here from time to time."}
{"text":"I am, to this day, not sure why but I love the taragon chicken salad sandwich on an everything bagel from Bruegger's.  Perhaps it's a childhood memory but it's definitely my version of a comfort food.  The consistency of the cranberry chicken salad is a bit more fluid than that found in other bagel cafes but I actually like how the creamy semi-liquid seeps into the bagel like a mayo spread.  Plus, I get an extra schmear of mayo on the bagel (who said it was healthy?!?).  The cranberries interspersed throughout gave it a nice hint of sweetness, which pairs well with the savory bagel and the chicken salad itself.  Ask for lettuce, tomatoes, and onions!  It was a treat for me since we don't really have this chain in Phila or NYC anymore and this was always my go-to.  I am also a fan of their asiago parmesan bagel, which comes with a nice thick layer of cheese.  Their bagels have a nice crust and dense, soft inside, too, unlike Panera's which are more bread-like.  Decent service and a nice selection of coffee flavors as well."}
{"text":"Amazingly slow and disinterested employees. Maybe some customer service training would help but the individuals working at this location simply don't care."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan mainly do to the convenience. It  has a great location and I can usually find a place to sit without any issues. Because its in park rd shopping center there's always a place to park. (Issues I have at many of the other coffee shops)

The wi-fi is hit or miss. I don't think they have enough band width for a place where people come to use the wi-fi. Their other locations work better but I still tend to choose this because of the other conveniences."}
{"text":"Clearly the best bagel shop in the West Akron/Fairlawn area. Delicious menu items and staple staff that have been here for years and deliver flawless service. 

Great place for a meetup on the way into the office or a quick weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is your typical Bruegger's spot. The staff were friendly and quick to serve me. The food came out fast and it was nice to see the interaction between the regulars here. It was definitely a friendly atmosphere and a great place to sit down and enjoy my breakfast."}
{"text":"I really like Bruegger's bagels, but I can't stand this location. There is one older woman who works there pretty much every day and she is pretty much the most unfriendly person I have ever encountered. She makes you feel like you are ordering your bagel at the prison cafeteria. On top of that she rushes you so god forbid you want to order something else for a friend or an extra bag of bagels, she's already moved on to the next person.

We went yesterday and I ordered a strawberry lemonade, one of their great new drinks. We both took a sip and made a face at eachother...why is it FIZZY? Yeah, it's not supposed to be fizzy, so it must be FERMENTED! Yay! My husband took it up to the counter and said rhetorically, \"Is this supposed to be fizzy?\" The girl at the counter shook it and said \"It doesn't LOOK fizzy!\" Um, remember that old customer service adage? No? \"Well do you want another drink?\" We ended up with a regular fountain drink, which I didn't check the menu but I'm willing to bet it cost less than the specialty beverage I had already paid for.

So basically I'm annoyed and I'm probably gonna not go to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I am greeted with smiles and such a kind manager. Awesome experience every time! The bagels are definitely baked to perfection. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Bagels are really good!the best smoked salmon sandwich. Our first time here with my fiancé and we are not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great bagles and great ciabatta! We had one of the breakfast bagles with bacon, one with salmon, one specialty bagel and a chicken-pesto ciabatta. All is made to order and 100% fresh! We loved it! But keep in mind, that the quality makes it a little bit more expensive ;-)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I had been to a Brueggers. This particular location had very friendly and professional staff. The bagel bins were mostly full and I assumed restocked from the normal morning rush. The young man preparing the bagel orders was very friendly and appeared to enjoy his job. The ladies at the register were acknowledged me at the very moment I walked up. The french toast bagel was very good with plain cream cheese.  I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the fact that I had to wipe off half of the cream cheese off the bagel. There was a tub of it on one bagel. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This Bruegger's has become a go-to for my girlfriend and me on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. As mentioned elsewhere, it's attached to a Caribou Coffee, so there's an easy kill two birds with one stone effect going on here. I usually grab a latte at Caribou and then walk through the door, newspaper in hand, to grab a bagel sandwich at Bruegger's. If it's nice out, I sit outside in their huge outdoor patio and enjoy my bagel/coffee/paper combo in the sun. It really is perfect for a weekend afternoon with good weather. 

Though a lot of people make use of this awesome outdoor seating feature, Bruegger's is never too packed; you're in and out pretty quickly. My girlfriend loves their Leonardo di Veggie bagel sandwich, which looks great. I always go with the roast beef, which comes with spicy mayo. Very good. It's pretty standard sandwich fare, but you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"There are very few options for food in CLE airport, especially for breakfast. Between Dunkin Donuts, Bruegger's, and Auntie Anne's, there are slim pickings when it comes to healthy food. In a quest for a healthy breakfast, I got a cup of oatmeal from Brueggers. At $3.99 it was a little overpriced when compared with Starbucks oatmeal ($3.79). They give you a hearty portion but it was a bit watery and didn't come with any toppings, like almonds/brown sugar/raisins, which I've found other places like Starbucks and Cosi do give out. 

That being said, Bruegger's is a bagel place and I wasn't expecting them to have amazing oatmeal. Their bagels are pretty good and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"While I was ordering my bagels an employee was standing right behind the counter next to the line eating her bagel.  She then proceeded to handle my bags, she never washed her hands after eating then went immediately to the cash register to take my payment.  I have never posted anything before, but I was so taken back by the lack of professionalism by this employee right in front of the customers.  Brueggers I believe you need to discuss where employees should eat, certainly not where your food is being prepared!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. here Bagels are amazing. 
%100 recommend to everyone who like Bagels
always fresh baked , melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"There's only one worker and he manages the cash register as well as the food...so do expect a wait. Bagel sandwich options are not my favorite. Had the Herby turkey and they add this sun dried tomatoe spread which is so potent that it draws taste away from the cream cheese, it's like the cream cheese isn't even there. I had to scrape off the sun-dried tomatoe spread after a few bites. I also got the sesame bagel with garlic herb which wasn't bad. The hot chocolate syrup is just another version of the Hershey syrup, so nothing special there. If I do come back I'll just stick to the original bagel with plain cream cheese."}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of this chain. Their bagels aren't amazing. Their coffee isn't amazing either although my husband disagrees. It's just kind of \"eh\". If you're hungry, it's there."}
{"text":"I'm compromising at a four. The food is five, but the service is a two or three at best.

I try to make this a stop when I'm flying out of Cleveland. I always start to forget how amazing a Brueggers's bagel is compared to the average bagel until I visit. Seriously, there is a reason that I've been coming to Bruegger's since I was a kid. This is one amazing bagel, the best.

I think they best option here is just a good old bagel with cream cheese. The best option here is the simple option. Let's talk about the variety. There are at least 20 different flavors of bagels and they are all good. Among my favorites are Asiago Parmesan, Cinnamon Raisin, Jalapeno Cheddar, and Cinnamon Sugar. They have also have the largest selection of cream cheeses of any bagel shop I've ever visited. My favorite is definitely Honey Walnut and it has been my favorite for 14 years. 

This location has odd service. The employees are typically bored, agitated, unfriendly, and lacking personality. News flash, most of us have things we like better than being at work, but we fake it until we make it. Recognize when someone is paying you to have some personality.

Next time you are flying out of Cleveland swing by for a bagel and cream cheese. Ignore the nasty attitudes and savor that bagel."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Bruegger's was not what I was expecting. I have heard great things from others so decided to try it this past Sunday. I couldn't make up my mind,so I ordered an everything bagel with onion and chive cream cheese and the skinny zesty egg white sandwich. The bagel with cream cheese was fine, considering it's kind of hard to mess that up to begin with. The other sandwich was not that great. I expected a lot of flavor and there really was none at all, I ended up putting ketchup on it to give it some sort of flavor. I was excited about the sun dried tomato spread and it was so bland. I didn't taste any of the swiss cheese and the eggs were processed eggs. Along with all of that, the wait was very long, which I wouldn't normally complain about but it seemed like the workers were taking there time and had no sense of urgency. They were talking to each other casually before calling on the next customer which was frustrating. I also got a caramel iced coffee which also had no taste. It's too bad because this is so close to where I live, and I would have loved to find a local bagel place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a smoked salmon bagel & it was truly horrid to say the least. The bagel was rubbery, cream cheese was not spread more like random clumps of it around the bagel. I couldn't even taste the salmon. It was a cold, rubbery unpleasant mess. Pretty upset considering my $7 bagel had to be thrown out. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really like this place not just because their bagels are so good they bring tears to my eyes (everything bagel ftw) but also because the service is really quick.  I know if I stop in there on my way to work to get something to go I'm going to be out of there in 5 minutes.  Yeah, it's a chain, but they are good at what they do."}
{"text":"I came in around 930AM, a late morning for some, to order a baker's dozen from the leftovers of that morning's lark feast. It was very much slow for that hour, and service was incredibly quick. I was assisted within a few minutes. Server helped me select the from the remaining bagels which included Asiago, cinnamon raisin, plain, honey wheat, multigrain, pumpernickel, everything, and sesame (if you'd like a greater selection be a lark).

I was quickly rung up and out the door with a hefty bag of tasty bagels to feed to my hungry students. Overall the experience of ordering bagels was great: quick and easy! A potential improvement is that the bagels could be better, but I understand I was picking from the leftovers."}
{"text":"Garden veggie soup of the day was delicious and the customer service even better.  Extra toasted my BB bagel for me with a smile. Best place in this airport with not too many options."}
{"text":"I would love to give them the a good review... if I could actually get in touch with them. Their phone rings and rings and rings, but they don't answer and on the off chance they do, they just put you on hold and forget about you. They obviously don't care about getting any business. I place BIG bagel orders, but not when I can't get in touch with you.

Go somewhere else, where they actually WANT your business."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have yet to review one of my favorite, go-to spots! But better late than never, I suppose...

I stop in this Bruegger's at least once a week (often more!) and have come to enjoy the food, staff, speed, cleanliness, and consistency of my experiences here.
I almost always get the sun-dried tomato bagel sandwich, and while I'm extremely disappointed they recently changed their sun-dried tomato spread to something more like a thick tomato sauce, this was a corporate decision, so I don't hold it against my local store. (update: about a month after I originally posted this, Bruegger's brought back their original & ah-may-zing sun-dried tomato spread - hooray!)

One memorable experience of being a regular here, their online hours on the corp website aren't updated, so when I arrived one evening last month to pick up a gift certificate for an event I was on my way to, I was so bummed to find they'd closed 30 minutes earlier. I called their number and Audra, the manager who was still there, told me to come on in and she'd sell me what I needed. Talk about going above & beyond for me!"}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's! I find myself stopping in to one of the three locations near my home & office about twice a week over the past few months.

I'm a huge fan of their new(er) egg white & sun-dried tomato bagel. They always have a fresh selection of coffee - house blend, flavors, & decaf. They have even offered to brew me fresh coffee if I'm there in the afternoon. The fire-roasted tomato soup is also a great option.

Above all, what stands out to me about the Cotswold location is their customer service. I always enjoy stopping in here. The staff is friendly and helpful, and I've told them so on numerous occasions. 

Last month, I stopped in here unexpectedly needing a dozen bagels. Despite it being a Sunday morning with a line forming behind me, the girl behind the counter happily sliced the bagels for me, while I picked out delicious cream cheese from their large selection. (The willingness to slice bagels cannot be said for another S CLT bagel location, but I'll review them separately. However, the Bruegger's positive attitude confirmed this is the bagel place for me.)

To clarify what some other reviews have said, this Cotswold location is NOT attached to a Caribou. Others in Charlotte are, but this location is not."}
{"text":"It was a sunny Saturday morning and I headed to Bruegger's for brunch -- and was appalled at the pathetic customer service -- haven't visited ever since, and strongly recommend against visiting this particular branch of the bagel chain. 

1. The employee who took my order was in a particularly foul mood -- did not ask me if I wanted my bagel toasted or not/did not bother to ask me if I needed anything else. Proceeded to roughly (with an apparent disinterest) cut my bagel into two halves, and slathered the cream cheese onto it. 

2. I was then made to wait for ten minutes after the customer before me paid for his stuff, all because this particular employee proceeded to prepare for other orders. 

3. When he finally did come to let me pay for my order, he (very) roughly slid my credit card through the system -- it could have snapped into two. 

PATHETIC."}
{"text":"What an absolute joke. The manager stands around while the 2 stoned idiots make bagels. People are waiting for flights, speed it up!"}
{"text":"solid spot, good fresh coffee, plenty of choices and the staff is happy to make any modifications you like. No complaints."}
{"text":"Solid place... and right in my backyard too. I always overlook this since I'm always b-lining it to HT or Home Depot in the same shopping complex.

Clean with friendly service and a great tasting breakfast wrap made for a good way to start my Saturday morning.

I would definitely consider bringing books/work here to do since they have large tables and spaces to meet people and spread out materials."}
{"text":"The girl with the bun and light hair needs to be fired. She's was rude to customers and thought she was entitled. She was being very loud and swearing while the store was FULL! long time customer that don't be back. This place used to be fun and nice but not anymore. The same girl also yelled at a older man and was carrying a cigarette while being loud and left the store. I wish I got her name. we also heard a 'nice' conversation between her and the African American woman about the schedule because she didn't want to stay until 5..... this is like an episode of jerry Springer."}
{"text":"Bagels are tasty.  Even chain bagels.  I personally prefer the Bagel Factory, but this Bruegger's is ridonkulously close to my apartment, and they have coupons all over the newspaper and facebook, so it's easy to get lots of free/cheap foodz.  I have to say though, when you get a bagel and a schmear, they put a gross amount of cream cheese on.  I love cheese as much as the next person, but the cream cheese is a condiment, there is not supposed to be a 1-1 cheese to bagel ratio.  But the lady at the counter was super nice.  She said something awesome the last time I was there - like \"have a peaceful day\" or \"have a beautiful day\" or a \"joyful day\" or some adjective better than a \"nice\" day.  Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"I live so close to this store and visit Caribou next door all the time but this was my first visit to Bruegger's.  I was looking for breakfast to take with me up to the mountains so stopped for coffee at Caribou and got my bagel to go from Bruegger's.

Bruegger's is a chain so the food is pretty much consistent with other stores.  Since this store shares the building with Caribou, it is kind of tiny as far as seating area but there is a large patio outside.

The service was decent although at first everyone seemed to be in the back room except for one person.  

There isn't anything exceptional about this location but it is convenient."}
{"text":"Very disappointed they closed.  I used to go 2x a week for bagels for work...  Westlake is not on my way in.  Had to find an alternative bagel place."}
{"text":"I love Brueggers, this location is quite gat, you can get your bagel and coffee at the same place and come here to study, remind or catch up with friends! This location is attached to caribou coffee. I personally think that Brueggers is better than Einstein bagels. Einstein bagels reminds me of more McDonald type breakfast and Brueggers is fresher better ingredients, not to mention a million type of bagel selections!! This place is only open for breakfast and lunch. I've gotten the smoked salmon bagel for lunch and it comes with my choice of veggies, all fresh and crunchy! I usually get the sun dried tomato with egg white bagel for breakfast. I also tried the spinach and egg bagel, also very good! I love how great my bagel taste after it's toasted! Yes, I am indeed a fan!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the bagel sandwhiches were lacking.  Plus they did not have any of the special that they were advertising."}
{"text":"Is a .5 star review a option? Seriously this place is so bad that I finally have to write a review about it. Let me just tell you why...

The service at this Brueggers is absolutely terrible ALWAYS. They go through employees like candy so clearly they can't keep anyone around. It really doesn't shock me though after I've met the woman who I would guess is the manager of this location. 

A few weeks back a coworker of mine ordered a box of bagels over the weekend for pickup on Monday. He was unable to come into the office so he asked me if I could picked up the bagels and told me they were already paid for. I show up and the woman tried to tell me I owed her for the bagels. I told her that my friend said he paid for them already and she assured me that he did not. I had no money on me (thank god) so I went back to the office and had my coworker work it out. He ended up calling the hotline and he did indeed pay for the bagels and it had already hit is account. From there he called the store directly and the woman said she forgot to check the catering system to see if it was paid for. So if I had money on me I would have paid for the bagels a second time.

So I walked back over and this woman is now just cleaning up behind the counter where there are already other workers. Oblivious to the fact that theres a line of people waiting to pay and me waiting for my bagels. She came over and rang everyone out and then just went back to doing whatever she was doing without asking if we needed something. We had to get someone else's attention to get our bagels. 

Flash forward to this past week and I stopped in again. The same lady was there of course and this time she's once again cleaning ignoring the fact people are waiting to pay for their food. I understand that things need cleaned since I've worked in the food industry myself but the second you have unattended customers is the second you attend to them. People have work and don't have time to sit around and wait for you."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is like chipotle but for breakfast. You can get anything! 

I suggest their cinnamon sugar with butter. Nice and simple and pairs well with coffee. 

My husband got a sausage, egg and cheese on a cinnamon bagel. He thought the sweet and salty went well. 

This location was nice and their employees were nice and chatty. 

I will try their sandwiches another time. They combinations look really tasty!"}
{"text":"On a mission to find the wife bagels and this was the closest place around. Well the service was a bit slow but it was to be expected on a holiday saturday around 10am. One of their employees was a bit slow making bagels too but it seemed like he was new. 

Anyway we ordered three bagels with cream cheese and a Naked fruit drink and a small coffee, total was $14 dollars, ouch. Wasn't expecting that but maybe the bagels would be amazing...

Ah no, the bagels were ok. I've had better ones at Panera or Grinds & Glazes in Blairsville, GA. They were just decent bagels, and the toasting wasn't long enough. I prefer a light char on my bagels and Brueggers just does a light toast. The coffee was good but I probably won't be back just based on the price:food ratio. They do have 'last nights' bagels in a bin just infront of the register that would be a way better deal than what I ordered. I didn't notice it until I was sitting down, oh well. Maybe you can snag those up if your there."}
{"text":"I like that this Bruegger's has a separate seating area from the coffee shop because it can be a little quieter in here and less creepy study-hall like than the Caribou adjoining.  You also have use of the nice patio out front & thank goodness they've moved the smokers and asked that chairs stay where they are.  It is standard bagel-fare so I think the prices are little high, but it's Charlotte, what are you going to do?  The staff are friendly for the most part but strangely lacking in training.  If it wasn't attached to Caribou I don't think I'd look for them specifically."}
{"text":"I like Bruegger's but it's your basic bagel shop with all of the usual choices.  That it's attached to Caribou makes it convenient otherwise I wouldn't look for it specifically.  I like the free wi-fi.  I will say that both Bruegger's & Caribou need to work on their cleanliness.  Most times I'm in there it's a step away from disturbingly messy, dirty, sticky and the bathroom (shared w/caribou is atrocious).  I'm also wondering what is up with the big square they cut out of the wall over a year ago that is still there."}
{"text":"Brueggers has good bagel and sandwich choices and are now offering a bagel burger.  They look good on the photo, but I haven't tried one.  

I got the new pastrami, swiss and egg bagel and I really enjoyed it.  Very tasty.

Any Bruegger's I've ever been to is a bear to get through the line.  

They do need to work on either adding another person to the food making and register during busy times.  

Sometimes people stand in line for a while but still don't know what they want when they get to order - so I wouldn't go if I was in a hurry.

But the food I've had is good, so I'll go back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a while, every time I go to this one I never have a problem. But today, it was different. It was at least 5 or 6 women behind the counter. But the thing is it wasn't even that busy, I had a guy making my order he was doing just great when two fussy women come out of no where telling him what to do.  And I'm thinking to my self he's got it, I wasn't his first customer and it couldn't be his first bagel he had ever fixed. Just really frustrating to have more than one person talk at you like everything was brand new. I don't believe it was a case of the Mondays either. Just fussy women, my bagel did turn out good I paid more than I remember from last time, but ok. Don't think I'll be going back to this one."}
{"text":"We love brueggers! The bagels are delicious and I love how they are always changing their sandwiches. The workers are always super nice and friendly.

The only thing preventing 5 stars is... why do they use that type of \"cooler\" for the drinks. They are NEVER, EVER cold. So I can never purchase a drink with my bagel. It blows my mind."}
{"text":"For some reason this is the only brueggers in Pittsburgh that does not toast their bagels. They may \"warm\" them up, but they are never toasted. This has been for over a year so it was just not a mistake once or twice. Completely ruins the bagel. If this wasn't the brueggers on the way to
Work, I would never stop at this one.

When I called to complain the man who answered was less than helpful and thought it was a joke. He asked me if I \"watch how long they toast it for\".. Sorry I did not babysit my bagel was it was being made. That should not be necessary.

The only reason I give 2 stars is because the employee was nice today and the cooler was cold. Which it typically is not."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Bruegger's for the past 3 years...all the friendly workers are gone :(  It appears they have been replaced by new managment.  I have been in the store the past 4 days in a row (even bought a new coffee card for $139) and the manager who has helped me everyday still doesn't remember me :(  I guess I was spoiled by the old workers who gave this store a non-corporate feel and miss the friendly small town feel it used to have.  Change is not always good.  

I hope I don't regret buying the new unlimited refills card."}
{"text":"I got to check out this place twice when I was visiting a buddy in Charlotte.  It is an awesome place for breakfast.  If people are whining about spending a few bucks on a bagel for breakfast, they need to make their own food.  A business has to make a profit.  

There is a Caribou Coffee bar in the restaurant if you want something more than just a cup of a coffee from the Bruegger's side.  They make a great latte. 

I was boring and got the same thing twice, but it was well worth it.  I think it was the sun -dried tomato sandwich or something like that.  I put a bit of hot sauce on it and DAMN it was good!  

If you want to try a good bagel sandwich, give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Let me say that I normally only go here for an iced tea in the morning and sometimes the occasional bagel. This review is based solely off of the service. 

Why I put myself through the aggravation is simple- there is never a line. Why? Because the people are rude. I did order a bagel one morning and after I ordered one of the counter girls asked me from across the counter if I could hand her an orange juice. Weird, but I complied with the request. She then took it and drank it! Rude. She then kept wiping her forehead with her gloves on- health code violation. 

I went here this morning just for the iced tea. The cashier asked me what I wanted and I supplied my answer. If she would have smiled I think her face would have cracked. I said thank you at the end of my transaction and she did not reply. The rudest thing a person in the service industry could do is not say you're welcome when you are being thanked. If you hate your job it's not my problem. Go work somewhere else. 

The only reason they got one star is because, well basically you have to give them something. Plus I do like their iced tea."}
{"text":"I came here twice, they had average food with pretty good quality meats but my wrap and sandwich were nothing to brag about. I wasn't impressed with teh bread or wrap they used either. I ordered a sausage, bacon, ham, egg and jalpeno cheese wrap for breakfast and a roast beef sandwich another day for lunch. They have lots of fresh fruits, special juices, and kettle chips/bagels too."}
{"text":"Here's some inside scoop, as I used to work at this location:

Things are actually clean, even when in the drive thru (you're not getting any bagels that fell on floors or something like that). 

Bruegger's as a whole has my favorite bagels to this day. You'd think working there would put me off to the place. Especially when comparing to a place like Panera - the bagels are no match. Panera does not kettle boil their bagels so they are literally just selling you bread circles. Tons of cream cheese flavors, they're rich and thick and flavorful.

Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pricey, but the salads are good.

It's not that the bagels cost a lot or anything they're just priced more like a movie theater.  You just don't expect a salad and a large lemonade to run $10 but it does at brueggers.

That said the food is generally on the better end of quality for fast food and the staff here are polite and attentive.  

If you're watching calories and work on the southside there aren't many options that work.  This is one of them."}
{"text":"Maybe this place has turned a new leaf. My experience was great; far different than the other reviewers. 

The young women behind the counter greeted me right away and was pleasant throughout the entire transaction. She even waited patiently for me to dig pennies out of my wallet and didn't mind when I realized I didn't have correct change. 

My everything bagel with cream cheese was well seasoned, fresh, and there was definitely no skimping on the cream cheese. Total was $2.75. 

A man that looked to be the manager was wiping down all the tables and also cleaned the counter and wooden doors of the condiment/napkin kiosk. This place is clean and well kept. There is ample seating inside and also a few tables outside the store for easy people watching. 

There are a couple of menu items that caught my eye (hello, French toast coffee) and I'd definitely stop back in Brueggers next time I'm in the Pittsburgh airport."}
{"text":"I ate here twice a week or more for two years. Nothing beats a fresh out of the oven bagel! Their sandwiches are all really good, and I'm really surprised they don't charge more for the amazing quality. They have so many fresh ingredients to choose from. Buying bagels from the grocery store will NEVER compare! I've moved away, and there's nothing I miss more about PGH than my morning bagel on my way to the bus. The coffee isn't my favorite, but I'm a fancy-coffee drinker. If only Starbucks did the same coffee promotion!"}
{"text":"I guess if you walk in and order one lunch, this place is alright.  But if you want to fax in a to-go order for your office- forget it!  They can't seem to keep an operational fax, they have no online ordering and they will tell you how busy they are when you call, so you end up feeling guilty about trying to spend money in their establishment...  All this drama for a sandwich??  I think not."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than this place is pretty good, excellent service too with friendly staff. Before Yelp I've' been in here a few times and never had a problem and always got in and out in a timely manner. The food over all is delicious, the jalapeno Bagel and blueberry is pure goodness. and the 6 Bagel bundle deal is pretty good too! just don't forget your tube of cream cheese!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Bruegger's.  This location is very crowded so there is normally a wait.

The bagels are always fresh and delicious.  I love that Bruegger's publishes their nutritional information and offers low calorie options.

My favorite is the everything bagel with reduced fat cream cheese.   Another delicious option is the western."}
{"text":"For a quick bagel, it's a great option!

While I have other preferences for bagels in this area of Charlotte, I must say that if you are grabbing a cup of coffee and a bagel, this is a great way to do it.  They are connected to the Caribou Coffee.  I don't know how that can't be a great thing!  Great coffee and quick good food!  I had an Everything bagel with light creme cheese and it was very good.  They also have plenty of lunch options as well should you in that mood!"}
{"text":"There used to be a few Bruegger's in Charlotte proper. I suppose there are still a few around, but there don't seem to be quite as many as there used to be. Regardless, this location was absolutely packed when I visited, more so than any in Charlotte itself. That is saying something, when the entire center is busy - the Bruegger's is simply happening.

I was hanging around while passing a bit of time on a morning while waiting on someone, and it was apparently not the time to be craving a bagel (or perhaps it was, judging by traffic through the place). The staff was courteous, but they were not all that friendly - just getting things done.

The unfortunate thing with this location, and perhaps all Bruegger's, is that for getting a bagel is that it takes forever. I mean we're talking slicing a bagel, adding some toppings and moving along. There are places where you can get a meal faster. They even add the type of bagel to the wrapper, but as you get to the end to pay, they ask you what you ordered. A little strange, but not a big deal.

Luckily I was able to snag a seat and watch the happenings for a while as I enjoyed my bagel, and it did not seem to improve for a bit, but the crowd kept coming. At least I had a seat from which to watch."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a bagel now and again, and all too often, the names that pop up are Poppy's or Poppyseed's (what is it with those two - could they not think of names that were any different?), and even I am guilty of passing by Bruegger's, chalking them up as another coffee place or too similar to Panera or something. But then I'll think that I need to stop in since they are right there, and usually I am glad that I did.

They are not the greatest, but the service is typically provided with a smile, and though they do not have the comfiness of a Panera, they will do in a pinch, and are certainly better than the drive through of most of your fast food joints, and the bagels are typically rather tasty. They even have some solid flavors, but your standard everything bagel works just fine even if you don't want something fancy shmeared on yours. Good way to start off the morning. Or later in the day, so stop by whenever."}
{"text":"Out and about on a Sunday morning and decided to stop in for some breakfast.  Surprisingly, they were packed.  Not so much surprised that they were packed because the bagels are bad - I've always found them tasty.  Just that it was so early and they were so busy.

Now Bruegger's won't ever be a Starbuck's or even a Panera Bread.  But they are trying.  They have converted some of their tables to booths, and they have a few comfy chairs and free wireless.  But you're not going to want to hang out at Bruegger's.  It's just not that friendly and cozy."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and they fulfilled my sisters customized million questioned demands which is not very likely of most restaurants and so, very impressive!"}
{"text":"I decided to dash to Bruegger's for lunch today with my $2 off for spending $5 or more (I'm an eClub member) I love deals!

I ordered the Leonardo da Veggie, an Asiago Parmesan bagel with light Herb Garlic cream cheese, red peppers. Muenster cheese, tomato, lettuce and red onion. The manager told me they were out of the red peppers and offered other options. I appreciated the fact he wanted to grant me a good customer experience. I dissed having a vegetarian sandwich and had it topped with ham!

As I was leaving the manager reminded me if I share feedback on their website I can get three free bagels! Who wouldn't want that!

I've decided to edit this review. I don't know why this store was given a low score. I've had exceptional service. I did the survey went back to get my 3 free bagels & my cellphone no longer showed my survey code and the manager, Scott, still honored the offer & said to bring in my slip later with the code written on it.  I returned later that day before closing and the employee remembered me and thanked me for coming back! I'm changing my score to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here one morning. There was a line but it wasn't too bad. I got the everything bagel and it was everything you could ask for. The flavor is so good and the bagel wasn't too chewy."}
{"text":"Being from NY, my family is always seeking delicious bagels. I've been to multiple Bruegger's throughout Charlotte (mostly uptown location) on numerous occasions; usually pretty consistent. While having family in town for the holidays, we decided to swing in. From the time we walked in, to the time we left, the staff lacked customer engagement, tables and common areas weren't kept up, and order was incorrect. I always get the skinny zesty egg bagel, the sun dried tomato spread is legit. If I'm paying almost $5.00 for a bagel (see pic), I'd hope it'd be appetizing and satisfying. My mom and sister's bagels were apparently good. It's getting old visiting familiar chains...and they suck! If it's staff or food quality/presentation, employers...train and educate your staff!!! I'll drive the extra few miles to the Ballantyne Einstein's!"}
{"text":"Service was timely for 5:45 am.  I had the sausage, egg & cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel.  It was tasty for 5:45am.  However, the hazelnut coffee was a complete miss huge disappointment.  I would have gotten some from Dunkin Donuts across the hall but the line was too long.  Thankfully I was able to satisfy my coffee desire with some McDonalds coffee in the Atlanta airport."}
{"text":"Bagels are good but coffee is weak and tasteless. Seems like it was made with grounds recycled 3-4 times.  Service was marginal."}
{"text":"This location has great service. I am not a fan of their bagels. I do find them pretty chewy. In the future, I will be spending more time eating their delicious muffins."}
{"text":"This location is close to my work. When it comes to their bagels, I find them pretty chewy. I prefer a less chewy bagel. I will say that the chicken salad is pretty tasty for lunch and it's only 5.99 and comes on wheat toast which is great since I'm not a big fan of the bagels. Also, the caribou coffee next door is a great addition."}
{"text":"Got 2% milk and it was bad, got chunks as I was going to finish it. Maybe keep drinks colder..."}
{"text":"This place is right next to the Alcazar hotel where I'm staying. I felt like a snack so popped in. It felt weird with the stacked tables and chairs in the doorway and the leaves all over the ground looking like it was mid-sweep, but the staff was super nice. 

I can't give 5 stars, although I could easily, as the guy making my bagel was really conservative with the veggie spread. When I spend an extra buck on special spread, I want that stuff taking over!! 

Try the honey or veggie spreads!"}
{"text":"I'm really confused here. Is it because I'm still sort of new to Charlotte? This is my first bagel from The South. It was cold. They gave me a cold bagel sandwich. I've lived all over the country, and in NYC - probably home of the original bagel - and I've never been served a cold bagel before. Is that how they do it here? 

Cream cheese was fine. Lox was fine. Capers were fine. Cold bagel. 
Turkey was fine. Bacon was fine. Chipotle mayo was fine. Cold bagel. 

I paid $15 for two cold bagel sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just got a two bagels from this wonderful place... super tasty... SUPER fast... and ironically enough, SUPER CHEAP!  I was pretty excited.  Probably gonna be going there every morning honestly."}
{"text":"Very nice staff :). Egg, bacon, cheese, with mayo on a plain bagel!! Must try"}
{"text":"This place was very convenient for us while staying at the Pittsburgh Airport Marriott when we woke up craving a bagel sandwich! I just had a plain bagel toasted with butter but it was very fluffy and had good flavor. My boyfriends breakfast sandwich was good he said, not the best but hit the spot. They were so friendly, even when my boyfriend handed them his Baltimore Ravens bank card (I'm working on converting him)."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected, nothing great typical fast food bagel shop. I got a bagel with bacon and scallion cream cheese. The size of the bagels are really small."}
{"text":"Currently, this is the WORST Bruegger's, by far.  2 of the employees asked us to repeat our order several times.  The tuna was bone dry (no mayo, lemon, etc.) and tasted stale (worst i've ever had).  The tables were dirty and unkempt.  And lastly, there was no 'Half & Half' or milk available at the coffee bar, for the longest time.  Clearly, management here just doesn't give a rat's ass about quality or the customer!  It's a shame because this is one of the Bruegger's i've been patronizing for well over a decade now, and it has gone 'down the tubes' over the last few years!

UPDATE 8/14:  I heard that this Bruegger's has gone through some needed personnel changes, so I decided to give them another chance.  The current manager, Julie, is a consummate professional!  Competent and cares about the customer.  I have returned to this Bruegger's for now.  I give them 5 stars now, but I will keep my original 2 star review to reflect how I initially felt about them when I wrote my first review."}
{"text":"This EXCELLENT bagel joint has been one of my faves for years and years!  I'm there at least 2 to 3 times a week.  The staff is super duper friendly and competent, and remembers your name.  The bagels are prepared as genuine bagels should be, and truly taste great.  I only wish they had more 'specialty bagels' instead of the same old pesto or jalapeno cheddar.  Bruegger's corporate, are you reading??  Lastly, if you have a fairly large order, or hot sandwiches that take a few minutes, have the common courtesy to go INSIDE the store and order, NOT use the drive-thru!  You are selfishly delaying those patrons who use the drive-through for their reasonably sized orders!  Thanks for listening.  

P.S. WHAT did you guys do to the Asiago bagels?!  It used to have scads of Asiago cheese on there, and now it looks as if you changed things, whereby there is less cheese and/or different cheese!  Looks like you 'cheapened' or 'watered down' your Asiago bagels!  WHY?!"}
{"text":"I walk into a Bruggers on 05/162016 (the store is empty) at about 6:40 am After the young man got off his phone I ordered a HEC Ham,egg and cheese. He tells me they have no eggs cooked and he will make some. I don't have time for that so I let him get back to his phone. I know having eggs ready in the morning is a lot to ask so I'll take my business elsewhere. Your employees last words to me were \"Later Dude\". I agree much later! You need people who care about the business and not their hourly wage."}
{"text":"Slow....ice coffee in a soda paper cup?  Western omelet on a salted bagel...not so good.  Had much better bagels.  Safe to say I won't be coming back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Usually I only have Bruegger's when it's bagel day, but on my day off today, decided to try them on my own. Was very pleased with the zesty egg white turkey on rosemary olive oil bagel. It was a mid Monday morning so no service issue. Was pretty happy with my selection and would gladly go back."}
{"text":"Bagels done well and simply and done to order by a competent and somewhat friendly staff.

Though I like this place, it is nothing super to write home about, but I have never encountered anything bad either. I stop by once a month or so...."}
{"text":"This location has the fastest service I have encountered in Oakland which makes it convenient to grab breakfast or lunch on the go."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bagel spots in Charlotte which isn't saying much but still a solid breakfast option"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the quality of the food.  It is thrown together and just not that good.  Honestly I would have enjoyed McDonalds breakfast more."}
{"text":"Bagels are decent here, but nothing to write home about in my opinion. They do have an extensive variety of bagels to choose from which is nice. Staff is courteous, and they get people in and out the door in a timely manner. Environment is clean. Gotta love places that are consistent with their food these days. And they definitely come through."}
{"text":"The day has come -- I finally found a good bagel in Charlotte!!! Yay! Although not a NY bagel, Brueggers definitely delivers. Their bagels are baked fresh daily and you can taste the difference. They've got several interesting choices, and I tried the rosemary basil bagel with garden veggie cream cheese, which was SO good. They also have pumpkin cream cheese, which was extrememly tempting, but I thought it might be too sweet. Delicious! 

They also sell delicious items such as natural and organic peanut butter mixed with dark chocolate. They've got yummy sounding salads and soups. A great place to come for lunch, or for a dozen bagels on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, but the breakfast I had was disgusting. The manager was super funny and really sweet. I just had to sit down and eat the whole thing. The egg kind of tasted like rubber, the cheese was pretty gross, and the bagel had my breath smelling like garlic until I went home from work and got the chance to brush my teeth."}
{"text":"Don't think ill ever try this chain ever again. The only thing even slightly decent was the coffee.  Advertised fresh cracked eggs but was surely misled they were pulled from a holding tray. Disappointed to say the least how does a bagel place run out of plain bagels ?"}
{"text":"Clean, parking close by (on street and cross the street there's a municipal parking lot).  The staff was very friendly, the bagels were very fresh, and even though it was a busy Sunday morning, I got speedy service and my order correct.  Lots of room to sit and eat (even though we took ours to go).  You can even see them making the bagels right in front of you behind glass where you're waiting to place your order."}
{"text":"The girls that work here do not have any customer service experience and no training. it pretty much seems like they just walked in from the outside and put aprons on.  Seriously the worst Brueggers Bagel place ever! I love Brueggers but if this would have been my first experience with them I would have never gone in a Brueggers place again.  I understand that they may be new and don't know how to make the items on the menu but at least have a smile on your face and warm energy.  They need help!"}
{"text":"Bagels are good, seems like they keep getting smaller and smaller but for the price $2.29 you can get yourself a toasted, cream cheese smothered bagel of your choice.   I prefer the jalapeno cheddar with scallion cream cheese.  Bruegger's also has soup, breakfast bagels, and coffee.  I can tell you that it is no Panera Bread but it fits the bill when all you want is a quick snack on the run.  I went in Sunday around 9am and the place had quite the line but I think it was just people going to the Browns game seeing all the jerseys.  But hey, I was going to the game too so when in Rome right?  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels, and their chicken salad is the best thing in the world. Love that they have a drive thru! The restaurant is clean, employees are nice. Zero complaints, except that I wish there were more Bruegger's."}
{"text":"This location needs a lot of attention.  Very dirty.  Men' Bathroom was disgusting.  Toilet wobbly and loose, floors filthy with dirt and used paper towels, towel dispenser was empty.  Dining area and entrance need cleaning and repair.  The food was ok but on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Love coming here for morning bagels. The manager is always funny and nice. Just a walk away from my place so might as well enjoy it. I've never gotten a wrong order in the past 2 years."}
{"text":"Brueggers is always the best! Harvest Turkey on ciabatta is my favorite sandwich, and I love getting yesterday's bagels to throw in the freezer for breakfast. The staff at this location are always friendly and worked efficiently together to make, package and cash out orders."}
{"text":"Was ok for needing a quick bite before our 7am flight. Prices are really high but to be expected in an airport. I wouldn't plan on eating here other than for a convenance reason."}
{"text":"Love the change in management, Kathy is AWESOME and her happy attitude keeps me coming back.  It is slow sometimes but is understandable considering she has been the only one in there a lot of the time.  Glad to see she is finally getting in and training new staff to get things back on par.  Love this place and the people, aside from a few one offs this place is awesome, her staff is great and Christian always has a great attitude, awesome addition to the crew.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Sunday around 11:30 to get a quick bagel sandwich from the drive thru. Big mistake and waste of time. I waited 25 minutes and 5 cars were still in front of me before I decided to leave. Nothing like wasting a beautiful Sunday waiting in a drive thru line for nothing. Thank goodness I left or else I would have been waiting 45 minutes at least for a mediocre sandwich. This kind of lack of service is why I'm sure other locations are out of business."}
{"text":"The worst service and most unprofessional staff I have ever seen. I wish they would put another bagel place here where the staff actually enjoys their customers and their jobs. I would've given negative stars if possible."}
{"text":"Nice place. Quick worth the taking orders and getting you in and out. Made to order and workers really working to get your order done. 
The sandwich was fresh and bagel very good."}
{"text":"Great place - friendly staff and lots of room.  Bagel's are as good as it gets and love their chili.  Free wi-fi and lots of room.  One of my favorite walking destinations - and BTW they have a great special on Wednesdays - a dozen bagels for $6!"}
{"text":"The bagels here aren't as good as everyone said they would be. I actually think I like the Einstein's Bagel's bagel-cream cheese combo better. I personally prefer the plain bagel and cream cheese over the egg sandwiches because the eggs are kind of weird and microwavy tasting. The nice thing about this location is that it's on the 2nd floor of the epicenter and you can get there directly from the Aloft.

They have some very good deals on breakfast bagels that are CHEAPER than Smoothie King. Damn you delicious expensive smoothies!

Tip: I wasted $2 on a very very disgusting and watered down Iced Coffee. Avoid at all costs. Minus 1 star for that."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Bruegger's a number of times because it is about 30 seconds away.  The convenience is the only thing that keeps me going back.  The employees get my order wrong about half the time. They are constantly out of many varieties of bagels. The manager is an unpleasant person and I have seen him yell at employees on a number of occasions.

Today\s experience may have been my last at this location.  I ordered a chai tea and was charged.  The employee then told me the machine wasn't even turned on and it would be 20 minutes at least until it would be ready.  They did not offer a refund at that point and I just asked for a coffee. The coffee was extremely hot and they had no sleeves for the cup in the entire restaurant.  I ended up burning my hand.  The employee asked if I wanted room for cream and then proceeded to fill the cup up to the brink.  They did not have any cream and they were also out of sugar.  All of this happened while the manager was there and while they had FIVE employees working (more employees were there than customers). This store could desperately use a better manager as well as better training for employees."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. The workers are lazy and not very friendly when you walk in. This is my first time writing a review and I must say it is not fair for a restaurant to act in this manor. Great chain lazy workers"}
{"text":"The only place close to my house that serves a smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel! I've gone twice in the past few months and ordered the same exact thing, smoked salmon on wheat bagel, no capers. The staff is very friendly but during my last visit, the cashier shorted me a penny. I know what you're thinking, it's JUST a penny, but sheesh! Give me the correct change! I figured it was entirely too petty to mention to him and left it alone but I'm pretty sure he did it knowing I probably wouldn't say anything. 

The food is always good quality and the prices are reasonable. Just make sure you give customers the correct change."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even considering giving one star is because the Parmesan asiago bagel was decent. (And unfortunately Yelp! doesn't allow zero star reviews) 

My boyfriend and I recently moved to the area from Denver, NC. Where we fell in love with our local bagel shop. Being new to this side of the lake I was really excited to explore our weekend breakfast options and Brueggers happened to be right down the road. 

After parking and walking up to the door, we notice that the dining room is almost empty but the line is out the door. Unsure of whether this was just a Sunday morning rush, or ridiculously slow service we stayed, and waited about 20 minutes to order breakfast. 

'Customer service' is not a standard of job positions here at Brueggers. There was not one smile, from any of the four employees working. Considering premade, well over salted and peppered (see photo) ingredients are slapped on an unevenly sliced bagel and popped in a convection oven for about 30 seconds, it was puzzling trying to figure out what took so long. 

Nobody likes floppy, soggy bacon. And that's the best way to describe this place. Disappointing and WELL overpriced."}
{"text":"Bruegger's has the best bagels in Charlotte for breakfast! My faves are the cinnamon sugar bagel with cream cheese and the jalapeño cheddar bagel with egg and cheese. Their bagels are larger than Einstein's, and they are much more generous with the cream cheese. While I have never tried their bagel sandwiches for lunch or their coffee (b/c I always go to Caribou), their breakfast bagels are arguably the best!"}
{"text":"Good bagel place in Charlotte.  Long lines though and they do not move to fast.  The bagels are pretty good though and if you have the time to wait it is worth it for a good bagel.  I went there more than once and the second time I stopped in around 9a they had run out of half the bagels."}
{"text":"In the area on a weekend visit.  Decent food and service.  Portion sizes are a bit small, though, as are the bagels themselves.  And its everything bagel had very little in the way of seasonings, spices, seeds, salt, pepper, etc.  Bruegger's pulled out of our home market (Toledo) years ago.  Now I know why.  

If you have to resort to a chain for bagels, Dunkin is the better bet."}
{"text":"The service at this Bruegger's Bagels is horrible, the last two times I was there my \"toasted\" cream cheese bagel was cold! The customer service was the worse I ever experience at a food place. The co-workers were having personal conversations while preparing my food and were being highly unprofessional."}
{"text":"Went here this morning on my way to work and was met with unfriendly and snippy service. Apparently it was too much to have someone be nice. Won't be returning. 2 stars because the bagel was good."}
{"text":"4 stars for the staff - super friendly and cheerful!

3 stars for the bagels and cream cheese. Pretty standard fare for a large chain. I don't think their bagels or cream cheese are as good as Paneras or Einstein's, and definitely not on the level of say Cleveland bagel.

I wish this location had one of the industrial bagel slicers, or rather, I feel bad for the staff since they don't!

Will keep coming back though. Their bagel pack with cream cheese is a pretty good dead and they're close by."}
{"text":"Solid place for a breakfast sandwich on those 0-dark-30 flights. Java is hot and fresh. Note 'fresh cracked' eggs are pre-cooked, but so are many of the breakfast places in the airport."}
{"text":"I love bagels. I really really love bagels. So as long as Bruegger's keeps serving bagels, I'll be here. However, I haven't always had the best experiences at this location. 

The last time I came in, the egg (egg-product patty, actually) on my breakfast sandwich was cold, like it had come out of the freezer cold, so I sent it back. It came back to me still cold. I had to send it back three times before the employee was able to successfully warm the egg. She acted like it was some great victory, instead of the expectation, when the egg was finally warm, and I did not receive any offer of compensation for this except an apology. Not a huge deal, but I didn't think the situation was handled the best.  On that note, I'm fairly sure now that the egg patty does come out of the freezer--not the freshest.

However, the Riviera egg sandwich has a different, fresher-tasting egg on it and the sandwich is DELICIOUS.

One thing I cannot recommend is the coffee. Hot or iced, it tastes disgusting. Bitter, over-roasted, cheap flavor...I'd say go with juice instead.

The manager is usually there when I've stopped in, and he has always been very friendly. (The time I had the cold egg incident, I don't think he was in, so that might have been a contributing factor.)

All in all, it's usually a good bagel place--just be careful what you order."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star because every time I go to visit the staff is always nice and friendly,  the place is always clean and neat and the food is always hot and ready to go. Their is a girl by the name of Missy who is phenomenal when it comes to customer service, she is always polite and recommended the new items. I would be visiting again very soon.

{"text":"Of all the Bruegger's Bagels, this is the best one in the city. And it's all because of the staff. They are extremely nice and super efficient. Even if the line is long, I never worry because they are speedy quick. It's the kind of place that once you're in there a few times, they'll learn your name and what your order. They will chat with you and actually care about how you're day is going. It's very refreshing! 

I usually come here before work to grab a breakfast sandwich. They have a good selection for breakfast and are very accommodating for special requests. I made up my own sandwich and always get it--a Rosemary & Olive Oil Bagel with egg, ham, cheddar cheese and their sun-dried tomato spread. The spread is so, so good. I could literally (figuratively) eat a gallon bucket of it. My bagel sandwich is always good. Is it the absolute best breakfast in Oakland? No, but for the convenience of it being so close to work, the price point and the fact that the staff is so great, I  will keep coming here a few times a week!"}
{"text":"Visited this location twice and both times have experienced exceptionally slow service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was displeased with my last visit at this location due to some customer service issues.  I received a message from the management asking me to come back and try again with lunch on them.  I went in at lunchtime, around noon, same as before.  There was a line already formed at the counter.  The staff was working hard to ensure everyone had a quick visit.  The line went smoothly and I ordered the new sandwich: The Parisian, which is ham, brie, and green apples.  It was delicious!  I skipped the soup this time because I didn't like it,  and opted for the whole sandwich.  The sweet tea was tasty and perfectly sweet.  There was no talking amongst employees, just everyone working hard to serve the customers.  I met Andre, the manager upon checking out and reminded him about his email.  He was very pleasant and welcoming.  I would like to say that it means a lot for management to reach out to customers who are unhappy, even with the slightest of issue.  I think it shows how much they care and really just means a lot to the whole of the business and what they think of their customers.  Connecting this way with people is a reason I will be back.  I know if I ever have a problem, this place will care enough to help me."}
{"text":"After searching for breakfast at 2 other locations in this airport (they were open, but weren't ready to serve), I landed at this bagel joint.

It had the most convoluted ordering system ever!  I moved from left to right, you had to talk to multiple people to complete your order (order bagel here, drinks there, pay here, etc), there were two areas to pay, but one was closed and people were confused by this.  I've never seen flow this bad.

Once I got out of the ordering mess, my western bagel was good, as was the freshly squeezed orange juice. I would order them both again.

While there was a wait for my bagel, I decided it was acceptable because it was make-to-order, and not some quick buscuit at chick-fil-a that should be quick and easy (they quoted me 15 minutes BEFORE I even ordered anything)."}
{"text":"I got the salmon bagel, I asked for extra veggies and got charged for extra veggies, only to open my bagel at work and to find....... No veggies... Sigh.."}
{"text":"Forgot to toast my bagel and didn't put cream cheese on one side ? Usually good but this time terrible !"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a good 3 years. I remember being rather underwhelmed, so I didn't feel a pressing need to go back. I was in the area this morning and decided it was a good time to try again. 

They were out of a lot of the bagels when we got there at about 9:45 am. That kind of sucked, but we were told some fresh ones would be out in about 10 minutes so we chose to wait. 

Y'all don't even understand how amazing their everything bagels are. I'm not a god-fearing woman. I'm actually agnostic. If I were going to choose to believe in a higher power, it may just be because of this bagel. It wasn't just everything on the top of the bagel. Oh no. This was next freaking level. Both sides. Top and bottom. There was never a point while eating it that I thought I was missing out. I'm going to dream about that bagel.

The 4 star is partially the way things went this morning but mostly, it's because their cream cheese is just straight up disappointing. They need to up their game on that to make it worthy of being on those bagels. Also, my husband ordered the brisket sandwich, and according to him, everything but the bagel was underwhelming at best, disappointing at worst."}
{"text":"2 out of 3 times you come to this location the order is wrong.  Today I ordered a sausage egg and American cheese bagel on a plain bagel and a plain bagel w cream cheese.  Simple enough, right?  First order was a plain bagel w sausage and jalapeño cream cheese and second was onion bagel w egg.  Not even close, and I was the only one in line.  I won't go into the response I received when going to the counter, but it wasn't pleasant.  Only other thing I will say is that their furniture is all over the place w chairs strewn everywhere leading to a less than decent atmosphere.  Only go if desperate for food and or hungover."}
{"text":"Overall: The food wasn't too bad. Service could definitely be improved. It's in a shopping center so Parking is plentiful if you don't mind walking a bit.

Had the trio combo with salad, soup, and a drink. Also came with bagel bites. The broccoli cheddar soup and the chicken almond salad were both okay but nothing to write home about. 

Be prepared for a wait :/ the location seems really understaffed (as you can see by the lack of trash being taken out) and the staff that was there all seemed new...and only one of three seemed friendly. 
I wouldn't make an effort to come here but it was conveniently located and we were starving."}
{"text":"Food is ok service is horrible. The staff girls behind the counter were actually complaining about how many customers were waiting in line. This is direct quote of staff making our food: \"Ugh can't they go somewhere else... don't these people know they can get bagels at the grocery store for less than $6 a piece\" 
Will never come back"}
{"text":"They try really hard and they're very friendly, but the line always takes FOREVER. There's never enough seating at peak times, and the line winds right up into people's tables. I hate that they serve cream cheese bagels sandwich-style instead of open-faced (they always put waay too much cream cheese on).  The drink cooler is always close to room temperature on the one shelf. My husband loves this place and the manager is super-nice, so I allow myself to be dragged in, but it's just always such an ordeal. It was almost worth it when they had tha cucumber dill cream cheese. Since it's disappeared, I'm kind of like 'eh'. Obviously, I'm the minority because they're definitely packing people in."}
{"text":"Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working."}
{"text":"Early morning grab for some breakfast on the go.   Good variety of bagels to select from.  Varied menu of different sandwiches you can get made with them.  Lots of people working behind hte counter so it was kind of an assembly line.

I asked for a toasted poppy seed bagel with garlic cream cheese.  The bagel came to me warm (but not toasted) with only a smattering of cream cheese.  They really don't need to skimp that much on the cream cheese, it was like it wasn't even on it.

Bottled iced tea.  Also hot tea where they offer you a different selection of team bags (from Lipton to herbal).

1 bottle of water
1 bagel with cream cheese
1 medium hot tea
1 bottled iced tea
1 chocolate chip cookie
The above came to $9.51."}
{"text":"Super fast service even at busy hours. Friendly staff. the bagels' content of cream cheese and baking may differ from time to time."}
{"text":"I ordered the new Sweet Georgia Turkey it was good. The service however was sub par. Tyrell was mopping the floor when I came in. He was salty that I walked on his clean floor and then had to make my food. He didn't smile or show any sign of cheer. I asked him about the new sandwich to which he responded *shrug* \"I don't eat peach\" so fun. I'm in the customer service business this is not how you create repeat guests."}

I'm not exactly what you would call a \"morning person.\"  As a matter of fact, when I hear the dreaded screech of my Alarm Clock, you might call me a \"mourning person\"....mourning the premature demise of my nightly dreams of rock and roll glory! 

As the last waves of applause recede into the great sea of the unconscious, I awake naked and trembling on the beige beach of the mundane.  The hustle begins anew and I must dress and dash downtown.

As soon as I pass through the glass foyer stacked high with City Papers, my morning blahs are burned away like so much fog and I strut confidently with the pizazz of Nicholson's Boombox-toting Joker as he defiles the art museum.

By the way, this Joker's usually a bit parched around 9 AM and could use a good swig of somethin' citrusy and special.

What's this ambrosial delight I see before me?  FRESH-POURED ORANGE JUICE!!!

I think I'm gonna like it here just fine....

As per usual, I grip my trifecta of breakfast perfection...a big-azz F.P.O.J., one everything bagel slathered liberally with G.V.C.C. (garden veggie cream cheese*), and one bodacious blueberry iced coffee (B.B.I.C).


Now the Chili Dude's ready for 8 hours of listening to my boss bark orders.  

I'd rather be listening to THE Boss (Bruce Springsteen).

At least I've got dear old Yelp to keep my spirits high 'til quittin' time.

It ain't rock superstardom, but it's a living.


*YUM!"}
{"text":"I was there last week for a dozen bagels.
The woman behind the counter was very nice and friendly and helpful as well.
the prices where ok and the bagels where good as well.
I can not say they are the best I have ever had, But they are some of the best in the area.
I would definitely go back to Bruegger's again int eh future"}
{"text":"Very disappointing... I was excited to try Bruegger's Bagels after moving to the neighborhood. Sadly, this will be my first and last time here.  We ordered a bagel with cream cheese and a bacon egg and cheese on a poppy bagel.  The bagel with cream cheese was okay, not great not bad though. The BEC was really disappointing though. The poppy bagel was over loaded with poppy seeds and was kind of greasy. The eggs and bacon were all pre-cooked processed products that didn't have any flavor.  Just overall not a great place in my opinion."}
{"text":"This could be a great place to get a bagel really fast but it looks like their organization is a little messed up.

I ran in to get a traditional lox and bagel. The lady did a nice job, the bagel was good.
The person next to me that got a western omelet was looked and tasted really good."}
{"text":"Very good location with friendly employees and delicious food. I had a toasted Asiago parmesan bagel with lots of cream cheese and was very pleased with the taste. My husband was thrilled with his baked potato soup & chicken salad sandwich. This was a really good brunch."}
{"text":"Free WIFI. Coffee and Bagels all in one stop. Plus there are plenty of electrical outlets to plug into.

I usually get the Bagel thin sandwich with turkey sausage, egg white, and sun-dried tomato spread. It's a great lunch item thats around 400 calories and you can choose whichever bagel you want, all for $4. I would like to see more variety for the bagel sandwiches on the healthy items menu though. Overall, its a good place and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bagels were excellent and they put the perfect amount of cream cheese on them. The poppy seed was excellent and strawberry cream cheese was perfect! I got the iced coffee and my sister got the cold brewed coffee. Mine was nice and bold and hers seemed a little watered down. 

The cashier was terribly nice, but didn't know the difference between iced and cold brewed coffee . Only annoying thing was that they were out of lids for the coffee cups.  I would go back because the service was fast and accurate."}
{"text":"If you come here in the early morning and ask for a toasted bagel the chick with the bad wig will pretend to toast it, and hand you a chewy rubber band bagel to enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The bagels are down right throw-upable. Hard as a rock and nasty tasting. It's no wonder why this place only has a 92 health code. I don't generally go to places that have below a 95 but I needed something."}
{"text":"I love Bruegger's but this location is a fail.  The blonde woman working behind the counter has a scowl so deeply imbeded on her face that I felt like I was imposing on her when I placed my order. She also doesn't cut your bagel or wrap for you so be prepared to grab a knife to take back to the office.  Service is so slow that I've seen people walk out numerous times after standing in line.  

The quality of the breakfast items is not up to par with other locations.  The eggs taste like McDonald's, food prepared half assed, and the bagels are often stale.  Go to Dunkin next door or walk the extra few blocks and go to a different location."}
{"text":"This Bruegger's is a parking nightmare.  They have a tiny lot behind the shop that is often packed to the gills.  The larger parking lot next-door, often empty, is managed by a parking attendant who takes his job very seriously.  Very very seriously.

Despite the trouble securing parking, I frequent this location and find service to be great despite the long lines.  If you want turkey sausage make sure to point that out as I only recently realized that it's not the standard when you ask for a egg/cheese/sausage bagel.  

Also, order your drink while they make your bagel and if you slurp it all down while still in line they are more than happy to give you a free refill as you head out the door."}
{"text":"Ol' southern guy had never stepped foot in a Bagel shop before, but it was close and I was in a hurry on a Saturday morning.

This place was busy, but they were doing a good job of keeping things moving.   I ordered a wrap with egg, ham and cheese.  Employee prepared it in front of me, and quickly I was at the register making my payment and was on my way.

Good flavor and filling serving,"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Bruegger's Bagels for years. Owner/manager has always been a ASS! But today I'm done. I order two bagel sandwiches, like I always do. I tell the worker please put a little bit of cream cheese on both sides of the bagel, like I always do. The owner has a melt down and screams across the store. THATS A UP CHARGE! OMG! If the idiot wants more for cream cheese that's one thing but to scream it across the store. He's an ASS! I just walk out."}
{"text":"Bruegger's Schmooger's. This place is whack. 

CAN I GET A REAL BAGEL PLACE IN UPTOWN? 

It's a typical chain bagel store. They serve crazy bagel concoctions that nobody eats. They serve a small selection of sandwiches. Their cold cuts are so-so. 

The only thing that they have going for them is the Wednesday Dozen special for like $8. Other than that, I am forced to go there because of the lack of Bagel shops in Charlotte. 

Bagel Spot.....we need you!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the location was perfect in Dilworth Uptown. We ordered a Egg & Cheese bagel here."}
{"text":"Usually this is a go to spot once a month and I never have any issues but today's lunch was extremely disappointing ! The girl working clearly didn't want to be there today . She slops my herby turkey together annoyed , I asked for a pickle and she gives me one that's wilted and gross . I then asked for soup and she never got me the bagel bites to go with it .  Far from appetizing experience today ."}
{"text":"Great food, long wait.  I miss Einstein's.  

I've gone here for bagels for the past 12 years or so.  Ever since high school, I've recognized at least one of the friendly employees in here.
As of lately, they're all gone.  I miss them."}
{"text":"Nice place. We enjoy getting breakfast here each time we are in the area. They do not have any gluten free or gluten sensitive option other than salad. Prices are reasonable and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Was in university area and wanted fast breakfast that wasn't super greasy. I got the skinny zesty egg white on a whole wheat everything bagel. The bagel was good,kinda chewy. The bagel came with a tomato-basil spread. Honestly, I didn't taste that as much as I would have liked, but overall it was a good sandwich. There was also one worker who  stood out. Was super friendly and very personable. I'd visit this location again."}
{"text":"For a bagel place that isn't in New York, it's not bad. It's definitely one of the better bagels I've had south of the Mason Dixon."}
{"text":"I frequented Bruegger's a lot in my childhood and I still do so I have a soft spot for this place. Bruegger's offers a selection of bagels, sandwiches, soups and salads. The Bruegger's on S Aiken does a great job in preparation. If you're not getting a simple bagel with cream cheese, the items are about 6-9 bucks but the quality is worth it. They actually mix all of the components of your salad in a bowl before they put it in a container whereas other locations will just put the fixings on top with dressing on the side. I have enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, signature bagel sandwiches and salads. I haven't had their paninis and their coffee is just a-ok which I'd go elsewhere for that.

Surprisingly they have wi-fi though I have never seen anybody studying/working with a laptop. This location is nice in that it has a whole upstairs to eat your food but the configuration of entering and ordering doesn't make sense to me. When you enter the store, the cash registers are in front of you and then off to the right is where you order. They have a big ORDER sign in wooden letters above the counter where you order but I just noticed it. Hopefully I am not the only one!"}
{"text":"Wow. So I go in and only three people are in front of me, just waiting to pay. I must have been in line 10 minutes. The poor young guy making bagels was getting worked to death and no one was at the register because the original lady at register was pulling bagels out of the oven. 15-20 people in line later, finally the person making bagels takes off his gloves and I finally get to pay, while trying to keep my toddler content. I also thought I ordered more bagels and there was only 3 in my bag... Maybe I was so distracted by the chaos? I don't understand why at least 4 people were working and one was not staying on the register?

Tables were dirty, the napkin and creamer area was a mess. Bagels were acceptable for breuggers but do yourself a favor and find a local spot like Bagel Bin in Huntersville. It's unfortunate the area is lacking good places for bagels. Panera may be a better option too. 

I should have skipped breakfast and gone to Sangam Indian buffet across the street. Doh."}
{"text":"Friendly and quite decent chain bagel outlet with well above average bagels.  Quite tasty.  Nice dining room.  Very attentive and caring staff.

Much preferred to the Bagel Factory - the other bagel place in Squirrel Hill.

Ultimate East Coast bagel snob compliment - I would eat here even if I were at home (D.C.)!"}
{"text":"Restroom sink needs scrubbing. Not clean.  Seriously,  not acceptable for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Daughter really wanted to come here. We ordered 2 toasted sesame bagels with bacon scallion cc on the side(over the years all the stores have become stingy with the  cc, so we get it in the side), and a hot chai tea to share.

The counter lady was nice, had our order ready in a flash, and delivered it to our table. My bagel didn't appear toasted, so she happily put it through again. Our bagels were perfectly toasted, cc was good as usual, but slightly light on the bacon and scallions, and we thoroughly enjoyed our chai tea, which is our favorite beverage there. Caution! It's insanely hot. If you bring your own mug, the charge a bit less, plus you save a tree.

The dining room and condiment station clean, but needed more utensils. 

The male manager came to tell us that he was locking the outer door since they close  at 5pm, but to take our time, and just let them know when we want to leave."}
{"text":"The man and woman waiting on me were great. My bagel was good, but I had some foreign object in the side of butter, which they happily corrected, without question. However, it was so chilly, it was very uncomfortable. I turbo-charged eating my bagel and left. Pretty bad if even I put on my coat, and am still chilly.  The color scheme and carpet are dated, and booth seats damaged...years later, after I started coming here. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Decent sesame bagel. Really  nice female employee. Clean floor, tables, ladies roomm."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels, nice and chewy with a crispy outside... even better when hot. I like that they have a lot of flavor options and rotate offerings... recently had a pretzel bagel that was pretty tasty. Lots of cream cheese options, the breakfast sandwiches are pretty decent as well and not greasy like typical fast food places. They offer the option of skinny bagels which I love... regular bagel is just too much, skinny bagel perfect!"}
{"text":"My experience at this location was awesome. The staff was a huge help and made me feel welcomed. The employee Tatiana was such a kind and energetic worker! It was my first time at Brueggers and she took the time to help me pick and choose a sandwich that I would eventually come to love and enjoy. I will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"I will admit that service at Bruegger's Bagels is never quite as good as I'd like it to be. Perhaps that is only because I walk into Bruegger's like an excited 6 yr old on Christmas and I expect to be met with the same childlike enthusiasm. Okay, not really.

I will say that Brueggers is one of my favorite treats and places to visit. I would be devastated if they closed any more stores. (I used to frequent, and once upon a time work at, the Middleburg Heights location). 

I am a huge bagel fan and there is no bagel that can beat Brueggers. The never frozen, malting, then baking technique churns out the most perfect bagels you've ever sunk your teeth into. The cream cheese is perfect- especially veggie. The only thing that can ruin my beloved Bacon-Egg-Muenster on an Everything bagel is if they cut the bagel wrong. Isn't bagel cutting the first thing they teach you?

I will sing Brueggers praises always. It is the best damn bagel you can get!"}
{"text":"This is a continuation of my getting breakfast in the Cleveland airport. Walking a short distance up from my last adventure the same morning (today) I found the usual fast food breakfast offerings. But centered on this place. They always have a good selection and sometimes it can be hit or miss in the quality and service. But this location \"ROCKS IT\". Good selections (I got the breakfast wrap with bacon and coffee) and the guys making the orders were great. Friendly and helpful and did I mention they had a smile and were pleasant. You know, proper service to a paying customer and by the way they were in the weeds as well, and kept their heads screwed on straight and took care of the customer effortlessly with flawless execution. 

Even the manager was pitching in to help (as it should be) and he was just as nice and pleasant to all the customers. I give them all 5-stars as they knocked out the line of customers and we all got HOT Fresh food and beverages. So if your hungry and want good food with great service, head up to this place and enjoy."}
{"text":"Always open late and never have more than 2 types of bagels ready upon opening. Employees need to arrive on time to open the store on time."}
{"text":"Always fresh bagels and some of best coffee .  You can eat and have a cup of Joe for cheaper then Starbucks down the street.  If your looking for something simple this is your spot."}
{"text":"I come here once every couple of weeks for a bagel and cream cheese and never have any issues. Love their bagel options - plenty of sweet and savory varieties, although I usually get sesame or plan. They are always fresh and delicious - nice crust on outside, soft chewy inside. 

The veggie cream cheese is my favorite, it doesn't have that overly fake seasoning taste like you would get from store-bought veggie cream cheese and there are actual veggies in it.

If you like a lot of cream cheese on your bagel like any standard bagel shop or deli would give you, just ask them to put on extra cream cheese because the normal amount that they use for a bagel is fairly minimal in my opinion. Anyways, they are happy to oblige and I'm always a happy customer."}
{"text":"The bagels was nice but I was the only one in there and I asked for a toasted gable with cream cheese and lox. I got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted. How hard is it to get that right when its the only think i ordered and the pace was empty?  Wish they also carried sable . The staff or lady was nice, I just really wanted a toasted bagel since I don't have them very often"}
{"text":"Not a bad bagel but would like to see more options. Everything seemed pretty fresh"}
{"text":"Bagels were awesome. I got a blueberry bagel with butter and it had the right amount of crunch and was delicious. I'm used to the real sweet taste of the store bought bagels in the bag, these are not very sweet, however it is very good to me still. My boyfriend got the cinnamon sugar one with cream cheese and it was sweet. The cream cheese overpowered the bagel in my opinion but I'm not a fan of cream cheese. Wasn't too bad. 
Also ordered an iced chai tea which they didn't actually have on the menu, but she gladly poured it over ice for me. It was very sweet but the ice helped water it down. The staff was very friendly. Would definitely go back and try something different on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great option for lunch- called ahead from work and my order was ready in 10 minutes. I always get the herby turkey sandwich, love the combination of the herb cream cheese and sundried tomato spread with crispy red onions."}
{"text":"+1 for customer service!  I just had a very normal exchange here at Bruegger's, but I was appalled by the behavior of a customer who came in shortly after me.  She barked a customized order in a tone that reminded me of how a parent scolds an unruly teenager.  When the employee attempted to repeat her order for confirmation, she kept cutting her off saying \"it's just swapping this for that, I order it all the time\".  The employee smiled the ENTIRE time despite the rude nature of the customer, which seemed to rub off on the customer herself (hooray!), and finally was able to confirm her order.  Perhaps they do need to bump up their productivity at this location (slower than Cincinnati locations I frequent), but with made-to-order bagel sandwiches on the menu, one should expect some delays.  This location clearly has their customers' best interests at heart...even the rude ones!  P.S. They have great wifi."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and got the lox bagel, came with capers and red onions and of course cream cheese. It was good, I was made together and it wasn't messy. The service was fast and the prices were decent. Was contemplating about going back today"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bruegger's in years, but was in Park Road Shopping Center & was hungry, and I will not do Subway. So, Mom & I decided to venture in, even though the construction was a little confusing. We ordered a few bagel sandwiches & I will say I was rather impressed. The bagels were fresh & they make sandwiches to order even though there are any great selections. Although we enjoyed the meal, the service was a little dis-organized and there were issues at check-out b/c they didn't have an organized plan for each customer. With that said, everything was ok & if I am in the shopping center that would be my meal f choice...plus, it might be one of the only Caribou Coffee's, my favorite, remaining open."}
{"text":"I have a flair for the dramatic.  And my previous review was just that.

I had a pretty bad experience, but I decided to give them a second chance.  Who doesn't deserve a second change?  Well, I'll tell ya - Brueggers.

I made special trip from my apartment in Lakewood to get to Brueggers last Sunday morning.  I was greeted by an empty store and a grungy looking employee leaning on the counter and texting.  I got stood infront of the bagels and waited a bit.

I got 6 bagels and a container of cream cheese.  The same employee I referred to in my previous review took my credit card that same way as before.  It must just be her thing.

One of my pumpernickel bagels was literally flat on one side and some were undercooked.  Just an update. 

We need better bagels on the west side!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich was delicious. The staff was awful. I overheard one blatantly say aloud \"I get angry every time someone walks in\". Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"This used to be a usual stop for quick cup of coffee when in college, I stopped by on a recent visit home, they are still as friendly as they used to be, even with a line out the door they were super friendly and happy to be there. LOVE the coffee and nothing beats a bagel sandwich from this place first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"This Brueggars makes the best Everything bagels.  They have the Everything topping on both sides.  I live in Berea but will go out of my way to stop there to enjoy the savory goodness."}
{"text":"Pretty straight-forward Brueggers located in the shopping plaza with Teeter and Home Depot.  I've gotten bagels from here a few times, and never really been wow'd or disappointing.

I do feel it's necessary to point out that it's rather pricey for a bagel here, with a half-a-dozen and a thing of cream cheese is $7-$8 easy.  For the same cash, you can get way fatter buying a dozen donuts.

The bagels early in the morning are super fresh though, which is pretty tough to beat.  I'd love to see more variety on selections, but at the end of the day I'd probably order the \"go-to\" choices anyway."}
{"text":"This place met my bagel needs.   I just wanted a plain bagel to go and it took a little while to get it.  The server was helping a lady in front of me and was chatting her up a long time.  She made a sandwich, toasted it, kept a running dialogue going the whole time.   What's funny is that when she was wrapping up the sandwich, she called to a guy in the back to come help her.

I was thinking \"why didn't you call him before?  now you're done with that sandwich and can help me yourself, even though I 've been standing here the whole time you were making it, what's the point?\"

In any event, I got my bagel, everyone was fine, the bagel was okay so no complaints.  Nothing special but nothing awful."}
{"text":"Unlike every other bagel place in downtown Pittsburgh, this place was open at 4:00 pm on a Saturday afternoon the day before over 20,000 people were descending on the town to run either a marathon or half marathon.  

The girl who helped us was sweet and cut the bagles and wrapped them up to keep them fresh.  They still had a couple dozen bagels left right before they closed.

A lot of runners like to eat bagels before a race, so to any place that wants to mint money on race weekend, just stay open and you'll have lines out the door."}
{"text":"Our trip included two breakfast sandwiches. The service was awesome. I was upset about the lack of everythings.  \"No worries, if you have a little time, I can make some fresh for you!\" That. Is. Service."}
{"text":"If I could give the service of the staff -0 that would be too kind. 

There's one gentleman in particular, that I would like to credit with the honor of -0 stars, due to his exceptional ability to greet (NOT!), smile (NOT), and  to provide such exemplary service (*coughs* bullsh--!). I used to only have to deal with his \"superb\" services on the weekend, however \"someone\" felt his skill set was exemplary to warrant a shift during the morning weekday rush. The gentleman in question is African American, early to mid 20s, with bifocal glasses. One morning, after he finished serving another customer, he sat and starred at me for a few moments. Confused as to whether I should place my order, he places a big sigh with wide eyes, almost like \"WELL?!\". I guess I'm not up on the latest eye/attitude demeanor that occurs between a customer patronizing a business establishment, because instantly I was stunned and shocked. Which I later discovered was taken as \"attitude\" by this gentleman, because when I came in the following morning(s) I became somewhat of a running joke to him and his equally young coworker. Each morning when I would come in for a bagel he would laugh snicker or make condescending gestures. Even today I'm almost positive I heard him tell his coworker that I'm the one who has an attitude. So rather than return there tomorrow morning, or any other morning thereafter, and cuss the young punk out for his rude unprofessional behavior, I've decided I'm never going to patronize another brueggers bagels establishment. I refuse to feel like a child in junior high (with the incessant laughs, giggles, jokes, condescending gestures) every time I walk into that business. I am a customer who drops at least $8 a day and I don't need that type of harassment. 


Also, just to mention, the service is incredibly slow, the staff have no social skills or work ethic. I don't know if they're aware that there business is in the business of serving breakfast/brunch. Which means at 6am (or whatever) you should have a smile on your face and be ready to work! Not moop around, and look at paying customers disinterestedly."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Brueggers for years and they have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They are slow, unprofessional, and the place is dirty. Tiles are falling off the wall and broken. Here's my suggestion, close down and let another bagel place open up."}
{"text":"I came here while I had some time to kill waiting for my car.  It was a chill spot and would be a good place to study.  I did some work on my computer with the free wifi.  The Cinnamon Sugar bagel was good.  My only critique would be that the music should either be better or it should be at a lower volume."}
{"text":"Fast and free wireless, plenty of electricity everywhere, I like Bruegger's. You do have to arrive early for the best seats. The place is pretty popular for the \"out-of-the-office\" types, sitting with their laptops at tables for hours at a time.

The only two things that I would say are negatives is that the place tends to get very loud with a lot of background noise from neighboring tables. And the coffee refills aren't free.

Great bagel flavors, including several that they don't have at Panera. I like the Pumpernickel and the Jalapeno. Both are excellent. These are \"real\" bagels, unlike the stuff you might pick up a supermarket. They're made the right way, even if they aren't as good as New York. (Ha ha.)

They have a \"deal\" for a bottomless coffee mug. Only $129 for the year. So if you stop by Bruegger's often enough (at least twice a week), it might work out for you. I was hoping for something way cheaper!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but this location has gone from the fastest service to the slowest. With only one person in line ahead of you you can still expect to wait five minutes to get out of there."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean Sunrise sandwich with cracked egg, Genoa salami, red pepper, cucumber and feta on a spinach-parm bagel is so good. However I often prefer to change it up a bit by getting cheddar instead of feta, adding jalapeño cream cheese and having it served on a Rosemary olive oil bagel."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, a bit overpriced in terms of bottled juices but good nonetheless. The reason I'm giving this a negative review is the service. 
I waited in line for at least 15 minutes, with a large line accumulating behind me, because the employees were talking to one specific customer. When it came my turn to order, I was greeted with an attitude. 
I forgot to specify whether I wanted my bagel toasted, and the employee brashly told me ALL BAGELS ARE TOASTED. I was simply trying to clarify. After my bagel was done, the employee slid it across the counter to me, saying nothing at all. 
Because of this downright rude service, and by a perceived manager at that, I will no longer be prioritizing my stop to Brueggers as I have in the past."}
{"text":"This location is good most of the time. The drive through people are friendly and the service is usually swift. Occasionally they are out of the bagel that I want but otherwise they are fine."}
{"text":"I came at 11am June 18th, the cashier was very rude and sassy.  The conveyor toaster was not turned on and they tried to toast my bagel on a greasy burnt cheese covered tray in the oven.  The conditions here are very unsanitary.  I would be happy to talk to the owner and let him know of my issues if he would contact me."}
{"text":"I was ignored for more than 5 minutes before placing my order. Then I was told they were out of what I wanted. So I chose something else no big deal. Then was ignored AGAIN, by the cashier and manager while they chatted about the manager dyeing her hair. Finally paid and left with only about 8 minutes left in my lunch break. Went to eat and got the wrong sandwich I ordered the turkey sandwich with Munster cheese and apples and got the herby turkey... Which is no where near the same. Safe to say I'll never go back to this location."}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly dirty. Not just from customers but dirty!  Area around cash register has dust that has been there for a long time. Area to prepare coffee is nasty and needs a deep clean. 
Guy working register is not a happy camper, acts like you are a bother to him.   Not coming back here. My advice is to skip this location."}
{"text":"Wholeheartedly agree about the extremely poor service at this location.  I've actually been recommending that people go just to see how comically bad it really is."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Brueggers location since it opened many years ago.  They have excellent bagels for a chain restaurant, transparency in the creation process, and a nice clean store.  The manager has been there for some time and he is pleasant to talk to and always has a warm attitude.  

I think the prices are pretty fair, less than Einstein's ($4-5 for a bagel sandwich) and slightly more than local stops like Bagel's Forever.  The quality is better than the rest set aside perhaps Gotham Bagels downtown, whose prices are outrageous.

Variety is solid, jalapeño cheddar, a new bagel sandwich idea almost every time we come in, and some whole wheat options.  I'm not big on the whole wheat movement, but their whole wheat everything bagel is my favorite bagel they carry, period.  Sausage, Egg (also tasty), and cheese on one of those, YES.  I could eat that every morning if bagels weren't so unhealthy.  And my wife's favorite is worth mentioning, the Rosemary Olive Oil Bagel.  Mmmmm Delicious.

Only issue is that they are generally understaffed, as lines tend to form.  I have to imagine staffing bagel restaurants consistently is a nightmare, so it's something I usually can deal with.  Literally every bagel place I've been to in Madison has this problem, and it's more than made up for here by great staff and great product.

Save your receipt too, the survey lets you get 3 free bagels.  I do it all the time and it's saaweeet"}
{"text":"I was just in this morning. The girls were so friendly and polite! I took the bagels to work on South Side and they were still warm! I have boycotted the Bruegger's in Mkt Square for a few years now and haven't really been back to any other location. The girls were so nice and the bagels were the freshest! I would most definitely go back! 

Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Can't expect much from a franchised bagel shop. I ordered the smoked salmon bagel, which came with capers, red onions, and cream cheese. There wasn't much salmon, and for its price of $7, it definitely wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"I do love Bruegger's... but I hate the cost. This is a great location with plenty of seats should you decide to park it for a bit. 

I noticed they have a \"skinny\" bagel now... too funny. All they do is slice the bagel in three... the middle part they give to you as well... what's the point of making it skinny if you're just going to give me the extra calories... LOL I mean really. Right!? 

I asked the girl behind the counter if they do anything with the middle parts that are left behind.... Nope, just throw it away. What a waste... I took my portion and broke it up into pieces and threw it in the part next to it for the animals...."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I vow \"never again.\" Then I'm running late somewhere and stop. Well, never again. 

A few mornings ago I walk in. The person in front of me had just placed a large and complicated order - a bunch of bagel sandwiches, which all needed toasted bagels, lots of sliced veggies. eggs and melted cheese. I stood there in front of the worker as he worked to make them, and he did what some employees do when they are busy - pretend you don't exist, as if somehow not acknowledging you means that you're not really waiting there for them. Anyway, that was ok - he was clearly busy, as was the manager who was helping a little and working the register. 

Anyway, after about 3 minutes of waiting (without any words from the worker) a woman comes in and gets in line next to me. She must be a regular, because the employee greets her, asks how she is, then asks if she wants her regular order. She says she does, but she needs a dozen bagels as well. While still working on the large order, he gets a bagel and cuts it to toast. In between finishing the large order, he gets a bagel with cream cheese ready, then hands it to the manager - and the lady goes to join him and tell him she needs her dozen bagels as well.The manager proceeds to get her dozen, and the employee keeps finishing the other order before he finally is bothered to ask me what I want.

So the employee completely ignored me, but greeted and helped someone he knew who came in several minutes after me. By the time he finally took my order, she had already paid. I complained to the manager, who of course thanked me for bringing it to his attention. However, this same employee has been terrible before. There is no excuse for that kind of shockingly bad service. 

Like I said - never again. And you shouldn't go there either. 

And this doesn't even address the time I was there and 3 upper level management people were there mediating a disagreement between a store manager and an employee, with him calling her disrespectful and her accusing him of racism. In the middle of the store during business hours, when all of us customers could hear. What a crappy, crappy business."}
{"text":"Awful service! My mom was given a half full cup of iced coffee because they were almost out. And she was charged full price! She is too nice to complain, bur when I suggested the girl top it off with regular coffee and extra ice she looked at me like I was Satan. I can't imagine how tough it would have been to make more iced coffee. Coffee and ice is a pretty tall order. Also there was one other person in the place. Then as we were eating our SALADS the girls behind the counter were loudly talking about having to throw out all the lettuce because it was \"so gross\". If this restaurant wants to hire 19 year old ditzes they should do a bit more training."}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service I've ever experienced. The food was meh, usually slow unless you speak to them like they're 5. The facility is old and run down, and should probably just be closed and replaced by a more reputable bagel shop."}
{"text":"For both breakfast and lunch, Bruegger's rocks.  

The dark roast coffee is consistent in its fresh brewed taste.  I've tried a variety of their sandwiches and salads, and the one I keep coming back to is the Siracha Egg Sandwich on an everything bagel.  It's definitely a festival of flavor with that!!  Yum.  Yet, for the more classic taste, the plain bagel with lox, cream cheese & capers is excellent too.  There is a salad with cranberries and walnuts that is delicious too. 

Beyond the food, the staff also rock.  They are service-oriented and chill.  

One other yelper mentioned they needed to ask for their bagel to be toasted.  They have \"Hot\" signs hung inn bagel bins that are fresh.  If you bin isn't tagged as hot, just ask it to be warmed.  But the bagels are still fresh and amazing all day long.   

P.s. I haven't tried the burgers yet .. Doesn't quite feel right at a bagel shop, and there are too many great selections at Bruegger's.      :-)"}
{"text":"Bruegger's is delicious, but this is the best location downtown. It is not too crowded. The staff is friendly and always brightens up my morning. I literally walk past the Breugger's on Grant street to come to this one. The quality and service is way better here!"}
{"text":"The staff are always friendly and accommodating, but overall quality of service and location is inconsistent at best. The store is regularly a mess with food on the floors, over-filled trash cans, and tables that have not been wiped down - not a very pleasant environment for your lunch break. My order is wrong about 1 of every 5 visits. I am an avid customer of Breugger's in general but never know what to expect when I consider going to this location. It would be very useful for management to address these service issues."}
{"text":"What the heck Bruegger's! I ordered a Salmon bagel for $7 and they forgot the Salmon. Don't know how that was missed"}
{"text":"I love that Bruegger's is at the Pittsburgh airport. Their bagels are fresh and very yummy. Great pastry selections too."}
{"text":"This was the first time I was disappointed in the service and the product. My turkey  sandwich  w as soon made with the shreds of turkey lunch meat and then the bagels  I had ordered  were cut in half so much
By night they were hard.  She put the sandwich and 3 bagels in th he smallest bag. Please train your people"}
{"text":"Staff are rude as hell. Sick and asked for a cup of water. Greeted with an attitude. Water with no ice. They acted like I was inconveniencing them... will never be back."}
{"text":"So tasty! They recommended a bagel for me that is beyond wonderful. Fantastic customer customer service, delicious food and great coffee!! Wonderful experience. Hope to come back soon"}
{"text":"If you show up downtown Charlotte around Founders Hall on Saturday morning, there aren't that many places to grab a quick bite to eat. Caribou Coffee is closed, Taste is closed. I found this Bagel shop open and stopped in for a bacon, egg, cheese bagel, to bring back to the office to work. Atmosphere was nice, service friendly and fast. I would recommend for a quick breakfast on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"I Have nothing but lovely things to say about Bruegger's and the team of people that work at my 'go to bagel shop'. The bagels are fresh and they usually have hot bagels right out of the oven and a wide variety to choose from. I usually don't stray away from my personal favorite everything bagel with an odd combination of two cream cheeses.The light garden veggie and lox cream cheese are both delish. If you're looking for something different you  try the jalapeno cream cheese. 
Everyone from Mary who usually rings me up to the guys who make the bagels.
I like the different types of bagels and spreads. 

The place is always clean and there are a few tables and booths. 
Whenever I'm craving a carb-filled breakfast on the run I grab a bagel and my day starts off well!  $2.50 for a cream cheese bagel, my coffee is more!"}
{"text":"The skinny bagel breakfast sandwich is the perfect amount to start your day. Add a pumpkin spice coffee to top it off!"}
{"text":"Anyplace that serves breakfast is awesome in my book.  I know bagels aren't really everyone's \"thang\" but I like the breakfast option in the heart of uptown.  Right in the EpiCenter, this place does serve up breakfast (as you would normally expect a Bruegger's to do)... it also serves lunch!  (Which I have never taken advantage of... soon maybe).

The breakfast crew is always nice and the line moves like clockwork.  You can be in and out in a couple minutes and back to your cubicle desk (sigh) in no time.  I also like that it is located right near the Overstreet mall bridge connection to the Epicenter... the bridge isn't enclosed, but fresh air never hurt anyone (except during winter when it can get pretty frigid on that walkway).

As far as breakfast bagel/sandwiches go, they offer a variety... I actually like their Sriracha egg sandwich.  Nice to start the morning off with a kick in the pants."}
{"text":"The best thing about this location is that it shares a space with Caribou coffee.  Sure Bruegger's sells coffee but it's not what I go there for and why get their coffee when your favorite coffee is just 5 steps away?

Anyway, the thing people come here for is the bagels in several flavors for everyone's taste and they make your sandwiches to order.  My favorite sandwich is the salmon.  It has salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, onions and capers on the bagel of your choice.

The place does get busy so you may want to allow some time.  

I always get my bagels to go so I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but being it shares half the space with Caribou I would assume it fills up fast."}
{"text":"I've never been to this bruegger's before but I had an appoitment across the street and needed to stop somewhere for breakfast afterwards and vowed to stay away from fast food.  So I checked the Yelp iphone app to see what was close and Voila, I find this one right across the street.

So I go in and order my usual sandwich...the salmon breakfast sandwich.  And I try their coffee.  The sandwich would have been better if they actually cut it in half all the way through and not halfway.  And what happened to the capers?  They were missing from my sandwich.

The coffee was decent but not as good as some of my other java joints.  

The person who rang up my order was very friendly so that's a plus.  I got my order to go but I looked around and the restaurant seating area seemed to be laid out well with a few booths and then tables.  at 10am it certainly wasn't busy.  I hope they are at other times of the day."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am disappointed. Today I was the only customer in the store and the guy behind the counter said he could not handle food and the only employee out of three working at the time was in the safe and would be a few minutes. I walked out because I was not in a mood to wait for what probably would have been lackluster anyway. They never toast the bagels to my desired degree of darkness, despite any description I can imagine, like \"stop before it catches fire\". I only went back today because it was really early and they're close to where I live and none of the other cafés were open yet.  Also, they sell day old bagels at a discount which is nice but the packages don't state what kind they are, so you just have to guess."}
{"text":"I don't like going to places at which the staff acts like they're doing me a huge favor by serving me. This place has a knack for attracting employees that make me feel this way every time I come in there. Many of them act like I ask them to perform alchemy when I ask for more capers while they're making my smoked salmon, and they take their sweet ole' time making it even when I get the order right on the first try.

The prices are also a bit high for what you get...if it wasn't tasty, I would never come here. Also, they are frequently out of stock on many types of bagels, and I don't think I've ever once heard them apologize for that fact. For two lunch sandwiches, water, and a bagel, it's like 12 bucks or so...I can go to Steak and Shake (where most of the staff is quite friendly) and pay the same amount for more food.

I'm giving it two stars because the smoked salmon is killer. Seriously, if it wasn't such a bad deal, I'd get two or three of 'em every time."}
{"text":"Popped into a very busy Bruegger's line this morning before my flight. The line here was definitely longer than any other line in the whole food court area, including Dunkin' AND the security checkpoints. 

I ordered a pastrami, egg, and Swiss on pumpernickel. There was a little confusion in the line (my coworker was behind me but was asked for her order before me, so I was kind of skipped over at first). Service was both moderately fast and moderately friendly. The checkout process was a breeze and I was given a receipt without having to ask, something appreciate when traveling for work. 

The breakfast sandwich is what I would expect from an airport restaurant, though I'll give them credit because it was toasty hot and the cheese was melty. I kind of wished that the egg or pastrami had a bit more salt...I was expecting a salt-bomb but it seemed a little bland (though I'm sure it was still a salt-bomb). But seriously, it was airport food and I'd come here again if I needed breakfast before a flight."}
{"text":"Another day ...another disappointment at Brueggers.  Brueggers needs to train their employees not only how to have customer service...but more importantly they need to train their servers to take care of the person in front of them.  Every morning I pull up to the drive thru window and I see my bagel right in front of me in a bag...but...I have to wait for the server to make the person's order behind me....and only then...do I get waited on.  This is ridiculous and I can't believe that this place stays open with the quality of workers that they have.  Piss poor service ....the worst."}
{"text":"My main complaints were that the price for the bagel sandwich seemed overpriced (almost $7 with tax for the herby turkey...) and my bagel didn't seem very warm seeing as to it was just toasted. Otherwise, the employees were friendly and quick to make the bagel."}
{"text":"Staff was super rude when I wanted to use a free coupon because the worker had \"Never seen me in there before.\" Isn't that the point of a coupon? To get you in the store? My office buys bagels from there a lot, and I honestly was planning to return in the future if it weren't for the bad service. I did buy a coffee as I was planning to do, since I was getting a free bagel. I really didn't want to give them my business at this point, but knew I'd get berated further if I didn't buy anything. 
Just go to Bagels Forever."}
{"text":"First let me say I moved to Pitt from upstate NY. N.Y. bagels and N.Y. pizza are hands down the best! I've lived in 10 states so I think I am a good judge. This place has n.y. style bagels down! Their bagel sandwiches are amazing too! I love this place! Yes, there can be a wait BUT you can call ahead and they have your food ready so you can skip the line. Staff is very friendly too. Oh they have so many things on the menu that I eat here a few times a week! Good cappuccino too!  5 stars all day long!"}
{"text":"Just had this for The first time finally. I must say I was pretty impressed, I thought it was just going to be some boring bagel place. I got the popular \" Herby Turkey\" I think it was called. Mind blowing really. My only complaint, it's dam expensive. Two sandwiches and a drink was just under 20 bucks. It's worth it maybe a few times s year, but I'm also pretty poor"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was my FIRST time enjoying ANYTHING at Bruegger's. I've never been big on bagels until recently. However, I'm a HUGE fan of Caribou Coffee... so I figured, why not?

Well to sum it up nicely, I wasn't really sold on the Bruegger's Bagel experience. It took about 20 minutes for me order and pay for a breakfast bagel... there were two people in front of me but 7-8 by the time I finished paying. The organization of orders kind of caused things to drop out of whack... especially after one person order a few boxes of bagels and a couple of large boxes of coffee. Also, one of the associates kept having to remind people to get on the register, as I was trying to checkout... there was one associate that was more concerned with cleaning and replacing the tap-ends on the soda machine... shouldn't that have been done before the breakfast rush? 

My breakfast bagel was a little rubbery so not enjoyable, to say the least. 

HOWEVER, as chaotic as it all seemed, the staff was really pleasant and apologetic for anyone having to wait in line. For that alone (and with it being 7AM in the morning) I think they are trying and I will probably give them another shot some time in the future... this time with just a plain bagel and cream cheese! :-)"}
{"text":"This is a good location given the large number of trips I tend to make each week to Fresh Market.  When I go to FM on a Wednesday, it's a good day to stop at Bruegger's as well as they have a number of specials.  The one I mainly take advantage of is the Baker's Dozen for $6.99.

Other than the good location for me personally, this place is generally well run with good, quick service.  Bruegger's isn't a \"real\" NYC bagel but, considering the airfare I save by eating a bagel in LKN, they are good enough."}
{"text":"I had never set foot in a Bruegger's before this week but decided to try and satisfy a bagel craving while Uptown at somewhere other than Einstein's.  I got a cinnamon raisin bagel with plain cream cheese.  The bagel had a crispy outside and soft, chewy center with plenty of raisins.  I actually liked the \"dense\" cream cheese better than the whipped variety that Einstein's offers.  So, really 4 stars for the bagel itself.

The star knock down comes from the fact that, with only 2 people in line ahead of me, it still took 10 minutes to get the darn thing.  Hard to comprehend really..."}
{"text":"So my review my be a bit bias, but aren't all reviews, technically? Haha. The person that made my sandwich was really rude, he grunted when I misunderstood my order, and with an attitude changed it. Second thing is my sister and I both had a stomach ache minutes after completing our meals."}
{"text":"Husband and I went to grab salmon lox bagels for breakfast. Ordered, sat and ate. Finished half and hub was ready to eat his other half then he noticed long piece of hair strand tangled in the cream cheese. He was chill, I told him to please take it back.  The employee was good and asked if we wanted a new one or money back. Hub likes the place so he took a replacement bagel lox. It was alright.. mines was fine lol."}
{"text":"I don't know why we haven't been here before.
My son got the brisket sandwich, I got a bacon, egg and cheese. The flavors are amazing.
Then we shared a cinnamon bagel with maple cream cheese.... It was heaven. 
Everyone was nice, the food was amazing.
Will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the tasty bagels I would never go to this location. Look at my sandwich....how do you expect me to pay almost $4 for something like this? What a joke"}
