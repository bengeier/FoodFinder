{"text":"Amazing pub,run by a wonderful family (we had the pleasure to meet a few family members while we were there) great food, wonderful atmosphere. Had a wonderful time there. Looking forward to visiting there again when we visit our son."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem through Yelp and have fallen in love with it. It's not fancy, it's just great food and great service in a comfortable setting. TVs line the walls around a beautiful center bar, and we've had nothing but great, fun servers. The 'rolls' are off the charts - spinach and feta, pepperoni, or chicken in a Stromboli type dough. An app that can be a meal!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly place to have some great pub fare and watch the Game. Good beer selection great prices."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a recommendation of a friend. Don't let the outside fool you--- the good was good and the service was great too!! Loved the pepperoni and spinach rolls!! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The service is incredible as is the owner. We were there tonight with our young kids. We left and forgot our pizza on the table and the owner brought the pie to our car. They like to get people in the door and treat them like gold. The food is great, I would recommend the chicken bacon rolls with garlic ranch and the wedding soup."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything that I have tried has been great. The wedding soup and spinach rolls are my favorite. They have the best garlic ranch, bring breathmints!! Also good for take out"}
{"text":"Fun place. Great food! Service is a bit slow, so if you're not in a big hurry I would recommend!  Great place to go with friends especially when the weather is nice. Their back patio is a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the food here. I didn't expect much from a place strangely jammed in a shopping center. The blackened salmon was awesome and came with one of the best sides of mixed sautéed veggies (WITH BACON) that I've ever had. I wish we could've sat outside but there seemed to be a private event being held."}
{"text":"I can't believe what we have been missing.  This place deserves six stars.  They have food that is all over the board and there is something for everyone.  We tried the pepperoni roll and the spinach roll - both were delicious.  We also tried the homemade hummus - it changes daily.  Ours was a jalapeño and cheddar hummus which had a perfect amount of heat.  All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious.  Burgers, Reuben's, fish, salads, etc.  they feature a dinner special every day except Sunday.  Saturday is Prime Rib night and it generally sells out early.  We told Chelsi, our bartender, that it was our first time visiting Downey's.  She was attentive and friendly with all of the bar patrons.  The owner came over to introduce himself and asked how we heard of the place.  He was genuinely interested in meeting us and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I grew up over in the West allegheny area and this has  been our go to spot for my friends and I for years. The patio out back was put in about 7 years ago or so, and makes this an even better place to hang out during the summer months. They have good beer selection and great food. I especially love having a few beers and ordering the buffalo chicken dip or the pepperoni rolls. The location of this place is also very central and a good meeting spot for all of my friends. The staff and owner are also very friendly and accomodating. They also have good live bands play here frequently. I reccomend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Good food, great staff and managed by the right kind of people (those who focus on good food and customer experience). The patio out back is great during the summer, also a great spot to watch the game and try a new beer or two. Definitely a favorite for my wife and I!"}
{"text":"fantastic food!!! Seriously!!! The best reuben sandwich of my life- I mean, who dreams about a reuben?!?!??.... I do now!!! :)) and to top off the amazing food, the service was super friendly, prompt, and fun :)) great hole in the wall joint that has officially made our \"gotta have it crave \" place :)))"}
{"text":"I've been traveling recently in the Pittsburgh area for work, Central Diner has become home away from home.  I've probably had ten different entrees and they have all been good. Grilled Chicken Wrap and the Spanish Omelette are my two favorites. Be prepared for large portions! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I am here on business and found this place on yelp. Typical sports bar atmosphere. I had the pepperoni roll and they were fantastic...especially with the garlic ranch. It is a must have when you visit. The outdoor patio and bar is a great.addition for some tv or cornhole."}
{"text":"They have really good pizza crust.  The staff is very friendly.  The interior could use some updates.  They do have a patio and what looks to be a pavilion in the back for large groups during nice weather.  They have a large selection of beer.  It is a great place to go have a beer while getting your car worked on next door at Midas.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this local spot. Ice cold draft beer.  Buffalo chicken dip was as good as I make at home. Spinach cheese rolls were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We came to town tonight for the game on Sunday. We were looking for a nice bar to go to. The server at central diner and grill told us about the Downey house love it and Steve the bartender and the girl whose name I missed rocked such a nice neighborhood bar loved it and thanks to them and Downey for the welcome of two  people from out of town they treated us like we were coming there for years"}
{"text":"On the outside it looks divey, but it's really pretty on the inside. I dined here this past week for the first time, and it was absolutely delicious.  I was with a large group, and we ordered almost all of their happy hour specials plus some. So my dinner was a bit of everything. The cheese pizza, chicken dip, fries, pretzel sticks, and happy hour drinks are great. I also had a small salad (and usually I'm just like \"eh\" with salads) but this one was really really good. It had all of my favorite toppings on it like olives, cucumbers, croutons, and green peppers. The only thing I was picking around was all of the cheese. I also hear the pizza rolls are fantastic, and two of the people I was with ordered them, but I didn't get a taste and I regret it. I'm sure I'll be back soon to try them though. I highly recommend going here for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Really the best bartenders around..   the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great pizza Rolls and fantastic service. She noticed we had left over food and brought a box without even asking. Cups were never empty. Good experience Over all."}
{"text":"Super selection, even the pickiest will find something they like.  They have really yummy fish sammiches that you can get an extra bun with to eat later, there is so much fish! The pepperoni, spinach, and chicken rolls are to DIE for!  The seafood bisque is rich and delicious.  There is plenty of table and booth seating in the bar area, or you can be seated in the quieter dining room adjacent.  You will see everyone from old ladies lunching to families having dinner together to singles eating at the bar.  No one is out of place here!  I grew up next door to the Downeys, so I know them to be good honest hard working people with strong family values.  I'm glad to see so many people coming together here and enjoying this place, they deserve the success!"}
{"text":"The wedding soup is delicious! Lots of goodies and the broth is not greasy. Our waitress was so nice. Although it was busy, the service was spot on."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place after a late night at work. There were limited options available at the time, so I gave it a shot. It was much more of a bar than what I was expecting. Not a bad thing, just a clarification. They were only servicing the late night menu, so I grabbed a beer (ok, two) while I waited and ordered a Hot Italian sandwich to go. The bartender was super friendly and had a great personality. Once I got back in the car, I cracked upon the sandwich box to take a bite.  Sweet Mother. What a sandwich. The combination of spicy meats, Italian peppers and Provolone cheese pressed into the bread (panini-style, but not really a panini per se) created one of the best sandwich experiences I've ever eaten. It was that good. If it hadn't been so late and I hadn't been so tired, I would've gone back inside for another sandwich.  I'm only giving the place four stars since I feel like I need more experiences to justify the additional star, but I can't wait to go back and try it again. Well done, Downey's. Well done."}
{"text":"The pepperoni rolls are absolutely DELISH!!! That's what I ordered the first time I went there and the only thing I've ever ordered the 10+ visits since."}
{"text":"Stopped in after talking to someone in the area who kept talking about the rolls. We were not disappointed! We sat on the bar side but there is a dining room area as well. The bowl of wedding soup was pretty good. Not too salty and just right. We both ordered a different type of rolls and split them. The Italian rolls with Marinara sauce and the spinach with marinara and garlic ranch. Everything tasted great and the garlic ranch topped it all off. We were there when the Pens game started and it was nice to have the tvs change but the audio wasn't blaring like it can be at a lot of places. We will be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here.  We will  be spending a lot time in the Pittsburgh area the next several months and have been trying out as many different places as we could.  I found this place from other Yelp Reviews and couldn't wait to try it out.  We sought this place out amongst a little strip of shops, snuggled in right next to an auto shop, with its black awning setting itself apart.  We sat at the bar when we got there and the bartenders were great, multiple of them....  They were very attentative, even answering questions we had as we were just mumbling amongst ourselves.    We ordered chicken rolls ( chicken, cheese, bacon), some chips and cheese, and some grilled chicken.   The menu had quite a few options from salmon to salads to pizza and more.  Just about anything you would like.  Sitting at the bar, there are four TV's set in a square so you can watch from any seat.... there is also a dining room.   They have different specials every day of the week as well as events.... I would check them out if you are looking for  a good time to hang out with some friends and drink some beers and have good munchies."}
{"text":"Spinach rolls...are the best in town...food there is great .  Try their garlic ranch ...the best around...I love them."}
{"text":"Well, I would like to say that it was the food, but since I was ignored by the wait staff for almost 45 minutes, I couldn't tell you. Repeated attempts to grab the attention of both servers in the non bar area and the bus boy and any other employee were ignored. I'd understand if the place was busy-even if it was half full!  But, there were 3 other occupied tables in my half of the place-the remaining 8 were vacant.  I tried to stop at the bar to let them know or talk to a manager, but got ignored there, too. I travel all over the country and have yet to experience this amount of disinterest from a team.  Very frustrated and off to find someplace else for an even later meal before heading to my hotel."}
{"text":"My friend and I came from Cranberry Township just to get out of town for a little bit and ended up at this place. What a gem. We love it so much Chelsea and Marie were great and we are actually going back tonight for the live band. Even if you are allergic to pepperoni..get the pepperoni rolls they're that good! #upscaleDiveBar  if you are yuppy and upscale and whiny...do not go there. you won't like them, they won't like you. try olive garden"}
{"text":"Another first timer for us. I remember when this place was Gabby Joe's. It has a dining room and bar. The dining room is seperated enough from the bar that the noise isn't an issue.  Wednesday is .45 wing night and the wings were nice size pieces. The hot-honey sauce was good but I didn't really taste the honey. The mild were good as were the BBQ.  The hamburger was fantastic and the reuben was killer. Side slaws were very tasty also.  They have an extensive menu consisting of grilled cheese to veal parm and lots of appetizers from zucchini to pepperoni rolls which are homemade and supposedly to die for.  I can't wait to return again and attack something else on the menu."}
{"text":"A new chilled glass with every beer. Sign me up!  I had a mix of pepperoni rolls.  One was the regular pepperoni and the other was the Italian mix. We all loved them. Truly delicious!  Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant during our travel to Pittsburg. My wife and my child raved about dishes here after eating.  First of all, all of the dishes we ordered were awesome!! This restaurant serves traditional American dishes. Regarding Italian roll, the taste was addictive, especially with garlic source. Impressive!  Second, size of dishes were enough for us ?2 adults and 8 years old boy?as a dinner. However, it was really reasonable price. Salad and rolls were around $11 each. Prime rib was around $24.  Finally, staff were so friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. Loudy, but comfortable enviroment. Old, but clean.  Totally, I would like to give 5 stars to this restaurant. We hope to be back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Arrived with a party of twenty which later grew.   Excellent service from our waitress Mia. She was helpful with beer and food selections and handled separate checks and orders with ease.  She was prompt on all our needs.   Everyone raved about her service.     Food was nicely portioned and arrived correctly.  Tasty meals and a wide selection of food was ordered.    Can't say enough of how this was a great experience for us with food and service.   Great job kitchen and waitstaff!"}
{"text":"Tried Downey's House while staying at the Courtyard Marriott on business. Directly across from the Courtyard Marriott you have a mall with all of the chain restaurants you would expect, PF Changs ect. I prefer something more local and real, Downey's hit the spot. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive, friendly and attractive. They have a good selection of beer. I ordered the pan fried veal with salad and a side of pasta. A solid portion, the food was fresh and good. After my meal I walked around a little and discovered they have a huge outdoor bar behind the place that was packed with 20, 30 & 40 somethings enjoying the great weather, corn hole games and music. It was a really fun atmosphere and it was great being outside having a few drinks. If your looking for good food, a upbeat staff and a fun atmosphere the Downy's House is the place. I know why the locals love this place so much, now I do too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"They took 15 minutes to get me a burger with some celery and  humus.  I asked for a regular hamburger bun and they gave me the biscuit instead.  This is my first time going to the restaurant."}
{"text":"The first time I was there I had a cold so I  was like whatever... The next time I went I was wowed...         It's a cool place walk into a bar setting then u got to the back room type of deal that's the dinning area... Every day they have weekly specials that are the same except Thursday its different cause that's nationality day...         Do you like pepperoni rolls..? I do, and I ordered them as an appetizer here and they came out in individual little meat ball looking rolls ...it was great      I'll be going back soon..."}
{"text":"long wait for old lettuce, cold mashed potatos, artificial gravy, little roast beef,french fries were ok on no price marked monday special cost $35 for the two of us."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, great pub food, fun atmosphere.  It's a dive bar without being a real dive.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Best fish sandwich in town. The separation between the dining room and bar is nice if you just wanna enjoy the good food.  Anytime I've been here to drink, it's been a good time! Definitely one of the best bar/restaurants In Robinson"}
{"text":"Top notch dive bar!! All reviews spot on. Pepperoni rolls...awesome!!! Fried zucchini, server recommendation, dynamite! Sausage stuffed hot peppers to die for!!! Great staff and food. Recommend whenever in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had the Italian Rolls stuffed with Pepperoni, salami, capicola, and mozzarella... served with house made marinara sauce... Sucked down two before I thought to take a picture... Where have these been my whole life? These gems are available on Friday and Saturday nights only,  My better half had a well portioned broiled cod plate with two large filets that was more than she could eat, very tasty but she did dress them up with some marinara.  We went Saturday afternoon and there was a good number of locals enjoying a late lunch early dinner. We missed the prime rib and band by a couple of hours but will work on that next time, well at least the prime rib, the band starts after my bed time.  Service was great and super friendly, there was a separate dining area as well as booths and  high pub tables surrounding the bar. The dance floor was under some of those tables in front of the stage so I'm sure there's a little rearranging when the band get rocking...  All in all a great experience and would recommend to anyone looking for scratch made comfort food and a few cold ones to fill in an afternoon that flows into the evening entertainment..."}
{"text":"I popped in to order pepperoni rolls to go since I had heard they were fantastic. I ordered with a waitress and got a drink while I waited.  The place was packed, which is great, especially on a Friday night. It didn't take long for my pepperoni rolls to come out. I paid my tab prior to them being done. I got a side of marinara, ranch and garlic ranch aoili with my food. Wow. Fantastic pepperoni rolls!  Garlic ranch aoili delicious! Only downside is the marinara tastes like it comes out of a store bought jar. Other than that, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a great experience. Service good but food was not good. Ordered fish sandwich as recommended by server. Large portion of soggy greasy fish on a stale bun. No lettuce or tomato to help it. Ate less than 1/4. Typical frozen to fryer mushrooms and fries that were less than stellar.  Just a big bland waste."}
{"text":"Downey's House is a local watering hole that I've been to a handful of times. We've only ever sat at the bar (both indoor & outdoor) and we've had decent service each time. The food, especially the garlic, spinach, and pepperoni rolls are quite tasty. I'm looking foward to the weather warming back up so we can enjoy the outdoor bar more. They have bands play, I think, a few nights a week.   One word of caution: I don't think the same service levels can be expected for the tables. I have seen people looking anxious and twice we've seen people just move to the bar after a few minutes of no servers showing up."}
{"text":"very nice environment and off the main road but the food was really good. Try bacon roll :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Don't think I've had one thing we havnt liked. The Long Islands are great too depending on the bartender."}
{"text":"The spinach rolls w garlic ranch were delicious. The fish and Mac n cheese were just ok. But the service was great. A manager asked us to meet be from a six top to a smaller table cause there was only two of us. We didn't mind and he was very grateful. He was chatty and friendly as our waitress was too. I would definitely try it again."}
{"text":"At first glance it looks a little divey...located in an older strip mall.  Do not let that fool you!  Food is very tasty with a huge menu to please everyone but most important get the pepperoni rolls or spinach roll with garlic ranch...you won't regret it!  There are made with fresh pizza dough to order.  Portions on all of their food is pretty large so you definitely won't leave hungry! Pretty decent beer selection too with all the standards but some rotating craft beers on tap and in bottle.  Bar area can get a little noisy and crowded, especially during games and the bar service sometimes is a little slow.  There is a dining room too and I've noticed is usually and older senior citizen crowd and some families.  Regardless of where you sit you can get the full menu though.  If you are looking for a relaxed environment with a lot of food choices check this place out."}
{"text":"Local spot tucked away between the connector of Robinson and Crafton. This local restaurant /bar is absolutely awesome! I've only been 3 times, but each time the food has been top notch Italian, large portions, good drinks, great prices, and nice place to watch the games.   First game of trivia I've ever won so this spot has a special place in my heart. There is a restaurant portion and a bar that are totally separated... the restaurant is more family/private/ quiet/ friends/ trivia-zone environment while the bar area is- well a bar area!   The theme is definitely more rustic and is very clean. Service is good, portions are big, and quality pizza and pizza rolls(i love the spinach/mozza rolls) the rolls are honestly a 5/5. Pizza is a 4/5, I ordered a seafood and veggie pizza on different occasions. Let's just say the veggie pizza took about 45 mins and I wasn't even mad, you can't rush quality bro... even if it takes too long!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We were looking for a lunch place in Robinson whenever we found Downeys.  It's located right on Steubenville Pike and if you are like me then you have probably driven by it numerous times without ever knowing that it was there.  Whenever we arrived we saw a sign that said seat yourself and so we choose a high top table for 4.  Besides our table and others like it there was also a large square shaped bar and seats in this area along with a number of TVs.  After we were seated we realized that we were in the bar area and that there was also a dining area available.  For lunch on this day I decided to go with the fire in the hole chicken sandwich with a side of celery and hummus.  I loved that they had a huge selection of sides that were both healthy like the hummus as well as unhealthy like the onion straws.  The menu described the sandwich as a chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese, bacon and jalepenos with a spicy siracha ranch.  Whenever our meals came out to us I quickly delved into the chicken sandwich.  The chicken inside was moist and I loved the addition of the bacon but I completely missed any of the spice of the sandwich.  While I know that a ton of spice isn't for everyone, if you are going to name a sandwich \"fire in the hole\", you should probably bring some heat.  As for the side of hummus, it came with celery and was overflowing its cup.  It ended up being an ok hummus but I don't know that it's a hummus I would have bought in the store as it was pretty bland.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  While the food here wasn't bad, it really let me down on spice and seasoning which is a shame since I was pretty excited about this meal."}
{"text":"Great pepperoni rolls! Happy hour starts at 5 and the apps are only $5! It gets really crowded for pens playoff games. The place is big enough to accommodate a lot of large groups. There is also an outside patio area, but it doesn't open until around the beginning of may. It's a nice place overall and worth trying."}
{"text":"Best service in the robinson area.  The rolls are so good we are considering buying them for our rehearsal dinner that is out of state.  I feel as comfortable there as I do in my own home.  Last visit tony bought us an appetizer which turned my day completely around without him knowing I was having such a bad day.  Every menu item comes with a big serving of flavor with their special ingredient being heart.  When my family comes out this way from Armstrong county this is our spot and will continue to be forever.  Love the place."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The waitresses I've had here were all super sweet. I'm from the area and never really heard of this place, but we gave it a shot one night and the food was great! Cool environment as well, sometimes they have bands playing or karaoke. The salads here are some of the best too"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Owners are great and staff is super friendly. Never had a bad meal and we eat here about four times a month!"}
{"text":"This is a local favorite of ours!  We usually eat here once a week. Pepperoni rolls are the best! Especially with the garlic ranch on the side. Pizza, wings, Italian hoagie are all great.   Only complaint is their dining area. Seating is very limited. Also, you have to walk through the bar area to get to the dining room. Not ideal atmosphere for the little ones."}
{"text":"Pepperoni rolls were delicious.  They have a nice selection on their menu with burgers, wraps, subs, and entrees."}
{"text":"I like to visit local establishments when I travel and I hit the motherload with this place. Sure, there are tons of chain restaurants in this area, but why would anyone what to go there when you could visit this family run bar/restaurant that is sure to please. Living in NYC now, this reminded me of my home town. I got there about 5pm on a Friday thinking I'd beat the happy hour crowd. Boy was I wrong! There was no seats left at the bar and there was only one bar table left (I didn't want to sit in the restaurant area). Service was great, food came quickly and the burger was delicious. People watching was great with patrons from 8 to 80.The Friday fish fry brings out the locals for both eat in and takeout. The only downside is the parking lot which is a bit small area in an oddly shaped strip mall."}
{"text":"Downey's is a no-frills, classic bar and restaurant that has delicious food and friendly bartenders. Great beer selection - while they have a limited draft selection, they keep a large variety of bottled beer. This has probably been said time and time again in the reviews, but TRY THE ROLLS! The spinach rolls, add chicken, with garlic ranch are my absolute favorite. Bring gum if you're on a date or are within three feet of anyone, because that garlic ranch is potent. So worth it, though."}
{"text":"It's alright not my first choice the waitress we had didn't make you feel comfortable she was non stop back and forth don't get me wrong I know there supposed to check on your table but she was really up our Ass I'm sorry but when I go out I like some personal space. I know you have to give good tips and I do. Here's a tip to all servers Please do not hurry your tables out that is so rude and they make you do that because that's how you make your tips the more people you wait on. If they rush me I don't tip. #keepthatinmind"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and I had the hot turkey sandwich with chicken and chili soup. It was awesome. I would definitely go back. And the pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and watch a game or even just have a few drinks. The service is really good and the food is amazing.  I had the Ruben turkey sandwich and was really impressed on how great it tasted. The bartender were right in point even tho the bar was packed. I found my favorite spot to go to."}
{"text":"This was a great find.  I wanted to have a couple drinks somewhere not far from my hotel (Holiday Inn Express) and I saw this place on Yelp.  Lots of beer choices, specials each day and many choices on the menu.  I went with the Meatball Dish which was listed as a lighter choice.  I don't know if I'd believe it is light, but maybe compared to the other dishes.  But it was delicious.  The picture doesn't look like it, but it was a large portion.  The server was fun and she checked on us often.  Lots of nice tvs for sports and fun music was playing the entire time."}
{"text":"Great food. We've passed by this plaza so many times and never knew that Downey house was even there. I was looking for a place with good fish and this place came up on Yelp and after seeing exactly where it was we decided to try it out. It is a very nice setup with a nice bar with plenty of seating and hightop tables and a separate dining room. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful with menu suggestion. We mentioned never having been there and they brought out some of their pepperoni rolls for us to try and like so many reviewers said they were unbelievably good,  we would go back for them alone. I had to get the fish sandwich since that is what lead me to them and it was a truly memorable sandwich, juicy with a great breading and the size was so BIG one of the options is an extra bun. My wife ordered the Philly cheese steak that she said good. I can honestly say that we will definitely be returning there."}
{"text":"A little history: I come from a town of pepperoni roll fanatics. A town where each pizza shop has their own version of the \"roni roll\" and every citizen takes a hard stand on which pizza shop does it best. In high school I ate a pepperoni roll every day for lunch. So you can say that pepperoni rolls literally shaped me into the woman I am today.   With that being said, Downey's has the best roni rolls I've ever tasted. Hands down, the debate is over. I've never tasted a better cheese, dough, pepperoni combo in my life. Hand-made dough is rolled and cut into perfectly sized portions and then toasted so that the cheese melts and spills out just a little bit. The pepperoni was very flavorful and when paired with the garlic ranch dipping sauce, I swear I saw a glimpse of what heaven is like.   Drinks were reasonably priced, the service was good, and the atmosphere was great (we were there during a hockey game and the NFL draft. There are lots of T.V.'s) My husband's burger was okay, but nothing compared to my rolls.   We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really don't have any cons for this place. The service was great even though they were busy and the food was fantastic. We all had various burgers which are huge and we had to try the pepperoni rolls and they were the best. My kids asked if we could sometimes come just for pepperoni rolls, now mind you we live 90 minutes away. My kids also gave it 5 stars and you know how picky (9 and 11) year olds  can be. And the manager came over just to check on his."}
{"text":"Went back and had the buffalo wrap and my husband and I split chicken tenders! Love this place! The patio is a must in the summer!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  I had the steak salad and my husband had the stuffed peppers.  Loved the \"Cheers\" feel this place had.  Lots of people knew one another and the staff was great.  Thanks for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Great gem which is quite tucked away. Fabulous turkey wraps full of tasty meat wrapped in a flavorful tortilla shell. Pepperoni Rolls thick with pepperoni and an amazing ranch dipping sauce. Service is excellent also. Address is Mckees Rocks but not really that far down Steubenville Pike from Campbell's Run. Definitely worth the extra few minutes drive away from the nonsense at Robinson."}
{"text":"Cheap and unreal. The best rolls you can get anywhere in town. A great place to drink and bring the family for food."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 2.5 but you can't give half stars.. so two it is. Pretty nice bar/restaurant. Their pepperoni rolls were great with the garlic ranch (must try). My husband got the fire in the hole chicken sandwich which he loved, and I got the Buffalo wrap with BBQ sauce instead of Buffalo. Also very good! The reason for the review of 2 is because we ordered the pepperoni rolls as soon as we put our drink orders in, but they came out with our food. I specifically asked for no tomato on my wrap (twice), and my husband did too, except I got stuck with tomatoes- which made my plate watery from the tomato juice. I sent my order back because I was so adamant about no tomatoes that I wasn't going to ruin my meal over picking them off. After getting my wrap back- I only had a wrap- my fries were gone and I was not given any more. The first few I had while waiting for the waitress to come back and check on the table were good- but can't believe they took my fries back.... really? Topping it off was getting a box and the waitress swooped up the plate with the last pepperoni roll on it (which was going in the box) before we could notice- bye pepperoni roll... overall if you want good food but expect a little disappointment even when asking to have things correct- this is your spot."}
{"text":"The young male bartender is always friendly and totally competent. There is a younger girl with dark hair who clearly hates her life and job and takes it out on everyone. She is so rude and cranky. Watch out for her. Never ate here but the outdoor bar is fun and laid back."}
{"text":"Great food good prices if you get pepperoni roll or any of the others make sure you get the garlic ranch dip"}
{"text":"The service here was ABYSMAL. We sat at the bar with dirty plates and empty glasses in front of us for an hour and half. The bartenders were more concerned about flirting and dancing with the guy patrons than refilling our drinks and taking care of us. I literally had to walk our check over to a dancing bartender to ask to be rung out so we could leave. Bottom line: don't expect to get good service here unless you're a young, attractive dude."}
{"text":"The Best Food here! The fish sandwich is my favorite! You cannot beat the pizza or chicken roll appetizers!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local bar in the area! Great, home-cooked food, decent beer selection and excellent service! Must tries include the spinach rolls, the chicken cheddar rolls and the fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to try. The ratings and reviews looked good, so I gave it a try. Not sure why this place got rated the way it did. Nothing special. Low quality. Over priced bar food. You can still see the flour on the breaded zucchini. Charged a dollar for a teeny weeny extra side of sauce. Iceberg salad wedge had way too much  smoked bacon. The smoke flavor was overwhelming. The bacon was greasy.  Only ate a third of the salad.   Atmosphere: restaurant with bar right there while you eat. Kinda dirty. In need of remodeling."}
{"text":"Bar review only: on a Wednesday night, the bar was pretty full of folks, tables were half full. I liked that it was pretty crowded on a week night. I enjoyed getting top notch service from the bartender (5 stars!!).  They also have really good music from a live DJ until 2 am. That was an added plus!! I like it when bars have DJs instead of the radio on. The DJ also offered karaoke, and it was super fun watching brave people belt out familiar tunes."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great bartender.  Great owners.  Always something good.  Lots of beers. Fantastic pepperoni rolls.  Get the garlic ranch.  You'll be free of vampires for days, bot oh so tasty."}
{"text":"This place, put simply, is great! Nestled away from busy Robinson and all the chain restaurants, this local joint has a lot to offer from great tasting food and specials, drinks, and a lively, but homey, atmosphere.   This was my second return here and I came in a group of 6 people. We were comfortably seated on the section aside from the bar. We had a great waitress who was friendly, courteous, and quick to service all of our needs.   The food were ordered ranged from the meatball sub, buffalo chicken wrap, to the tuna salad sandwich. We were all satisfied and liked the favor of our food. There's one thing I do remember from the first time I visited here, the pepperoni rolls. Save yourself the regret not ordering, and order them! Get them with the garlic ranch, it's seriously the bomb!   Lastly, one of the reasons why this place is so great is because of the reasonable prices of the food. For 6 people, under $80 not including tip. That should make any family happy. :-)"}
{"text":"Thete is nothing special about this place. It is just your regular neighborhood bar with a lot of regulars and friendly staff. The crowd is very child out and more towards the nature side (35-50), so if your in your 20's and want a wild place, this definitely isn't for you. I absolutely enjoyed my conversation with the folks at the bar and the bar tender and the food was pretty good to..all in all, comfortable environment, great food and a busy patio with a pool table makes this joint a must visit if your in the area"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice atmosphere! I would suggest the spinach roll ups and the fried zucchini"}
{"text":"This place was a blast to eat at. The staff are very friendly and the food is outstanding. Ever since I moved out here I've really enjoyed diners more often and honestly never knew this one was here. If you are looking for great food I'd recommend trying this one out."}
{"text":"Wasn't always my favorite, but has really turned the corner.  Real food and real people.  New menu.  My son is a big fan of the pizza and we all love the wedding soup.  Surprisingly good baked fish dinners.  The zucchini is the best ever.  We generally stop in for a fairly early Saturday dinner after church and find it to be very family friendly.  Friday nights can be quite different, however, with lots of noise and music.  Not bad, but different.  Great fish sandwich too.  Generally very good service."}
{"text":"I had doubts about this place from the outside but the food was amazing!! Pepperoni rolls were everything I wanted them to be. I got the Italian chicken and it was the most moist and juicy chicken I ever had at a restaurant. The bread even appeared to be home made! My husband had the chicken parm and he enjoyed that too. We will be back!"}
