{"text":"I crave Ono from time to time.  I wish it was closer to my apartment.  I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance, because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive.  My boyfriend is more adventurous than me, and he literally always is in the mood to go here.  He especially enjoys the spare ribs, bbq combo, and the spam musubi.  We both love the macaroni salad...  I get why someone said there was too much mayo, and I guess by some standards it's a little plain, but that's what I like about it.  People who say the rice is boring are obviously right, but they're forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it.  It's plain white rice, guys, what do you think it's going to taste like?  

They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.  

Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.  Awesome."}
{"text":"This place was always our favorites, but lately the service and environment has been terrible. This used to be a nice environment that made us feel home with the food we grew up eating. The last few times we've been there the food was  not satisfying at all & there's a weird sewage smell that won't go away 

The service was normally good but the young cashier with glasses always has a rude attitude when we get there. I don't know what the problem is but it's always something with my family. 

I wouldn't recommend this place, it was a good place to eat but now overall the service & food is not authentic Hawaiian. I would give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ok service. Hit or miss, sometimes cashier is nice and patient, other times they obviously want you to move along.

Chicken katsu and bbq beef are our faves. Katsu is hit or miss as well. Some batches are soft and golden deep fried, other times crispy and too dark brown.

This is where we go when we don't have time to cook"}
{"text":"Excellent Hawaiian plate lunch! Mac salad always my favorite! Been to Hawaii several times and this place gives me the opportunity to revisit cheaper than a flight."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times have been great. Lucklily the times I have gone they weren't really busy and I got served right away. I sat in the dinning area with one other couple but a lot of people came to pick up orders when I was there. I ordered the teriyaki chicken plate both times. I LOVE the slaw salad. The dressing on there is the bomb!  I wish you got more salad. The food is average prices and you get a large portion. Both times I had plenty left to take home. I understand a lot of people take out, but I think it would be nice if for dine in there would be real dishes, not Styrofoam containers and plastic forks. Would add quality points. Everything tasted wonderful, including the wontons I got. Better than at a Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place really is the most authentic \"plate lunch\" place I've found in Phoenix and Tucson.  I am from Hawaii and while nothing compares to what we have down there, Ono's isn't bad. 

The menu is somewhat limited.  I usually get the Hawaiian BBQ Mix plate and the beef and chicken are always tender.  I like how they have a hot teri sauce dispenser so you can put it on top of your rice or dip your meat in it.  The katsu is really good quality--made with good pieces of chicken and the breading is crisp and not greasy at all.  The katsu sauce is crap though...it's a weird, watered down mess.  The katsu curry is good, not like Hawaiian style curry that much but delicious with a little kick to it.  Loco moco is good, I don't know how they make the hamburger but it's moist and tender and flavorful.  

I'd recommend this place to any Islanders out there in PHX...it's way better than L & L and you get bigger portions.  Sometimes the rice isn't cooked right, but hey that happens even in Hawaii.  Musubi is a good snack, too...they aren't stingy on the nori or the rice.  

Overall, pretty good place when you're missing home and 'ono for some plate lunch."}
{"text":"Ono Hawaiian BBQ at the Power & LP 202 location is the location closest to where we live and when we don't want to cook local Hawaii food, Ono's was the place to go! But after several visits, I'm very disappointed. The service is terrible! Both my Wife and I was dying for some plates like the BBQ combination and the curry katsu. And you gotta get Spam musibi's! Well, we tried to make a phone order the person who took the phone order told my Wife that they were too busy and weren't excepting phone orders. I was like WTF!? and thought it was weird. I just told my Wife I was dying for some Kalbi short ribs so I'll just order at the restaurant. When I got there, the place wasn't even busy. Yes, there were people enjoying their meals and MAYBE, when we tried to place our order they WERE busy. So I placed my order, sat and waited for it to be ready. While waiting, their phone rang and I over heard the cashier explain some of the entrees they offered. Well it sounded like the person on the phone wanted to place an order so the cashier says there's a long line so we can't take phone orders and hung up. I looked around and there was no long line! I don't know if the two cashiers were lazy or what but that was an outright lie! Mind you, I even tried calling them to try and place an order but I got a number for a fax machine the first time and no answer the second time. Let me make this clear, someone picked up but it was like I was placed on hold! I was kind of pissed at this point! And to top it off, my Wife's Katsu Curry plate had the Katsu, but NO CURRY! This no curry in the Katsu Curry is he second time they forgot to put the curry in our plates!

If you're dying for local Hawaii food and don't want to cook it yourself, Ono's will provide... expect them to not pick up their phone if you want to call in your order or screwing up on your order...Ono's is hit or miss and this time, for my family and I, it was a total miss! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, friendly staff and quick service. Had the katsu and chicken combo. Lunch was delicious. Good place for a quick lunch and break from the regular fanfare."}
{"text":"I love their kalua pork and the macaroni salad. I am a big fan of this place and I will definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Place was empty, maybe it's because the food's not great, or perhaps it's because the girl at the counter doesn't know how to crack a smile and seems disinterested in creating a pleasant customer experience. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I've eaten here since they opened and have never had a bad meal.  The chicken katsu is always hot.  The spam musubi is good here though nothing special.

The regular size menu items are large enough for 2 sensible meals.  
I love the fact that their more popular meals are available in \"mini-meal\" versions that give you just the right amount of food."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...I started out reading other reviews of this place and I'm thinking that maybe a 2nd visit is in order.  Our experience was definitely not like others.

We stopped by here for lunch.  $5 lunch special includes your entree, 2 scoops of rice, veggies and a small drink.  We both got the BBQ chicken ... the boneless chicken portion was small, the rice was good and  the veggies consisted of cabbage (and that's it!).

We were greeted by a woman on the phone who hung up only long enough to take our order and then returned to the phone.  Since we were the only ones in the place (at 12pm!!), I wondered if her conversation was meant to be entertainment?

Considering this place is next door to several other really good restaurants, I can't help but wonder why anyone would choose this particular establishment instead of one of the others?

Ample free parking, cause it's a shopping center.  Would we return? I don't know.  Would I recommend?  I just don't know.

If we decide to give this place a second chance, I'll update my review."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST orange chicken and BBQ beef I've ever had! Staff was all smiles at 8pm. Even the white rice was sticky and delicious. A must try."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, this place is at the top of my list.  Its always fresh and it is a treat compared to other food choices.  I'd never really had Hawaiian food before and didn't quite know what to expect the first time I went here.  But its really pretty much like comfort food.  And I love it.  

But the real reason that I'm throwing 4 stars out is because today is the first day that I went there for lunch and the special is a screaming deal.  I got the Katsu Chicken and the portion was huge for $5.49.  My only regret is that I haven't tried more on the menu because the few things that I stick with are always wonderful."}
{"text":"Honestly, customer service here is GREAT, specifically today, Joshua really impressed me! Friendly and everything I would want in an employee! Food is great, always fast and consistent."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been going here for a couple years now and it never disappoints. 

The seafood Mix is my go to but pretty much all the combos are good. The spam masubi is a must and the macaroni is my favorite part of each combo."}
{"text":"The BBQ mix is the bomb! You get all the good stuff, rice, and macaroni. The soda prices are pretty high and they don't have many drink options, but the meat is the best you will find. I use to eat here almost every day. If you want takeout, call ahead 15 minutes and pick up or you will be stuck sitting at one of the tables waiting awkwardly in everyone's way. Food is well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.... I told the cashier that it was my first time and asked for assistance with the most popular meal.  The customer service here was terrible and I had to pay for two separate orders to complete my meal. The food was decent, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location for a few years now and Love the bbq mix, they are always consistent. Food is always good."}
{"text":"This might actually be the worst place to eat within a 10 mile radius. And there's a McDonald's close by. Don't order the masubi. It's dog crap....literally. Don't order the \"Fire\" chicken....Because it's about as spicy as Betty White in Frederick's lingerie. And don't order anything made of \"beef\" because it might actually be...well... Not beef."}
{"text":"Ill probably come back and try it again. I had the lunch plate of Katsu Chicken with the pineapple sauce. After I added more rice and a ton of Tapatio sauce it was delicious. 

It was about $7.50 and the lady on the phone said \"Aloha!\" which just made me laugh. Come on, we're in the middle of the desert!

Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm at Ono on duty tonight, kinda busy NO sauces both empty? Lots of sticky soda on the floor. Both table I stood waiting a to go order have sticky food on them icky for sure. Staff is nice tho and smiles while being polite. I'll be back KDS"}
{"text":"So disppointed......Stopped for the first time because i read the reviews saw the pictures of good looking food...paid 12.00 and change for a combination so I could experience the restaurant; so disappointed, wish I would have looked before I drove all the way home.  It smelled good, I thought yum. Until I opened the container to find a lit of rice and lettuce with one small piece of white fish, and about 7 ...1\" in length pieces of chicken with a few onions...wow!  $12.00 for .75 worth of meat and a whole container if of rice and lettuce with the blandest so-called house dressing that had the flavor of lettuce and water.  What a waste of my hard earned money. Wish I had taken a picture but then I spent the day at the hospital for a friends surgery and had missed lunch and thought from the pictures I'd have maybe enough for one meal and left overs?! Well I have plenty of lettuce and rice...but I dont have a rabbit. Will not be stopping there again."}
{"text":"While visiting the area we stumbled across this restaurant.  We got the BBQ mix #4. The meat so good! And the mac salad...yes! Am so glad we stopped by here on a whim!"}
{"text":"I had gone here once before, long time ago, and it did not make a huge impression.  Then I was invited by a friend to go again and loved what I ordered.  The BBQ beef strips...very good...and I am a fan of the Macaroni Salad.  I will be going back for some BBQ beef and rice...very good...could not stop chowing down."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the food, as the overwhelming smell of sewage forced me to leave before I could order. We instead went next door to \"On the Grill\""}
{"text":"Figured we would try this place. Something new. And, oh my god. It was just so delicious. We ordered the family meal. It took about 5 minutes to get through the drive through. And that was waiting behind someone also..great drive through cashier. Great service. Food tasted absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have been back in a long time, and I must say that I'm pleasantly surprised at how much better my experience was compared to past visits. Everything had started great with both food and service but things changed and I had stepped back from visiting as much.
I used to work at the Harkin's next door and used to stop in when this place had first opened on breaks and after shifts and the lady that had worked here at opening was awesome. She was so friendly and really cared about the people that came in and the food was always great. It has always been slow to arrive to me though. That is one thing that has not changed at all. Then, she and a few of the better employees left and it all started to decline.
The newer manager was never around and all the regular cashiers were always miserable to deal with. Always seemed like I was an annoyance, because they needed to do something when I came in. They also took some things off of the menu which I was really upset about. My favorite, the Loco Moco was removed and I have yet to find somewhere that makes it just as well, or better than here. The quality of the rest of the menu took a slight down turn as well. The chicken always seem to have those strange pieces that you couldn't handle chewing after you found it, and the BBQ beef would sometimes have chunks of just fat.
The items on the menu that never changed and stayed good are the chicken katsu, short ribs, island fire chicken, and the spam musubi.
I eventually left the theater and found other places to eat and hadn't been back there in probably a solid year and a half, but I went back last night because I was really craving those short ribs.
It was great. The food that is. The service still left a little to be desired, especially with the amount of people that were in there(which was more than I ever remembered being in there before). There were two of them sitting at the round tables and one got up, took our order, then went and sat back down after she told us it'd be 6-8 minutes for the food, My immediate thought was to laugh, but I grabbed my sauces from the counter and sat down quietly. Even though it was 10-13 minutes that it took, it was a lot faster than I thought it would be and it was still warm when I got it home, even after a small detour.
All in all I will probably start coming back because that food really is quite good. The BBQ beef this time wasn't as fatty as it's been in the past, the BBQ chicken was free of strange pieces and that short rib is just so good. Everything was really flavorful and if you do try them out I recommend getting rice in place of the \"veggies\" because all that is, is steamed cabbage, and pouring Katsu sauce over the rice instead of soy sauce. It's got a really great flavor."}
{"text":"Little bit greasy food but great people and service. Wish their service could be little quicker but good food and clean dining area."}
{"text":"Island Curry Chicken was better than I expected! Food came out hot, fast, and in to-go boxes because they know you might not finish the huge amount of food they provide. My fiancé and I were craving Hawaiian bbq and this was the only place open at 7:30pm on a Sunday. I highly recommend this place if you want your island bbq fix."}
{"text":"I love the macaroni its the best. I always get the katsu chicken so if thats what you want to try i recommend it"}
{"text":"Ono is good Hawai'i fare. The meats are so, so good and the sauces are perfect. They have an awesome family meal that hits the spot for two big stomachs or about four little ones. On top of that, I recommend the spam musubi. You may have grown up thinking spam is nasty, but Ono makes it taste amazing. This place earns all four stars!"}
{"text":"Place sucks. Food isn't that good employees can't get orders right and manager is no help. Second star for food being just alright."}
{"text":"Okay so I went in last week and loved the food! I decided to go last night for dinner and was sadly disappointed this time. Let's start by saying the employees were goofing off the whole time and couldn't remember who ordered what. I told my boyfriend we needed to check our food before we left but forgot (pregnant brain). We get home and everything looks delicious that is until I take a bite of my rice. There was a huge very hard piece of something that instantly made me spit it out as it hurt my teeth. Upon inspection and digging through the rest of my rice I realize that this is plastic...and it wasn't in just one bite. I had pieces of melted hard plastic all throughout my rice and my meal was ruined. I'm not too sure how this could've happened and was very shocked. Definitely not what a 6 month pregnant woman wants to eat for dinner on a Thursday night and surely not safe. I don't think I'll be back after that which is really a shame :("}
{"text":"My first visit is my last time there. I ordered a bbq mix w/katsu plate and there was very little to be desired about this meal. The katsu chicken was over cooked to the point that the breading was extremely crunchy and dark brown, not a light golden color with flaky breading. The chicken meat was very dry due to the moisture being fried out. The teri-beef was dry/tough and teri-chicken had no flavor. 

I gave this restaurant two stars instead of one because the mac salad was pretty good, the restaurant was very clean and appealing, and the employees were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened here....we use to love this place.  But the last couple of visits was not the same!  They reduced the amount of food on their entrees.  I remember the first time I went, the bbq combo had 3 pieces of ribs, 3 pieces of chicken and a bunch of beef slices.  

Last year, they reduced the amount...2 pieces of rib, 2 pieces of chicken, and a few pieces of beef.  

Last week, there was 1 piece of rib,  2 pieces of chicken and 4 slices of beef!

Totally cut their food cost down half!  

Also, they don't serve good tea anymore.  

I guess we are done with them for awhile..."}
{"text":"Little dirty everywhere. The place isn't being kept up. Water from the fountain tastes like cleaning chemicals but the lady at the counter \"can't do nothin' 'bout that.\"  Expensive for what you get and slow service as already stated.  
The food wasn't bad but I didn't have flashbacks of the islands, either.  Except maybe some dive in Pearl City.  Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"food here is amazing and priced just right.  if you are looking for great BBQ to go or dine in, this is the place. Looks ok and clean. many establishments for shopping are close by."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time you get alot of food for a good price. The teriyaki chicken is very good. There macaroni salad is the best I've tasted out of the few island places I've had in the area. The crab puffs are also very good."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here, my fav dish is the BBQ mix. Unfortunately I work early, when I take my lunch it's still closed."}
{"text":"First impressions mean everything and this first time here will likely be the last. Not impressed with my takeout order since they forgot to give me the shrimp that I ordered with my meal. Customer service was poor as cashiers were not attentive to front of the store and customers but rather have backs turned and playing on phones. Place was nice and clean but staff needs to get on board if they want to stay ahead of local competition. Food was not great and for a $10 plate I only liked the chicken and didn't care for the bed of cabbage that floated with juices from the meat. If you are looking for bbq check out another place. ** shrimp were really gd though lol"}
{"text":"Chicken katsu was warm, rice was cold! ..Instead of 2 scoop rice, I had 2 small half scoops. I was given a half scoop of macaroni salad too..  ! Iv'e been going back there trying to give them another chance, but only been let down time & time again.. The counter girl was engaged in a trivial conversation with her boy friend, while I waited & waited for service. She was so lazy that the tables had crap on them that she didn't bother to clean up & it wasn't even busy! I won't go there anymore. I will go to Aloha kitchen where I'm treated well & the food is hot and consistently great!  Shame on  the owner who owns the 3923 E Thomas store!"}
{"text":"The chicken is ALWAYS under cooked. Just 5 more min on the flattop and it would be great. This location has very boring employees, no sense of welcoming for a guest in their restaurant. Boring and rehersed speech, no sense of urgency getting your food to you. I waited like 7 or 8 min longer than it usually takes. Im never in here more than 4 min and I have my food, but lately its been lax. I would give one star but the food tasted ok so the get that, just cook it longer."}
{"text":"Delicious. It's nothing special inside and sometimes it smells of disinfectant, but I enjoy the food. Get it to go. They accommodate my substituting salad for rice and the barbecue chicken is delicious. We also enjoy the island fire chicken. I'd pass on the kalbi short ribs, though. It's a lot of food, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"I have three for sures here. My favorite is the  grilled curry chicken. My other two stand bys are the Hawaiian BBQ mix and the Kahlua pork. The beef noodle soup is also worth a try. Good portions at an acceptable price."}
{"text":"My bf and I ate here for the first time today ... I ordered lemon pepper chicken and my bf ordered bbq beef. Both were really good, but between the two we enjoyed the bbq beef the most. We will definitely come here again. Their katsu sauce was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"They didn't give me a discount for being from Hawaii. Food was good though, Katsu breading tasted like fish a little but it made it taste better and the musubis were like they were home made which is good and bad. The nori on the musubis was kinda chewy. We had to wait 5 minutes for someone to get off the phone. Foods good though I'd recommend it to any Hawaiian food seekers."}
{"text":"I have been to this place recently. I was highly disappointed. The food took 30 minutes to get. When we finally got our food it was cold. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Very yummy food of good quality. I have been there twice now and have had good experiences both times. Reason for not having all stars is that the staff do not seem to get along very well. My second time coming one girl had puffy red eyes as if she has just been crying and was sniffling  while being shown what to do at the register. The friendly \"Aloha\" at the door was not-so friendly the second time. Other than that, very good food. Might just go through the drive through next time to avoid drama."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great alternative fast food this is it. Low priced and delicious with big portions and served really, really fast. Lots of seating inside too."}
{"text":"Good food, I was stationed in Hawaii for a couple of years and it is very close to the real thing. All you need now is Spam!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from hawaii so I'm always looking for a plate lunch place where ever I'm at, I found Ono Hawaiian bbb on baseline in phoenix. I remember ono's in hawaii growing up of course so I went in looked at the menu but I didn't see all what I was looking for. I asked the girl if they had lau lau, her and the other girl next to her looked at me kinda strange and said \"what's that\" I explained it and one girl says ew! Doesn't sound like something we'd have here, if we haven't heard of it we don't have it. Ok fair enough, I asked about the short ribs and if it's got the kalbi sauce, she said the what sauce? We don't put any sauce on any of our food. Well I said I guess I'll eat elsewhere cause I came to eat hawaiian food and this wasn't. What looked like the mgr standing there looking at us never gave me an explanation of any kind. This is Ono hawaiian bbb and is not anything like hawaiian food."}
{"text":"OMG SO GOOD!! I love this place, the service is great and the food is better. Never had much of a wait and the people are always friendly. I have eaten in Hawaii a number of times and I like that they keep to the rice and macaroni with every meal tradition (not sure why they do it but I like it), Now is it like real Hawaiian food? No, but close.... its a chain what do you expect?! However Hawaiian food outside of Hawaii it cant be beat!"}
{"text":"A+. Always good stuff coming out of here. Prices a little high though."}
{"text":"If your looking for a good meal and quickly. This is the place to go. Highly suggest the island chicken curry. Friendly service, always hot food, and always clean."}
{"text":"Love it!! But my only disappointment is the girls that work there. They clearly don't like their jobs and it totally comes out when you talk to them."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Food is well above average for this type of place. Family owned and run. Service is always friendly, especially when they see you a second time (or more). A friend prefers the chicken katsu here. My favorites are the Hawaiian BBQ mix or the chicken curry. I have also heard good things about their vegetable or chicken or seafood or beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this restaurant I had went to one in California with my sister brother in law mom and dad but I forget the name darn But anyway it was so wonderful this one matched up to it. I ordered the BBQ combo with a extra scoop of macaroni salad since I am a huge macaroni lover since the last restaurant and let me tell you I am glad I got an extra scoop because their macaroni salad makes you want to eat it noodle by Noodle and savor every bite or maybe that's just me LOL no but it is really good and the chicken was moist with that yummy teriyaki BBQ flavor the ribs and steak so fall apart flavorful I wouldn't recommend this place definitely and also the guy working at the front counter was so awesome polite  and fast service I wish I could remember his name he was even wishing people to have a nice day on the way out  if all restaurants have employees like him their businesses would be around a lot better and smoother!"}
{"text":"I got the mixed BBQ plate, The good . . . generous portions, rice was good, mac salad was good. The bad . . . expensive, BBQ beef over cooked, skinny rib was mostly fat and gristle, chicken was fatty. Customer service . . . no hello, no thank you, no smile, no come back,"}
{"text":"people be trippin.

this place is really yummy.  I eat here at least once a week.  They give a good amount of meat and it is very tasty.

As an asian, they got the flavors right.  I usually go for #4 Combo - chicken, beef and pork.  so tasty.  I don't know why other people don't like it here.  Maybe this food appeals more to an asian palate.   Asians unite for hawaiian BBQ!"}
{"text":"If you are the type of person who likes Chinese take out, with a mindset of \"it is what it is\" then you'll likely love Ono's. We have dined at very high end restaurants, and obviously Ono's wouldn't compare to that. But sometimes you're just plain in the mood for something fast and comforting. In that instance, Ono's is great. I am baffled by the people who talk about how bad their burgers are, you don't get a burger at the Chinese take out  place...why would you do that at a Hawaiian barbeque restaurant? We love the basic barbequed chicken, white rice, and macaroni salad. It's mild, flavorful, the kids love it, and it's a nice change of place from Chinese. Great for picnics or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"i was born and raise in hawaii, any thing thats hawaiian food, i am all over it, like spam on rice lol...anyways, i had the pleasure of going in, the food was pretty good which is the  main thing, but didnt feel the \"ALOHA\" when i went in, there was no hawaiian music on, the cashier just looked at me and ask if was ready to order, although that person was polite, nothing against that cashier, but a simple Aloha would have been nice.  Personally LnL is better with the service and food quality and quantity, but the main thing was the food which was ono"}
{"text":"I was not super impressed. I got the curry dish and the curry was more like a gravy with no flavor. I am also not a huge fan of dark chicken meat. It was OK and I will probably go back to try the seafood but I don't have high hopes."}
{"text":"Just disgusting! The quality of food here is extremely lacking. Severely disappointed. I pretty much had to throw away most of my food because it was so gross. I have had Ono in other places and it was good, but this location was awful."}
{"text":"Every time I come here its always good nice loves it sis loves it I love it food is always good"}
{"text":"I love Ono Hawaiian BBQ. The food is healthy and the staff is so friendly. Love the bowls they are very delicious. I am a nurse and the food always hits the spot without the guilt."}
{"text":"Did a late dinner run last night just before closing. Been to several of this chains locations in California which means I generally like the Hawaiian food fixes that they serve up. Ordered kalbi ribs and they gave me the ribs but no meat attached!  When I questioned them about it they acted offended however the manager finally came by and provided me with a few more bones. Rice was dry and hard from sitting for awhile. Definitely not Ono!"}
{"text":"Well, I tried a couple different Hawaiian restaurants while in Phoenix for my visit.
Being that I lived in Hawaii and married into a local family, I think I'm a pretty good judge of what Hawaiian food should taste like. Ono's surpassed the other places by far. In fact I'm not gonna even gonna write a review on the others.  The Chicken Katsu is a \"must try\"  By far the best in this city.  
The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the Katsu sauce is a bit watery for me, and it not like they make it in Hawaii.
And their Mac Salad is the best in Phoenix..  Nuff said!!

They get a 4"}
{"text":"While i waiting on a friend, i decided to stop by for some lunch. I ordered the mix plate - Chicken Katsu & Chicken BBQ. Ive had a fair share of plates from other places/out of state, and i was highly disappointed. With a small drink, I paid about $11. The Katsu was SOO dry and it was ALL batter and pretty much no chicken. Some were rlly fried, i couldnt bite into it. The BBQ was soft but no flavor. 
I thought it could be an off day but reading the other reviews, its common. 
The person, Jessica W. who rang me up was always on her phone texting. No manners whatsoever. I hope management reads everyones review.
I wish L&L Hawaiian Food would come back to this area."}
{"text":"Big fan of their food! My husband likes the katsu and I prefer the teriyaki chicken. Great portions and fast service."}
{"text":"First off, I like the food. I've never had a bad experience with the food. I usually get the same thing. The white fish with rice and the mac n cheese and it's always delicious.

As far as the service, it could be better. I recently had a bad service experience. I had printed a coupon off of my Verizon site. I redeemed points through them and I chose a coupon to this place. I stopped in to order my meal. I handed the coupon to the cashier and she said she had to get manager to look at it. Manager came and he looks at it and says it's not valid and can't accept it. I told him to look at it again. It clearly said it was valid at this location. He said he's never seen on. So just because he didn't see one before and didn't know what to do with it, he was refusing it. I told him he needed to figure it out because it was valid and it was my points I used already and I wanted it honored. He went to the side to call someone. I waited about 10-15 min. He comes back and then says he can accept it. Overall I spent 30 minutes in there waiting for my food when it should have only taken 5-10 minutes. He didn't even do anything to go above and beyond to turn my experience around which makes me feel like business is not really appreciated there. More than likely, I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and as such, please take my opinion with a grain of salt unless you as well are picky and spoiled when it comes to Hawaiian barbeque.

I've been to three places for Hawaiian bbq while in Arizona, and Ono Hawaiian is definitely the worst of them.  The fact that is it a chain first raised red flags, although I knew this fact when I decided to come.

I ordered then curry chicken katsu and I was horribly disappointed.  The curry was more like water-with-curry-flavoring.  It was watery and instead of adding flavor, like curry is supposed to, it made my rice mushy and my katsu soggy.

If you want good Hawaiian BBQ, go to Aloha Kitchen, run by a local Hawaiian family, in Mesa.  It's a drive if you're close to Ono Hawaiian, but it's absolutely worth it and reminds me of being back in the Islands."}
{"text":"I recently visited the store on Germann and Gilbert and want to express how unsatisfied I was with the food and customer service.

Thomas the manager was working the front counter and has the personality of a piece of bread.  He barely spoke.  We walked in today at 4:00pm to no one in the restaurant.

We ordered loco moco - egg hard, with extra gravy, chicken katsu, lemon pepper chicken and spam masubi.  Our order took over 20 mins to receive and a mother and child that came in 10 mins after us received their food before us.

After we ordered, we went to get our drinks, we noticed a spider on the railing.  Something I was willing to overlook until I noticed it jumped!  Quite unnerving to say the least, I let Thomas know about the spider, he looked at it and walked away.  5 mins later, we noticed it was getting closer to us, so my mother got a paper towel and killed it. 

After we received our food, I noticed my loco moco patty was burnt (I have pics), we didn't receive a lemon with our lemon pepper chicken (which we always have in the past), the katsu sauce was like water (absolutely no starch...again I have pics) and no access to the forks or chopsticks.  After standing at the counter for 5 mins, I told Thomas that I needed lemon, extra gravy and a fork.  I watched Thomas walk over to the lemon container next to the tea machine to see if there were any lemons - he walked to the back and with his bare hands - lemons cut - put lemon in the lemon container.  He gave me the extra gravy and told me there was lemon in the lemon container.  

I witnessed 3 people tell Thomas the Katsu sauce was thin like water and each one was ignored.  My son ate his chicken katsu with teriyaki sauce - not exactly what he wanted.

My mother had to go up to the counter again to ask for the extra fork.  

There wasn't an explanation or an apology for the poor service and crappy food.  To be honest, Thomas didn't look like he cared if he was there or not.  The store wasn't busy by any means except for the lady that had a phone order that she called in 15 mins before she arrived and had to wait an extra 15 mins and leave w/o katsu sauce because Thomas was too lazy to get some more.

It doesn't make sense to replace the katsu sauce AFTER the customers left, which is what he did as we were leaving.

I frequented this establishment quite often on the weekends but never during the weekdays and will definitely think twice before I go there again - EVER.

Also - I was informed Stanley (the person above Thomas) would be out of town for the next 2 weeks for a conference - so I couldn't get in contact with him.  The number I was given to lodge a complaint: 480-274-2540 a number that doesn't have a recording to whom I was calling.  

Overall - I have gone to Ono's for the past 7 years - when there was only one location in Scottsdale and am very disappointed to see how far Ono's has dropped as far as quality and customer service.  

( I have pics and video on my mobile that was played for others to see the quality of the food and conditions of this restaurant...there is absolutely no exaggeration in this review.)

SAVE YOUR MONEY - GO TO ANY OTHER RESTAURANT IN THIS PLAZA BESIDE ONO!"}
{"text":"Hit the drive through and got two chicken combos. So much chicken. Macaroni salad and cabbage was awesome. Chicken rocked. Not bad for $20."}
{"text":"Great good and service... Hawaiian music playing, clean and delicious Hawaiian food... Makes me Hawaii..."}
{"text":"Pretty slow shop
Food is good but man are they slow.
Staff is Talking about everything but work.
I called in they answer because they were understaffed 
4 guys standing around doing nothing wow.
There was only 1 guy actually working. This is how a franchise runs into the ground!
(Girl)Throwing forks around the kitchen how great is this.
If I was the owner I would fire everyone on shift.
Time and date as posted. You can look at your schedule and figure out who was working. 
Just sad.
Waited 20 minutes and no food
Manager message me and I will be more then happy to remove this"}
{"text":"It's really good for being chain Hawaiian food I always eat way to much and I think it should be a little easier on the wallet but definitely worth a go!"}
{"text":"You need to double check your order in this place! They will get it wrong, make you come back again, and not even be very sorry about it! Bad service and the manager unapologetic.. I'm disappointed! Hope they do something about their service, now my food is cold and i had to go out again on 108 degrees! I understand people make mistakes, but not doing anything to make up for wasting a customer's time is poor business management."}
{"text":"Overall good food and good service, however the environment was very unwelcoming, I don't know if it was just that day or something but i just got my food and left there.."}
{"text":"Alright, I have gone back to this place quite a few times because of the fact that 1) It is close to my work and 2) some co workers really like going there..

Well, that being said, I really have to admit that I enjoy their bbq chicken a lot more now and I wanted to change my review to reflect that.

The first time I went, I got the teriyaki chicken, which is different and not as good.

Anyways, if you like a little spice.. I get their bbq chicken lunch special, two sides of teriyaki sauce and one side of the red \"spicy as shit\" sauce.. 

Throw all those together and you have some freaking awesome food. Dip a tiny bit of the chicken in the red depending on how hot you want to go and then use the teriyaki sauce to mild it down a bit.. get the perfect combo and you are in heavenly food paradise.."}
{"text":"I Had lunch here a couple of days ago. I ordered the combo plate that had 3 different types of meat, macaroni salad and white rice. The food was pretty good, nothing too exciting though. The soda machine was not dispensing right- they needed to add the syrup. I got tea instead because I didn't feel like waiting for the counter girl to fix it and there were other people in line. The restaurant was pretty dirty. The place definitely could use a good deep clean..."}
{"text":"I had the Hawaiian BBQ chicken plate. Was the best Hawaiian Food I've had so far. The macaroni salad... perfect!! Restaurant was very clean, And the customer service was exceptional. Pricing for food was very fair and the amount of food was fantastic!!  AND The employee that was coming off of break even backed up and opened the door for me as I was leaving. What more could you ask for? NOTHING!! best example of a 5-star!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and am so happy they decided to open up closer to home!! I usually get the teriyaki combo and it never disappoints. Reasonable prices and you get a lot of food with your order. If I'm in a hurry, their drive thru is usually very quick."}
{"text":"I do like this place. Finally! One our side. They are fairly new to open and I know it takes a while to get the system and the employees down and trained. So I can slide on the service and knowledge of the menu and system. No biggie. Food is consistent and they are very happy to help and greet you. The management team seems to work hard I  educating and informing everyone on all levels. Good to see. Establishment is clean and welcoming. And the drive thru is open till 12! Definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Two words: seafood mix.   It's very yummy and plenty of food.   Two white fish and lots of chicken and four big shrimp ,rice, macaroni, and cabbage.     As of lately they have slimmed down the pieces of fish. which is very dissapointing.   I would give 5 stars if they didn't get cheap on the meat.

The worst part of this place is the location and the other customers.  It's in a ghetto area and so if you eat inside beware.      They are usually loud and annoying.     And like to stare you down.      I would suggest calling in and ordering.  To be honest I'm not sure they even do that,  so don't mark my words.    don't take a date here.  People will just gauk and stare at your woman.    Some of these people order a lot of food and you have to wait an extra five minutes to get your meal.     


The food is always hot and amazing though and I really recommend trying it.   Just make sure you wear neutral gang colors.  

the music they play is a lot of hawaiiAn cover bands that is cute at first but then you want to bang your head against a wall when some of your favorite tunes are massacared."}
{"text":"This place is has great Hawaiian style Bbq. The Katsu sauce is awesome. I ordered the mixed Bbq platter. The staff is friendly,the service is fast, and food is hot. I would give the place five stars but the dining area was dirty looking, and it was hard to find a clean table."}
{"text":"Always drive by this place and always wanted to try it and I can say I was totally disappointed I went in and was not greeted once I got to the counter to order there was a sassy rude teenager behind the counter who was too busy talking to the cook's in the back was very rude when taking my order I told her it was my first time there and instead of giving me suggestions she was playing with her nails and rolling her eyes waited 10 minutes for the food which isn't too bad but the food was just left on the counter as a rude girl yelled my number and turned around to talk to the cooks will not be returning the food wasn't that great don't go here"}
{"text":"The food is great at every Ono I have been to!  Only downfall of this location is the service.  Employees will stand around talking while you are waiting to order and once they do finally help you, they are not friendly at all.  As if you are a burden on them.  We usually drive further to order from a different location."}
{"text":"What happened? I had Ono's at a different location and it was decent. This location? Horrible. First off, the staff consists of ghetto high school kids with attitudes and no smiles or even a personality. The chicken, on 2 seperate occasions, was REALLY fatty. You find yourself spending most of the time picking off the fat than eating. The rice wasnt cooked correctly one visit. The flavors of some of their sauces are ok, but that wont get me to go back. Especially when Chiptole is a few doors down. And especially when its vastly overpriced. Good portions, but too bad most is inedible."}
{"text":"I love Ono's!!!  The chicken combo plate is what I always get and I am never disappointed.  Lots of flavorful chicken, and the cabbage is awesome.  The macaroni salad is great too.  I love the katsu sauce and make sure to try the teriyaki sauce which is served hot as well.  There definitely enough food for 2 people or a couple of meals.  The service may be slow or chaotic at times but the food is so worth the wait.   I just love this place."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but in the last six months this place has gone to hell.

Their portions have almost been cut in half and their prices have gone up and the service has gone down. The last few times I have gone in there the only person that takes the orders is some girl named Phing who barely speaks english gets the orders wrong and then acts like it is your fault. The need to move Josh back up to the front. He always greeted everyone with a warm smile and always remembered people.

They changed their menu a few months back and I think that is when it started going down hill. 

I went in there today about 12:30 ordered my meal after waiting 15 min for the food I went to get sauces and was informed they where all out of soy sauce and hot sauce. This store is owned by the same people that own the other Ono's in the valley they could have got some from another store before they opened or even gone to the Fry's in the same parking lot and got some. How can you open a Hawaiian BBQ place with out those. What really got me mad was the fact that they got mad at me for asking them for it. When I asked them to package it to go so I could take it home and get soy sauce the girl at the counter tells me \"Fine then take it home\"

I will not be back here for a very long time."}
{"text":"The customer service here sucks!!! Courtney one of the managers is rude and has attitude. They messed up on our order said we could come back anytime and get it fixed. So I go back to get what was wrong on the order and she proceeds to tel me well we will fix it if it was our fault...umm how would it be my fault??? I don't work there. Food is awesome but the service sucks"}
{"text":"I like the food but the cashiers are consistently bad at customer service to the point of being rude. Saying \"what do you want?\" in a short manner is not the way to address paying customers. I've worked many jobs in customer service, this is place is really bad. Particularly bad is a cashier named Kayla Marie. I normally would tip, but I just laugh at the tip jar with service like that."}
{"text":"Love this place. Small, simple, great food and A LOT of it for the price. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is really close to my house so I was hoping to find a place that I really liked, close by. I got some sort of combination plate and I was really disappointed. The rice was a gooey tasteless glob and the meat was oily with no flavor either. I am one of those people that always eats everything on my plate, and I only took a few bites of everything and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"I got the fried shrimp plate. It was way over fried. the macaroni salad and rice were really good though."}
{"text":"We found this place in California and didn't know they had this place out here. We use to go to Leo's Hawaiians BBQ till we found this place out here. My wife gets the BBQ beff meal and I get the BBQ chicken meal always. We have only ate inside once and it was a good atmosphere. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The price is decent as well."}
{"text":"for fast hawaiian food this is goood! I'm in love with the beef ribs ( don't remember proper name) I just wish more came with it! my boyfriend loves the bbq chicken huge portains! macaroni salad is goood! a great place for some hawaiian taste! hang loose brah'  ;)"}
{"text":"First time in today. Flavor of the food was ok. Too much mayo in the macaroni salad so I didn't even bother finishing it. Aside from that all I ordered was the meal and a small drink. I got that and some crab rangoons when I got my food. Looked at the receipt and they didn't eveb charge me for the drink and just charged the rangoons instead. Most wouldnt't mind, but it's not what I ordered. More than likely won't ever go back. I'll make the 20 minute drive to Leo's on bell road instead. Much better flavor and they have homemade katsu and teriyaki sauce on hand."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! We have gone to locations in Cali and were very excited to have one open close to home. We attempted to go through the drive-thru. Waited for about 5 minutes, no one ever came through on the intercom. Drove up to the window...we could see employees but no one was paying attention. Finally we have up on the drive-thru and walked in to the restaurant. We complained to the manager about the drive-thru and got a meh response. To top it all off when we went to order they advised us that they ran out of EVERYTHING so our only options where #1 and #2. Don't think we will be going back there ever again."}
{"text":"Want to note that this is a service review, the food is usually pretty good here.


I'm a big fan of the Postmates app (food delivery service) and I've been using them to deliver my lunch for some time now. I'm also a big fan of Ono, I have been eating there since I was a kid.  

I tried to order lunch from ono several days in a row from postmates and every time my ordered was canceled because ono was \"too busy\". After receiving this message a few times figured it was Postmates and not Ono Hawaiian. So I decided to call the order in myself and pick it up. I called twice and no one answered. I then decided to drive over myself to check out how busy they were. Turns out, they only had a few customers and were not what I would consider \"busy\". My guess is the employees are to lazy to answer the phones. I've had this happen a couple times at this location prior to my review. I'm disappointed in the customer service here, how hard is it to answer a phone? You are not only making yourself look bad but also Postmates."}
{"text":"der food was ok but der meat was kind of hard to chew i would not go bavk.................."}
{"text":"I came here to check them out. Being from Hawaii and having eaten TONS of plate lunches in my life. I gave them a 3.I like being able to come and get chicken Katsu,mac salad and rice. The reason I rated them 3 was the amount of time I waited for my food.I came here twice so far and both times I have waited long times. My wait time was about 20 minutes. It was also pretty expensive.  
But Food wise it was okay,I cant complain, it was good and will probably come back after I check out the other plate lunch places here.Dont get me wrong,I dont hate this place, I just wish there was bigger serving sizes and wait time wasnt so long. Good to come if your with someone and can chill out with, not good if your on a lunch break or in a hurry."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the quality of food and service has really gone down hill since when it first opened. The last time I ate here the meat was fatty and I ended up not eating most of it and to top it off I had to wait almost 20 minutes to get my food when there was only about two other people in the entire place. 

I've also learned that their service is inconsistent as I used to be able to go in and substitute one item for another on their combo plates but have recently been denied, even when I offered to pay extra for the substituted item! I was told by the cashier that she didn't even know how she could do that."}
{"text":"The food here great but I have had mixed experiences since I started going here. Most the time the food is as you expect and will say I see the quality improve in the last year. They worth trying more often than not."}
{"text":"I have seen Ono while driving around the valley and have always been curious. I tried it for the first time on 4/3. I am not sure if since it was close to closing I received horrinle food. We ordered the family deal that comes with 3 meats and 3 sides. We chose the island white fish, chicken Katsu, and the bbq beef. My husband said the fish was ok nothing spectacular.  I don't eat seafood  so we will take his word. The chicken Katsu was ok it was  very fatty and gristly so not my cup of tea. The breading was also not cooked completely. The bbq beef was inedible. It was fatty, tough, and  in pieces. It was the worst beef I have ever attempted to eat
 My husband and children agreed. The veggies and the macaroni salad were ok.The rice is just plain, dry, hard rice. I don't know if I would eat here again. I know I wouldn't order the beef or the Katsu chicken. We paid almost $40 and went to bed hungry. Normally leftovers are a hot commodity in my home. Needless to say noone attemptef to touch it and my children asked why we put that nasty food in the fridge. My response was IDK and it was tossed into the garbage. The food deserves a 1 star. I gave it 1 extra because the restaurant was clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste."}
{"text":"I am seriously a HUGE fan of ONO Hawaii BBQ! Living in Hawaii for 4 years I terribly miss the island life and all of the delicious foods. This place takes the cake and feeds all of my addictions. Located in a shopping plaza this place always has an abundance of parking. Lets get into this food. 

I started off with the Plate Lunch Combo! It gives you 2 scoops of white rice, 1 scoop of macaroni salad, and vegetables. My favorite has to be hands down the Hawaiian BBQ Mix which comes in BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef and Kalbi Short ribs.  This meal is sure enough to have you covered for lunch and dinner. The portions are very large and you surely get your bang for the buck. Those Kalbi short ribs are always tender and they good part is they make the food fresh. The seasonings are perfect they don't overpower the meat but it gives off a nice flavor. Don't expect to walk in and get your food immediately you have to wait a little while but it is clearly worth the wait. 

Overall I would definitely come back the food is reasonably priced and not to mention its delicious! I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. I got the Hawaiian BBQ and Chicken Katsu and it was super good. The restaurant is clean and the employees are very nice and professional."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. The place was very clean and unfortunately - sorta sparse. I guess the South Side doesn't appreciate Hawaiian food like I do. :( 

I had the Bulkogi short ribs. They were braised in this wonderful tariyaki-like sauce and were very tender!! I was in heaven while eating it and I tried my cousin's chicken katsu and it was wonderful! I loved it too!! i wish they had a bulkogi and katsu combo... but alas they don't! :( They have a pretty big menu and I needed a few minutes just to read through it all. and I didn't even get through it all! :( 

When our food came Steve is absolutely right! Our containers were BURSTING with yummy food! :) My ONLY complaint is that the Macaroni salad has onions in it. I hate onions. but that's just me. 

I am totally adding this place on my list of regular haunts. I know it's a fast food chain... but damnit it's GOOD! I look forward to trying the Span Masubi!! It's a giant piece of nori wrapped sushi made with SPAM!! How could that be bad?!?! I also want to try the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. :) 

to my yelpers, I say GO! i know there's another location Phoenix... but if you're on this side and you want to dine in a clean and you're REALLY hungry and want to be REALLY full... and you love BBQ like I love BBQ and have a few extra bucks to spend and are willing to give a fast food chain a try... then give this place a try! Where the grill is always hot and the surf's always up! :D"}
{"text":"Great food. My families favorites are the pork and teriyaki chicken and spam Musubi. It's all good here. With large portions and good quality sauces. Definitely a returning customer."}
{"text":"Ribs are super fatty. Hardly any meat. Service was slow. Other food was ok."}
{"text":"I found out this place was opening through friends at work and they just raved about it.  After eating there twice in two days I can see why they love it.  Best food, great value, mac salad is the best in the universe and I have family that are Hawaiian and it's better than they make. This is my new \"go to lunch\" place.  Love you Ono!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love love!!!!

It's been years since I've been here.
I finally talked my husband into trying it.
I was a little nervous as taste buds change.

But it was 10 times better than I even remembered.
My husband was pretty blown away too.
& The portions were perfect for us to share."}
{"text":"Consistently very good, we usually get the bbq chicken meal.  Katsu sauce is delicious.  Wish the mac salad was served colder though."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and get the #45 plate (bbq chicken and pork) with island fire chicken substituted for the barbecue chicken, which is pretty flavorless. They upcharge a buck, but it's worth it since the island fire chicken is pretty good. All good. The food is generally adequate - 3 star type. 

How was it tonight? I have not the faintest clue. The kid behind the register didn't know how to make the substitution. So he told me they couldn't do it. Then he rang up the order. Didn't ask if the Bbq chicken was ok. Just rang it up. I told him I didn't want that and ordered a straight up plate of island fire chicken and a drink. He rang it up, but didn't remove the original (wrong order). I told him he had it wrong and he started arguing with me. 

So I walked out. The food isn't good enough to justify crappy service - and in that they've always been a little borderline anyway. So, won't be back and don't recommend. For a quick bite in the area hit ATL Wings next door or Maria's Frybread and Mexican Food across the street instead. Both are great w great service."}
{"text":"Hit or miss here. The first time I ever tried Ono's I fell in love. I had never eaten at a place quite like it that offered the selection of food they have. The plate sizes are pretty solid for what you pay for... you will always be filled up. Their rice is good, and I cannot tell you how much I love the macaroni they serve as well! That's the hit. The miss... half the time the meat I order (usually get the BBQ Katsu Mix) is extremely tender and hard to even chew .. which makes me question the storage of the food prior to being cooked and ultimately how it's cooked. Now don't get me wrong, sometimes it's AMAZING, but sometimes I have to question if I even want to continue after the first bite due to the tenderness and quality of the meat. Whenever I get the urge again I will stop by here and give the meat another chance.. stay tuned"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I tried this place, he'd had it once before but it was my first time.. I wasn't too pleased, their staff isn't the nicest, I'd have never been there and they were so rude when I asked what was best and what not. And their white mac & cheese is honestly tasteless. It seriously tastes like nothing. No flavor. But their teriyaki chicken was petty good.."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff. Was greeted right when I walked in and was suggested great food. Restraunt was clean."}
{"text":"I was so excited for them to open a location near me. Love their food. This is the best looking Ono by far!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the owner should consider using the AC. It is uncomfortable and gross sitting in a hot restaurant"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hawaii BBQ chicken and after consuming half of the food, I found a long black hair at the bottom of the plate... Totally disgusted me, I will never eat there again.  I filed a complaint with the Health Department.."}
{"text":"Was totally excited to get some Hawaiian food today. Drove about 25 minutes to come to this place. Once my wife and I got here we LITERALLY stood in front of the cash register, ready to order, while 4 \"workers?\" just chatted away. They looked over and DIDNT SAY A THING and continued to have their conversation. 

I'm not looking for a 5 star restaurant experience but ATLEAST greet or acknowledge that you have a customer in front of you. 

Now we're at Chipotle."}
{"text":"This is my first time with Hawaiian BBQ so I am not familiar with the cuisine. Food was great, the quality of ingredients not so much.
The meat was not trimmed of fat and cartilage which made the experience much less than it could have it could have been.
Other than that the food was tasty but average."}
{"text":"Depending on who is working- you may or may not hate this location. Apparently when you buy a gift card, you cannot use that gift card until the next day....? Then we had to wait another 20 mins just for them to check with their manager that the customer (in this case) was indeed correct. Get it together Ono, you're slowly losing your spot as my favorite Hawaiian spot. I will never be back to this location- I will drive the extra 25 miles to the Avondale location since they seem to train their employees more accurately. 

Winnie & Sam P- FYI your POS will accept the $30 gift card purchased the same day so quit lying to your customers (pics attached as proof). This will be reported to the BBB and FTC as falsifying information to customers to scam them out of more money."}
{"text":"Please do not eat here and expect to get a real \"plate lunch\" like in Hawaii. The food is pretty good for a fast rice bowl type of restaurant. You get quite a bit of food for the money and it seems to be pretty fresh. The flavors are still lacking though...plus their macaroni salad isn't like in Hawaii...and it has way too much mayo. Overall, I wouldn't expect anything special, but if you're hungry for some sticky rice and teri sauce, you're on your lunch and want something casual this place will fill you up."}
{"text":"Not bad place. The service was good, but food can take a long time. The food was good. Nice change of pace and not bad."}
{"text":"Tried Ono Hawaiian BBQ for the first time today.  We were not disappointed. I had the chicken katsu plate (2 scoops rice, mac salad, cabbage) for $7.99 and my wife had the kalua pig &cabbage plate (rice and mac salad) for $8.49.  Impressions: (1) lot of food! (2) mac salad was tasty and reminded me of the mac salad at Rainbow's in Honolulu; (3) kalua pig seasoning was just right; (4) chicken katsu was crisp and tasty.   Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night and picked up a teriyaki chicken family portion for dinner.  Wow I was surprised how hot and the portions they gave.  My family and I only ate two-thirds of the food and we had enough for the kids the next day.  

Great food and the staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"As with everything else prices go up portions go down, as does the quality. This use to be a great go to spot, wish I knew what happened, just not the same....my favorite combo used to be beef and chicken. The whole meal was not awful but the beef taste as if it's been under lights all day, and lots of fat. This has happened on more than one occasion, this just maybe my last time......first the Fat boys breakup now this...so sad."}
{"text":"Good food, for a fast food place. Sorry for the all negative reviews, I thought it was quite tasty!! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes to get 3 orders. I was late for work because they took so long. I think they lost my order, but they never told me what the issue was. 

Food was only okay, NOT worth the price"}
{"text":"I always get the bbq combo and spam musubi.  There must be crack in that musubi man because before coming here I had never even tried spam.  I know, spam???? YES SPAM!!! Try it.  DEEEEEE-LICIOUS! and their mac salad is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"This place was disappointing. Ordered the shrimp and it was so overcooked that I could barely bite into it without cracking my teeth! It was all batter and tasted horrible. Also ordered the combo plate with chicken and ribs...also wasn't good. Overcooked meat-almost burned.  I usually love Ono Hawaiin BBQ but definitely wont be back to this location."}
{"text":"Love, love, love me some Hawaiian food! I usually go for the trio plate that comes with beef, chicken, and pork, the most delicious macaroni salad and white rice. Bring your appetite when you come here. 
Tip- great for lunch- they have 5 dollar plate lunches! Aloha!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We tried L&L and were not fans! But Ono Hawaiian is yummy! We get the family meal with the Chicken Katzu, BBQ Chicken and I think its the Terriaki Chicken. Big portions. Very Tasty!! Its always the same woman working at the counter. Shes nice but nothing extra special. They have great coupon deals that come in your mail.
We will go back often!"}
{"text":"I went there on my lunch hour and i have never eaten there before, the service was horrible the manager was very rude. When i got my food, The #1, The chicken was mushy and tasted like it was microwaved, the rice was stale and felt like it had been sitting around for a while, the only good thing about this place was the terriyaki sause. I do NOT recommend eating there"}
{"text":"I finished the whole plate. Yea, it was good. Everything was cooked to order so there was a little wait which I didn't mind. Great for lunch."}
{"text":"It is what it is-- a fast food restaurant. The food is pretty dang good though. The macaroni salad is off the chain. The only problem is that the serve mystery fish. If you ask an employee, they will either say they don't know or that it's Mahi. Well, I can promise you- this is not Mahi. Stick with chicken and fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Excited to have Hawaiian & a drive thru except you're not allowed to order Just anything. I was denied fish and asked if I could just order the fish then park or even run in and both options were rejected. I was ordering for someone else and have a baby in the car so ordering inside was not an option. Really upset with my first experience at Ono."}
{"text":"This is my very first time at Hawaiian barbecue place I was impressed with the food for what it was mine is way better than panda I got their spicy chicken it was actually spicy unlike most places that says her food spicy that's more mild medium I mean cheap chicken some steamed vegetables with a good sauce not bad I just sent like the rice is too mushy skip the counter we're pretty helpful giving good advice what to order definitely would try some more of this style and see if it was actually in good or not"}
{"text":"Usually get the Hawaiian chicken... sometimes too fatty or tough if it's a slow part of the day.  It's usually always fresh, fast and delicious!  Love that they have hot teriyaki sauce available and friendly staff.

Add brown rice and it would be awesome!"}
{"text":"I used to call in my order when leaving the office and it would be ready when I arrived.  Today, they just put my on hold for 10 minutes.  When I finally arrived, I ordered the noodle soup - my favorite - only to learn that they don't have it anymore.  Why?  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS! We just tried Ono Hawaiian BBQ for the first time. It's so refreshing to find a place that is a bit more on the healthy side and that our tummies can handle (we both have IBS) had number 44 and LOVED every bite of it!!  =) =)  and our stomachs felt great hours after (no bloat). We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is easily the worst Ono in the valley. They have the absolute worst customer service, slowest cooks, been there twice and both times my order was completely wrong. That's hard to do considering I'm picking a number from the menu which is directly behind the order taker. I love Ono and I can reassure you no matter how much I love it, if it was the last Ono Hawaiian on earth I would never eat at this location again. They shouldn't have the right to be a franchise. What a disgrace. I'd like to slap the owner in the face with the cold slop they served me. I hope they see this and have enough balls to respond so I can destroy that fraud for ruining one of the best things in my life. . . Ugghhh"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! They forgot our order and he said they called us. They did not and he blames us. Awful experience!"}
{"text":"Worst \"Hawaiian\" I've ever had.  I've eaten at the Chandler Gilbert Road location and don't remember it being this awful.

The rice was properly cooked, but the bbq chicken was stringy and chewy, while the nori wrapping the musubi was the worst nori ever.  It was so gummy and tough!  Seaweed is not supposed to be chewy like that!

I won't even get started on their lack of saimin and use of the term \"noodle soup\".  (I tried the seafood one once years ago and it was pretty horrible and didn't resemble saimin, ramen, or really any Asian noodle soup.)

They've also taken Loco Moco off the menu.  Disappointing, even if theirs did use onion.

Avoid.  Stick to L&L in Happy Valley, or find a small mom and pop shop like Aloha Kitchen in the east valley."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter went to Ono to get takeout.  Waited over 20 minutes to get order.   Brought the takeout home and all three meals,  the chicken was RAW!!  The macaroni salad tasted terrible.   Never going back.   Can I give minus stars???? It is forcing me to rate at least one star.   They can have one star for tables and chairs."}
{"text":"I like their katsu chicken. Drench it with tons of sauce that you can get as much as you want of. The beef is good too, not that big a fan of their fire chicken."}
{"text":"This place is OK! Service was good, the staff seemed friendly. We did a to-go order & the food came out pretty quick. The food itself was just ok; we found a little bit of bone in our chicken unfortunately. Portions are large, though!"}
{"text":"Don't come in if you expect to get your food in a timely manner. I was first in line and the two other people behind me got their food first. My order took well over 15 minutes to prepare. While I was waiting I noticed the crew that were here were made up of a bunch of loud kids. Some of their uniforms looked atrocious with dirty torn T-shirt's. Overall store looked poopy. I hope management is aware of the happenings at this new establishment will surely start going downhill."}
{"text":"Live this place so much better than the one on the other side of town! Really feeling like I'm eating in Hawaii"}
{"text":"I love their food but DO NOT come to the Scottsdale location.  I phoned in my order ahead to beat the lunch rush, I get there not busy i though cool.  I walk up to the counter, a girl comes up to counter looks at me don't say anything to me so I was like I'm here for an pick up order, she said \"um hum\" and tell me my total, turn around grabs my togo order.  I paid her, she gaves me my changes tells me there is fork over there, turns around and go into the kitchen..... Not a \"How are You\" not a \"thank you\" Not \"have a nice day\"  NOTHING.....  RUDE.    On top of that my meat was soo dry.  Never, never would I go back to this place again.... 
BAD Service,  BAD FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Get the teriyaki mini meal! It has delicious cabbage, AMAZING macaroni salad, & sweet Hawaiian rice. There food is cooked to order so if you're in a hurry you can call ahead"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place but I wish they still had my favorite dissh...I liked the island fire chicken rice bowl or the combo.  I also like the Hawaiian BBQ chicken combo with exrta veggies and extra rice with no macaroni salad.  Everyone I know loves the macaroni salad, but I have never liked any type of macaroni salad at all!  Their sauce that goes on the chicken is pretty good.  The price is decent and you get a good amount of food.  Whenever I get a combo I always have leftovers and I have it for the next day or for dinner.  This place is good for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Love the hawaiian mix plate. For serious meat eaters like me, give it a try and i know you won't be disappointed!  Not too salty, sweet or saucy..
It's just right, enjoy all the sides that come with it for just a small price. So worth it and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Is Ono the best Hawaiian BBQ I've had? Not really, Is it the best in the state? Debatable. Do I end up here whenever I have the craving? You betcha!

There aren't many options in town for Hawaiian BBQ, and Ono scratches the itch consistently and never lets me down. 

Spam Musubi is good, the chicken, beef, kalbi and katsu are all tasty and consistent. 

In short, if you're in the area and want da kine grinds, check it out brah!"}
{"text":"ew! Pisses Me Off! rubber like beef and mushy chicken - dont eat here ! - go to leos bbq on bell rd ! wayyyyyy better island bbq and more friendly staff #waisteofmoney"}
{"text":"Damn good food and they give you a lot for the money.  They offer coupons buy one get one free .  ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Just like Hawaiian plate lunches - a combination of Korea, Japanese, Hawaiian and who knows. We often buy just one mixed BBQ and take it home as a main dish and share. 

The GOOD:
Food. Service. Price. 

The BAD:
Food is served in Styrofoam containers."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a couple of times and let me tell you what. NOT FOR ME!!!!!! First off I enter the store and the dining room is empty. Not even an employee. It took a few minutes for one to emerge from the back. Well great. This individual was a statue who barley spoke or moved for that matter. I tried voicing my complaint to the \"district manager\" who the employee ended up telling me she wasn't the DM just some bimbo claiming to be (not very profesional) but this lady named linda was not helpful at all and I now understand the employees frustration towards her. She didn't care at all about my problem and walked away. HOW DID YOU GET PROMOTED?!?!?! I finally got my food after almost 30 MINUTES!!!!! It was cold and tasted like rubber. I would have asked for my money back but the people here were so outrageously blank minded that I just threw out the meal and went to panda express across the street. Also to add to the whole insult I experienced half the store smelled like sewer gas and the floor was turning black. I never had bad experiences when the old managers Thomas and Kathy were there. The store was always clean and employees actually made you feel welcome. I was starting to enjoy this place. It is obvious this establishment has no concern for the way there store performs and no proper management is in place. I am never going back and I hope this company goes under.

I have voiced a formal complaint with there corporate office but never heard back. I submitted another one concerning my new issue. lets see if they actually can be profesional and try to contact a pissed and outraged EX customer!!!!!"}
{"text":"What kind of Hawaiian restaurant doesn't have Loco Moco??? A fake Hawaiian restaurant! This place deserves less than one star, there customer service is rude and does not know anything about Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"My friend recommended. The place is so busy tonight and when i got to the counter the guy asked what we wanted...i let him know i was unsure and i had never been here before. We decided to step aside and review the menu longer...a short minute later he brought us a sample plate of three meats! I'm super impressed at this customer service (you just don't see that anymore)...it is super....the food was delicious. I give 10 out of 10....great food and perfect customer service...can't beat that...the prices are great too..."}
{"text":"Ono is delicious food. However this location is Drive thru as well as a sit down. Because it is a drive thru the food isn't as fresh like the location on Dysart. Dysart doesn't make it until you order it and you can definitely tell the difference. Do your self a favor and drive there if Ono is want your wanting!"}
{"text":"Oh the quality has gone down. I have to admit I haven't been back to this place for a while now but definitely not coming back for good.

This place is pretty pricey if you just want to grab a quick lunch. But I don't mind pricey food if the quality is  somewhat good but ...

12$ for combo #3 which comes with chicken katsu and Barbque chicken.
- chicken in katsu was pretty non-existent, felt like I was eating only crunchy breading. 
- the Barbque chicken was stringy... Why is my chicken stringy?! 
- the cabbage was rotting... There were black spots in the cabbage. I actually enjoy eating cabbage but not this time around. 

Save your money and your calories and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The girl name Lynette at the register has no personality or customer service skills whatsoever! Great food though!!"}
{"text":"Addicted to the Island Fire Chicken!

I really love this place. My son and I always get the Island Fire Chicken (can't get it in the drive through because takes longer to cook). It is really spicy and flavorful. We also enjoy the sticky rice and macaroni salad that comes with as well. I love that the teriyaki sauce you pump is served warm as well. 

Comparable in price to other similar food places. Customer service is fine (nothing bad, nothing spectactular) which I think is like most other quick food places. Atmosphere is fine (comparable to others - nothing stands out). Clean."}
{"text":"Best plate lunch I've found on the mainland thus far! My father grew up in Hawaii so I know what to order! (obviously you are a hoale if you get chicken teriyaki haha) Damn good plate lunch I always get the BBQ Beef lunch special. If you want to eat some specialities I recommend the Spam Musabi (Moo sa bee) and Manapua(Ma Na Poo uh)!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food is bland and not fresh. Ordered a chicken combo and the BBQ chicken was dry and hard to eat. The katsu chicken barely had any meat, it was mostly breading, fat, and skin. 
Service was horrible, not a single smile from the girl taking my order. It was very obvious she did not want to be there. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I love this place i recommend to anybody looking for a quick bite.. food is awesome and i love the quietness of it during the week."}
{"text":"Man the food was off the chain the teriyaki chicken was so so good the staff was great as well. The coconut wasnt my thing but it was something to try but overall i love the place... 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I eat here quite a bit, I'll be honest, the food is good but last two visits they have skimped on the meat. I guess times are tough for all of us. If you are feeling adventurous try the spam masubi, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good food. Typical \"Hawaiian\" quick spot menu, except really good food. Have gone here multiple times and never had a problem. The last time I went I ordered the chicken Katsu curry, and man oh man was it good. Didn't think the curry would be good from here but it was. Definitely going again, and again. 

**UPDATE**. Went on the website where they encourage calling in orders (which I've seen happen the few times I've eaten in the restaurant). Yea....good luck getting through, seems like the phone is left off the hook. Fail."}
{"text":"The food is good but if you're looking for good hawaiian food, this is not your place. This place is similar to an L&L with minimal add-on Hawaiian food options. The ambience is neat and reminiscent of Home. There's always hawaii music playing too. 
Having a recently moved to AZ, I was looking for real hawaiian food. I am still on my journey....
PS...I love their chicken katsu, bbq beef and Kalbi!"}
{"text":"This is one of my husband's favorite! The food is very good, however I would like to see a better variety of sides that include vegetables and not just a tiny spoonful of macaroni salad. I always get the stir fresh meal to get veggies. Otherwise you are eating a plate of meat wit a spoon of rice and a spoon of macaroni. Basically meat and carbs. My rating would be higher otherwise. The staff is friendly and the store is clean."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite foods. Hawaiian BBQ!
This location is clean and the food is great. The only thing I would address with management is the customer service. The cashiers are rude and a bit mean. Please fix this issues to ensure a long time repeat business!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for three years now and if I wrote this review when we when we had it the first year, I'd give it at least a four star, maybe even a five.  However, it seems like the cut of meat they've been using lately isn't so great anymore.  The taste is still the same and quite frankly it's about the only thing that's keeping me from giving it a two star (you can't go wrong with sweet sauces!!) but the quality of the meats doesn't seem that great.  Maybe it was just the past few times that we've been there we've had a \"bad experience\".

The food is pretty much carb and protein overload.  Rice, meat, a tiny bit of cabbage (on most meals).  Simple but delish.  You order up front and they call you number when the food is ready.  They also have a few soup/noodle selections (a little too salty for my taste but decent) and salads, too.  And, if you're not too hungry, you can order the mini-meals which is a much smaller portion of the regular meals offered.  I definitely recommend that if you are watching your diet but want a \"treat\".

They used to have really good tea but nowadays they use some sort of syrup thingy that a lot of other places are converting to instead of brewing which sucks.  

I've never had Hawaiian BBQ until I cam to Ono's so my opinion may be different than someone who is a bit more experienced in this area but the food is decent ... I just wish they had the same standards as they did a few years ago ... biggest reason why we don't go there that often anymore."}
{"text":"Well for starters don't expect any sort of customer service. The employees all seem like they were just released from prison. Talking to you is the last thing on their list of priorities (manager included). I literally watched a girl greet a guest as she was texting. The food is pretty good but not worth the atmosphere and customer service."}
{"text":"Today I tried Onos for the first time. I had the number 1- chicken with rice, cabbage, and macaroni salad. The chicken was boneless thighs, fresh and had great flavor. The rice was cooked well. A bit bland, could have used sauce. The macaroni salad and steamed cabbage were decent. Nothing to write home about. It was fresh but it took 20 minutes for a basic dish. Tasty, but unfortunately I'm only around baseline on my lunch and I won't have time to stop back."}
{"text":"This is definitely more of a \"Hawaiian-theme\" restaurant and not a true Hawaiian BBQ place. It was disappointing. Their menu neglects to include Hawaiian staples -like loco moco and manapua. We ordered the Kalbi short ribs - it was hardly edible, the pieces were so fatty. The Kalua pork was decent, but extremely salty. The best was the chicken Katsu, which honestly was pretty decent. It's unfortunate that this is the closest Hawaiian restaurant within 30 minutes of us..."}
{"text":"It's ok.. nothing to compare to the real deal of Hawaiian BBQ, i rather go the exrta miles to head up to Happy Valley to L&L. Chicken Katsu is what we order but other than that if you want good hawaiian food, hit me up :)"}
{"text":"Everything that we've ordered has always been good here. We especially love the Kalbi short ribs here. The macaroni salad that comes on the side with most of the meals is really good here too. Average price is about $10/person."}
{"text":"Stopped off here on my way to Maui, believe it or not, to get into my Hawaiian gorging mode.  If I wrote this before I got to Hawaii, it might have gotten another star, but after Hawaii, the food was only passable.    I ordered was the Hawaiian barbecue chicken breast with rice and macaroni salad and It is certainly was more healthy than the Hawaiian counterpart. But the Chicken lacked the sweetness and the Macaroni salad wasn't creamy like their Island namesakes.

Don't get me wrong, I will return on my next trip and I hope I'll raise their rating!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just have moving to Arizona we are looking for places to eat. My 8 year old picked this place. At first, the price was a little overwhelming. It's expensive BUT once we got our food it's totally worth it! Portions are HUGE. and so so good. We will for sure be coming back a lot. When my 8 yr old who is picky about food and my 10 month old who rarely eats EATS EVERYTHING. score!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go through the drive thru if you want white meat, you have to go in. I was unable to go in so I just ordered a regular teriyaki combo with crab Rangoon. The Rangoon's were delicious, could actually taste the crab. Macaroni salad also had crab, was very good. The teriyaki sauce and rice was perfect. Two bites of the all dark meat chicken with plenty of fat was not good. Chicken was very mushy, grossed me out and couldn't eat anymore. Price is good for the portion of food, but not the quality."}
{"text":"Agree with latest posts on yelp. The employees behind the counter are nonchalant. On the phone etc. but thought the food was very good. Would go back but definitely could use training behind counter."}
{"text":"I ordered the short rib combo and they only gave me one piece majority being just fat. I continue to visit however I stay away from the short ribs as I don't want to encounter another rip off experience. Only other gripe is the wait time."}
{"text":"YAY! They have SPAM!!!!!

I was going to go for Meat Plate #4 but when I saw the Grilled Spam with Eggs, I was in love. I don't care what you Spam-haters have to say. I'm Asian through and through and will stick to my Spam. Mmmm.. sooo salty and meat-like. 

It was just what I expected, Spam, fried eggs and rice with some macaroni salad. It was good. Reminded me of the days when my parents didn't cook and we would fry up some Spam to eat with white rice and soy sauce. 

My friends were kinda 'eh' about their dishes. It also took a long time for the food to come out for them too.

One cool thing about this place was that the Phoenix Fire Department eats here.... so hot! Too bad I was busy stuffing my face with Spam and eggs. That was probably not hot."}
{"text":"I had a BOGO coupon for Ono Hawaiian BBQ, so we stopped by one evening after work. I wanted just plain chicken, so I got the breaded style chicken. My husband opted for the same and teriaki. The chicken had a lot of fat in it - very chewy. The breaded chicken had very little flavor and was dry. They give you rice and macaroni salad with meals - both were standard. Took quite awhile for our food to come out. It cost over $15 with the BOGO coupon. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Needed to stop by for lunch& was feeling Hawaiian food :) the lunch plates are great with big portions. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while now as it's next to my gym. Went here for the first time, and wasn't all that impressed. 

We ordered the teriyaki chicken plate which was decent. Came out pretty quickly. We ordered a side of spam musubi in a separate order right after the first, but this took 20 minutes. My friend was almost through with his food before I got mine. Kind of a mystery as to why the musubi took them that long. Musubi was lacking in the sauce department too. 

Overall it was alright - I'd still come back since it's so close to where I live, but it's really nothing special."}
{"text":"Well I finally checked this place out today after knowing about it for years! I ordered the Chicken and Beef combo!  Can you say salt city?  Just not very good, sad to say the cabbage was the best part of the meal.  The Mac Salad that people love so much had a fishy taste to me!  Is that normal I wonder?  The beef was borderline gross with the texture and bad flavor!  The boneless chicken thighs weren't exactly horrible, but far from good.  Steamed Rice is steamed rice, it was ok!  Just disappointing as a whole as I was expecting it to be so much better!  Highly doubtful that I'll return to Sodium City...."}
{"text":"Cheap, questionable chicken and really, really overpriced considering the quality and amount that is given.  Not a ton of options but the only thing open in town on Easter.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ono Hawaiin BBQ is one of the only 'Fast Food' places I allow myself (and my boyfriend) to eat at.  The reason being is because the food, while prepared quickly, is yummy, clean goodness!  Our rule of thumb is to share a grilled bbq chicken meal with no steamed rice, extra cabbage (for me) and extra macaroni salad (for Papa)....This makes everyone happy!  Our sauces of choice are the Katzu sauce and Hot Mustard - We find that the Teriyaki sauce is just too sweet.  The portions are giant, so if it's just for one, I would highly recommend the half meal (unless you want leftovers), it's plenty, trust!  Bottomline, this is a convenient, clean, meal option spot that will have you coming back time and time again - All at a great value to boot.....Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Large portions, really tasty (Ono), and friendly staff. I've eaten here a couple times and enjoyed it. I'll keep coming back even though it's out of my way usually."}
{"text":"The only reason this establishment gets one star is for the food being edible. It took us 15 minutes to receive our food and only after I went to check to see what took so long. The workers were busy talking and had no remorse for them forgetting our order. The Mexican manager starts laughing when I walk away and thinks it's a total joke. I will never return!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get a bite to eat. Place was very clean. The food tasted fresh. The menu had plenty to choose from. Fish was very good, had the right amount of crunch on the outside. The salad was very good too, just wish it had a *little* bit more dressing on it. The gals behind the counter in their down time could help face the store up a little bit they kinda were just holding up the counter looking at their phones and watching people eat. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Wow, the reviews are all over the map for this joint. I think this place delivers...and then some. I've had plenty of good meals at great prices here. If they can work on consistency (my BBQ chicken comes out in various temperatures), and perhaps the friendliness of the cashiers (they do the job, but are not particularly friendly), I think this place is in it for the long haul. I recommend the Hawaiian BBQ chicken and the spam musubi. Moco Loco is good, but very salty."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and very friendly staff. The wait isnt too long and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Cute staff, great service and mouthwatering BBQ that is the stuff of dreams. If you dream about smiling faces and Hawaiian BBQ.

They're part of a franchise so they have stupid rules they adhere to in limiting substitutions, but I go out of my way as often as possible to eat here. Their musubi is probably the cheapest meal replacement I could think of and it's the perfect introduction to their palette of flavor. 

I'd like more variety, like being able to have beef slapped into a bowl for one thing (why is beef over rice weird???) and then you are required to submit to both rice and macaroni salad, I'm sure there are other sides on Hawaii. I think. I dunno.  

Anyway, I've got some gripes with the menu, but I adore it all the same and their prompt, polite and courteous staff keep me coming back for that outstanding food.

I wouldn't really recommend eating in there, personally. But it has supplied me with exquisite meals on the go for years."}
{"text":"My wife and I live near this restaurant, so we thought we would give it a try.  When we walked in, the place smelled almost septic.  There was a couple in front of us chitchatting with, what I assumed to be, the owner.  She smiled at them and we were patiently waiting just for them to take our order.  She eventually turned away from the couple and her demeanor immediately changed from amicable to aloof.  She acted as though we were inconveniencing her.  She took our orders and we ordered a drink, but the machine had no ice.  She resumed her conversation with the other couple and I went up to tell her that there was no ice.  She said, \"Yeah, we getting ice.\"  We got our food, which was mediocre at best and one of the other employees got the ice for us.  For me, manners are everything, especially when dealing with the general public.  I specifically will never go to Ono, because of the egregious way we were treated.  If they were nice to us, I would consider going back, regardless of the food.  Hope this helps others."}
{"text":"Great food I love the BBQ chicken & chicken katsu combo. I just don't recommend if in a rush the wait can be upto thirty minutes sometimes that's the only bummer I know of."}
{"text":"Macaroni salad, macaroni salad, M-a-c-a-r-o-n-i  S-a-l-a-d!   I don't think I've had macaroni salad this good.    I have no idea what the heck is in it, but it is truly addictive.  I often times go there and order just that.  Ono Hawaiian was my first experience with Polynesian fare.  The menu was kind of exotic, for a Hispanic girl anyway.  Spam-burgers?  Well, my grandma did used to make spam tacos.  I haven't tried the burgers yet, but they're on my list.  I've had their chicken katsu which is very good, but my favorite is the Kahlua pork which is truly delicious smokey, porky goodness.  I've had their catering on a couple of occasions and it's been quite a hit with my guests.  Their catering is pretty  affordable; where the most I've spent is like $150, and that fed over 25 people.  My only complaint is that over the years, they've gotten kind of chintzy with the serving size of macaroni salad that comes with every meal.    Ono Hawaiian BBQ is good, fast, affordable, and it's definitely thinking \"outside the box\"."}
{"text":"O M G !!! Love there food! 
I had * Hawaiian BBQ Mix *  It was Finger Licking GOOOOOD !!! I'm Definitely going back again! (´`)????/"}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food, and this place is not so \"Ono\".  I asked the girl at the counter if the sauce for the chicken katsu was in the bag, yes she says, well you know the answer to that.  I get back to my hotel and the chicken is soggy, rice is cold, mac salad is hot (it was a 5 minute drive).  The spam musubi tasted weird not like the stuff you get from 7-11 on the Big Island.  Sorry, but I cannot rate this place good when I have had so much beter here on the mainland."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night, and it was just okay at best. Maybe it was my fault, my expectations were to have Hawaii BBQ, instead this is Chinese food with bizarre sides. I didn't get it, and didn't like it. I ordered the bbq chicken (chicken teriyaki) plate and the katsu (essentially almond boneless chicken) plate. They were both disappointing. The food was over cooked and rubbery. I'm sure this place is for some people, but it wasn't for us."}
{"text":"I love their food! I always get their bbq chicken because it's so good. This time their special wasn't on the chicken so I got the meal that didn't include a drink and was almost $8. It came with 3 pieces of chicken, macaroni salad which wasn't bad, and a scoop of rice. 

This isn't a \"fast\" food place to say the least because I've always had to wait 10-15 minutes on my order. And their professionalism is something to be desired, I really don't care if some d-bag that looks like Bruno Mars is trying to flirt with you just get my order!

Great place for when you want semi-fast food without the added grease of a typical burger place but don't come for the service"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way to the airport. Great food and a lot of it! The service was friendly and fast and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Fresh and very yummy. I love the mac salad and rice it comes with. This location had great service and the food came out on point. We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Good cheap and filling for under $8.  

Order #1 and you won't regret it.  Makes for a great lunch or dinner, cooked fresh and efficiently fast."}
{"text":"Onos = good.......what more can I say ? All the food here is great. Love the macaroni salad, wish i had the recipe. Everytime i go, i need to get the spam musubi. When i was in Hawaii, i was hooked on spam musubi from the first try. 

The plate lunches make onos the closest to authentic Hawaiian food that i have found in Phoenix. I also enjoy the Hawaiian fruit drinks in a can.

The atmosphere is great for me, Hawaiian music, they also have this awesome painting on the wall of a surfing scene and Diamondhead. The staff are great and the food even more so."}
{"text":"So glad this place is just a minute away from where we live.  It's the best place around this whole area.  The food isn't too good around north scottsdale.  Our go to is the chicken katsu plate or chicken bbq plate.  We always get a side of spam musubi as well.  This is plenty of food for two people.  They also have a selection of Aloha drinks.  Wish they had aloha shoyu instead of kikoman but that's ok."}
{"text":"This place is horrible took them 20 minutes just to make a lunch meal. So could not eat my lunch took it to go and could not eat it because the dam sauce was all over the box napkins and inside the bag."}
{"text":"I love this place so much to food is amazing and there are always large quantities of food. It sometimes takes awhile for the food but it is still worth it"}
{"text":"I originally went to this area because of the Panda Express a few doors down..they were swamped so I opted for Ono.  To my surprise there were no customers in the store.  I ordered the teriyaki lunch.  It was amazing!  I also tried the spicey Hawaiian bowl. Omg!!  So incredibly good! The staff was so nice and accommodating and recommended items, as I'd never been there before.  I'll go there every time instead of Panda now.  Great experience!  Mary T."}
{"text":"We first went to the Avondale location many years ago and the food was great. I worked on 16th Street & Indian School at the time so the Thomas location made sense to stop in for dinner after work. We have also dined at the Scottsdale location & all three are great!!  The food is always fresh, the macaroni salad is great & it comes on a bed of steamed cabbage. The Chicken Katsu is delicious, tender & juicy on the inside & crunchy on the outside. We also love that the portion sizes are large enough to share with our kids not having to order additional meals.  Love Ono & always stop when in the area!"}
{"text":"Over priced, compared to the other ono's . Barely any sauces any more. The hot sauce is in packets. Came here a few times and decided it wasn't worth it. Hardly any people in there , and it took a long time to get my order. My ribs were so-so. Kinda fatty."}
{"text":"WAITED FOR NOTHING.  Drove past for months while this was under construction glad a \"Hawaiian\": restaurant would be close to home.  Went there the first day and asked - where is the Loco Moco and Laulau - not on the menu and the clerk looked at me and stared,  What? was all she said.  I ordered the Katsu and the Kalua Pork since I was there already; katsu was dry and overcooked; prices were higher than expected and when we left and said \"mahalo\" she said what's that mean!  Not even any aloha wear so what is Hawaiian about this?  Nothing but the name.  May be ok for people having never been to the islands but as former Maui people we will still drive the 21 miles to L & L."}
{"text":"The place is as authentic as being in Hawaii. Their chicken is by far very juicy and tasty and combine that with rice and macaroni salad and whatever sauce you like from unlimited soy sauce , spicy red sauce, spicy mustard, teriyaki or katsu sauce. Their beef and short ribs and fried and open faced shrimp are wonderful too. Plus don't forget the spam musubi or Loco moco."}
{"text":"Slow service!! We came in and ordered 2 meals to go and waited over 20 minutes for our food. We ordered our food and other customers received their food before we did! How rude!!! Not coming back and there is hardly any air conditioning in this place. First and last time coming to this place."}
{"text":"Good food and always large portions, enough to take some home as leftovers unless you're gluttonous like me :). For meals that fall in to the $5-10 range, it's a very decent deal. I have been to this place more than 3 dozen times and can say that the food has been relatively consistent and is usually good to very good.I believe there has been only one occasion in which the food was bland and not cooked well. 

Having said that, and as many other reviewers have stated, expect to wait for your meal a while, even when you walk in and there are only a few people ahead of you. 90% of the time I go there, it takes anywhere from 10-25 minutes to get my meal. One of the last visits I made to Ono Hawaiian BBQ, I waited over 30 minutes for my meal. There was a couple, one guy and another couple with 2 small kids ahead of me. I don't pretend to know why it usually takes so long, but do not consider this restaurant to be a \"fast food joint\" with respect to how quickly the food comes out.

Perhaps calling ahead would be wise if you can't stand the wait, but in my opinion, the food is pretty darn good and worth waiting for"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in a long time we ended up getting the number 44 Katsu chicken there was so much food plenty enough for two people plus leftovers. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Generally, I do not write reviews after visiting a place one time, but this placed forced an exception.  My wife and I were heading to a movie at the Harkins theatre next door and wanted a bite to eat before the flick started - so we popped into one of the nearest restaurants Ono Hawaiian BBQ (we talked about Rubio's but decided to try something new).  Believe me when I tell you it is not very often that I can not eat the food I have in front of me at dinner time - but this was one of those times (more on that below).

The service at this place was not particularly helpful, but we finally were able to place our order after their employee got off the phone.  Several items were out on their menu and two other items had black magic marker on their sign indicating they were permanently out (I understand changing menus, but this did not look particularly professional).

Once we ordered, we choose to sit at one of their high top tables or at least tried to.  The first one we sat at was dirty so we moved to the second one but then realized that was dirty too (this is in a restaurant with only one table occupied  - should not have have been too busy to keep the place clean.  Ditto for the third and fourth high top we tried.  So we moved to some round tables on the other side of the restaurant - two of the three were dirty there too and the third was in direct sunshine (can't blame the restaurant for the sun).  We did finally find a table with no crumbs, sauce smears or food left on it and sat down.  As we were eating one of the employees came out and cleaned one table, got a phone call and never came out for any of the others.

I ordered the seafood noodle soup and my wife ordered some spare ribs.  The seafood was not fresh, smelled unpleasant and two of the shrimp in it had not be deveined (not appetizing and I was unable to eat given the smell and the appearance).  The same was true of my wife's food - it smelled bad, tasted bad and did not look good.  We would have talked to the manager but at this point no one was around (they were all in the back in the kitchen) and it was not clear any of the people there were management level anyway.  As I said above, it is pretty rare that I can not even choke down a meal - but we tossed it in the garbage and left (ended up having a bag of popcorn at the movies for dinner).

Just because I am on a roll I will also mention that their shaved ice counter was not open - no big deal but it would have been nice if they had not left brooms and mops as well as boxes sitting out in their restaurant.

All -in-all, bad food, inattentive service, unpleasant smells and a dirty unprofessional looking restaurant combined for a wasted $18 of food.  Perhaps we just hit a really bad night for the restaurant, but I know I will not be back.

{"text":"May 2013

Cashier was friendly. 

Prices were spot on!

Food was a little on the oily side. :(
We ordered bulkogi beef well done.
Food we received was still too pink. We send it back to be cook to our liking and as how we ordered it. We did not have any issue with the food being sent back. The cashier followed up after.

Wait if or our food was a bit long ... 25 mins. We get that it's being cooked to order so we did not mind waiting.

Will return again."}
{"text":"If you love mayo, grease, and scoops of rice over cabbage (their claim of veggies in the meals), this is the place for you. I have tried their BBQ Chicken and Fire Hot Chicken meals, and it tastes good initially (probably because it's dripping in fat), but made my stomach turn a few hours later. Fire Hot  Chicken will mess you up! It is dowsed in a super hot sauce and spices. There were not enough macaroni salad and rice to extinguish that! About $10 a meal there, blah. 

It is OK at the best... what do you expect from a 'hawaiian' fast food joint? Will leave you saying Oh-No..."}
{"text":"Great fast food place. Clean, food comes out fast, tastes great.

You get really great value for the what you pay for. I had an $8 katsu chicken plate, which was more than I could finish. Has plenty of veggies, though they skimp a little on the rice. Based on my friends' advice (they're regulars) I would recommend you order the plate which comes with barbecue and katsu."}
{"text":"Tasty and satisfying.  The food tasted fine and the portions were not too big or too small.  I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Its mothers day and my wife wanted Ono Hawiian bbq. I ordered the family meal with bbq beef, white fish and grilled lemon chicken to go.

Also ordered vegetable noodle soup and spam musubi on the side.

When I arrived home the first thing that I noticed was that the bbq beef portion was not as generous as I've received in the past.  There was actually more cabbage than beef.

Secondly the grilled chicken was dry and a bit over cooked.

Worst of all, After serving my plate, I noticed  that the spam musubi was missing! Bummer.

It's a 20 min drive, round trip, from my house so I really didn't want to return to pick it up. 

When I decided to call and inform them of the error the phone rang normally. As the phone was answered it went directly to a fax machine.

 I double checked the phone number on the receipt and tried again only disappointed to hear again the sound of the fax machine.

After paying $50 for the meal I believe the quality and service could have been much better."}
{"text":"GUILTY PLEASURE!

This place is DELICIOUS! I had the chicken and beef combo which comes with 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of macaroni salad and vegetables.

I inhaled that whole thing. It was really good! I would come here again! I just wish there was a location closer to my house."}
{"text":"I had the mini bbq beef meal.  The prices aren't on the website but it was $5.79 + tax.
I am a full grown man and it was enough to fill me up pretty well.  It came with macaroni salad and white rice.  They also threw in some sriracha, hot mustard, and katsu sauce.  

The macaroni salad was surprisingly good.  I was surprised because I normally dont care for macaroni salads and this one was tasty.  The white rice was...white rice.  The beef came in a good portion and was accompanied with cabbage.  The flavor of the meat was enjoyable.  It was peppery and savory.  The problem was there was a decent amount of fat that needed to be trimmed off and was tough to chew at times.  I had to spit some into a napkin that was not going to go down.  Other than that it was pretty solid.

Would I come back?  Sure.  Would I recommend it?  I guess if someone is looking specifically for Hawaiian food.  I did try a piece of the katsu chicken and it was really good.  I think I'd order that if I return."}
{"text":"Plain gross - i went with my teen daughter and the food we order was extremely greasy, over-salted, not even good to the taste. I am not even talking about the presentation in Styrofoam containers.

We tried a few bites of each other's dish and ended tossing it all and went to eat elsewhere. Even the rice was not cooked right.

TO AVOID"}
{"text":"Love this place food is great, service is fast I usually get the bbq chicken plate with 2 scoops of macaroni and one scoop of rice. It's always good never a complaint."}
{"text":"Katsu chicken is a fav of mine. Took some friends as part of the Hawaiian themed day at the office."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would only come here for the spam musubi. The spam musubis are good, but I didn't like the plates. I got a beef plate that came with rice and macaroni salad. First, they gave such little rice, that I had to just go home and make more rice because they didn't give enough to complement the beef. The beef was okay.. a little red in the middle and a little charred/burned on the outside. The mac salad wasn't good though. It felt watery and had way too much mayo in it. If you come here, I would recommend getting spam musubis, if not, then I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here about a month ago. The food was good. Nothing to write home about, though. The order clerks were not very friendly. It was like pulling teeth to ask them any questions about the menu or to request extra condiments."}
{"text":"Ono Hawaiian BBQ 

teriyaki chicken bowl:

This would have been outstanding.

Why do I say \"would have been\"?

Two things. 

1) even though that looks like a bunch of cut up pieces of chicken, it's not. Someone forgot to finish cutting them. (I've noticed another reviewer had a similar experience) So. It was really one piece of chicken all connected to all the other pieces of chicken.  (See pic). If you can't finish cutting the chicken then st least give me a plastic knife in my togo bag.  Also. The chicken was a little gristly. 

b) the cabbage. Come one man!  When cut up cabbage is so big, one bite is bigger than your mouth, cut it smaller!  Again. Could have used a plastic knife...

Oh. And a third one, I guess...  only two tiny pieces of broccoli.  (Sad face emoticon)

Lots of steamed white rice though. And the teriyaki sauce is very, very mild. 

On a positive note, the food tasted very fresh!  And the Krab Rangoon (cream cheese with krab mixture) was very tasty. 

Maybe I'll try something else next time and update this review accordingly.  But please don't be out of coke next time..."}
{"text":"There was 6 different customers  in the building and it LITERALLY took 30mins for the food to be ready ... but get this ... EVERYONES food was incorrectly prepared !! Items were missing , or not the right order .. OMG What a Circus !  And it's all thanks to the cooks not paying attention to the orders and more focused on there personal conversation !  This was my first time here .. and what an experience  NEVER AGAIN !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here pretty regularly. Is \"traditional\" Hawaiian boxed lunch fare healthy? Not so much. Spam is on the menu, people!Think grilled or fried chicken, fish, or beef, sticky white rice, and the most delicious macaroni salad ever. I've not cared for the appetizers, frankly, but we have only tried the Spam musubi and the Crab \"Langoons\". We really like the BBQ chicken and especially the chicken katsu (breaded chicken cutlets cut into strips- dip into the fabulous zingy katsu sauce). They also have soups, burgers, and salads. The portions are quite large for a \"regular\" meal. I always make 2 meals out of it, but Hubby can usually finish his. Aloha Kitchen does a few things better (and also has great Kahlua pig on Saturdays which Ono never has), but for a quick and filling out of the ordinary weekday dinner, Ono hits the spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in the area for business, and spotted this joint while eating at a nearby establishment. Decided to eat here even after seeing its rating. The food was excellent. I had an aloha plate with the island fire chicken and bbq beef. My food was cooked to order and it took only a few minutes to complete. The meats were super tender and flavorful. The island fire chicken had a perfect amount of heat and smokey flavor. I made my plate a combo and had 3 crab rangoons come with it and those rangoons were very good too. This place is definately worth a stop. Great food good clean atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Been to two of the locations and this one was not as good. The food nor the building measured up to my first visit to a Scottsdale location, which madr me a fan. 

Here I had to send my chicken katsu back because it was cooked so hard that it was not enjoyable and not eatable.  The Macaroni salad here isn't as creamy and good as it is at the other location I've gone to.  And the cabbage comes cooked on this plate at this location.

The restaurant is bigger  here but the place isn't kept as cool as it needs to be to dine in comfort on a hot day.  Then there's an awful overpowering smell of water damaged ceilings/walls that just made me think this location wasn't clean."}
{"text":"I was referred here by a coworker and thought it was simple and delicious. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Having lived in Hawaii for 3 years then moving I've missed me some Hawaiian food and this place didn't disappoint. My husband got the Kalua pork and I got chicken teriyaki and chicken Katsu to share with my son who is a toddler. The chicken Katsu was a big hit for him along with me. All the food was great! The rice, macaroni salad, cabbage etc! The only negative was it did take about 17 mins for our food to come out which we didn't mind because the food came out hot and was just delicious. We will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian Barbecue Beef. My daughter and I drove through and picked up the Hawaiian BBQ Beef plate. I considered getting the chicken katsu, but they only use dark meat for their chicken dishes except the grilled chicken breast. So, I passed.

The beef was tender and well marinated. My daughter greedily ate all the meat and rice after my taster. So, she definitely approved of it. The steamed or boiled cabbage below gave the illusion that there was more meat than was there, but I enjoyed the meat juice on top of the cabbage. The broccoli was on the crunchy side.

The macaroni salad was okay, but it could possibly have been more flavorful because I was recovering from a cold and might not have been able to fully taste it.

I also purchased the spam musubi which looked rather large and clunky. My son said that he had little or no teriyaki or saucing on the spam and was slightly disappointing. I guess I still owe him some homemade musubi."}
{"text":"Cute ambiance, generous portions, okay good. Hawaiian theme was consistent from the aloha when you walk in, the tropical colors. 

We love that they offered Hawaiian Sun drinks. We love the orange passion fruit.

We ordered the Ahola plate and the Hawaiian meat plate. The portions were large but we thought the marinate in all the meats were not well developed. We have tasted better. The meats were grisly. 

Ono is tastier than regular fast food, but as far as Hawaiian barbecue goes, we have had better."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place and it is hands down the best bbq place we've found. The food was fresh and was excellent value for what we paid. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very good food, certainly good portions for the cost (sometimes for a 2nd meal or to share!)

I enjoy this eatery for sure!"}
{"text":"NASTY. idk how anyone could even want to dine inside here! Seriously everything is so dirty! The floors are black like they havent been mopped in days. The bathrooms smell and are dirty in every possible way. AND were out of soap.The tables are sticky and gross and need to be wiped down. The A.C. was making noise but absolutely NO cold air was coming out and we sat right underneath it. It had to be close to 90 degress inside. Their ice machine doesn't make ice and was out. Everyone had to wait quite a while for them to refill it. The girl at the counter isn't friendly at all and seems really fake. Their mac salad tastes fishy and made me nauseous. And last thing we had to wait close to 15 minutes for our food!
My advice: MAKE YOUR EMPLOYEES CLEAN YOUR DAMN RESTAURANT. It's one of the most disgusting places ive been to try and eat and will not be back. If the front is that dirty I'm afraid of what the kitchen looks like. 

Where's the NO STAR button. This place is right up there with my first review about that nasty McDonald's that was dirty with horrible customer service. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This is a solid place for those seeking Hawaiian food since it's not a very common type of food found in this area that I have seen.  I tend to favor the Chicken katsu which is served with boiled cabbage, steamed white rice, and macaroni salad.  

Other items on the menu to take note of would be the Moco Loco and Spam Moco which are also common foods amongst the locals in Hawaii.  If you seek a quick place for some Hawaiian type comfort food this restaurant is pretty good.  With generous portions and plenty of seating, my friend and I tend to go here when we're looking to have a late lunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"The food is always great and so is the service. Today being Fat Tuesday and no meat tomorrow for lent we decided to stop by to eat. It was about 20 mins close to closing but the staff was SUPER GREAT! Food came out quick and they even let us finish eating even though they were closed! A man walked in after closing and the girl had informed them they were closed but the chefs in the back noted they can still whip something up and so he ordered food. This by far has to be in my list for the best customer service. Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"The only thing good is the macaroni salad. Disappointed :(  This was my second time trying this place and it was no better than the first. I won't give it a third try"}

Having lived in Hawaii 20+ years i dig into a plate lunch now n then.
I went to Ono(Means taste good in Hawaiian)And i was stoked.
I go for the bbq  chicken its  marinated in pineapple juice i think
2 scoop rice and mac salad.
These guys do chicken well
The place is jammed on a wed.  at lunch
Wish they had this kine in London
A.B.

and i will be back"}

{"text":"Food was good, the teriyaki chicken, beef and pork was the way to go!  The family meal is a great deal!  The macaroni salad was very yummy as was the sauces.  

Prices were great and my Dad's biggest excitement was the fact they offer Spam and Eggs on the menu.  We will be back again.  

Would have given them 5 stars but no Mai tais."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered Chicken Katsu through drive up. When I got home no sauces in box. No Katsu or Teriyaki sauce. Maybe a half scoop of Mac salad. The \"chicken\" was over cooked and the actual chicken was so thin there was more breading than chicken. I was really looking forward to Ono opening. Been here twice. Both times I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Their food is rich in flavor. They also allow for extra sauces on the side. My favorite had to be their teriyaki chicken. I like having both katsu and teriyaki sauce on the side. The pricing is fair given the fact it's made fresh. They lack locations but I would recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is good I get the barbeque chicken and some of there sauce very tasty and not a lot of money"}
{"text":"Their portions are very generous  f all their food was very flavorful even before adding their sauces. Their cabbage which is a filler was not seasoned . We do like the sauces also their chicken was chopped into very small pieces maybe over cooked"}
{"text":"my sister and I stopped for lunch at the Ono located on Dysart road. I was wanting a good noodle dish. I ordered a noodle and shrimp soup. when it was serve I found a medium sized bowl of some vegetables, maybe a half dozen small shrimp, and then after a little search found some dough tasting noodles at the bottom. The noodles tasted as if they had not been cooked. All the while this establishment had the audacity to charge almost 10 dollars for this garbage. I would not revisit this place nor would I ever recommend it to a friend. it's a rip off."}
{"text":"Good food and service! Next best thing to being in the islands I guess. Better the nothing at all."}
{"text":"We went for dinner but their was a scent that was so strong. We ordered  take out but it took 30 minutes  to get our meal. Their were 5 orders that got their meals. Before us. The Kolbi  ribs were great but hard to cut. Tried the spam but it was tough and salty. I will  not order again . Macaroni  salad was good . Portions  are large. I still  love their food but the service  is really  lacking. Last year I ordered  take out and they left half the order off"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work so I will have a lunch a day a month or so  when I want to be filled up and want some decent Hawaiian food.  I wouldn't call it authentic because I LOVED me some L&L when it was in town and there are a few other restaurants that are a little better. This hits the spot when I'm craving some mac salad and some BBQ beef - get the mini meal."}
{"text":"Ended up here because the Cajun place around the corner was closed for some reason.

Very pleasant surprise.  Menu selection was good, prices were great and the food tasted pretty good and the portions were huge.  Service was very quick as well.

Both my wife and I got salads with meat.  Compared to the amount of meat that we received on both (a ton), the salad portion was just a side, but that's not a complaint."}
{"text":"Love their food! Especially their teriyaki sauce was a catch for us.  We will definetly come again when we will be in town."}
{"text":"Sometimes you've got to satisfy your spam musubi cravings, luckily for me there's an Ono's close to my work and I'm able to get me a spam musubi fix. MMMMmmmm for spam musubi, spam and sticky rice with teriyaki sauce wrapped in a seaweed roll... yum yum! And with my spam musubi i usually get the curry chicken katsu... with a scoop of rice and two scoops of macaroni salad... it makes for a good plate lunch altho it's a tad pricey, wish it was slightly cheaper. But we're aways from the islands and plus this Californian chain is not really from Hawaii but it's still good stuff! Totally recommend if you're craving spam musubi and some katsu, it satisfies and spam is just yum!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. I have never once asked for napkins at a restaurant I was a paying customer of and been asked \"what for?\" as a response. Just give me a damn napkin!

The food was below average. The terrible service and multiple dirty looks from the workers is not worth going back to ever again. Next time I'm craving Hawaiian food, I'll make the drive to Aloha Kitchen in Mesa."}
{"text":"C'mon, five bucks for a big, quality plate of delicious lemon chicken? Please. Really, we're talking about two meals worth of food.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"The fast-food restaurant scene in Phoenix straight up baffles me. You've got the Chicago staple Portillo's, California cult favorite In-N-Out, and the southern stylings of Raising Cane's all in one spot. Then you've got a mostly California chain serving up Hawaiian food here? There's literally only one place in Chicago that has them delicious musubis and plate lunches, yet Arizona has multiple spots. I don't get it!

Ah well, at least while I'm here for work I may as well get in what I can. If you're unfamiliar with the plate lunch, it's usually a mound of rice, some macaroni salad, and a large helping of protein on some random lettuce. I went with the chicken combo, which comes with a teriyaki-like barbecue chicken and chicken katsu, which is a sliced fried chicken cutlet. It didn't really taste much different than other Hawaiian I've had, but the name of the game here is comfort. That it definitely delivered on.

I also got the Spam musubi, which is like Spam sushi. It comes with two giant pieces, and unfortunately like other places, it's way too much rice for the amount of spam you get. Like, I ended up only eating half the rice on my pieces. Good, but I would only get it if I'm splitting with someone and as a side dish.

Overall it's good food that would cause dietary problems for me if I had easy access to it. If I come back to Phoenix I'll definitely swing by again."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday, and man, how things have changed in a few months.  No longer have that wonderful asian sauce in bottles to have as much as you want.  You have to ask for it, and they give you cups with a little tiny bit in it.  Seriously, when you stick your fork in it, it coats just the tips of the fork, that's how little they put in it.  So I had to ask for two.  And it still wasn't enough.  They skimped on the macaroni salad too.  The meat wasn't as juicy either.  I can only imagine that maybe they have changed their management?

We will not ever go back, if we are in the mood for Hawaiian, we will stick with Aloha kitchen.  

Ta ta, Ono..."}
{"text":"When i was there I was waiting for my food and heard one of the cooks drop a metal utensil like a spatula or something and I'm pretty sure they didnt wash it also there were many tiny hairs in the macaroni salad. The chicken was tasty though... Very conflicted."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Associates are consistently rude. Slow service. Dirty establishment. Complained to management but he didn't seem to care. Taking our business elsewhere"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and both times bad service.  I got the Island Fire Chicken both times. Which was really good. But it's slow as hell (both times) and the employees are rude."}
{"text":"Ah the smell of the sea air, the sounds of the waves crashing on the shore line. These are just a few things that remind me of visiting my family on the big island during the summer. The food at this place is kind of like those people who want a tan so they go to one of those spray on places and come out looking like a big orange LOL. Sure you come out darker but you still look like a jack 'o lantern. The same can be said for real island food, once you taste the real thing there is just no substitute. 

Now I understand that those who are not millionaires, lottery winners, or big money making executives can not afford to go to Hawaii every time they are ready to feast on a large serving of slow roasted Kalua pork (the roasted pig that is placed in the ground served at every luau) or a plate lunch when they want something fresh tasting and well.... cheap. But this places does a better job than most. 

Like I have said in many of my reviews if you are going to do something make sure you do it right. Do not slap a piece of pineapple on a burger and call it a Hawaiian burger! Why you ask?? Simple because there is no such thing!! Ask anyone who knows real island food and they will tell you that most of a Polynesian diet is made up of sea food (we do live on islands after all LOL) and pork. So for all those who are used to the images of sliced ham with pineapples stay away from this place and stick to chain places like Chili's and their humm.... island inspired menu items. ( Just sounds wrong does it not?)

The thing that made me want to try this place was the fact that it had a simple yet well though out menu. They offer several of the normal plate lunch staples such as white rice, and macaroni salad ( for those like myself who can not eat fish they add tuna to the mac salad so make sure to ask for a substitution or you will be sorry). They even offer Loco Moco ( a traditional island breakfast favorite) and Kalbi Short Ribs. I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Mix which offers three types of meat (had missed breakfast) and two scoops of white rice and mac salad. 

This was my first time here so lucky enough my dining partner tasted the tuna in the salad before I ate it. Note to owners given that tuna is not normally found in mac salad why not include that bit of info on your menu humm... just saying!! The rice was fresh made, hot, and was good. The ribs were a little tough though and could have used less salt (pork is naturally salty so less is needed especially when the meat is cut so thin). 

The chicken had a great tasting glaze but was a little on the dry side. The BBQ beef was good and cooked all the way through (do not like under cooked meat) and the can of tea that came with my meal was good and cold. Now for two combo meals, that included two drinks we only paid $11.50. Not bad given the normal price would have made it around $17.00 ouch! We took advantage of their great 50% off deal they have. It ends on the 18Th so make sure you get there soon to take advantage. Just make sure you go there with a open mind, empty stomach, and you will enjoy some really ONO ( means delicious) food.

{"text":"I was excited to get my plate lunch fix on while I was in Phoenix and this place fit the bill.  The food was great and came up quick.  I think I had the Hawaiian combo or something like that.  It was a mix of chicken and beef with the scoop of rice and macaroni salad.  Not quite up there with my favorite place in Hawaii but good enough!  Phoenix is lucky to have such a place."}
{"text":"Just got done eating at Ono. This was my first time. I absolutely loved it. The portions were huge, the service was great and the food was amazing. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I got chicken, fried shrimp and fried fish. It was good but greasy and a little bland. The macaroni salad is good. It was about 26 dollars for me and my boyfriend l, which is extremely overpriced. The soft drinks are like 3 bucks each. Just ok, not dying to go back though."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars. I ate here Thursday night, I had the BBQ chicken plate, and had the WORST food poisoning. And I'm 38 weeks pregnant. My boyfriend had the BBQ beef and was just fine, I guess only my chicken was undercooked. So be careful, but I will never ever eat here again."}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for some light food, that is very flavor filled. Then Ono is the place. Teresa showed me this place, other wise I would of never known.
It is tucked away in a shopping center on Thomas.
Busy place and now that I have been here a few times, I have to say it is always good. I like it to go though, because, it is always so busy and so much noise. 
I just feel better taking it home.
The Macoroni Salad is really good. It is great food to take on a picnic or an outing.
The food is very fresh as well. Probaly because, they do such a great business nothing has time to get old. It is worth the time to check this place out, Bra!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kalua combo and the pork and chicken came out really good! Pork was moist and full of flavor, not dried out like in other BBQ places. Definitely recommend this place to fill your Hawaiian food cravings."}
{"text":"This place was busy when we stopped by on a Saturday evening, around 8:30pm, to get some food to go. Of course there was a wait, but it wasn't too bad.. 

Spent about $20 for a regular combo, mini, and spam musubi (2pcs)... And it ended up being a TON of food... 

Service was nothing exceptional, but pretty standard... It's fast food, you pay at the counter. 

I don't normally like Katsu but ended up really liking it from this place. Breaded white meat (but not too heavily breaded), and super tender and still juicy. just a tiny bit on the oily side. I actually had it with Onos teriyaki sauce, which I think is so much better than Katsu sauce. Their BBQ chicken is served dry (no sauce). Nothing too special, it's boneless chicken. But prepared fine, tender and not dried out. Not really a ton of flavor going on here, so don't forget some sauce. The macaroni salad was simple but added to the meal. And I actually appreciate the boiled cabbage under the meat. People probably don't eat it often, but I liked it with my chicken.. 

Decent place for a quick rice fix... 

Dining area has plenty of tables, pretty clean, super busy location."}
{"text":"It's been my go to for the last few days. As a classically trained chef that says a lot!!! ENJOY AND GRATITUDE!!"}
{"text":"First time trying hawaiian food and this place is pretty damn good. My favorite was most definetley the island fire chicken, but the bbq beef is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, lived here awhile never chose to eat here because hubby said it was sweet, I don't care for sweet meat but I do like good BBQ and teriyaki, so I tried the beef, bad mistake, the flavor of meat was very good but could not eat hardly any, it was mostly nasty fat and sinew which I tried to chew but it would not break down! I don't eat rice, and it was plain and white, I did like the macaroni salad though!  Hubby had chicken, it has a great flavor, so if I go again may try the chicken or the ribs! I left hungry, for $23.00 you would think that wouldn't have happened! Don't think I have ever seen that much fat on slices of beef, had more I couldn't eat compared to what I could! They had lots of customers at lunch time, thinking I may have got the wrong entree I guess!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Ono location i ever been to. 

Staff - they were having an argument that night i went. One of the girls stormed out crying

Food - extremely bland chicken and pork

Environment - new modern updated. (Reason for 2 stars)

I wish Ono would better train their staff. Very unprofessional, uncaring and had a lacking knowledge of their menu. Cashier couldn't do substitutions and only until i almost walked out was she able to(I'm on no gluten right now). 

I love Ono Hawaiian BBQ and have been a great fan since 2005. However this location sadly put the name to shame. 

The frustrating part is that the location had about 10 or 12 staff members that night yet food took forever to come out. 

Maybe its because they are new, maybe its because the owners here just don't care for quality and just the money. There was 3 asians that night that seem to be the owners/managers yet they ignored and just laughed that a few employees were arguing. Embarrassing. Actually i lm giving it 1 star now."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their BBQ chicken is great, but my favorite is the macaroni salad!"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks. Called for a carry out. Made my order. I wasn't done talking and he hung up on me. Happened once before so I ignored it, but now I won't be coming again. Super rude. Asshole"}
{"text":"Love the Katsu Chicken and Katsu Sauce. The mac salad is always great, and the service is decent, too. Great location from my work, as well!"}
{"text":"So...it's nice having something new in this area that's not Chinese food and burritos. 

The food tastes great. You can't leave without spending 11 bucks easy for a entrée and a drink. 

Just a couple issues. The servings are never the same. I always go to this place with a buddy and we always order the same thing. But every time, one of us end up with more food than the other. 

Customer service is below average. The crap look you get from every employee (minus the owner) is so sour. You can tell they don't want to be there. They would rather be at home chasing the dragon in their moms bathroom. (True story about one of the cooks)"}
{"text":"Consistent and always delicious! I always order the BBQ chicken meal with extra macaroni instead of the cabbage. My wife loves the cabbage tho. Love the food."}
{"text":"I go to this location fairly regularly and have never had a problem. Store is clean, employees are friendly, food is consistent. What more could I ask for? 

Until tonight. I get my order to go, the crispy shrimp plate. The girl working the register was really nice, and I was in and out quickly.

I finally get home and open my container. THE END of my good, reliable Ono experience. My shrimp are blackish/greenish/brownish...plainly, not something I am even going to take a bite of. (Gross!!!)

The store was about to close and I wasn't going to be able to drive back in time, so I called the store feeling like I should give them a heads up. I don't know if these things could make a person sick or not. (I do know I won't be the one finding out.) 

The girl that answers tells me, \"Yeah, that's how they've been turning out.\"  Well, gee, that's great. Thanks for selling me something you KNOW is sub-par and far from edible. 

I guess I'll be going to Pete's the next time I want some fried shrimp, and that's a shame. I really like Ono's mac salad and the katsu sauce with the shrimp.

To anyone else thinking about eating here -

Maybe you should check your order before you leave. I'm sure this was a fluke and hopefully will be fixed soon, but I know how much I hate wasting money. And being hungry."}
{"text":"Service is Ho-hum but the food is good when you're in the mood for some Hawaiian food. The kahlua pork is good. Servings are generous enough that I anyways have leftovers. I like that I can get extra cabbage instead of rice and potato salad. My husband had a new spicy chicken dish but it was TOO spicy and had an upset stomach for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Geez, I love their BBQ chicken and cole slaw!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving Hawaiian eats, I definitely go to Ono. The food is good and their portions are good size for the price. Sadly the customer service has gone down, specifically the cashiers. Kaitlyn waited on us yesterday, with a scowl on her face and the attitude of \"I hate people and my job!\" She even snapped at one of the cooks when he was verifying our order. Luckily the food is good or otherwise I would not go here. Ono, please hire people that make your customers feel welcome that greet people with a smile. Not some rude bitchy teenager!"}
{"text":"Very tasty authentic Hawaiian style bbq.  Wife had chicken Katsu,  I had curry chicken both over sticky rice and salad. Reminds me of plate lunches in the Islands."}
{"text":"First time at Ono today. Stopped by on a Sunday at 2:30 PM and there were six tables full. Unfortunately five of them were waiting for their order. 

I ordered the #44: BBQ and Katsu combo. Order arrived in 18 minutes. The plate came with steamed cabbage, rice and Mac salad. 

First the sides: the Mac is a Hawaiian tradition but never my fave. The rice was hot, sweet and sticky, just the way I like it. The steamed cabbage was, well, steamed cabbage. Just a filler but I like cabbage. 

The BBQ: the chicken was okay but the beef was excellent. Juicy, sweet, tender, yummy. The chicken Katsu was crisp, light and tender, another yum. Good meal, they need to add a cook, tho."}
{"text":"I am from Hawaii, moved out to Arizona and been here for about two months. Craving the island food, I stopped here with my family. 

1. One of the girls at the register needs a hair net. I understand that the messy look is in, but when working with food you should tie it up! It just looks more professional! 

2. The other cashier was standing there with a fly swatter. How sanitary is that!? 

3. No hair net cashier girl took our order...and apparently when I said FORTY FIVE, she heard FORTY FOUR! Yes because 45 and 44 sound the same! (FYI fly swatter cashier girl told me that! WTF!?) Fly swatter cashier also had a little attitude because the Kalua combo I ordered came withy choice of meat. So I asked her if I ordered the wrong number and she told me no. So now I'm wonderful if no hair net girl has even made it past 3rd grade! 

4. When I was making our drinks with my 6 year old one of the cashiers and the cook were talking about \"don't bring that damn hoe in here!\" WTF!?!? HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL! 

5. While we sat at our table, the cook and no hair net cashier were COMPLAINING ABOUT ME SAYING 44 NOT 45!!!! I could hear them from my table! OMG!!! HOW UNPROFESSIONAL! 

6. While we were eating another patron came in and was quoted the incorrect price on her order from a Marisol (that's what fly swatter cashier said) so the cook came out and was making a huge fuss saying \"we're short staffed!\" And I'm like wtf!? How fucking unprofessional!! I COULD HEAR THEM FROM OUR TABLE! 

At this point my husband ushered me out the door because he could see how disgusted I was with the lack of professionalism and customer service! We will never eat here again! I only gave this rating a one star because I can't give them a zero! I will wait until my next trip out to Hawaii for my local food cravings! Just horrible!! FYI I didn't eat my food because I was afraid they did something to it!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Cheap meat... Macaroni salad I WOULD NOT RECCOMND. On a better note employees are nice"}
{"text":"I like the food, the wait is a little long sometimes, but I don't mind about it. I dislike the employees there. They are so rude.They can be really cheap with the meats, but it's whatever. I would go here again, but that will be once in awhile."}
{"text":"I go to Ono at least once a month because of my job (Sonora Quest) and every experience has been amazing. The food is on point and i have had pretty much every meal. The front staff are always smiling and cheerful. They keep the place clean and inviting. I see a lot of bad reviews on the food but I've never had a problem."}
{"text":"so dis one time, wen i stay up in phoenix, i was hungry for some local kine grinds. my fren said, eh, why not try some ono hawaiian bbq? they stay close by, and da food broke da mout.
brah, he was right! i had mop some bbq chicken wit mac salad and rice. hit da spottttt! cheeeee pono! dis hawaiian stay happy. was so ono i had for take one order to go. wish i had da kine in tucson!! aloooooha."}
{"text":"Here's the reality and its sad.  Ono's used have good decent food.  However, the quality have dropped at the Baseline location, the Thomas Road location, and the West Phoenix location.  The rice is never properly cooked, the meats are either over-cooked and burnt or under-cooked, the veggies are often too raw, and the portions sloppily placed in the boxes.  Sure the counter staff tries to make corrections when this pointed out, but really, should the customer have to serve as their quality control agents?  Also, how healthy can poorly cooked (over and under cooked) food be?

To make things worse and to signal of how things have deteriorated, I called their corporate consumer number 6 times and never received a call back.  Now, if the corporate office doesn't care about their product and how their locations are not being run correctly, why should I spend my money at their stores?  I won't anymore as their a plenty of other restaurants who want my business and are willing to properly prepare and serve their food.  

I shared my experiences with some of my friends and they added that they too have had poor food from Ono's.  They had stopped going there, but thought they were just being too strict.  Now they know that others like myself have discovered what disasters Ono has become.

Life is too short to put up with a restaurant chain that doesn't care about their customers and who can't get their food done right.  Spend your hard-earned money at Ono's at your own risk. I know I won't and many others also will not.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here three times now.  The first couple times, I would have given it three stars, but the third time is definitely NOT a charm.  I'm giving it one star based on the completely inedible BBQ chicken and long wait.  This must be the leftover s*** chicken that no other restaurant wanted to purchase.   

For a completely fattening, cholesterol laden meal, I would like to enjoy SOME level of flavor other than lard.  I calcuated the approximate number of calories (based on nutritional information from another fast food Hawaiiian restaurant with a nearly identicial menu) for a Chicken Katsu \"plate lunch\" to be a whopping 1,800 calories (1,200 for the chicken and 600 for two scoops of macaroni \"salad\" and one scoop of rice).  Gross."}
{"text":"Don't know why they got such a low rating, I thought they were polite, fast and clean. The food was good and the spam musubi was as good as you can get on the mainland."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.   I ordered a combination and the chicken came out raw.  Rather then fixing it for me the girl said it is like that and sure eats it.  I work in the restaurant industry.  Isn't it her job to fix it for me even if she thinks it's ok? So then I was going to eat it and she calls me back and says I guess I can put it on the grill for you. Food poisoning sucks. Obviously she doesn't care what the guest wants."}
{"text":"Meat selections get 5 stars but decor get 3. Takes a while to get food and the presentation isn't the best. I'm a fan of the combination plates. Good spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place I got the Seafood mix and the Spam Musubi. First time trying the Spam Musubi and it was so tasty. I called in the order and picked up, my order was right on time!"}
{"text":"It's one of them places you eat once a month kinda deal. The food is pretty darn good actually, and it's just as good as your standard Hawaiian BBQ joint. Which is for me anyways it's a once a month thing. There is only so many spare ribs combos available lol and that's what everyone else eats right?"}
{"text":"Minus one star for only having water in their tea-thingy.

The food's good. I split a Number 4, I believe, which included terryaki style bbq chicken breast and rice (it was supposed to come with a side of macaroni salad also, but I'm not a fan, so my boyfriend ordered double rice). I don't think it came with a drink since he ordered one seperately. I was hoping it was going to be enough food for us to split since it wa $7.99 -- pretty steep for a fast food meal. Sure enough, it was just the right size since neither of us was starving and it held us over for awhile. 

I say three and a half stars, but that's not possible.. so, I rounded up."}
{"text":"Love the Island Fire Chicken! 
Restaurant could be a little cleaner..maybe mop the floors more often."}
{"text":"Definitely hits the spot when I'm craving some korean food.  The meat is never dry, comes on a bed of cabbage and a scoop of rice and macaroni salad.  A great spot for an asian type lunch with big portions and quick service."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I'd always get the three meat plate which included a strip of korean ribs, maybe korean type beef(?) and a barbeque boneless skinless chicken thigh.  They would all be served on a bed of steamed cabbage with some rice and a bit of macaroni salad that somehow worked with it all.

I haven't been in months but it seems like something is different.  The meats just don't have the same flavor.  The korean ribs were overcooked and the marinade for all three just wasn't right.  There were also little patches of saltiness which is weird.  The cabbage had some grit in it which makes me worry about the cleanliness of the food.  The only thing that seemed to be the same was the macaroni salad - but that used to be the worst thing on the plate.

I'm so disappointed in this place.  It'd be edible with a bunch of hot sauce and if you plow through some of the grit, but might as well go to panda express next door.  :/"}
{"text":"Not very impressed. While the food is good, it is extremely overpriced for the portions & the wait time is ridiculous. 

I give them props on a decent & cleanly atmosphere. But I feel like I was entirely ripped off paying $10 for a few small pieces of chicken on a large portion of lettuce garnish... And the \"combo meal\" for that price didn't even come with a drink. I feel like I paid for lettuce & two scoops of rice with a small side of chicken. The chicken WOULD be good... If there was anything to it besides what looks like the scraps leftover from a rotisserie. 

And for some fairly simple food... Waiting over 45 minutes was bs. One gal works the counter alone, and clearly can't keep up with the call-in orders vs. counter orders as well. One person trying to keep up with orders while also trying to bag & box the food. All while you have 3-4 guys in the kitchen and the food is still slower than anything. Not a good setup. It was blatantly apparent I was not the only one annoyed with the slower than sit-down meal process. 

Doubtful a return visit will ever take place."}
{"text":"Been here once before. It was mediocre at best the first time. Thought we'd give it another shot. Maybe after 9 months away from Hawaii, the memory of our island cuisine will have faded from our taste buds. Worst. Saimin. Ever. Seriously, you're much better off eating Top Ramen. The chicken katsu isn't bad, but the katsu sauce is horrible. The teriyaki, BBQ chicken, and kalbi are just...wrong. They can't even make a Spam musubi right. The one bright spot is the mac salad. The mac salad is legit. Oh, and the can juice. Can't fuck up a can of Aloha Maid. We won't be back. Guess I gotta make my own ono Hawaiian grinds."}
{"text":"this place everything was great the only one thing that I ask please salt the rice water when you're making the rice it was rather on the bland side and needs salt while it's cooking"}
{"text":"This in one of two places I will go for this kind of food. Their 24th St and Baseline location is closer but they're reeeeeeeaaaallly slow. I mean slower than a herd of turtles. I will always drive across the ten to get some grub here.  The mac salad here is good. Best I've ever had ANYWHERE. Love the cabbage too.  I'm all about eating good, and this place never disappoints.  Not yet anyhow.  I don't know who they have grilling up the goods in the back but damn boy. He's like a ninja back there. You go witcho bad self."}
{"text":"The title says it all, because once you walk out the front door you are saying \"Oh no..........what did I just eat?\"

But this restaurant could be for you, that is if  you like to juggle globs of fat on your toungue every time you take a bite of their meat.  

Ono indeed."}
{"text":"Rating just based on the first 5 secs I came in.. the girl at the counter just looked at us.. didn't greet us or even say if she can take my order.. she just stood there looking at me.. and after ordering she didn't even say thank you... Or anything Worst customer service ever.. first and last time here."}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian food you will find in the west valley and I'm always happy when I'm eating food from here. Be careful if you go during lunch time because the rush can be quite insane.
I must give credit where it's due, the staff is fast and handles it well.
I always get the chicken katsu and a side of the fried shrimp or the crab Rangoons.
Try mixing the spicy mustard with teriyaki sauce. I know...it sounds weird, I thought the same thing when a gentleman told me. But I ended up becoming a fan, way better than it sounds. I put this on my chicken katsu and it gets better when it mixes with the rice. :)"}
{"text":"I hate to say that I frequent this place but I guess I kinda do...at least once or twice a month. I like the food, the Katsu is yummy when it's not basically all fat (which it is more often then not) but i like to get the BBQ chicken meal with the delish macaroni salad most of the time. Service can be slow. If you are walking in plan to wait 20 mins on most days. They will surprise you sometimes and have it out early. Here is a tip: order ahead! 
As far as customer service...ehh. The employees are just..well...there. I've never had one be overly nice to me by any means. I have been in there and the cashier be down right rude but I don't go there for the friendliness, I go back for a yummy escape to the islands ;)"}
{"text":"I love Ono hawaiian. The flavor of the food is really good and unique. Most of the time I get the bbq mix since it's one of my favorites. But everything is really good."}
{"text":"I like this place. Easy and has great lunch specials. The Bbq beef is good. Comes with rice and mac salad. If you want something different and fast, check it out."}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food Hawaiian BBQ. The food here is a tad greasy..but it taste very good!"}
{"text":"Prices recently went up but the food and service is still good, some new items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice and spacious. Quick service. Welcoming. Music was right level. Good was hit & tasted fresh. Interior is kinda cool - light fixtures & seating. 
Only complaints are its a lil warm and meat wasn't cut up like the other location by my work."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a yesterday and wow....I already want it again.  Its up the street from me and I well come back here often!  The menu is simple, the place is clean and the price isnt too bad.  Try the chicken.....really yummy!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the bbq chicken with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. I enjoyed the food here and the chicken was nicely seasoned and grilled to perfection. 

What liked here was the clean dinning area and the unlimited drink and condiment station. 

Parking is free."}
{"text":"My girls didn't like this place at all.  No wonder I never see very many people in there.  The service was not very friendly, just basic.

We got two small beef meals.  No one would eat the beef as it was a strange soft texture with lots of fat and stringy pieces.  The macaroni salad was just okay.  Only decent part was the rice and the teriyaki sauce.  We will be skipping this place from now on.

In fact we keep joking about it....
\"You want to go to the Hawaiian BBQ place?\"
\"O-NO\""}
{"text":"FUN FACT: did you know that Belinda Carlisle's 1987 hit song \"Heaven Is a Place On Earth\" was actually written about this restaurant? Well, it's true. The food at Ono's is so amazing. If you've never had Hawaiian food, you can't really go wrong with anything - but I definitely recommend the #4 BBQ platter. If you like meat, this is the meal for you! Also, don't be shy about trying the Spam Musubi appetizer - this is basically Spam Sushi - a dish that's popular in Hawaii. This location has a drive through, which if you go through it, don't forget to ask for extra sides of Teriyaki and Katsu sauce for your meal.  The food here is always, fresh, hot, and incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii myself, it's nice to see somewhere that serves proper Mac salad. I'm also fond of the curry-- I believe they do a great job on that."}
{"text":"While counting down the days for my trip to Maui, I wanted to get a Hawaiian Plate Lunch.  Luckily I found an Ono's close to my office.  Everything is always cooked fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken combo (katsu and Hawaiian BBQ chicken).

The BBQ chicken has a pretty good flavor to it, but it was a little greasy for my taste - I think it might have been better with white meat instead of dark.  The katsu chicken wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular.  The rice was a little boring.

This was good enough that I'm not sorry I went, but I don't think it's enough to get me back.  Maybe if the price dropped a buck or two."}
{"text":"Food is 4 stars. Cashiers 1. (Continuation from pic)Who is this girl? Is she an employee? On the clock? Off the clock?a friend of an employee?  She stood there for over an hour, Walking back and forth between the kitchen and the counter talking with employees behind the counter about things you should not be talking about (full of profanity) at a place of business especially in an open kitchen like that. My family sat in the back of the restaurant and we could still hear their entire conversation. We all heard it. Including  my 9year old son. Then to top it off the girl in the middle decides it's time to mop at 830pm when there are still a bunch of tables eating and they close at 930pm. Not the best time to do that. She's lucky no one slipped and fell. These employees are a lawsuit waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is by far one of the worst. If you plan on eating here before a movie, make sure you show up an hour and a half early and you just might make it to your movie a few minutes late. I thought it was a one time occurrence but its not. If you have nothing but time and are not seeing a movie then this is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and I thought ono's was pretty good. The BBQ chicken was good. The katsu seemed a little weird but it tasted good and the portions great! Too bad they don't have meat jun!"}
{"text":"When I'm home late from work, you can bet my husband got Ono's. So it's my life saver. My kids absolutely love it. They always have some great deal like buy one get one free. They love the Katsu chicken or the Korean BBQ short ribs. It's so cheap and pretty healthy for you. I don't know why anyone would pay same price for mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Got the number 1 Hawaiian chicken BBQ. My favorite.  Easy quickly. Chicken is good. Rice is amazing and the macaroni salad to die for. It's fattening so I'm glad the portion is long too big lol. Ono is my splurge food :)"}
{"text":"This has become a go to lunch spot for me 2/4 times a month the lunch special for 6 bucks is a good deal. I usually have one of the chicken dishes ......curry, katsu, terriaki"}
{"text":"Seafood Mix = two meals.  Chicken is always juicy, not dried out like other places I've tried.  Only set back(?)  is that they're not affiliated with the \"chain\" so their menu items and specials are not the same as what's on the website."}
{"text":"This was a great meal. I really enjoyed it. I got the BBQ chicken and it was very moist. Perfect place for lunch or even dinner cause the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. However, there's something I just don't understand. 

They have the pick one plate and the pick two plate. Pick one is $7.49 and pick two is $7.99. So with the pick two you get two entrees. Cool. But why did the cashier just tell me when I ordered a pick two with two entrees of Hawaiian BBQ chicken that it would be the same amount to food as the pick one. So you're telling me that the pick two costs .50 cents more but you don't get any more food as the pick one cause you take the portion and you split it in half between the two entrees. 

Meanwhile at Panda Express when you order a two entree you get two portions of whatever two entrees you order. 

Don't charge me extra for the same amount of food because you're giving me the choice of two kinds of meat instead of one. Change your pricing model to get what people are expecting since every other restaurant works in the way I described above (Panda Express example) or don't offer a pick two. It makes no sense and you will just anger customers when they figure out you are scamming them. 

It's not about the amount of money, it's the principle."}
{"text":"I always stop here when I travel to Phoenix for work.  The food reminds me of the years I lived in Hawaii."}
{"text":"This place is very slow and they don't have great customer services the food is a hot or miss. One day it's great no complaints the next time the meat is fatty and over cooked. I would recommend Hawaiian bbq on bell and 77th"}
{"text":"This place rocks, but if you count calories then read their nutritional information BEFORE ordering!"}
{"text":"It's pretty ono..not as good as L&L but still can fix my cravings from home..I always get the kalbi lunch plate, and the Spam Musubi.   Better to order the meal with raw cabbage then cooked cabbage."}
{"text":"I come here often during my lunch while at work. Quick service most of the time and always delicious! I came here twice this week and the chicken was very cold like it had been sitting out. Usually it's hot like it's made to order. I always get the mini chicken bbq plate with no rice substitute fresh mix salad and still got rice and no macaroni salad :( disappointing as the macaroni salad is my favorite and what I look forward to. They even repeated the order. Other than that, very good when it's fresh."}
{"text":"If I could leave a zero, I would. Horrible experience this afternoon. Went in with a coworker for lunch. Planned on eating there, but due to the circumstances ended up eating at Jersey Mikes right next door.

I don't write reviews often at all this is my 5th in a couple years, but am compelled to do so today. 

We ordered food, several people behind us ordered food and were served before us, if you know this place the menu is simple and no reason why our order of chicken should take longer than the next persons. Then, one of the customers walked back in with the food she was given, told the cashier it was the wrong food, cashier tried to blame the customer for grabbing the wrong bag. I also overheard the customer ask the cashier 2 times if she was grabbing the right bag, cashier confirmed. So cashier made the mistake but blamed the customer. 

So that container of food was put back on the counter, cashier showed the cook and said it was wrong, cook opened the container and did something to the food. Then the cashier grabbed that container along with another one and tried to serve to my coworker. 

Very unsanitary, very unorganized, and rude. Manager didn't seem to care. I will never go to this location ever again. 

If you want to eat food that have been handled by people other than the employees here, go for it!"}
{"text":"Quick review:  
It's pretty good.  
I eat here when I'm in the area but don't seek it out.  
It's somewhat lacking in value and the food is not really remarkable in any way.

Good Musubi, and it's the best Hawaiian food in North Scottsdale ;)"}
{"text":"My co-workers always talk about this place so I joined them this time. Bruh! I got the Spam Rolls, yes SPAM! The BOMB! It was like a sushi roll but SPAM! The teriyaki chicken was okay and the rice as well but if you dig macaroni salad? You'd buy a bucket for your picnic dawg. I had a little extra cash this week so I splurged for lunch. $17.00 but it was sooooo worth it! Give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. I recommend the bbq chicken combo w an extra side of macaroni lol you can't get enough of that delicious stuff. I'm craving it now."}
{"text":"Hawaiian BBQ options here in the East Valley are very limited. There are only a handful of places. The plate lunches here are pretty decent, nothing remarkable, but hits the spot when I am craving some Hawaiian bbq. Their mac salad is pretty good also so I can't complain. It's not the definition of the ultimate plate lunch, but it does it's job to fill that craving."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. We weren't a fan of the food and we won't be back. I believe the food was cooked properly however we just didn't like it. It took 16 minutes for us to get our order. My biggest complaint was lack of seating on a busy Saturday afternoon. There were four of us and we had to crowd around a small table while a single employee sat at a long table with 6 chairs. I know the manager walked up to this employee at least twice and spoke to them so the manager was aware but the employee did not move."}
{"text":"I would not give this place anything less than 5 stars. I went for the first time today and loved it! I ordered the number 44 which had like a mix of all the meats, rice? And pasta. The service was superb. I got my order quickly. It was fresh and the meat was so tasty. My only complaint is that the water tasted weird.

People are saying it's overpriced but my lunch meal was around $9. For the amount of food that came with it I think it's definitely worth it. I'm for sure coming back."}
{"text":"Great food that wont make you feel too guilty. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and even though we went during one of the opening weekends it was still pretty quick."}
{"text":"You can't beat the lunch special or any of the teriyaki dishes for that matter. Another viewer said it's like eating off a food truck at the beach in Hawaii it is!
I had the noodle soup and it was excellent as well. The staff is professional and focused on their customers. Whenever I am in the area I plan on taking advantage of the specials regularly."}
{"text":"For places that serve Hawaiian fast food it was not bad in the morning i will try the Musubi that will be the real judgement breaking point..."}
{"text":"I always steered away from Hawaiian bbq, that is until today. I've been living under a rock. My husband and i shared the chicken Katsu, bbq beef and short ribs. I didn't care too much for the Katsu but the beef. Holy cow I was in heaven! I will be returning for the short ribs which by far was the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken Katsu! BBQ beef was not nearly as good."}
{"text":"They have fantastic macaroni salad and rice. The kalbi short ribs and the teriyaki chicken are both favorites. Fast and very friendly service as well as great lunch prices!"}
{"text":"Forgot to write this review yesterday night. Called in the order so I could just get there and pick up my food and go. The lady said it would be ten min, so ten min later(probably more) I was there and paid and sat down because my food wasn't ready. Long story short I waiting longer then I should have...but I have to give it to the 2 cooks that went out their ways to come out and apologize for the wait. One came out and gave me a drink for the wait and apologized and then a few min later the other cook came out and sincerely apologize and explained why they took so long. I did have to wait a bit too long but because the way they handled the situation it made it okay and I left with a smile. Great job on customer service!!!(I've been Having some horrilbe experiences)great food also of course!"}
{"text":"We came during promotion week so we got the coupon for BOGO free entrée. woohoo! Really love their teriyaki chicken. Will come back to try their katsu one day."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ in town... Okay, okay its the only Hawaiin BBQ in town. This newly opened joint is good. Food portions are huge amd the food is cooked well. Onos is a chain but has a local feel to it. The prives are a bit high but you do get a ton of food. My favorite is the island fire chicken, spam masubi, and the macaromi salad. The restaurant is good for both sit in and take out. Why did I give this place 4 stars instead of 5? Like I stated earlier, this place is pricey."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Not only do they have delicious chicken with multiple sauces and methods of preparation, they have very delicious macaroni salad. Make sure you try it. Also, The food I understand is Hawaiian. Fine by me."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Hawaiian place since I moved out here from Portland. This place does the trick. Bbq chicken is super good and I like their Mac salad. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Freaking amazing.

I really hate there is a minimum character limit on this shit. It's good. It's clean. It's fast. They are friendly. =)"}
{"text":"Good plate lunch. You can't go wrong if you order spam musubi, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken or BBQ beef.

Reasonable price and delicious food."}
{"text":"hi everyone i was a well know customer of this restaurant until this incident happen.  after arguing and debating with the store supervisor i was able to take my food back..  i informed the district office of this incident and this is all they could reply back.
    first of all, we would like to apologize again forthe incident. as a token of apology, we are giving you two (2) free plate lunch of customerchoice, exclude family meal and catering items. valid only atono hawaiian bbq at thomas rd, phoenix, az.

  i was really disapointed in the way they handled this case. and they still expect the costumer to return to the location where i was fed the discusting food.
  if there is someone out there that has any suggestions on what i should do please message me!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating from this location for about 10 years and have never had as bad of an experience as i did tonight. Called at 6:40 to place a pick up order and was asked to hold. After waiting on hold for over 30 minutes I decided to just hang up and drive down to location to place my order.  

After driving 15 minutes and calling multiple times along the way (phone still off the hook from my previous call) I actually had to walk in and when I asked for the manager she was rude and abrupt. I told her what had happened and her response was that they were training new people.  So in an entirely empty dining room and three associates working not one could remember the phone was put down. She immediately started acting with an attitude so I asked for the district managers phone number, she wrote his cell on paper and handed it to me and walked away without offering an apology or a discount on my meal. (I don't want a discount I want good service) mind you this is after being on hold for essentially 45 minutes. Hope no one else was trying to place an order during that time. I then hear the manager around the corner talking to the cook about me with a smile on her face because it's so funny apparently. 

I called Sam from the lobby after placing my order and he was sincerely sorry and wanted me to hand my cell phone to the manager or cashier to speak to them. After explaining I didn't want to give my phone to his employee he said he wanted to get me something for free to which I explained I don't want a discount. I go to places willing to spend my money in exchange for good food and service. 

I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but looking at this yelp page shows they have had this issue numerous times and are making no effort to get better. How hard is it to answer phones? Hate to say I won't be back because Sam was very nice but the service from his staff just doesn't merit the return."}
{"text":"Tired of the usual, mundane dining options? Looking for something different? I've got a suggestion for you. Ono Hawaiian BBQ has been a favorite of my girlfriend's for years, and despite its \"chain\" status, it's menu is unique and sure to impress.

I've enjoyed Ono BBQ dozens of times over the years. Lately, not only have I been noticing more locations springing up, but there are certain items on the menu that have become favorites of mine. Particularly the macaroni salad. More on that later.

Months ago, the last time we were in Vegas, my girlfriend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat on the way out of town. We found a \"Hawaiian BBQ\" place that we figured might be okay, seeing how we liked Ono. This place was no Ono! It was disgusting and put things in perspective. Tonight's visit to Ono warranted some Yelping.

My girlfriend loves the ribs and I'm a fan of the fried shrimp and fish. Despite the preparations, these are fairly healthy options which include rice and cabbage with vegetables. And there are even healthier options available but I've yet to try those.

In the meanwhile, let me brag about the fish and shrimp. The breading is delicious and crunchy. Plus the shrimp seem larger lately and the fish is generous, thick and moist. And did I mention the macaroni salad? I figured out why I enjoy it so much. The secret ingredient is tuna. And it's so good!

With all the options and combinations, there is sure to be something for everyone in the family and enough variety to keep you interested. Plus, for the amount of food you're getting, Ono is a great value!

Ono BBQ has a lot of things going for it. The locations are clean, the service is always fast and friendly, and their Katsu Sauce is amazing! Plus, I'm pretty sure they don't sell SPAM. Look, Ono may not be representative of all Hawaiian cuisine. But I'm not flying to the islands for fried SPAM. Also, avoid the Hawaiian BBQ place near Henderson!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't do it for me. It's a nice spacious place that is clean and has friendly employees. But I guess I'm just not a fan of the Kalua Pork. I liked the Katsu Sauce that I put over the pork. But overall, my tastebuds were underwhelmed by the Kalua Pork."}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty good.  I would give it 4 stars for flavor and value.  We got the family meal so we could sample a few different things.  The island fire chicken was my favorite.  The BBQ beef also had great flavor and their macaroni salad is quite delicious.  The only thing we ordered that we didn't love was the kahlua pork, it doesn't really have any flavor and we had to douse it in their teriyaki sauce.
 
The 3 stars is more for the quality of meat.  Not that I'm expecting high quality, but the beef has quite a bit of gristle that you had to cut off.  Not the easiest to do with cheap plastic knives.  The kahlua pork also had a lot of fat in it.  Not the best texture.   I would like to come back and try their fish.

Also the clientele (which I know isn't the restaurant's fault) might prevent me from returning to this particular location.  Most of the diners were quite dirty in appearance, dirty kids running around in pajamas....made me feel dirty just sitting there.  So I may get it to go next time or try out a spot in another part of the valley."}
{"text":"Went here today and was very disappointed.  First of all what's with the cabbage on every plate.  Of all Hawaiian bbg I've never eaten the cabbage, nasty. I bought the most expensive plate and it was terrible.   I so not recommend this place.   Heck they don't even put napkins out you have to up to the counter and ask for them."}
{"text":"My rice was so soggy and mushy. After we ate we felt sick to our stomach. Dont recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ono Hawaiian BBQ is a great place if you are looking for something healthy and affordable.  I love their $5 value meal.  You have your choice between chicken, beef, pork and it comes with boiled cabbage, drink and choice of steamed rice or macaroni salad.  To cut back on the carbs, I just get a double order of cabbage.  

There are many fast food options in that area, but if you are looking for something fast and healthy, Ono Hawaiian is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and if you've ever been to any other Hawaiian bbq place you can already guess about 90% of the menu. The food was very good and I'm a sucker for dipping sauce which they had a couple of.  It's a tasty spot if your not in the mood for a burger or pizza."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 but my  shrimp's \"butt\" was loaded. Guys, please devein your shrimp! I want my $ for that.  Glendale, AZ location. Thank you"}
{"text":"I am a truly fan of Ono Hawaiian Restaurant. Courtney gave great customer service that allow me to make decisions on what I really wanted. She was able to provide me the opportunity of taking home the meal that my family really enjoyed! I am so grateful that Courtney was patient with me while I was making decisions on what I wanted!

The food was tasty and the restaurant environment was very nice and comfortable!

Thank you Courtney and staff for your great service!"}
{"text":"If you're in diet or want to make substitutions they won't accommodate. First impressions are everything- I won't come back.

Side note: Place had a very foul smell. Either the floors were washed with dirty mop water or the grease trap need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"I love some good Hawaiian BBQ and this place fits the bill. I called to order take out on my lunch break and sure enough by the time I got there my food was waiting and was nice and hot, which seems like a tall order for most take out. It was even still hot after the 10 minute drive back to work.

As for the food the flavors were great and I was devouring it like a mad man. Usually I am not a huge fan of the macaroni salad anywhere but I liked this and wished there was more of it (it was a solid ice cream scoop+ worth). The meat on the combo plate I got was all well cooked and still moist and tender not dried out.

They even gave enough food that I had some leftover that was enough for a small meal or a hearty snack. For the price it is a meal well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  The Mahi Mahi is flaky and fresh. The macaroni salad is good. Reminds me of some of the food I ate while in Kauai.  Highly recommend! My girlfriend likes the chicken /beef combo with fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Service is BEYOND horrible.. i called an order in, 30 min later arrived they had yet to start the food. 1 employee is eating why she is taking customers orders the other employee finishes texting & smiling at his phone before he attempts to help. I called to complain to the manager & he could care less actually admitting to being the one texting. Asked for the store managers number & guess what he could care less either he actually doesn't even speak proper English . Horrible business ethics!"}
{"text":"I have seen ONO specificly this location go down hill for years. Today was my last time, the prices have increase while the portions have gotten smaller and smaller. Today the seafood plate was terriblly over fried to the point where the batter was dark brown and the shrimp and fish dried out. the hawaiian plate was terrible as well. the bbq beef was all chopped up like hamberger meat. when i ask the order taker to look at our plates she said \" that's the way we do it now\". 

I absolutely loved ONO's when they first opened. Now I'll never go there again. theres a reason there offering 50% off deals it's about the drink and not about the food. 

so sad to see this happen to ONO's"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We live across the street so it's always an easy dinner. The food is good and you get a nice sized portion. I honestly have no idea why people don't like it!!!"}
{"text":"What the hell are they putting in this food? Is there drugs? There's gotta be drugs.
The food here is awesome, I seriously crave it all the time. I get the aloha plate with Hawaiian barbecue as well as the island fire chicken and it's AMAZING. Even the rice is fantastic.
I always get a couple katsu sauces as well, don't skip out on those!! Give this place a try. I've never eaten in the restaurant but getting it to go has always resulted in happiness!"}
{"text":"The place is about as authentic as one of those cheap plastic coconut bras that you get for $5 at the ABC store in the seedy part of Honolulu but it is tough to argue with their low lunch prices.  I can tolerate a lot more when it is only $5."}
{"text":"So yummy. Exactly what I expected and even better, can't wait to eat here more! The bbq chicken was great, Best crab Rangoon I've ever had, great Mac, and a nice clean place."}
{"text":"The food here is always great, and fresh. But they start closing down the building and cleaning an hour before closing. I have no problem with that normally, but they put the chairs up on the tables so there's no where to sit and wait for your food, and they take away the teriyaki sauce so you can't even get any on your own unless you ask for some from the back. Just very unprofessional and unsettling."}
{"text":"was a little disappointed in my visit. the menu looked great online. the food was mediocre at best. 5 star customer service. very polite and friendly. my food was ready before I sat down (bad thing in my opinion). it's just makes it seem the food is not fresh. 5 star service with 1 star food. the food seem pre cooked and microwaved for lunch. could be a good spot if your in a real rush for lunch. with so many better options in the surrounding area I likely won't return."}
{"text":"Went to Onos today because we had an email coupon spend $20 and get $5 off. Spent about double that and when I presented my cell phone coupon I was told they wouldn't honor that because I didn't print it out.  Get with the times Onos, everybody accepts coupons on  the phones now days!"}
{"text":"This was amazingly authentic. I hadn't eaten here because I thought it was a big box fast food restaurant.  That is so far from what they are... The food was amazing, and cooked fresh!"}
{"text":"A Different Twist.

The food at Ono Hawaiian Grill is good, the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating. On this visit I had the seafood combo plate and my dinner companion had the katsu and barbecue chicken. The combo plates come with white rice and macaroni salad and I have to admit I am not a fan of macaroni salad but the macaroni salad at Ono is really good.

The portions are a good size and great if you want to have a heavier lunch. Definitely not bad for a fast food."}
{"text":"Good Value for Your Money 

 The food at Ono Hawaiian Grill is good. The restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and accommodating.

On this visit I had the Bbq grilled chicken and my lunch companion had the BBQ Chicken Combo Plate. The combo plates come with rice and macaroni salad.   I have to admit I'm not a fan of macaroni salad but the macaroni salad is really good at Ono Hawaiian  Grill.

The serving sizes are you good, tsizes he food is always fresh, not bad for fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"ONO Hawaiian is a chain.  Several locations in several states.  That said, the food isn't bad.  Perhaps not as good as what you would get in Hawaii, but still pretty good.

Today we ordered a family meal.  Chicken katsu, BBQ beef, chicken curry.

The curry could have used more sauce.  Would have made the flavor stronger.  But it was fine.

The BBQ beef was pretty good.  Not salty, nice flavor.

The chicken katsu is like \"chicken fingers\" you'd get in many restaurants.  The katsu sauce makes the difference.

The meals come with scoops of rice, and scoops of a macaroni salad.  I'm not fond of mayonnaise-based salads (macaroni or potato).  This one isn't horrible.  I can't say it's good, but remember that I don't like mayo.  That I can eat any at all says it probably isn't bad.  If you like mayo you will probably love that macaroni salad.

Overall, pretty tasty.  And what was really cool was that the cashier took our coupon, even though their location was not listed as accepting them!  That is good customer service, in my opinion.  I would rate the food at 2.5 stars, but that kind of concern for the customer earns them a solid 3 star rating in my book."}
{"text":"Try the fish platter. 2 panko breaded fried crispy pcs of fish. The cashiers arr kind sketchy or rude but food is good."}
{"text":"I don't know who is taking their phone orders but she was very unprofessional and rude. I asked a questions and she forgot (or didn't care to) put me on hold and then proceeded to talk about me to whoever was standing next to her. I also had to ask the same question about 3 times to get an answer. 
I love their food, it's amazing. I'll still eat here, but someone needs to talk to this employee about how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Finally to the valley!  Considerably better than most out there. Very fast, friendly, and affordable!!  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My first experience with kalua pork and it was incredible! We also ordered chicken katsu and the Hawaiian BBQ mix. Everything was delicious. Moist, juicy, flavorful. They have warm teriyaki and katsu sauce that melts in your mouth. All the meat was hot and fresh. The workers all seemed happy and we came in right before closing. They didn't try to hurry us out and others even came in after us. The leftovers were equally as good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place.  It was good, not great.  Good flavor but meats weren't quality.  I will go back to try something else."}
{"text":"I agree with the reviews that indicate that the service here is not great.  It took probably 30 mins for me to get my food, and there were a large number of dirty tables around the place.  This was late on a Sunday afternoon, there were probably two or three other tables occupied when I arrived.  All that said, I liked the food.  The rice and macaroni salad were both very good.  The meats, while nothing special, were not bad and I liked their sauces.  I would not hesitate to stop by again."}
{"text":"I'm an Ono fan.  Most locations get a 4+ star review from me, but this location insists on putting the employees with the least amount of customer service skills in charge of dealing with customers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!  The BBQ Beef is the best I've ever had and the macaroni salad has been fresh and delicious every single time.  They take a long time getting your order ready, but its worth the wait because they obviously make it fresh and aim to please.  Put the hot sauce on your macaroni salad if you like HOT stuff... so good!
I've also tried the BBQ Chicken, which was also fresh and delicious and the Chicken Katsu.  My wife and daughter loved the Katsu as well.  I've seen some negative reviews of this place and I'm shocked to hear them, so I had to write about how great this place is!  Go try it for yourself and try the BBQ Beef!  YUMMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"I loathe coming here however, the only reason we come out here is because my mom loves the food. So we have to go through drive-thru each time. The workers taking my order and my payment are moody and come off annoyed that they have to work. We've actually drove up and had one of the workers talking to a friend on her phone! All the While asking for my card and giving it back. They never say that they'll be back with the order, they just shut the window in my face! I have been nice each time to them thinking maybe the workers are having a bad day but I think everyday they have to come to work, it's a bad day. Food is decent but customer service is a 1/10. Not impressed ?"}
{"text":"The food is pretty okay. I'm asking for Hawaiian ish style food in the hot dessert Phoenix. The food itself defintely tastes corporation or franchised. The atmosphere is pretty bland, kind of dirty and overall not appealing. The place does the job though. Get in, order food, enjoy and get out. It's a good lunch time spot or a quick bite, nothing too special besides the type of food."}
{"text":"Just started reviewing all my check ins and yelps says that I have this as my first check in?! Yeahhh! Anyways the food here is awesome and its near my house. Every time k need a spam masubi I always go here! Try it. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Chicken was rubber and rice was cold. The restaurant itself was dirty as well."}
{"text":"Good food and the coconut in the Shell and the coconut pupping is to die for the chicken is breaded 8n panko serve with rice so good"}
{"text":"At first I was impressed with the amount of meat on the plate until I discovered a pile of boiled cabbage underneath. The meat (both beef and chicken) had a good flavor, but you need the knife provided to cut away the grizzle.  Since this location is an easy drive from Luke AFB and Sun City/ Sun City West, I asked about a military discount and I was told they do not offer one. Overall this is a 3-. To feed 4 people I spent over $50. I might return in the future, but I can't guarantee it."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of the Hawaiian BBQ places and this one is my favorite. Their food is always made fresh but also very quick. The staff is always friendly, it's always clean. If you are looking for a quiet dinner I would suggest ordering to go, this place is always crazy busy but I've never waited longer than ten minutes. My favorite is the katsu chicken with crab raggoons, served with teriyaki and they hide the siracha behind the counter :)"}
{"text":"I love their curry chicken n spam rolls! I always order an extra side of curry with it! This is not a low cal place but they do have great salads and grilled meats. I've been coming here for about three years and the staff is always nice and helpful if I'm a little indecisive"}
{"text":"Wanted something different so we stopped by Ono's. I ordered the Hawaiian bbq mix and mini bbq chicken meals for me and the kiddos. Each meal came with rice, cabbage and macaroni salad- which is excellent by the way! Grabbed some teriyaki sauce and it was soooo good! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when Ono opened in Surprise.  The place was nicely decorated and clean.  The service was good and the staff was friendly.  Now, I have eaten my fill of plate lunch on all the islands so this is not my first rodeo. This was ok.  I had the mixed plate with Kalua pork and chicken teriyaki.  The portion of pork I received was ok but really fatty.  The chicken was really tender.  The hubby got the same but got the fire island chicken.  It was good but to spicy for me to eat a whole portion. The cabbage and Broccoli \"veggie\" was pretty good but was huge pieces.  The rice was rice.  The winner on the plate was the Mac salad. If I'm in the mood this will hit the spot but I'm not in love that I would go all the time."}
{"text":"Everyone was hungry but couldn't decide what to eat. Someone said barbecue so we searched and Ono came up. It was a good choice. A good choice of menu, chicken, seafood, beef, pork. Yummy! The macaroni salad was the best! It was a little slow but we had a big order so not a big deal. I had the seafood mix. Very good.   It's a lot of food for the price, too. Will definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I grabbed a late lunch here today during my travels. I always make it a point to get Hawaiian-style food whenever I have the opportunity!

The place was clean and fairly spacious with a few additional tables outside. 

Service was average for a quick-service restaurant. Nothing special. 

Menu was decent without being overwhelming. There are some photos to help if you're unfamiliar with the food. They offer Aloha Maid juices (!) in addition to fountain beverages.

I ordered the kalbi (spareribs) plate, which came with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop macaroni salad. Everything was piping hot and had great flavor. Generous portion. The kalbi was a bit on the fatty side, and the rice was sticky but just slightly too wet. Mac salad was fine. 

Overall, it was all right -- not outstanding, but still pretty good, and definitely a better choice than most fast food. Glad I found it."}
{"text":"Let me start with why I give 1 star! I placed a to go order at 11:03 order #10 and my to go order took 25 minutes they didn't call my number till 11:28 and yes I was watching my watch! I could not believe how long it took! I was so tempted to cancel my order and ask for a refund. I was very upset with the long wait but yes my food was really good and fresh but I don't think I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food at a fair price. This location is great and the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Been going here for a little over 2 years and keep going back. The reason is simple. They have great food at very reasonable prices. The portions are very good, and the service is good too. I don't understand any negative reviews. In over two years, I have never had a reason for complaint or been disappointed. My wife enjoys the food here too. I will keep going back until they are gone, or I move far away. I think I will go there for dinner tonight. Just writing about them makes me hungry!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the customer service makes me not want to come back.  I will say that the young ladies who took my order were very sweet and this 1-star review is not about them...it's about the manager.

I ordered the seafood mix, and when I got it, I saw a strand of hair in the mac salad.  I took the hairy food up to the counter and asked one of the young ladies to replace my food because of the hair.  She apologized immediately and took it to the person in the kitchen who prepared the food (who also seemed to be the manager).

Here's what I think should have happened: The manager apologize to me personally, replace my food, and offer a gift card as an incentive to return for another visit.

Here's what actually happened: The manager replaced my food in about 10 minutes and I heard him instruct the cashier to apologize to me.  The cashier brought me my food and apologized.  No manager interaction at all.  Again, this 1-star review is not about the cashiers, because she seemed genuinely apologetic.

While the food is delicious, I can't support an establishment that doesn't know how to manage and rectify a customer's concern as delicate as finding hair in the food.

Aloha, Ono Hawaiian BBQ (and I don't mean 'hello')."}
{"text":"First off this is not Hawaiian food. I am Hawaiian, moved here from Hawaii and was so looking forward to having some food from home to cure my homesick. I would say this is korean food. It can be difficult to order because no one seems to speak english as a first language and the supervisor is not afraid to come and yell at the employees at the register helping you. You can be rung up incorrectly if you do not pay attention. I don't think friendly customer service is a concern of theirs. And worst of all the food is bland and plain and terrible. Their kalua pork just tastes like someone boiled a big in water for days, no seasonings or flavor. Want kalua pork? Make it yourself - put a pork butt in a crock pot, sprinkle hawaiian salt all over the top and add 3 TBSP of liquid smoke. Cook on high for at least 7 hours and you've got yourself some killer kalua pig. My husbands favorite is chicken katsu - it was hard and just tasted like grease, hardly any meat in the thing. Should change name to NOT ONO just junk korean food LOL"}
{"text":"I just visited and had the alohoa platters. The meat was cooked well and the rice was delicious. Salad was excellent. I would definitely return. well worth the money. Enough food for 2 meals."}
{"text":"Always great food especially the beef and bbq chicken. 
Clean.
 I really like their steamed vegetables and rice. Not a fan of macaroni salad and theirs doesn't change my mind. I'm a regular lunch diner. So far the service has been good."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. The lady at the front desk is very rude and is not where it should be for Ono Hawaiian Brand standards. I ordered just spam musubi, it took 25 mins (not exaggerating) to get my ordered. It seemed they prioritize customers ordering over the phone versus customers in the store."}
{"text":"I really like Onos, the food is great. When I went to Hawaii, I had some food at L&L, it was very similar. I'm a fan for sure. I love Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"I love this place for Hawaiian food.  Ever since our Hawaii honeymoon I fell in love with Spam.  I didn't care for it before but in Hawaii it's everywhere.  Even in McDonald.  I really like spam Musubi but it's fun to try different type of Musubi if you don't like Spam.  Their portion is big so I would recommend sharing then you'll have room for coconut haupia.  If you like coconuts then you'll love this coconut jello.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.......I know what we're having for dinner tonight/heehee."}
{"text":"This was awful.  And now that we have been to Hawaii, it is even worse.  I have only been to Ono once before, many years ago in Scottsdale and don't remember it being this bad.  The service was horrible, the smell was foul, the food was gross.  Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"My BIL introduced his haoles side of the family to this place. For years it was \"plate lunch\" this and \"plate lunch\" that, so I was more than happy to finally have a reference for all the SPAM based conversations.

Ono is friendly, crisp, and clean. They serve a mean Hawaiian BBQ Mix
(BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef & Kalbi Short Ribs) and Chicken Katsu (a breaded fillet served with... duh Katsu sauce). The soups are tasty and the macaroni salad that everyone references definately lives up to its reputation. Portions are large, so unless you want to take food home, get one of the mini-meals. It can get a little busy at lunch time, but service is amazingly quick.

The BIL swears this is the best plate lunch he has found off the island and goes to his happy place with each visit. If you are looking for a different kind of barbeque, try Ono on for size and you too can be hanging ten in no time flat."}
{"text":"So we went here a few nights ago and at first it was looking like a good experience. 
We ordered and then went to get some sauce the sauce was empty.
The lady  taking orders was rude when I told her and then about 15 minutes later someone else told her and again she was rude. 
Finally after someone took the bin out and put it in front of her did she fill it. 
Our food was ok not like the ones we have eaten in California and the didn't give us our whole order they did leave out some items.
Overall it was and ok experience!"}
{"text":"I've had the Teryiaki Chicken, Curry Chicken and BBQ Chicken. They were ok but nothing special. The Island Fire Chicken is amazing. It's just the right amount of spicy for me. The greens, rice and macaroni salad mixed with the spicy sauce is great. I was also served by a lovely woman named Rachel.

She was working late on a Sunday of a holiday weekend and yet was still such a sweetheart and was so nice! I signed up for the loyalty program, so I see much more Island Fire Chicken in my future!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, quick and friendly service, and clean. They are a little skimpy with the macaroni salad, which sucks cause it's always my favorite on the plate."}
{"text":"Usually come here for afternoon lunch.  Been to this place 2 times.
Pretty consistent with the food.  Usually gets the Hawaiian barbecue chicken.  Plates comes with 2 sides.  Mac & cheese and vegetable side and cabbage under the meat. 
Nice flavor with the bbq chicken, but I do like the bbq sauce in additional.
Good quantity, you could do potentially 2 meals for this 1 lunch plate order. Quality is not bad.  
basic but consistent overall.

Lots of indoor seating. 
Place is overall clean. 
Big parking lot outside in the plaza. 
Service is pretty quick. 

I tried their spam musubi 2 times as well. This takes a bit longer to make for some reason. They do put a lot of rice in the wrap. Probably more than I like. But basic. 

Pricing: 
Definitely on the pricier side for a semi-fast food type of place.
But you get the quantity and consistent quality of food. Good post-gym workout, just decrease your rice intake. 
I believe the price for just a plate lunch came out to around $9. 

Would come back here if I was around the area and craving this. 
But will need to try more Hawaiian places in phx."}
{"text":"This place is great. 

Rose at the cashier is amazing! The food was fantastic. The number 3 combo plate with katsu and teriyaki chicken (typically BBQ chicken but we always sub teriyaki) is our go-to. 

Ample parking, great for a quick bite for lunch or dinner. I do hope they open more locations soon!"}
{"text":"I usually really love this place- we go to a few locations across town. 

3 star review because the girl at the register had zero customer service skills and also because the food made us both sick!:/ haven't had this happen before, we'll still come back... but not a very pleasant experience ."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, but the problem is it's way overpriced! For $ 20.00 for a meal at fast food. A little Outrageous! Plus there a loud mouth worker female who voice you can hear throughout the whole place."}
{"text":"It took me more than 20 minutes to get my single to-go order at this location. On a thursday night when there was hardly anyone there this was ridiculous. The food was OK, I've had better Hawaiian BBQ in the valley for less money. At almost ten dollars for the whole meal, it was not worth the money. Fortunately they do have a smaller, less expensive portion that would fill most people up for lunch."}
{"text":"I took my little brother-in-law here before going the adjacent theater to see Paranormal Activity (see it, its cool).  It was either this place, Rubio's, or that retardly expensive ice cream place that mixes in candy bars and crap (big deal for the price of a gallon of grocery store ice cream.

I had one of the mini meals or whatever it was called.  Chicken, a shit ton of rice, and cabbage (WTF?).  My chicken was cold and undercooked.  YUM!!!   Not really.  The flavor was okay... but who the hell wants to eat cold BBQ chicken thats rubbery and undercooked?  I guess I could have asked them to cook it more but we wanted to hurry cuz the movie was starting soon, plus they already took fovever with our order in the first place, for cold food.  

Justy had the ribs... they were as thin as, oh i dunno, thinner than a slice of bread... and they were mostly fat and bones.  Weird.  But, he said they tasted good and were hot, and that he would like them more if there was more meat on them.

The cashier was a douche.  He was short with us, had a cocky attitude (for what reason I have no idea!) and when I signed the reciept he literally ripped it out of my hand and said thanks GUYS.  Gee.  You're welcome?  Ass.

Another sucky thing is that they don't have a la carte items, you have to pay full meal price even if you only want the meat portion with no sides... which is what Justy wanted.

NEways, they suck, I would never go back.  I can find better food at my fav sushi place.  They serve terriyaki and katsu and all that crap.  And I don't rate a place well just because they give you a ton of food... quantity does NOT = quality in my book.

Shoulda went to Rubio's."}
{"text":"This place just opened up few weeks ago. Their food was delicious, freshly cooked and full of flavor. I always substitute the rice for additional scoop of the macaroni salad. It's hard to pass up on it. The place is very clean and their service was friendly. Can't wait for another Hawaiian craving to kick in and go back there."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and craving chicken, come here! I love how they pack their boxes. Portions are big! It my friends first time having Hawaiian BBQ and they would love to come back. I usually go with the usual, chicken katsu. My friend selected the curry chicken as her second choice and both were really good! I was told to not order the pork because it's something to stay away from so I did. I enjoyed Ono!"}
{"text":"This place is super affordable and yummy.  I love that it is something in the neighborhood that wasn't here already.  It is nice to have a change of pace.  The fast drive through is a plus!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here right when it opened at 11am. We order the ono family meal combo. Which come with 3 entrees and their macaroni and rice. Each entree comes with steamed cabbage in delicious juice's topped with whatever entree you get. The meal feeds a family of 4. I love the sweet sauce they give you with the meal. The food is so good and the service was great. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here and overall great experience. The cashier was really nice and helpful. We ordered the 2 plate with teriyaki chicken and bbq chicken, that was so good and we ordered the 3 plate combo which was chicken, beef and ribs. Ribs weren't the best but the beef was really good.  Rice and macaroni salad were good too. We'll be back definitely."}
{"text":"the food here is mmmmm. average. nothing special, but nothing atrocious. it's convenient if you're craving hawaiian food and are in the central phoenix-ish area. the bbq chicken is tender, but a bit on the ginger-y side. my friend ordered the bbq beef and thought it was extremely tasty. another friend ordered the crispy shrimp - and although it was good, the portion was scarce. 

i recommend ordering the mini plates (4.99), as they are a decent sized portion (and probably closer to a regular portion should be). not sure how the spam musubi tastes here. as far as the ambiance - not really a place to go for a conversation, as the \"hawaiian\" music is LOUD. and the staff? not too friendly.

it's unfortunate that all of the hawaiian food joints are so far apart! with gas being so expensive, you kinda hafta take what you got. because i think that moki's and l&l's are a bit better, as far as taste and options."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this place a 5. I come here often with my family and I've never had any issues like what I've read. But it seems many of the complaints are about service and no one answering the phone. I've never pre-ordered so I wouldn't know. But I've had good experiences when coming to eat here. The Food is always delicious! I do enjoy great Hawaiian food and miss authentic food from Hawaii when I used to live there. I believe this is the closest franchise I've seen here in the mainland that Ive tasted close enough to the food back there. This place is the Best in the valley when it comes to quality, they've never let me down here. 
I do understand some reviews wanting more Aloha spirit and I do agree that it changes an atmosphere when you're greeted with a warm Smile and employees are attentive to their customers needs. So maybe just that and answering the phone might help these customers and future ones change their minds about their reviews."}
{"text":"20 mins for a scoop of rice and dry chicken is unacceptable should've went to Wendy's and I wouldn't have been late getting back to work."}
{"text":"As far as fried or Asian style bbq meat goes this place isn't bad.  We got the mixed seafood platter and chicken katsu.  The katsu was thigh meat battered and fried - nice crunch, though the batter is a tad greasy towards the inside.  Their katsu sauce is a bit sweet, but it's really good and probably made the difference.

Seafood platter had battered shrimp and a white fish that I *think* was cod.  Shrimp was okay - not quite as good as Coconut's but passable.  The white fish was perfectly cooked and not too greasy - recommendable to any fish sticks fan.  And finally, the dish comes with bbq chicken - again, thigh meat and a tad greasy.  It doesn't really fit with the seafood but it's alright.  We ended up setting most of it aside for leftovers."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I love the mix plates. Also they are very nice. It was busy as all and they were pumping it out. I wish they had more side sauces though. This is my first time but won't be my last. The mac is bomb... I would  recommend 2 mac and 1 rice. It's awesome with ponzu too."}
{"text":"We were very excited to see them open in Surprise.  We have been here 3 times each one getting worse.  First time food was really good with slow service but it was clean and seemed well managed. Well today our 3rd and our final visit was not very good. We ordered from a nice young man and went down hill from there.  We went to 3 tables till we found one that was half way clean.  The tables and floors are dirty even after the girl wiped the table next to us it was dirty she just spread the sauce on the table all around.  If the outside where customers are is not kept clean what about the kitchen.  We are home now and my wife is sick from the food.  Oh well we will not return.  They need to Clean up there act"}
{"text":"When I don't take a lunch break or I am craving some bbq and rice, I swing by Ono. Food comes out fast, and the marinated/grilled meat is tasty.  Portions are large and are either enough to satisfy or save for another meal. The workers are always nice and upbeat. 
The only downside (and Ono can't help it) is the neighborhood is BAD. I go through the drive-thru because I don't feel safe walking in the lot. I have seen multiple drunk, high, and homeless people linger in the lot adjacent to the building."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! All their sauces are delicious and their meat is spot on. If you try it you'll get hooked and need to eat it at least once a month if not more. Reheat good too. Get the family meal so you don't have to cook the next day"}
{"text":"Really bad food. Cold. Stale. Nasty. Almost inedible. 

Super friendly staff though. Decently quick service."}
{"text":"This place is always sooo good! They probably know my family by now. Everyone who works there is super helpful. The only thing is... The curry chicken is GONE now? Breaks my heart. I would give five stars if that curry chicken were still around."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hawaiian food place! Not only is the food spot on and awesome, but the people there are really nice. Josh, he is almost always there at the front and is always very nice and ask how's it going. The food may take a tad long to cook but hats because it's fresh and so good! Anyone you talk to there is friendly and makes you want to come back for the food and service, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Be careful... They do not take mobile coupons from their own email Club... I am not going to drive an extra half an hour home and a half an hour back just to print out the coupon"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I put in a order over the phone which was very rude and rushed like the girl had better places to be. 

To make it worse i had to wait for my order (which i was trying to avoid doing in the first place. ) i was not given my food until everyone else in the restaurant was served. I didn't even get an apology just a simple \"you want a soda?\"

The manager Kayla Reyes should be training her staff better when it come to customer service. I will never go to this location again!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken mesubi, bbq chicken and chicken Katsu are my favorites. But Kinda expensive for my budget when you add a drink."}
{"text":"Huge portions! One regular order lasts me three meals.

I'll be coming back here to fulfill my bbq cravings."}
{"text":"Always a good place to eat....always reminds me of back home in tje South Bay.....love the Mac salad.....Yummy!!! Al the meat is juicy n tender.....just love it......I add some Sriracha and it takes it to a differnt level....just outstanding! !! One thing I didnt like I didnt see my Kalib ribs...no bueno."}
{"text":"Glad they have a location near by.  Good food.  Too bad you have to wait over 20 minutes to get your food. There was only 1 person in front of me. Dine in.  If you come order ahead. This wait is horrible."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My fave is the lemon pepper grilled chicken meal. A good sized portion with macaroni salad, white rice and steamed cabbage. If give 5 stars if the service was just tad bit faster, if I could give a 4.9 I would :)"}
{"text":"I like to pop in here for a quick lunch with my husband sometimes. I always get the BBQ Chicken and Katsu combo. Pretty good! The macaroni salad... honestly they should seriously consider packaging that stuff and just selling it by the pint. Id buy it! The only reason I wouldnt rate this place any higher is the services is always mediocre. They often dont have the side stuff stocked (forks, sauces, straws, etc) and more then once I have notified them of something out and the people behind the counter have acted like Im soooooo putting them out for even suggesting they stock forks. Pretty annoying- but that macaroni salad....it makes up for it. Usually. And they give you so much food for what you pay."}
{"text":"This is the newest location just added. The atmosphere was very nice and the cashier greeted me right away asking for my order. The food was delicious just like the other locations I have tried. I ordered the chicken combo which consists of bbq chicken, katchu chicken, mac salad, white rice on cabbage. I also got the sauces that compliment the chicken a katchu and teriyaki sauce. Definitely a must-try place."}
{"text":"Always have s good experience here. The food is good and fresh. The place it's self is always clean with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here. The food is always great and fresh. The staff is courtesy and attentive. The place is always clean. The prices are about average. Definitely a must-try if you have never gone before."}
{"text":"If you've ever had good Hawaiian BBQ don't eat here. My wife and I went at 1200 today and were the only ones there. Now I know why. I got chicken and shrimp and my wife got the BBQ platter. The food tasted greasy and half-@$$ed plain and simple. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Go to Chipotle one store down. Absolutely horrible food. We threw it in the trash and continued on with our day."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Yummy Hawaiian Food!!! Just like in Hawaii. One of my favorites is the Crispy Shrimp. Another is the Seafood Mix, another is the Hamburger Steak. Well you get the idea. I have never had a bad meal here. The plate lunches come with Rice and Macaroni Salad and Veggies. The Macaroni Salad is yummy too. They also have mini meals, family meals that serve 4 and do Catering. it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food tastes great. Perfectly spiced the way I wanted it. Customer service not bad. Ordered the fire chicken and seaweed wrapped spam. Love it"}
{"text":"Absolute goodness!!!  I have been coming to this place over and over again for 3 years.  Love the Chicken Combo, Hawahiian BBQ Mix, Mahi & BBQ Chicken Combo, Spam Musubi, BBQ Chicken Musubi, and the Ono burger.  YUM!  Miss me miss Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got the mini-meal... Loved it!  Just enough food and tasty too!  Love the BBQ chicken!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I visited the new stand alone Ono.  It was of course new and shiny!  We placed our order:  chicken combo for me, bbq combo for mom, and we shared a spam musubi.  The food was standard (good) like the other Ono's around.  The portions were huge, service is good, and loved the decor."}
{"text":"This place is call Ono. I mean like \"oh no\" don't go here. It looks like island food, it smells like island food, but it taste like horse poop. I've eaten a lot of island food to know what it should taste like. This place is like the taco bell of Mexican food..."}
{"text":"Ordered a side of chicken and a side of beef. The chicken was not even warm. Not even luke warm. The beef always warm, but not close to hot."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Power close to the 202, Ono is your typical strip mall fast food until you taste their unique combination of bbqs and Asian Hawaian fare.

I ordered the #4 combo - galbi, beef and chicken.The galbi was very tender and had a nice bbq flavor but not what I expected. Same with the beef n chicken. However, ignoring my expectations, the bbq was really very good! The accompaniment of macaroni was superb and the cabbage ( boiled) was excellent.

I also ordered fresh young coconut and it was excellent.

Service was excellent ( I asked for my coconut to be halved and got immediate assistance).

Will definitely try this again."}
{"text":"Really delicious Hawaiian food!
Order the young coconut, you will feel like you are in vacation on a tropical island
The new location has a nice ambiance too!"}
{"text":"This place serves more cabbage than chicken in their plate. When you open your plate of food it looks like a lot of food until I realize they put a bunch of cabbage under 2 pieces of chicken. So if you want a cabbage plate this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Best macaroni salad I've ever had and love the cooked cabbage.  I've been here twice now and have had the BBQ beef and chicken.  Love the sauce and flavor.  You get a lot of food for the money.  Meat is a little fatty, but that's what gives it great flavor and is suppose to be atypical.  Can't wait to try the chicken Katsu."}
{"text":"Love their food.  Shocked that people gave it 1 star! Did I go to the same place?  All the food is super fresh! The Mac salad rocks as well.  Love Ono HBBQ!!!"}
{"text":"haven't been here in a few years, but went last week and was surprised to see a big change since my last visit.  I did not like my meal last time I went, but really enjoyed my BBQ chicken on this visit. Also liked the choice of regular rice plate or plate with green salad option.  Good portion, good BBQ and great mac sal."}
{"text":"So this was my first visit here and it did not disappoint! I ordered the Katsu chicken/Kalua pork combo and it was delish. Just what I was craving. The only minus would be that it's served over cabbage which gets soggy and I like my cabbage crispy, but besides that, really good! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Not good.
The choices for salad are slim to nil. It's shredded lettuce, onion and cabbage with a few soybeans thrown in.
My order took 18 minutes because I ordered the grilled chicken salad (even though they told me it takes 8 minutes to grill the chicken, which was so grisly I couldn't even eat it). What happened to the other ten minutes that I sat there watching all the other orders come and go?
One saving grace: the shrimp was good, but it was cold since it sat around waiting for my salad.
Ugh.
Basically, it's about what I expected for the price. I may go back, but only if I'm NOT ON MY LUNCH HOUR...and someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Ono is Ono...I would have given 5 stars but \"as good as it gets\" is backyard/beach luau on the Islands.  For those of you that don't know Ono has many meanings, it can describe a delicious dish (that teriyaki plate was Ono) or your wanting of something (I am Ono for a beer right now).  My first experience of Ono was living on the west side driving back to CA and I saw it off of Dysart road next to my bank.  I went in and got just what I wanted for the trip to CA, a couple of spam musubi.

Now living in Phoenix I am glad to know that Ono is a hop and a skip away.  I have been there multiple times but am lazy on reviews.  If you are looking for a different lunch, or easy dinner, then you are in for a treat.  Plate lunch is what we call it, but plate dinner, or leftovers, works as well.

I would recommend to start off with the BBQ Plate Combo, it has a piece of teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, and a korean kalbi style short rib.  To top it off traditional plate lunch is also served with mac salad, a scoop of rice (sometimes two) and Ono likes to put some steamed cabbage on the bottom of the meat.  Get a side of Rooster Sauce (Sriracha) to dip your meat or rice in and you will look up with a smile.  My favorite is the Spam Musubi, a piece of spam, rice and sauce, wrapped in seaweed.  Different Ono's have different items, but plate lunch is a staple at all.

If you are a light eater you may want to split any plate lunch combo.  If you think you can do it and can't then score, you have dinner or a snack later.  Either way you will be happy.  I only wish they had brew to wash it down with, but good thing about plate lunch is it is just as good when you get it home as when it was put in the box.  Writing this made me Ono for Ono, mmmm."}
{"text":"I really like the food at this place. Although I have never tried another Hawaiian BBQ restaurant I might be inclined to for a few reasons. This first and most important reason would be the customer service. It seems like a team of workers with low moral and absolutely not friendly whatsoever. I said hi to both employees at the front counter and was greeted with blank looks from BOTH employees. The employee that took my order still didn't greet me or even ask what I wanted. It definitely can make a customer feel uncomfortable when they feel as if they are bothering the employees. Definitely not impressed with the service. And second I understand repairs can be costly for things around a restaurant. With that is in no way any excuse to have a filthy lobby when you have employees just standing around. This place has the opportunity to be an amazing place to visit with a few adjustments to the team. The only reason I return is because it is the closest Hawaiian BBQ restaurant to me. With that being said I would gladly venture out and drive further for a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time with my sister and kids. We were 2 very confused gals looking for something different. The oriental lady training the young cashiers was a doll. She recommend some dishes and they were amazingly delicious and inexpensive. The kids loved the food as well, The only bad thing is that they didn't give me 1 more scoop of that delicious mac salad it is creamy goodness def coming back! Adios diet!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. However Stay away from their fountain drinks. I got water and the water tasted horrible. The soda machine is connected with PVC plastic pipe instead of having a copper this explains why the water tastes so bad like plastic, when u drink a soda you won't notice the taste but try the water and you will know what I'm talking about"}
{"text":"I LOVE going to Ono, their staff is very friendly, they are quick and my food is consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken and Katsu are the best around my area, when I miss home and local food we go here.  Not too impressed with the kalua pork.  They sell Hawaiian Sun drinks which was pretty cool.  Service and restaurant reminded me of little spots back in HI, nothing crazy as far as décor or customer service but it was better than L&L I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I never miss a chance to eat here when I'm in the area..I've been a fan since they opened, and I love the teriyaki chicken, rice and mac salad! For those of you who've spent time in Hawaii, mac salad is a favorite and simple side, and this place has the BEST around. Large portions and super friendly service.   Lots of fish/veggie options. Friendly service - Frank always makes me feel welcome when I come in!"}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews.  We had a pleasant experience.  We had to wait 15 mins to get our food but then we got it hot off the grill.  The food was tasty, the portions were generous.  Considering every plate was under $10, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It's the closes best chicken Katsu & bbq plates in the west valley. Price is reasonable & worth it."}
{"text":"The one star is for the food. It's actually good. I like it! I would rather have gave it no stars for the wait. So far it's been 20 minutes and they're just calling me up. Didn't even get an apology. BTW it was 1:24 when I ordered my food,  way pass the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service ever and Corporate could care less. Will boycott this place forever! Go to a place that actually cares about its customers and that their corporation actually responds to you when you have a complaint, question or concern."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but the customer service and and the employees are ALWAYS so dull and rude and look like they hate their life. And usually it is the same girl who takes our order. I even asked one time if she liked working here and she gave me a weird response. I wish the people were as good as the food. The employee Jasmine is always so unhappy and unfriendly. I wish they would hire people who actually wanted to work, especially with so many people looking for jobs. Don't expect any smiles or good service when coming here and don't expect any help with any questions you might have about the food or menu."}
{"text":"Ono has always been a great go-to for Hawaiian lunches, their teriyaki and katsu chicken is great but what really makes it is the fresh house-made sauces. And the macaroni salad...oh man, put a little bit of soy sauce on it. Just trust me.

I used to visit the Scottsdale location a lot back in the day, but recently when I happened the in the neighborhood of an Ono I insisted that we stop in for lunch.

In the time since my last visit to an Ono, I was disappointed to see that the prices had gone up, and that they no longer served burgers.

But really those are the only negatives. Ono is consistently great food, and their restaurants are consistently well-kept and clean. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family and everyone really enjoyed the food. We had a little of everything at our table and it was all good. The rice is very tasty, the macaroni salad is VERY good.  The grilled chicken was great.  The battered shrimp was ok, too much batter for my tastes but it wasn't bad or anything.  The place was also very clean and the staff was nice.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of bad experiences at restaurants, but the last two experiences I have had at Ono shocks me. 
Before I go into explaining what happened I think you need to know that my family is Hawaiian. I go back once or twice a year and I know first hand what aloha means, more than just a hello and goodbye. And when it comes to a Hawaiian restaurant even one that is thousand miles away from Hawaii I believe if you are selling Hawaiian food, apparel, etc. you should always embrace the aloha spirit in your store.

With that being said let me tell you my frustration. A couple of months ago my family and I wanted to place an order ahead of time and go pick it up. I called the store probably 10 times and no one picked up. It wasn't a holiday or anything so I was sure they had to be open. So I decided I will just drive down there and place my order in person. When I walked in the restaurant it was not busy, don't get me wrong there was probably 2 or 3 tables but it wasn't packed. When I get to the counter I told the girl I had been trying to call and her words were \"oh that was you? We all were wondering how many times you would call before giving up\"....ARE YOU SERIOUS??? I was shocked, if it wasn't for the rest of my family and me having all their orders I would of taken my money else where. I couldn't believe they thought it was a game that I was calling. 

Just today I tried calling in my order because I was in a hurry to work. I wanted to pick it up and go. I called and a girl answered and she says \"hold\"...no please hold, or can you hold? She just said hold and she puts the phone down. She didn't mute me or put me on hold so I can hear her talking to customers. 3 minutes of me holding I can now hear her just talking normal to co-workers or something because she is laughing. After a total of 5 minutes I decide to hang up and call back. But low and behold the phone was busy because \"I\" was still on hold. I was so mad this time I decided to go to Chipotle right next door. I decided when I got back in my car from Chipotle I would call Ono just to see if the call went through. SHOCKER the line was still busy, it had at least been 20 if not 25 minutes I would of been on hold.

I've never had a problem with my food. It's always been nice and hot, cooked perfectly but the customer service, the aloha spirit from a Hawaiian restaurant is not there. But I will never go back there, they don't deserve my time or my money."}
{"text":"For my love of Kalua pork I decided to stop by Ono since I was in the neighborhood. 

My first notice was that it was more pricer than Leo's Island bbq. I seen that they had small portion options and small meals but the kalua pork I wanted wasn't an option so I had to go with the regular sized portion. 

Once I received my food, which was a very long wait, I was highly dissatisfied. The pork was not as flavorful as Leo's and the cabbage was either old or just hard. More than half of my plate was cabbage. It was ridiculous. I didn't know if I was paying for a plate of cabbage or pork. 

Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love the BBQ here, oh my slathered pork with rice and cabbage and your favorite hot sauce....A little taste of Hawaii's Asian, and Western panthology mixed up and served fast. The chefs, perhaps owners, actually seem like Japanese / Hawaiian people. 
Good for Lunch and the room is bright and well painted. 
They have a great take out menu brochure.
Right in the same enourmous complex as Home Depot and Walmart on the far East side near the AMC theatre. Right next to Panda Express. 
Makes me hungry just thinking about it--Perhaps I will go today...."}
{"text":"The closest to being back home we could get living in Arizona. Reminds us of L&L. This was the second time we have eaten here. The food is great, but not so much the workers. They close at 9:30 and the worker started mopping the floors at 8:30 while there is still  4 tables still eating. The entire time we were there a woman stayed at the counter talking to the workers and walking back and forth from the kitchen to the counter. The conversation could be heard from us sitting in the back of the restaurant. Usually these things don't bother me, but it does when the conversation is full of swearing and talking about personal lives where my 9 year old could hear. No professionalism."}
{"text":"I'm pretty puzzled by the negative reviews for this place. I avoided it for awhile because of the reviews but I finally decided to go. The wait wasn't that long but I go later in the evening and avoided the rush. The food is delish and fresh. We get the plate with BBQ chicken and kahlua pork and sub the rice for extra salad to be a little healthier. I can't give up that macaroni salad though, its delicious! Their teriyaki sauce is also to die for and the girl working the register is always super friendly"}
{"text":"This is the worat Hawaiian place I've ever eaten at. Daughter took me for Father's day.  I lived in Hawai'i and went to college on the Big Island. 

First of all, fhere was no loco moco on the menu. You could not get kalbi ribs substituted for the Hawaiian beef bbq. So I got the katsu. There were no condiments on the table. The soy sauce was in a packet and was not Aloha or Kikkoman, it was some cheap kind. There was no tobasco or siracha, only a cheap packet reading, \"hot sauce.\" The mac salad was bad too.  

The counter didnt know the menu and the onky decoration was one surfboard on the wall. No music playing either.

I wont be going back, EVER! 

Betyer stwp up yor game Ono. If you need I can come in and show you what a successful Hawaiian place looks and feels like."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the restaurant is filthy. The bathroom will make you cringe! The soda machine had no ice, come on people , either fix it or go grab some from a store. Table and chairs were filthy. I will be looking for a different location due to the dirtiness of this place."}
{"text":"Came back here cuz my kids were paying and on a budget. This time I got their $4.99 special. You get 2 small scoops of rice, 2 crab rangoons, choice of like 4 meats, and a drink. I had the kahlua pork and it was actually pretty good. The food overall was decent, the place was clean, and the service was average. Did NOT get sick this time. Some of the menu items are a little pricey for what they are and the bench seats are way too far back from the tables ( which can't be moved ). 

Note: Their selection of already sweetened teas were really good, especially the black tea and the green tea."}
{"text":"It was just \"ok\" I don't think I'd ever crave it? I've had some awesome Hawaiian BBQ and this was not on the awesome list. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great."}
{"text":"I love Hawai'ian BBQ for lunch.  I frequent many on the East side of the valley.  I guess this place just opened because it seems the entire staff was here.  Very clean, food quality was better that I expected.  Service was quick and friendly.  I think the owner or manager stopped by, he didn't identify himself but it's all good.  The only advice I can say is to get the staff dressing better.  It seems knit picky but a few of them dressed like slobs.  Call me a prude but I take pride in my work and in my professional appearance.  I understand all the tats and piercings are the \"in\" thing now all that self expression crap has its place OUTSIDE of work."}
{"text":"Not thoroughly impressed. If you want the meats, it is a place to think of. Being a chain restaurant, you get that same chemical aftertaste, almost like you would after eating KFC. I had the BBQ combo plate with the mac salad and rice. Yea it was a lot of meat and grease under the decor cabbage lol. It was tiring to eat. More authentic options in Phoenix/Tempe."}
{"text":"I like this place, their food is tremendous. They where busy but their service was good. I couldn't help but order chicken on the side because they have so many options. I want to come back to try the BBQ."}
{"text":"We used to really love this location and would drive out of our way to eat here. We always order the chicken combo meal, which has both bbq and catsu chicken. Tonight we ordered our meals and when we got home (which is way out in Surprise) we discovered we had no sauce in the bag. I called the store, pretty irritated, and when I told the woman that I live 30 minutes away and couldn't just come back for sauce she suggested I \"remind the girls at the window next time.\"

I'm not opposed to doing this, I'm just really disappointed with the customer service, or lack thereof, that I received. It isn't my fault that staff gave me an incomplete order. We will definitely not be back to this location."}
{"text":"First time in and decided on the Kalua Pork. Portion was large, rice and macaroni salad was good. The pork had decent flavor but definitely needed some teriyaki sauce even though it was moist. The wait was a little long for lunch and I feel as if they missed my ticket (17) they called #23 and I had to wait at the counter as the lady walked by me 3-4 times before she even acknowledged I was there. I was told they were waiting on one item before my order was ready (it took 20 minutes for two lunches)."}
{"text":"So good to find this place on my business trip.. reminds me of the food I got when I was in Hawaii, taste so good. Great place, good prices, and great food.."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. I have called multiple times during business hours and they do not answer the phone. It is more convenient to call ahead so that I do not have to wait when I get there. They need to work on their togo service"}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a newbie when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ. I've seen an increase of these kind of places sprout up over that past couple years but never really tried one until late last year. I found out that day, that I love Hawaiian BBQ. 

The first time I came here was last week. I was running some errands & wanted a quick bite. I tried the Hawaiian chicken & rice bowl. The meat was fresh & juicy not to mention plentiful. They have free sides of Teriyaki sauce so I mixed in a little with the rice which made the meal all the better.

The second time I ate here was last night. I decided on the Hawaiian BBQ mix which consists of chicken, beef, & short ribs. It comes with sides of rice & macoroni salad on a bed of cabbage(or more rice if you're like me & don't like cabbage). I paid $7.99 + $2.00 for a drink. Well worth it! Once again all the meat was fresh, hot, & tasted great. The rice was wonderful & the macaroni salad was perfect(a little heavy on the mayonnaise but that's the way I like it). I wasn't able to eat it all in one sitting because there was so much food & brought the rest home. I loved it. The customer service was great & the dining room was clean. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the food 
3 for the employees 
Food is always good and made in a timely manor 
I've been coming here for years and they never seem to be able to keep staff members, I don't know why. But lately are extremely lacking in basic customers service skills. Some come off as rude and don't seem like they want to work there at all. You ask question and they look at you with a blank look and answer so mono tone that it makes you feel stupid. Great place and great food but they to improve some of the employees, some are really nice."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I ate here today and couple hours later I'm puking it up and it takes quite a bit for my stomach to disagree with food. The food here was also plain and not worth the money spent so I'd recommend spending your time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food has always been good . But it's still a fast food joint .but I have yet to be disappointed except when I order coconuts there prepared very poorly. But I'm no hater of the place ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Delicious food, fast service and beyond clean! 
The bbq chicken is a thin sliced thigh and has a sweet and savory sauce grilled into it. The white fish is so crunchy with each bite, and the fish has a mild flavor, but exactly what you want in fried fish. The macaroni salad is fresh and creamy, and the white rice is just that, plain white rice, which is nice to mix in with the steamed vegetables. 
It's a wonderful, clean, and tasty five star stop!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Having never been to Hawaii, I can't comment on how authentic it is, but I generally enjoyed my experience here! I had laughed when I read the Yelp reviews on the service, but they were pretty spot on. The girl at the counter was a bit condescending and impatient, but definitely wasn't worth reviewing as a one star!  

I ordered the BBQ & Katsu Plate, which included BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, and chicken katsu, while the s/o ordered the Island Fire Chicken Plate. Both dishes came with 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop of macaroni salad, and a bunch of vegetables under the meat (99% cabbage, with one piece of broccoli in s/o's veggie pile). The flavors were simple, but good, and I enjoyed it. The portions were also large enough that we had enough to last two meals (and I used leftover Island Fire and Teriyaki sauce to make a fried rice for lunch today). I wouldn't drive out of my way to come back here again (which we did this time because I had heard about it and wanted to try it out), but if I was in the area I'd definitely give this place another go."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes and prices. I ordered the grilled chicken and it was amazing. Nice and juicy on a bed of cabbage. Their white rice is good too. Overall, good experience. I'll come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for grand opening, and tonight's experience deserves 5 stars! 

I've been to an Ono once, and it was good but not great. My friends and I saw the grand opening event for this new location, so we decided to go. Given the promotion going on, there was quite a line, but it went by pretty quick, and once we ordered, the food came out really fast! 

Service was great, everyone we encountered was so energetic and happy. The restaurant was very clean and modern looking. It was very well-staffed, and a guy came to the back of the line a few times while we were waiting to give everyone a menu. Nothing was sold out. All of this goes to show this location is well managed. I've seen plenty of businesses do promotions that they are not prepared for, so big kudos for that. 

Food-- yummmm! We got spam musubi, island fire chicken, Hawaiian BBQ mix, and chicken katsu. That ISLAND FIRE! Delicious! All really good but my favorite was the island fire and spam musubi. 

Keep up the great food and service!!"}
{"text":"Love it! I've never dined in but I've never had a problem w/my food from here all the times I've gone. Really good food! My favorite is the Katsu Chicken! Oh and their macaroni salad is amazzinggg!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the girl that took our order was nice but I am dairy free.  I ordered my food then went back a minute later and asked for no macaroni salad and just extra rice and I forgot to mention it initially.  They were busy and there were orders in front of mine so I figured it'd be fine.  They told the guy preparing food but it took him a little while to understand for whatever reason, I didn't think it was that difficult.  Well our order comes out and he just scooped out the macaroni salad and put ice on top of it.  So incredibly frustrating!!  I ended up just eating around that entire area as I CANNOT HAVE DAIRY!!  I couldn't believe he would find that acceptable.  I should have said something but didn't want the argument.  They only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the girl at the register and the food is good.  Please be aware that if you have any food allergies they do not take them seriously."}
{"text":"I've never physically visited this location, but my parents (this happened in October 2011) drove for over an hour to this spot for takeout to bring home. The kalua pork did not have much flavor. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, because I haven't tried other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. However I hate the new digital menu. I stood there for 15 min just to be able to see what all they have to offer. It doesn't display everything at once. It only show one page at a time. So if you don't know what you want. It will take you a little bit to look threw the entire menu. If your new or first time visiting I recommend looking at the menu online first so you have an idea of what you want. Unless you don't mind standing there looking clueless or holding up the line if you do t know what you want."}
{"text":"We got to the movie theater 40 minutes early thinking we would get a quick bite to eat. We ended up getting into the theater 5 minutes after it started and getting the worse seats because if the wait time (there was maybe 7 people in the whole place btw)."}
{"text":"In the amount of time it took them to make my food I:

-Checked Google for a Customer Service number or email to complain about the obnoxious amount of time it took to make my food.

-Couldn't find one, so I went to Yelp via Chrome to make a review.

- Since I was on my phone, the only way to write a review was via the app.

- Went to download the app, but my storage was full.

- Made a few Sophie's Choices and got rid of some apps.

- Downloaded the Yelp App.

- Created a new account

- Found this store and left a review.  

- 5 minutes after I posted this review I got my food.

The food is decent, but expect to wait a very long time for anyone to do anything in regards to your order."}
{"text":"Best authentic Hawaiian style BBQ beef around. The add scope of rice and Mac salad with cabbage...Ono Hawaiian style."}
{"text":"I love you guys but very upset because it's 104 outside and it's almost 90 degrees inside. I could not stay and enjoy my food and the staff had no idea what and why it was so hot.  I hate to say it was the worse dinner I have had with you guys over many years eating here."}
{"text":"I have been to the Ono location in North Scottsdale and I think this location could stand to take a few lessons from them as they did not measure up.

The boyfriend and I went to Ono on a Sunday afternoon eager to stuff our faces with yummy Hawaiian food and spend the Groupon I had purchased.

There was one person working the register and she was not very personable, couldn't follow what we were ordering (I ordered, then boyfriend ordered, then the counter person asked me what I was having??), and took forever to figure out how to deal with the Groupon. Then when our food came out she forgot to give us forks and napkins. They don't have any napkins out by the drinks or on tables. By this point she was putting ice in the soda machine so it took about 10 minutes into our meal before I could get a napkin. Do they have a problem with people taking too many napkins that they feel the need to hide and ration them? Weird.

Anyway, onto the food. We ordered two plate lunches and two musubi. Hands down the WORST musubi I've ever had. The seaweed was so tough we couldn't bite through it so it was just a mess. The spam was the thinnest piece I've ever seen. Awful. Save your money for something else.

The BBQ chicken was pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. The mac salad is not great, very heavy mayo. Now, I know mac salad is made with mayo and I don't expect it to be light by any means but I also don't eat mayo out of the jar either and that's what this tasted like.

Overall I was not impressed, not satisfied and I will not be going back. Ono turned this dining experience into an Oh No!"}
{"text":"I'm a devout fan of Aloha Kitchen so I was hesitant to try another Hawaiian place here in the Valley. Especially one with mixed reviews. But it was convenient one day so the boyfriend and I decided to give it a go. And i'm happy we did!

We got the food to go - I got the BBQ combo (chicken and beef) and he got the katsu. Like most Hawaiian joints the portions were huge so bring your appetite. I thought the chicken and beef were both done very well. Juicy, flavorful and not too fatty or gristly. The mac salad was not as good as Aloha Kitchen but it was decent. The portion was a little skimpy too compared to the rest of the meal. But like I said, big portions overall so it was okay.

We also got a few manapua to try. Very good, tasted fresh.

When I find myself on the north end of town I would not hesitate to go back to Ono."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food was very good. So why only 3 stars? The place was filthy. It looked like the floor had not been mopped in a week. Seriously managers, you are lucky I'm not with the health department. You need to spend an early morning or late night doing some deep cleaning. Even the tables just felt like they were not clean. I would like to come back, so please spend some quality time cleaning."}
{"text":"It was an alright experience. More or less what I expect out of a chain. It is defiantly a healthier option to other fast food restaurants out there and is even a change of pace from Chinese food. The prices also seemed fair for what you were ordering."}
{"text":"Uno is a breath of fresh air from panda express. It's a great place to eat. If you haven't them why are you still reading this?! Go try it."}
{"text":"Was really good. I like the Katsu sauce. The macaroni salad is great. The portions were pretty good, you get your monies worth."}
{"text":"Way too over priced. I mean its great food. With an average sized portion. But for how much I'm paying?... Not totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is great everything on the menu is pretty good and I love their macaroni salad. However, their customer service is just severely subpar and lacking. What is the point of allowing customers to phone ahead if no one answers the phone? I don't understand. I've been ordering the same thing for months now, and I called ahead and all the sudden they say they don't have macaroni salad with that plate. It's a little frustrating because the menu has not changed and the attendant on the phone told me if I could just pull up the menu and look at it. No, I cannot pull up the menu and look at it because I'm driving that's why I'm calling you. You are supposed to be the expert on your menu. Really considering not going anymore. That is a real shame because I love the food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I have supported Ono Hawaiian BBQ for a while but today I had probably the worst restaurant experience so far with a worker named Amber. Right off the bat she was very rude and talked to me like I was dumb and with a short and stabbing tone. I asked her questions about the menu and she would just get more irritated and you can see that body language from a mile away. After she took my payment I told her thank you I hope your day gets better and walked away because you know maybe she is just having a bad day. She then proceeds to tell the girl behind me that was next in a very smart/mocking ton I am actually having a great day and some other stuff. Then I go sit down to take a phone call and wait for my order and she still proceeds to talk about me to the other customer and is laughing at me. I am very disappointed and I will take my family, Polynesian community and friends elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh NO! So I have passed this place nearly two dozen times and every time I look inside the place is DEAD!! I wonder to myself WTF; How does this place stay open? Now, I love Chicken. I could eat Japanese, Chinese and Hawaiin everyday if it is grilled or sauteed. Not fried. So, I get done training and I decide Im going to give this graveyard a try. I walk in, no smell! I look around, No customers. I walk up to the counter and the only thing I can hear is the air vent. Fucking Crickets I tell you. So So quiet. I knew this was going to be bad. And I'm going to cut to the end here....... It was the worst I have ever had. The chicken was not fresh, there was very little flavor and the kicker...... Diaherhea (spelling) and the chills..... ENOUGH SAID!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4.5 because I'm saving my 5 for jaw dropping food! Ono BBQ is very delicious though! They have a very cute man working in the front welcoming all the guests with an \"Aloha!\" and they have island music playing in the background! The food is very tasty, too! Very similar to L&L BBQ if those of you are familiar with it. They have great chicken katsu, great BBQ chicken and delicious Hawaiian mac and cheese! Next time I come, I'm going to try the kalua shredded pork! Oh they also have spam and eggs! Mahalo, Ono BBQ"}
{"text":"Really great food, great cooks. But the people who answer the phone for pickup orders, can be such a dick. 
They don't seem to have patience, I get it. Fast pace restaurant. But still, Im paying a good amount of currency. Sometimes I want to add more items to my meal, but do not. Because the person is completely rude. Like I said really great food. But bad customer service.  At least the times I've called."}
{"text":"Too much of waiting time even if you order by phone. Also workers have attitude. Instead of trying to listen customers concern they always said this is our way. This will be last visit for me . Like a past almost 2 years ago was my last visit to this place and returned but still the service is bad. They have many menu disappeared like loco moco ( many times they will said we are out of eggs. May be they are only ordering dozen of eggs at times when merchandising)."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain but their food was great! The chicken salads are my favorite. You can go wrong with the mac salad for an extra side too. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"The food was... AMAZING!! The decor was fabulous and unique! Everyone had a smile on there face super happy! And helpful!! I also noticed that they have fresh coconuts to drink out of so if you like coconut milk, definitely a great place to get your Hawaiian dream on. Will definitely go back to this place more often!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Hawaiian food... Or at least what they claim to be Hawaiian. They had the music right, but the food tasted like bad Asian food to me. 

I had the chicken katsu and the island fire chicken. I'm not entirely convinced that the meat was even chicken at all. 

The only reason it wasn't a horrific one star experience is because the environment and music was kinda cool. Hard to be miserable with some sweet island jams in the background."}
{"text":"Eh. Not anything special in my opinion. I prefer Leo's Island BBQ. Though the macaroni salad and teriyaki sauce at Ono was tasty. My sister got BBQ chicken and it had a lot of gristle which made it hard to eat. Wish they had fresh tartar sauce for my fried fish, not the fake stuff that come in little packets."}
{"text":"Always good and great prices.  This is really not fast food so expect a little wait while they cook it. No WIFI is available. Right next to a movie theater. We are regular customers here and have tried many of their offerings."}
{"text":"Restaurant is usually packed. Affordable and delicious. Be warned, the place is usually a wreck with overflowing trash cans, a floor that has never been mopped, and trash and junk everywhere from the sheer amount of customers coming through. Food is usually quick and on-point."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that i love Hawaiian plate lunch but this was the worst service I have ever had. 35 minutes for fast food is not acceptable. Also they were out of sauce. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great flavor! I get the bbq mix meats with ribs, beef, and chicken. The macaroni side dish is good too! Always have great leftovers! 9.99 for a couple of meals!"}
{"text":"Been coming here many years. Tried almost everything but my favorite is the island whitefish lunch special. $5.79 gets you 2 panko breaded fish filets, macaroni salad, & rice all served on shredded cabbage. It is super light and never greasy. Most important is the katsu sauce. Its like BBQ sauce mixed with a little soy sauce. Very sweet and great for dipping. (Don't pour it on the fish but instead dip as u go to keep that wonderful crunchy outer layer on the fish)"}
{"text":"Getting my chicken katsu with curry sauce!  Get the curry on the side and ask for more rice instead of the macaroni.  Definitely get the cabbage too!"}
{"text":"I love the Katsu chicken from here!! It's always seems to be just right, pair it with rice and macaroni salad you have a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"I never had Hawaiian food before so I can not say how it is compared to whatever they served me at Ono. I didn't expect a high end restaurant with noble cuisine, but something edible would have been nice. However, the food was awful - and I am not a picky eater. I had rice with bbq chicken. The rice was awfully dry, and the chicken tasted horrible. It had this weird taste of really cheap low quality chicken that wasn't stored properly, it tasted like a henhouse smells and had a mushy texture. Not even the bbq sauce could make it palatable. I don't even want to know what foodborne illnesses you can catch from this. The service was not that amazing either, to put it mildly. We all know the attitude where the staff seems annoyed whenever a customer expects them to just do the work they're paid for - like daring to place an order or have the brass to ask a question. That's pretty much what I got at Ono. I can overlook bad food if the service is great, but I guess the staff knows what awful food they serve so they don't even bother to make your experience any more pleasant as nobody would come back anyway? 
I do not recommnd eating at Ono."}
{"text":"My family have always enjoyed coming here but yesterday when we came in to dine Amber behind the counter gave my family dirty looks like we were dirty people or something. When my family decided to move tables because we were waiting for the rest of our group to meet us she had the nerve to continue the dirty looks while saying move the tables back when you're done. Instead of dining there we left because of how rude she was for saying something like that, we have never been to a place to eat where an employee asks us to move the tables back. If that wasn't bad enough the manager was standing right there and did not say a word. It was like he did not even notice her being rude to us!! We even called in and all he could say was sorry. DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"It's ok but I lived in Fiji for two years and got picky when it comes to island food. This place does have some good food but just nothing to write the islands about!!

If you are in the need for a change the terriaki chicken and anything pork is recommended. 

I want to give it more stars but it's just not good enough or worthy in my opinion but it's not aweful.  Go check it out and see what you think. Let me know."}
{"text":"Excellent food. A little pricey but really tasty. 
Customer service is terrible. Lady running the register clearly doesn't want to be there. Stuff like that really turns people off to a business."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious!  I can only vouch for most of the combo plates, as I have tried them all.  For some reason they discontinued Moco Loco, which is one of the more popular dishes in Hawaii! Although pricey, portions are plenty."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a laid back day in Hawaii. Love the food and the friendly staff. So laid back and calm but super efficient and fast. Simple but great food."}
{"text":"Two weeks in a row now, I have not been able to eat at Ono's, not because I didn't want to, but because the store was unable themselves. Last week I walked into the restaurant, through an unlocked door, at 1115, 15 minutes after the posted opening time and an employee just yelled in my direction, \"we're closed\". Ok, well I don't have time to wait, while you decide what time you're actually opening. Went and enjoyed the Chipotle next door. Came back this week, because I actually do like the food and would like to eat there, but they could figure out how to get their registers open and could not take anything but cash, which I haven't really carried in years. So went and enjoyed some Smashburger in the same mini-mall. They have always seemed a bit disorganized but I think I'm just gonna give up on them."}
{"text":"New and definitely improved! They've had some rough reviews recently, so we were a little hesitant to go again...but when the wife craves Mac salad, my hubby complies! I could eat that stuff all the time--creamy, oniony, and just a slight taste of tuna. YUM!!! We both had our staples, Hawaiian mix for him, Seafood mix with BBQ chicken for me. His was the usual and he was pleased. Mine was transformed and just great! The fish, instead of flat planks of dry fish wish tons of breaking, was large pieces with a lighter panko crust. The shrimp were the same, bigger with the same coating. I was also very pleased that they now have real tarter sauce to go with the fish instead of warm packets. Service has definitely improved as well. So happy our little place is back and better than ever."}
{"text":"Good quick taste of Hawaii in AZ!

I first ate at an O'no while on vacation in Hawaii, and was pleased to discover that they have expanded to the \"Mainland\"!

Be sure to try classics like Kalua pork and the Musubi's. And remember that no Hawaiian meal is complete without the macaroni salad and scope of rice."}
{"text":"The hours are never want are stated online or on the door. The service here is absolutely terrible. I had called in an order and when I came to pick it up, it was incorrect. I asked for the correct thing and the owner said I was wrong and that's what I ordered. Funny, I think I would remember the words that come out of my mouth. After charging me to fix their mistake, they undercooked the fish to the point of having to throw it away or risk food poisoning. It almost seems like they undercooked it out of spite. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I grew up in Hawaii so I was excited when I saw the ad for this restaurant. Overall, it was alright, I would give it 2-3 star

-Noodle Soup Combo: this should be a 0 star. The soup was bland, basically boil water. The noodle was those packaged ones you buy at Longs supermarket in Hawaii for less than $5 for 4 pack. They put some cabbage and edamame and charge you $8.29 when it prob cost them $1.25 to make. Worst bowl if noodle I've eaten. 

-Aloha Plates with Chicken Katsu, Kalua Pork, Teriyaki Chicken, BBQ Beef - all tasted decent, not the best but not the worst. My preference would be best for Teriyaki Chicken, then Chicken Katsu, BBQ Beef, and Kalua Pork cause I like more cabbage with my Kalua Pork."}
{"text":"My first impression was very tasty I ordered the Island Fire Chicken had a little heat nice portion the rice and macaroni salad was on point. Hard to mess those up. Chicken was hot and steaming everything seemed like it was going well until it ended bad now I'm stuck on the throne writing this review regretting what I just ate dont get me wrong it all taste good but just have a tablet or a few dozen magazines handy for the aftermath."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Oahu, been off the rock for 19 yrs. I'm always checking out the local bbq restaurants. Ono lives up to the name. I had the seafood,
Bbq chicken plate. With the fresh mix salad on the side. The bbq chicken was the best I've had in a while. The fish and shrimp was good too. The Mac salad was spot on. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First off I am so excited to have a ono in surprise now we don't have to drive far. This was opening night I went the line was long but man the line went down quickly too. I got the island fish and wow it was delish it had a unique sweet taste too it which was so yummy!!! I love this place. The service was great the staff was friendly, I would recommend ."}
{"text":"The food quality has gone completely down hill, not to mention their customer service is garbage! Who is running this place. Like seriously you have some girl who whispers and can't hear anything you say and doesn't know how to do anything on the register and has the nerve to have an attitude because she doesn't know how to do stuff.  Her neck has hickies and there is no manager available.

Not to mention the fact that you have to stand there and watch your food sit and wait for her to go back there and figure out if she's going to call your number or not. Seriously just avoid this location altogether.

Please get some customer service here...fix it Jesus!"}
{"text":"Love this place good food and if you do paleo you don't have to get the rice  or the macaroni salad just meat and cabbage."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken katsu and it came out raw. The chicken was a very dark pink like they didn't even cook it. I confronted the staff and they quickly made me another one and again it was raw. Stay away from this place!!"}
{"text":"It's possible that the term barbecue set my expectations improperly. The food was pleasant and well prepared, but unmemorable. The Kahlúa chicken was bland unless you added sauces, and even the sauces didn't hit the spot. Plenty of rice, and a large chunk of cabbage in every meal. My wife had the teriyaki chicken which she found tasty, and was made with dark meat, which she enjoys more. Portions were generous, especially with the cabbage. Food was healthy and attractive, but I'm probably not going to be revisiting Ono's because it just doesn't ring my bell."}
{"text":"No matter witch one I go to they are always delicious and the staff is very friendly. The service is always fast and I'm always happy about my portions. When I come here I am more than happy to pay for what I get knowing it will be well worth it. The meat is well done, rice is so soft and sweet, and the Mac is heaven... Even if it's made from simple ingredients. If someone has not tried it and I pass one we will go every time !"}
{"text":"Great tasty BBQ. The mix combo allows to taste beef ribs and chicken. Nicely grilled with no grease. Great flavor and seasoning. I would go there every day"}
{"text":"First time dining here.  This is a popular chain from California.  We got the Hawaiian BBQ mix (#4 combo) all for less than ten dollars.  This had BBQ chicken, BBQ Beef (bulgogi) and Kalbi short rib served with rice and macaroni salad.  We also tried their spam musabi.  The portions are huge here.  This easily feeds two people.  My favorite was the BBQ chicken.  It was tender and seasoned well.  The kalbi was my least favorite. The meat was not good quality and the texture didn't seem right.   The macaroni salad was legit though.  That was pretty addicting - thankfully they didn't give a big portion.  The spam musabi was good - like in most Hawaiian restaurants, they fill it up with a lot of rice.

This is a great choice if you are looking for different food options instead of your typical fast food places."}
{"text":"This is one of the regular lunch date places my husband and I go to.  It's a lot of food and the food is consistently to our liking.  So, we usually buy 1 thing of food and we share it.  

It's great.  Sometimes their music is a bit too loud so it's hard to hear each other.  They are skimpy on napkins, but I guess that saves money on people taking too many napkins.

They have a high turn over, so if we wait a couple months or so to come here for a date,   I'm giving it one less star because of the stinginess.  They see two of us coming in, yet when I ask for a plate to put the food on, they give me one.  Do you not see there are two of us?  Same with me asking for chopsticks.  We are TWO people, so please give us double of utensils.  

It would be nice if they had free Wi Fi and I would like if they had a frequent buyer's club card.  We haven't come as often just because we aren't eating out as much.  Sometimes some of the email coupons are good, but not often enough for us.

However, we do love the food and it's not crowded when we come, so good for us."}
{"text":"Bummed that the Ono that we used to go to regularly as lunch dates with my husband closed down awhile back, so this is the closest Ono's to us.  They have some good specials, which I often use.  

Today I saw on my email that you get an Hawaiian BBQ Chicken meal for $1 with the purchase of any regular chicken meal.  We love their macaroni salad.  And my husband loves the BBQ Beef.  We also love the Katsu.  We ended up getting 4 different dinners - which included what I wrote with some Hawaiian mix of chicken and beef.

Our meal came to $1.65.  I had a $30 gift card.  We saved $6.99 with one of the meals, but we got extra macaroni.  Anyway, good deal to feed 5 people tonight with this at home.

I would give it a 5 star, but the people working there really are average with customer service.  Food for us is a 5 star, which is plenty of food and really we only eat about 1/2 of a dinner meal per person.  So, really a good deal for us."}
{"text":"You guys I could not eat this fast enough! I have been dying to try this place since I first saw the sign going up and today was the day! I just did a big Target run so I had a ton of groceries in the car so I decided on going through the drive thru. I was helped right away by a very nice young lady and was very patient with me while I looked over the menu to decide what I wanted to eat. I decided on the Hawaiian BBQ Mix because let's face it I want to eat everything I can at once and not make a rash decision . Goals I know right?! Besides left overs are good. The meal consists of bbq chicken, bbq beef, Kalbi short ribs, white rice, macaroni salad and a cabbage and broccoli mix. It was DELICIOUS! they gave both teriyaki and bbq sauce on the sauce so you can control how much to add, cabbage was cooked perfect and I ate it all. I'm not sharing with anyone...oh yea and all that was only about $12 with tax. Some people may think that's a bit pricey, but the portions were big. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this establishment. The food is delicious!! I'm sooo soo in love w/ the island fire chicken!! Every spicy bite with the side of sticky rice, just brings me back to my childhood in Hawaii. 
I love how the employees always greet you w/ an aloha and smiles!
Obviously I'll be making more visits to this establishment."}
{"text":"Tonight was the very first time I've ever tried the food here. I must say it was pretty tasty! I loved the Hawaiian BBQ Beef. It came with 2 scoops of sticky white rice & deeelicious macaroni salad. I highly recommend this place if you've never had authentic Hawaiian Food, Or if you have & you're just searching for something better than you've ever had - then definately give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food a lot. There are a few things that when I do get the urge for it I will order it.  I am not a regular here so when I do come it just seems the prices have gone up every time. It does make it hard to bring a bigger family to eat here for fast food. Prices to eat here are a bit high so if you have a large family and plan to spend sit down money go to a sit down restaurant.  But when there is a craving I come here to satisfy my taste buds.  There are not to many Island eats around so this is the spot to come to."}
{"text":"Food is good they get a little busy and mess up an order once in a while the service over all is friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. We actually placed the order and ate it at home. I got the chicken teriyaki meal. It was bomb!!!! I inhaled the entire thing! It came with a little salad with sesame dressing...bomb too!! So delicious!! I will probably be getting the same thing the next time we order from there. It was that good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! Staff is very friendly. Love this place! Try the BBQ Mix plate. Yummy! The macaroni salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Convenient and they open late! Employees had great service. Very polite and apologetic, which you don't see in a lot of fast food places. Plus they gave me a butt load of sauce. You can always appreciate extra sauce."}
{"text":"I've only been to a Hawaiian BBQ place once. In Clearwater, FL. The place went out of business and I never had Hawaiian BBQ again. *cue sad music*

This was truly unfortunate because I really liked it. But now *cue the happy music* I've found Ono Hawaiian BBQ!

The service was a little slow but friendly. The service didn't matter anyway as long as the food was on point... and it was. 

I got the Braised Short Ribs lunch plate. It's a special that they're running only until the end of this week, I think. It was only $7.49 and fall off the bone good. It was a braised short rib with carrots served on cabbage. It also came with rice and macaroni salad. This meal made my day.

They sell Hawaiian Sun canned juices ($1.89). I got the Pineapple Orange. I'm not sure how well it paired with my food but it was refreshing on this hot day. 

I can't wait to try their Spam musubi... Aloha Ono Hawaiian BBQ, I'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"The food is really delicious here and definitely is made fresh to order. My favorite dish is the barbecue chicken over cabbage white rice and scoops of macaroni salad, Yum! The value is very fair with large portions and plenty of protein for eight dollars. The customer service could be a little friendlier."}
{"text":"Great food full of flavor. The pick two was big enough to have for dinner and then have leftovers for lunch the next day. Everyone was so friendly and helpful when deciding on what to order."}
{"text":"So we have never been to Ono and decided to try this place tonight! First off Winnie the manager is horrible with customer service. She was very rude to the girl taking my order. I'm waiting for my food to go and almost 20 mins pass and people who came in after me were leaving with their food!!! I asked wth and Winnie first tells me chicken breast takes forever to cook okay that's nice I've already been waiting forever then she says somebody took my order bc they couldn't find the ticket!! I then tell her how ridiculous this is and oh so sorry that's about it! She's horrible!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with this place. I got the kalua pig (pork), spam musubi, and their Hawaiian Sun Guava Nectar canned drink. The disappointing thing is that the drink was probably the best part. The kalua pig was mediocre - possibly because I'm used to the homemade kind, but I thought it was very dry - and the spam musubi had raw spam. When we asked them to remake it, it came back still undercooked. I'm not sure if that's how people normally eat their spam but I was a bit let down. Definitely not ono!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out, but after my recent visit I wasn't a huge fan of the food. It was greasy and not very appetizing. Probably wont be back based on that experience."}
{"text":"(just read the other reviews AFTER I wrote mine...I guess different strokes for different folks) 
There was one of these right down the street from my old job, then they just weren't' there anymore. That was a sad day. They used to have a daily special of an order of fried shrimp for $4...and you got SOOOOOO many. 
The places with awesome values always go out of business... 
Anyway, the two times I've been to this location I'm reviewing has left me missing the other one. Something isn't quite the same. 
I've order the Chicken Curry Katsu both times, which is my favorite from Ono's. They serve the curry on the side, which most people would probably appreciate and prefer...but I liked how the curry would smother the chicken on the ride back to the job and make it all happy. But I must say, the taste hasn't changed. Its still an awesome dish - curry gravy with potatoes and carrots over these perfectly seasoned and fried chicken strips...with rice and a subtle-tasting macaroni salad. Somehow, when you 'accidentally' get some of the macaroni salad mixed into the rest of the stuff, it makes it all better??? (why the question marks? that wasn't even a question. this guy's weird) 

Even though that's all I ever get, the rest of their menu looks sooo good. I mean the pictures OF the other stuff on their menu looks sooo good. There's pictures of all kinds of pork choppy type things stacked on other pork choppy type things sitting next to mahi-mahi, grilled and fried shrimp, my chicken katsu, and other deliciously photographed things. I can testify that the pork choppy things are incredibly tasty. They are where the 'Hawaiian BBQ' comes from in Ono's name. Oh and the chicken, too...which I've never had because I'm afraid of exactly what others here have complained about - undercooked rubberiness. But back to the 'ribs', the sauce is one of the best sauces I've ever had on any meat. Its sweet, light, and makes you want to eat the bones. 
They also have Hawaiian beverages. I can't remember the name of the one I get, but it tastes like pear juice only a million times better. 

Overall, the value here is acceptable. My katsu will sometimes not be finished in one sitting, and its only like $7-8 or something...which I have come to accept as well, acceptable. I had to stop being a cheap-butt when I moved out here. 

I do miss the daily specials that the other location had. The shrimp are now $5 by themselves and you get like 6, as opposed to like 26 for less money. Oh well. 

The service is good here. I was asked about my holiday shopping on my last visit, and I appreciated the small talk. Wait times are ok...a bit long if you're in a hurry. The inside of this location is really nice, with a lounge area, plenty of seating, and a nice view of people going in and out of the Harkins next door. 

The food, service, and value here are on point, and I cannot think of any reason not to give this place 4 stars. And if they start offering specials again, then they'll get another star."}
{"text":"I love this place for take out. The grilled teriyaki breasts are great and I love their macaroni salad. As far as eating in, don't really recommend, chairs are sticky and it's really warm inside."}
{"text":"Got take out. I have never had Hawaiian food, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I ordered the chicken combo which had the chicken katsu and hawaiian BBQ chicken. I've had better katsu at Korean and Japanese restaurants, but it was not terrible. The marinade on the BBQ chicken was decent but quality of chicken wasn't impressive. It came with rice and macaroni salad (which was good but again nothing special). Overall a decent meal for a cheap price but nothing that stood out."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I went to Ono Hawaiian BBQ and was very disappointed. The restaurant was very clean inside, but the food was terrible. Not only was the food terrible, but it was way over priced for what you got."}
{"text":"My Spam Masubi was hastily prepared and seemed to be double seaweed wrapped.  The block of rice just crumbled apart in my hands.  Bummed....really enjoyed this place in the past."}
{"text":"Ono is a Hawaiian fast food chain with locations throughout California and Arizona. The first Ono's I ate at was in North Scottsdale and it was an overall good experience, especially since there weren't a lot of restaurant options in that area years back. 

This location is fairly spacious with a lot of seating and a modern digital screen. I do think they could use a little help with the designing of the on-screen menu because it was hard to see the font from further away and the sides weren't readily available to see as it was part of the menu that changes screens every few seconds.

I decided on the aloha plate, a plate that includes your choice of one or two main items, rice, and salad. I went with the two item combo with whitefish and fire chicken. I also had a few bites of the katsu chicken. While we waited we grabbed some teriyaki and katsu sauce from the counter. 

Your order will come automatically packaged to go. We decided to eat it at the restaurant since we were pretty hungry. The aloha plate was a hefty amount of salad, rice and chicken. There was only one piece of the whitefish, a smallish-looking, battered and fried oval of seafood. The katsu entree also came with a plentiful amount of chicken and rice, with an additional scoop of macaroni salad and bed of steamed cabbage under the chicken.

I enjoyed the fish and katsu chicken, with their crispy crunchy batter and tender meat inside. I didn't really like the fire chicken. It had a low level of heat, was very salty, and had a powdery/paste-like taste to it. I could also taste an odd additional seasoning in it, like they added maybe some cumin and chili powder which are weird spices to add to your Hawaiian style chicken. 

If I go here again I'll probably opt for the battered and fried items again and avoid the marinated stuff."}
{"text":"Love the Katsu Chicken and especially the Island Chicken Curry (which has a curry sauce over the katsu chicken, with rice, etc.).  Very inexpensive, but hearty meals - large portions!"}
{"text":"If you live in the area and in the mood for hawaiian food, here is your place.  We usually phone in an order or I order it to go.  A mini meal (teri chicken) for C and then the husband and I will get an Aloha Plate combo - Pick 2 with Teri and Island fire chicken.  Oh and get the mac salad. It is super ono!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. Service has become excruciatingly slow. Stopped in yesterday at 5:30 and didn't get our food until 6:05. The food is good but don't see going back here due to the lackluster service."}
{"text":"Tried this place for The first time yesterday. In short-the food was awesome! Quick stop through drive-through-the service was good as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First off they never run out of Spam Masubi!!! Secondly the Kailua Pork is on point. Third the staff is very friendly and it is spotless!! You could be a little more generous with the teriyaki sauce:-) also open late!!!"}
{"text":"ONO doesn't begin to cover how amazing this food is!

i grew up in Hawaii and, although NOTHING will ever stand up to the food on the island, this place comes pretty damn close as far as \"plate lunch\" goes.  

the chicken katsu is good, the spam musubi (awesome snack when you're out surfing for the day...a personal fave) is wonderfully delicious...i LOVE the sauce they put under the spam...i'm thinking it's the katsu sauce, but i could be wrong.  my fave tho is the island curry chicken.  it has a kick, but it's freakin AWESOME!  the macaroni salad is to die for...my advice, if you're feeling naughty, skip the rice and ask for two scoops of the macaroni salad...totally worth the calories.

oh, more advice.  go for the mini meal.  it might sound small, but it is the PERFECT size!  just enough to fill you up!

mahalo to whatever lolo brought this grub out to all the haoles in phx!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a place you go for atmosphere, but the food is pretty great! All combos are served with 2 scoops of white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad and the protein of choice is served on a bed of cooked cabbage. I ordered the chicken combo which has katsu and Hawaiian BBQ chicken. Both options were incredible- Hawaiian BBQ is extra moist and flavorful. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the macaroni salad, but I don't enjoy Mayo based salads anyway. The serving side could likely feed two or one hungry person. Normal meals range $8-10; they also offer a mini meal for $6.99. Certainly a good option to try out if you're in the shopping center or for take out. Friendly and fairly quick service."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out and finally I had my opportunity, which I should have just skipped.  The place was a huge let down. 

When you enter, you're greeted with an enthusiastic 'ALOHA'.  Each person that you see had a huge smile and is willing to help and answer questions.  

I ordered the white fish Aloha Meal and my friend ordered chicken with beef, I think it was.  

For me, a couple fish nuggets weren't very exciting and my friend mentioned that the dark meat chicken wasn't great.  Overall, the quality just was t there.  

Each of our meals came with a huge amount of rice.  It felt like 75% of the meal was just rice and about 20% was shredded ice berg lettuce with soaked in their dressing.  I think that the salad might have had a chance to be good but, with less dressing.  

Lastly, I was surprised by seeing the 'Seafood Mix' on their menu consist of chicken.  Seriously.  

Overall, I'm glad that I went to try it out.  The atmosphere was nice but, I can't find myself eating there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a disappointment. The photos on the menu look nothing like the meals that come out of the kitchen. My son ordered the seafood mix, which had little sea food and lots of water and veggies without taste. He said it was awful. I had the Hawaiian chicken bowl and instead of nice looking chicken strips in a large bowl with rice and veggies, I got a small bowl with small bites of chicken soaked in teriyaki sauce and wilted cabbage piece. Not very good. 

So do not come here because the food is not represented well by the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome & authentic Hawaiian food! I've been to Ono dozens of times over the years and it never disappoints. My favorite is the island curry chicken - I always add some of their phenomenal katsu sauce. They offer white meat chicken, if that's your style. Another option is to get your meal with all rice and no macaroni(or vice versa). Bottom line-try it, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome however, the service kinda sucks and it's a little over priced for the food you get."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love their teriyaki chicken combo! Delicious macaroni salad. Tasty teriyaki sauce. We love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our absolute favorite places to pick up dinner. Love, love, LOVE the teriyaki chicken. And the macaroni salad is amazingly delicious. We always get extras so we can munch for dinner and lunch the next day! Yummmm! In fact, I think we will go tonight!"}
{"text":"It's fast food. I get the curry, and it's ok, but most of the other dishes have meat that is fatty and greasy. One awesome thing is that they have small meals. I don't need 2 lbs of food, so I'm glad for a lower priced smaller option."}
{"text":"My dilemma is I have intentions of eating healthy, but when I go out to eat there are so many yummy sounding \"bad food\" options and then its all downhill from there. But at ONO, all the plates sound good and are good are relatively healthy. I am always down to grab a bite to eat here. I like the decor, although there could be more seating. And the seating is not that comfortable"}
{"text":"I don't know what the bad reviews are all about! This place is bomb! The food is so delicious. The gentleman who rang me up was very polite and helpful. I wanted chicken katsu and bbq beef together, but the two item plate didn't come with the macaroni. So he suggested I just get the chicken and beef combo and just change the chicken from bbq to katsu. It worked out well. They have a station for katsu sauce and teriyaki. I love it so much I got a few containers haha! They also gave me two containers of hot sauce. I love this place! Give it a try! It's not as dirty as people make it seem. Also, when I came there were no bums around. I came around lunch time as soon as they open and it wasn't busy at all.  I was in and out of the place in less than 5 mins. Will be coming back here more often!"}
{"text":"Bad...just really bad!

Was excited to see something different other then \"burgers and fries\". I thought, \"Oooh, Hawaiian food, great! Something different!\" I was so wrong. First off the place was filthy and I had to wipe down my own table. Staff was rude and obviously hated their jobs. And the worst part ever and why I will not be going back, they do not properly clean the shrimp. That to me is unforgivable. I couldn't even eat the rest of my dish once I saw that. If they don't clean the shrimp and devein it properly, what else do they not clean?!! Never ever again!"}
{"text":"The family was out and about and decided to give it a try to see what it is all about. First we were shocked that for two adults and a child the meal was $40. We waited quite a while for our food and had high expectations for the price. The beef had a lot of grissle and was bland. My son didn't like it at all so he just ate the broccoli and rice. He is 5 and it not s picky eater at all. My other meat was teriyaki chicken and that was decent but come on. It's chicken.  My wife had the BBQ chicken and it was also quite bland. Overall for the price is nowhere near with it. We have it a try but won't go there again. The staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"First off, Hawaiian BBQ as a food genre is delicious. BBQ, teriyaki, Katsu, Macaroni salad, you name it, I'll eat it all day long. And Ono delivers on the tried and true recipes that keep me coming back to these types of places time and time again. The macaroni salad is creamy and the chicken juicy. As far as food goes I have no complaints.

With that said, I have a few comments on Hawaiian BBQ establishments. Maybe it's just me or maybe it's this city but all of three Hawaiian BBQ restaurants I've eaten at in the Phoenix metro area are nearly identical. They have the same decor, the same level of service, and the same music. Is there a league of Hawaiian BBQ restaurateurs who make sure all locations uphold the standards of the league? Like the type of organization that employs ninjas. Maybe it's just straight up Yakuza. Or is it more democratic? Is there a convention every year where the owners of these restaurants agree to use the same chairs and increase the amount of mayonnaise in the macaroni salad by 5%? I'm not sure exactly where this line of questioning is leading, other than I think there's more behind the simple facade than initially meets the eye.

Anyway, food is great, but I could go with a little more originality sometimes."}
{"text":"I do believe now that Ono is superior to L&L. Bigger portions, better quality...and their spam musubi is better than anything I ever had while living in the beautiful 50th state. Ono = win."}
{"text":"As a local boy raised in Hawaii, this place sucks. Everyone on this thread that says this place is ono (tastes good) you have no clue what good Hawaiian bbq is or you haven't lived there. No offense, but for real kine. They say it comes with 2 scoops rice but that's not 2 scoops rice, more like 1 sccop. I had the bbq combo and the meat was greasy, had no real taste, almost tasted old. There was no flavor whatsoever. There were 6 open tables and only 1 was clean, the rest were dirty. I eat up at the one in scottsdale and their food is much better. Night and day for sure. Whomever owns this place, get your store together otherwise close it already. It's a shame to call this \"Hawaiian bbq\"."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this time. Their hours are 1100 to 900 so why are they not taking orders at 823pm? Called and they picked up phone and hung up without answering only to leave it off the hook. I have been calling nonstop since then and its now 846pm andd phone still busy.  If they dont want to serve customers after 823pm then they should tell customers that instead of just hanging up on them. It's a shame because I had not had a bad experience before. We'll see if the management offers better customer service and replies to this review with an explanation. Will provide an update then"}
{"text":"I was on my way to chipotle and couldn't help but notice that they there desperately looking for new employees. I used to work at this location. And I'm warning anyone looking for a job or that likes to eat here that I'm about to drop a few bombs. 
1. I have seen multiple times with my own eyes cooks dropping food on the filthy kitchen floor and throwing it back onto the grill to serve to people.
2. There was a terrible cockroach problem. (Not sure if that is still the case) THEY WERE EVERYWHERE
3. They do not clean the soda fountain so I've gotten strep throat 3 times while working there. It's honestly disgusting. 
4. The owners and employers do not care about their employees, they only care about making money. ( you could be vomiting up blood and they would still expect you to show up to work) 
Overall the restaurant is filthy. When I was working there I tried to clean as best as I could but to no avail. So heads up to anyone looking to either work or eat here. I have one suggestion for you: DON'T DO IT"}
{"text":"Ono is my favorite place but this new location has my favorite plate which is the kalbi short ribs priced at 11.49 when all other locations it's priced at 9.99. 
This place is really nice but the wait is long even when it's not busy. I'm really indecisive on weather I should travel to a far location just to get my favorite meal for cheaper. Or pay more here. Idk 

Update; i never got my refund back into my account and they took more than $50 out of my account. When my meal was only $20.
I'm super angry and never coming back here."}
{"text":"Stopped there cause i was missing home.  The place was crowded.  They everything pretty much down except for the taste."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hawaiian bbq mix. Food didn't taste fresh. The beef was fatty and the chicken was dry. The Mac salad was bland. Wouldn't recommend or go back. However, the inside of the restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. As a Chamorro, I love this food as it's the closest thing to home food. 

I only give it 4 stars because they are \"not as good\" as L&L or Lou's Hawaiian out in Peoria. But, that doesn't stop me whatsoever from eating here out thinking the food is delicious. But if I gave everyone a 5 star, what would that mean? 

We're here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always busy but they don't take forever to give you your food. I come her once in awhile but when ever I do they are nice and friendly to me."}
{"text":"I love Hawaiian food and wish this place was better than it is because it is so conveniently close for lunch. That said, the meal i ordered today for dine-in was served barely luke warm. The chicken katsu was dry with virtually no actual chicken and completely inedible. The BBQ chicken was tastey and moist, but i imagine it would have tasted even better served hot. The rice was decent. The service was a bit slow but I wouldn't care if the food was good and hot. 

Disappointing."}
{"text":"Looks great, clean and attentive help. Now for the reality, ordered the Hawaiian BBQ Mix plate and arrived with a small scoop of Macaroni Salad and another of rice even though the pictures showed larger portions and 2 scoops of rice. The truth is the salad was bland and I would not have eaten more. The short ribs looked great but were tough as shoe leather and inedible. The sliced beef was good and the chicken leg meat a little dry and just ok. At $25 for 2 meals I don't think I will be back. As another suggested, Leo's Hawaiian BBQ is the place to go, just a few extra miles."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday and it wasn't bad! I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ. The chicken itself was good enough to get again, the white rice and the cabbage was nothing to cry home about, but all in all a good meal!"}
{"text":"A \"Hawaiian\" spot without Loco Moco? No thanks, good thing there are other choices opening up close by..  they don't even have Chicken Katsu Curry, guess they will be getting rid of Spam Musubi soon too, this place runs with no Aloha."}
{"text":"Ok, I already know this place has it's issues.. but I like Ono's.. lol

I walk in and am greeted by Desiree which is very nice and friendly, as I tell her I haven't decided yet she begins to help another customer.. Al**  then says, \"I can help you over here.\" I ask if anything is on special (because that's what helps me decide when they have ran extensive menu) and she says no and rolls her eyes, or just decides to pan her view around the top of the wall, I decide to get the BBQ mix, she tells me my total and I hand her my card.. she doesn't even look at me as she runs it and hands me my receipt and quickly crumples the copy and throws it.. awkward silence.  I should have not asked for an ice water, I think it made things worse because I was interrupting her conversation with another employee. 

Maybe she was having a bad day, and maybe I am too.. I'll redact her name from public shame,
Ono's gets 2 stars instead on 1 because it was yummy."}
{"text":"The food is always good but customer service needs to be worked on. We got rude looks from Amber, who was working the cash register, and the other young girl who was standing there with her. They were on their phones and talking to each other, ignoring customers waiting to order. None of the cooks in the back looked happy to be there either. We didn't get a thank you or even a smile from anyone there. The only time I saw Amber smile was when a customer who seemed to be a regular walked in.  As they left, she didn't even look up from her phone as she said, \"thank you come again.\" 

But like I said the food is always good! Just hard to feel welcome and want to eat in when the employees don't seem to want to be there, or want you to be there."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today in fact I am still trying to eat this stuff you call beef. It is terrible.  Most of it is fat and gristle. I  just can't finish it. Maybe the chicken is better. I got the mini beef lunch. It is a good thing because most of it wasted.
Would I come back----- not on you life"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and was very dissappointed. The woman behind the counter was clearly annoyed that I wanted to order. The food although very tasty was very fatty. There was very little meat that wasn't all fat. The tables were all dirty and it wasn't very busy and when I asked the woman behind the counter for some napkins to wipe one down she didn't even budge to come wipe them down. There were only two tables taken in the whole place and it wasn't busy enough for her not to be able to get away from the counter. I don't think we will be back. Didn't seem like it was worth the money for a bunch of fatty meat and indifferent service."}
{"text":"This place is on par with L&L serving many of the same types of dishes. The food is pretty good, but the menu can be a bit overwhelming if you aren't familiar with Hawaiian cuisine...study the menu thoroughly before getting in line. This place is definitely not for the health conscious, as a majority of the meals are comfort food."}
{"text":"used to work here so i know how the service should be. ignoring calls and then answering just to hang up right away is NOT good service. aloha kitchen or paradise hawaiian bbq in tempe are better options."}
{"text":"I'm from California so of course nothing compared to the Ono Hawaiian BBQ out there, but this is a very close 2nd. The reviews complain a lot about the wait. We did have to wait a bit but it's not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. Especially since my food was hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff.  Can't miss with anything on the menu, but chicken katsu is the best!"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food. Only 4stars as it's a little expensive worth it though. I have not found a better Hawaiian bbq in valley"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Hawaiian food and it was great! The food is solid--I got the Hawaiian BBQ mix. The beef was seasoned well and the macaroni salad that came with it was noms. The prices were pretty standard ($10 for most dishes). The location in solid (in a complex right off the 202). The actual place is really casual--like any other regular fast food place."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good, but the customer service tonight was absolutely terrible. My order was taken correctly but the cook had forgotten to make the extra side of chicken that I had ordered. This would have been fine if it wasn't for the fact that I then had to stand around for another 10 minutes while watching other customers that ordered after me get their food. The icing on the cake was the fact that the server, Linette, didn't even bother to apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"Foods good cashiers are nice and friendly! Totally recommend the chicken curry amazing! A bit spicy but gooood"}
{"text":"I really like the Katsu Chicken, I have ordered almost everything on the menu here, its that kind of place.  yet I really think the Katsu here is the best.  Large potions and they have authentic drinks.  don't forget to get some Ono Hawaiian sauce that is to the left of the counter.  

Happy eating,
Kevin"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of \"Hawaiian food\". Don't get me wrong, I love to taste new things and try everything at least once, but my first time trying Hawaiian food was not the best experience. 

ONOS CHANGED THAT! 

This place was great! The staff is nice, the food is phenomenal, the sauces are amazing, and I just enjoyed my visit overall. 
I recommend this place for anyone in The Valley to check out."}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest you go to this place unless you have plenty of time to wait for the poor slow service.  I was there today at 2:20 at 2:49 I finally got tired of waiting all I had was a simple  crispy shrimp... Trying to get my money back was even longer.. like I said I don't recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Macaroni salad and Chicken Katsu good
BBQ chicken not so good

It's a bit weird paying 9 bucks for rice, chicken, macaroni, and steamed lettuce when other Hawaiian places offer multiple sides gratis with your meal. BBQ chicken was a bland rubbery mess that the Katsu sauce couldn't help. (Teriyaki tastes like straight syrup)

Visit the much better Hawaiian options in Phoenix! \"cough Paradise cough\""}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was not.
Came in at 9, the inside dining closes at 9:30. Drive-thru closes at 10:30.
We ordered and waited. And waited. And waited.
We got our food at 9:17. Our friend didn't get his until 9:29. 
I asked when I saw the whole line staff walk out back for a smoke break/trash run most likely, if his was coming and they said they had to make it fresh so it was going to take longer. 
Finally getting to eat, they start picking up chairs and mopping. The girl on the register then comes over with a bag to have us put our barely eaten food in to leave, but says \" I didn't want to rush you out because your food took so long\" AS SHE'S RUSHING US OUT. 
Not a great first impression, first time, new to the neighborhood. 
Might go back for the food, but wouldn't go inside. Depending on how long it would have taken sitting in the drive-thru though, might just skip it all."}
{"text":"The food is good but that family meal is a rip off unless you're feeding a family of hobbits.  You're better off buying 3 plates. You'll get more and it'll be cheaper.  I paid 6.00 more to order the BBQ ribs which I only got 4! 43.00 gives me 4 pieces of fish, 4 pieces of ribs, and it looks like 3 pieces of katsu. It comes with 6 little scoops of rice and 4 little scoops of salad."}
{"text":"Well it is what it is.  A Hawaiian food place trying to get as close as possible to the real thing.  Watery Katsu sauce and Kikkoman soy sauce does not do it any justice.  Take my advice, make your Katsu sauce thicker, lose the nasty thing called Teriyaki sauce and ship over Aloha Shoyu!  That is the only way you will get it right.  Wear shoes because the floor is sticky."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian food fast!  Came in to get an order of Spam Musubi to go and was immediately greated.  The spam musubi here is awesome and portion size is great.  The service was prompt but the wait for the food was a little longer then I had hoped, but worth the wait.  I've had several other dishes and sides here and have enjoyed them all.  Great place to come for something a little different."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday hoping to get a couple salads for lunch. Had their own coupon to buy one menu item and get one free. However since our one lesser meal was less than $6 they couldn't figure out how to take the coupon off. They kept trying to get us to order something else instead of a salad! Over and over we told them we just wanted salads not a different more expensive menu item. I don't understand how the manager couldn't even figure out how to give us the discount. We ended up leaving and going some where else instead."}
{"text":"I love ono! At first I had the thought that this place charges way too much for a plate, then I saw the portions. We ordered the Chicken Katsu meal and the Short ribs meal and it was enormous! The chicken was so crispy and went very well with the mountain of macaroni salad and rice (not to mention a bunch of katsu sauce). The short ribs were also delicious! They gave a generous amount and the marinade they used was perfect. We had so much left over I had it for another meal! I had recently gone to an expensive Korean BBQ restaurant that had \"premium Angus short ribs\" and I wish I had just gone to Ono instead! Haven't tried their spam musubi but I plan to in the near future!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place a solid 3 stars for the first visit, good enough to earn repeat business.  

Apparently a CA chain, Ono serves up a variety of \"Hawaiian\" menu items featuring various grilled meats with assorted sauces, generally complimented with rice.  Prices range $5-8 for entrees.

I had a \"mini meal\" which was plenty of food for me and a reasonable deal for the quantity of food.  My Yellow Curried chicken was tasty and piping hot.  The sauce had a mild spiciness.  The chicken came with some veggies which were fresh and tender-sweet potato or yam? and cabbage.  I would have liked more rice and less meat.   There was also a small scoop of Macaroni salad which was not bad but very bland-the Macaroni Salad equivalent of Wonder Bread."}
{"text":"No food is good enough to make up for the horrible service I got. With only a couple of customers ahead of me, I waited nearly a half an hour for two to-go meals. It was absolutely absurd because the cooks who I could see were goofing around and nobody seemed to care.  If you have unlimited time to stand around waiting, the food is good. My time is valuable and it's not worth it for me."}
{"text":"The food of my people. Good to know that Scottsdale has great Hawaiian BBQ. Try the #4 Combo for an assortment of meat. Kalbi, bulgogi, katsu - all good. Large portions for a great price! 

Note: I appreciate the fact that the cabbage garnish is boiled and not left raw and squeaky under my food like at other places. It's the little things that matter."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Dis bbq broke da mouth brah!!!

BBQ & Katsu Combo ftw

Most Hawaii bbq I've had has always been good. This place is great. Every bit of my platter was mouth watering. The katsu was way better than I expected and you get a full helping of parboiled cabbage and Mac salad. Way more food on the combo than I could eat....and I'm a big strong boy with a big appetite."}
{"text":"First time here. Was pleasantly surprised. Loved the Island Fire Chicken & Kalua Pork. Can't wait to come back another time to try more. Staff members were very friendly and welcoming. Food is very good."}
{"text":"I had take out brought to me from this place today, so I can't speak for the inside of the store, but the food was very good.  For those of you that remember the Ma'i Island Grill in Tempe, this place is the closest I have encountered to the Ma'i Island perfection of Hawaiian BBQ.

I had the standard BBQ chicken this time, and next time I will be trying the Katsu.

The macaroni salad and white rice were excellent -- the rice was sticky and the macaroni salad sweet and delicious.

If you haven't been able to find good Hawaiian BBQ in Phoenix yet, this may be the place for you.  The portions were good, and the price reasonable.

I like it!  And it turns out it is right down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"I ate at Ono last night and the food was delicious! I got the chicken combo and the teriyaki chicken was just as tender as it should be, and then the other chicken was nice and crunchy! My boyfriend and I shared the combo, and still had food left over. It comes with rice and pasta salad. The pasta salad was SO good, I would go back just for that. To me, the rice seemed a little dry but was still okay. 

My only suggestion was that the seating area had a little bit of a messy/unclean feeling and could be improved! But, don't be deterred by this, because once you're eating you won't even notice the floor!

Overall, I would certainly return and would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service every time. Brought my grandparents and they are hooked! Girls are always nice and the manager is very accommodating. Clean restrooms and seating area."}
{"text":"Bonus points for just being Hawaiian food in the West Valley!  

Plate lunches are good and what you'd expect if you call Hawai'i home.  Normal fare and combinations.  Service is okay, but ends at the counter.  Time from order to pickup can also be long, translating into the food sometimes being lukewarm.  When the crew is on, the food is very good.  However, we've also had some bland pork, fatty and meatless short ribs, and overcooked chicken on occasion.  Kind of like a luau back home...

Portions are the normal Hawaiian-style generous.  Cost is a little higher, but not bad.

The owner is a very nice lady and it's always fun to support franchisees like this."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a coworker today. I would give the food 4 stars, but the service brought it down to 3. The cashier taking the orders looked like we were bothering her by being there. I handed over my debit card, she ran it through, and the receipt printed. What struck me as odd is that she took an imprint of my card. I questioned her and she informed me \"Corporate is making us do this. There's been a lot of fraud.\" Personally, I would rather not have my card number printed on a piece of paper and changing who knows how many hands. That's just me. If I go back, I'll pay with cash.

I had the BBQ chicken and shrimp combo plate. The food is good and I like their selection of sauces (teriyaki, katsu, soy, tartar, mustard, and sriracha) to kick up the flavor."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service. I love this place!! Thanks for coming to Surprise, I used to have to drive to Litchfield for this goodness, now its right around the corner.
I have tried everything on the menu at least once, and its all really good."}
{"text":"Ono has Awesome food. Fresh, and delicious. Will be back! Try the chicken Katsu or lemon pepper chicken. Might not look like not much but the food delivers. Also, a friendly staff!! Only thing I would recommend is adding more to the menu. Lunch special is a steal too"}
{"text":"This is my go to when it's been a long day and I don't feel like cooking. Chicken combo, in, out, dinner done. The staff is always nice even when it's crazy busy and sometimes it can be but my order has never been cold or incorrect."}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place. The Island White Fish four piece with cabbage, broccoli and rice is very tasty. I get it every time I'm close by it."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the places in Hawaii that has tons of food for a good price.  The plate lunch portions are easily large enough for two people and filling. The barbq mix plate lunch is a great deal, but wish their galbi short ribs did have so much fat and that this combo included some meat jeon.  The bbq chicken and bbq beef were my favorite, so next time, I will just order the Chicken and Beef combo or their BBQ & Katsu Mix plate lunch combo. 

If dining alone, their mini meals are the way to go. Their macaroni salad is quite tasty! Maybe I will get an extra side of this too.  Yum.  Good place to dine if craving for the flavors of Hawaii without spending so much money. 

Please add meat jeon to the menu too!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst meal anywhere.  Never again.  I ordered the seafood mix which came with chicken, shrimp and fish along with 2 scoops of plain white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad and cabbage (which they called a side of vegetables).  They asked me if I wanted tartar sauce and I said \"yes.\"  So they give me two cups of tartar sauce that they store on the counter and not even refrigerated.  Hello?  But tartar sauce's main ingredient is mayonnaise.  It needs refrigerated.  Room temperature tartar sauce is questionable for anyone's stomach.  No telling how long it had been kept at room temperature.  Then the 2 pieces of fish, although greasy hot from the deep fryer were still translucent and slimy inside like raw or semi raw fish.  Not at all flakey like cooked fish is supposed to be.  The chicken was tough and hard to cut with the plastic knife.  Of course the white rice was bland.  It would be nice if they would have some sort of sauce or something to eat with the dry white rice.  Never again will I eat there."}
{"text":"My experience here was good. The food was honest authentic Hawaiian food. It is the common food of the people, not the elite.
My food was prepared promptly and correctly. Not exactly a health food place. It is more aptly termed comfort food."}
{"text":"This place REALLY SUCKS ASS!! I mean, shit, you order and after 12 minutes they tell you it's going to be 15 minutes more? And \"we have a lot of tickets\"?? Bull Fucking Shit. If I wanted to wait 30 minutes for a fucking meal, I would have gone to a restaurant, not a fast food joint. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"BBQ combo plate with mac salad and rice.  Throw on some sauce and you have a meat lovers paradise.  Might as well be in Hawaii, that is my visual interpretation of the food....If you like meat as much as I do you have to have the combo plate.  
I like the spam roll as well, when I am really hungry eat a combo plate and the spam roll and you will be satisfied. Vegans need not apply here, nothing really here for you?
If you crave some good Hawaiian BBQ, visit Onos.  
Onos you didn't.....I had to, could not resist."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for different types of food to try.  I've never been to Hawaii but thought this would be cool.  We purchased the family meal and it was a great value.  We had plenty of left over.  It was so good, I went back a few times.  This is worth trying out."}
{"text":"Their chicken is just too rubbery and chewy for me - though I think this is the way they intend to prepare it, and obviously some people really like it. I've eaten at another location in the past with the same rubbery results. Their shrimp and fish was almost passable. Disappointed as this would be a healthy close-to-home alternative."}
{"text":"satisfied my craving for spam musubi.  would go back for them!"}
{"text":"Store looks brand spanking new. First time I tried Ono and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the two item plate and chose teriyaki chicken and BBQ chicken. Meat was tender, seasoned well and tasted awesome. White rice was cooked to perfection. The sauces are amazingly delicious. The teriyaki self serve is free and heated which is very cool. Customer service could be a little better which is why I'm rating a 4."}
{"text":"Front counter person not friendly, basically rude. Impatient and not helpful. Then proceeded to go back to checking her cell phone"}
{"text":"New location with a drive through. Staff is below average with their service but the food is great. The grilled chicken, beef and ribs with the teriyaki sauce are amazing. White rice is cooked very well and taste great with the teriyaki sauce, too. Fried white fish is also a hit. Coke products, Hawaiian drinks and iced tea are your drink options."}
{"text":"Ono is an oyeah in my dining book! Another place introduced to me by my coworkers. I'd never heard of Hawaiian BBQ before moving out here, so the combination of things like sushi & spam, cold macaroni salad served with warm rice & chicken confused/intrigued me. Thankfully their menu has pictures so I could get an idea at first of what I had ordered. 

I love their lunch specials! Biiiiiig meal for ~$6, add $1 for a drink- macaroni salad (absolutely addicted!), \"veggies\" (cooked cabbage), rice, & your protein. I always feel rediculously full after an Ono meal. 

A few times the coworkers and I have gone in together on extra macaroni salad bc #addiction. Some of them really love the katsu and the spam sushi (doesn't look appealing to me). My go-to anymore is the BBQ chicken lunch. And it never takes long to wait for our to-go orders- they are right on the ball with service!"}
{"text":"Have tried this place on 3 different occasions, the last and final one being today.  The service was TERRIBLE.  I was the ONLY person in the place and the woman behind the counter made me wait, without even acknowledging my existance while she looked through some sort of tickets. I then asked if I could place my order and then she said, (without even looking up from the stack of paper) \"in a minute.\"  So I just stood there staring at her.  BAD start!  Food is very greasy and chicken was very fatty and majority of it was not edible.  
The positive of the place is that the portion size is large.  Even the mini meal which I got today was more than enough for 1 person's lunch."}
{"text":"I have been to other Ono locations, and had good food.  I tried this one twice (thought the first time was just a bad fluke).  What I go was fatty, bad tasting food with slow service.
Did I mention the parking lot is 1/2 the size it needs to be?
Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, I'm telling."}
{"text":"I first tried Ono Hawaiian BBQ about 4 years ago when it opened in North Scottsdale. It was the first time I had ever been served anything in a restaurant that looked so gross and tasted so bad that I walked out swearing I would never eat there again...and I didn't until last week a co-worker wanted to try it out. Against my better judgment I said sure I will try it again I am sure it has improved in the past 4 years. I ordered the chicken katsu to go with rice and macaroni salad...

When I got back to the office and opened my to go container I was shocked to see near raw chicken....It was totally pink throughout the the breading not even being cooked all the way...How do you screw up a fried piece of chicken that is pounded out super thin breaded and fried???? My co-worker thought maybe it was just the dark meet that made it look pink so she tried a big bite and immediately gagged it up since it was slimy going down....Once you pay for the meal and a drink (at $2.25 a pop!!!) you are looking at $10+ a person!!!!I would rather eat at Chili's for that price.

In the end I will say the rice is good from Ono Hawaiian BBQ the mac salad is also not too bad although a little heavy on the mayo/sauce they use."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place! This is my first time at this location but its still the same delicious Hawaiian BBQ!! As long as that never changes I'll always be a loyal customer here."}
{"text":"Got takeout - lady behind the counter was nice but every single other thing about this place is bad.

Frozen, fatty chicken breast. Threw it away after a couple bites."}
{"text":"Stopped into this location for a quick lunch with my coworker. This location is a little more expensive than the other locations. A mini meal cost me almost $9 without a drink.

I got the BBQ chicken mini meal. I substituted the rice for an extra scoop of Mac salad which I kind of regretted after receiving my order. The chicken was nice and juicy. Very well marinated. Tasted great. The steamed veggies it comes with you can never go wrong with! As for the Mac salad, there was just so much dressing. It was like a 2 to 1 ratio of dressing to macaroni. Lacked flavor. Mostly tasted like mayo. Should of gotten the rice instead!

Staff was very friendly here. Nice and clean on the inside."}
{"text":"Got the BBQ chicken and shrimp loved it all large portion of rice macaroni salad.  Also underneath cabbage.  We got to make but it was enough for the three of us."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten Hawaiian BBQ in years! This place is awesome. Didn't disappoint. I had the chicken and beef plate. Macaroni salad, cabbage, and rice are the sides, generally sides are usually run of the mill. In this case all three tasted great!  We shall return with more friends!!!;-)"}
{"text":"I love Ono's Hawaiian BBQ! When I find the time to stop by any of their locations I always order the Hawaiian BBQ Mix. It includes BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef & Kalbi Short Ribs, a side of macaroni salad, cabbage, and rice. All of the meats are tasty, though sometimes really fatty, but the macaroni salad is like crack! It is the best macaroni salad I have ever had in my life. When my friends tell me about eating entire pints of Ben & Jerry's ice cream I wish I had a pint of the macaroni salad instead.
 
Depending on who is working will determine if they are stingy with the portion sizes. When I lived in the East Valley, one of the Gilbert locations was so cheap about portion side that I decided to only order it when I'm going to the Baseline or this location in Phoenix. I often like to call my order in ahead of time so it is ready as soon as I get there. I always ask for them to substitute the cabbage for extra macaroni salad and they are cool about it. I wish the restaurants were more consistent regardless of which location I visit."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've had any sort of Hawaiian food. Knowing that Ono's is an established chain I was expecting the quality to be better than normal. 

When I stepped into the restaurant I noticed that it was pretty crowded due to the lunch rush. The place was relatively clean even with the influx of people in and out of the establishment.

 I went ahead and ordered the BBQ chicken combo and the other people I was with ordered the BBQ chicken and katsu combo. I have the say that the BBQ chicken was tender but the chicken was quite fatty. The people who ordered the BBQ chicken and katsu combo said their chicken was also very fatty and a little too oily for their tastes. The combo also came with white rice and macaroni salad. I've never been a fan of macaroni salad so I passed on eating that and the white rice complimented the chicken just fine. 

Overall, I would rate the place 3 stars. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"I'm glad they have a Hawaiian barbecue place down the street from where I live. Before I used to drive to Leo's on bell road but so far in my opinion, these two places are quite almost similar. But unfortunately, when I was in the drive-through they made me come inside to get the curry chicken."}
{"text":"Still a one star... Ownership reached out to me about a month ago after I posted this so they would send me some coupons in the mail never received them and will not reply to messages on Yelp so ....avoid


2 1/2 months later and still no contact from management of this location or the ownership"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Although the last visit was unfortunate. The young ladies that were by the register didn't acknowledge me when I walked in because they were too busy on their phones. The order also took a lot longer because the cook was too busy flirting with the young ladies. It was surprising because I usually have a good experience I think because it was close to closing time. But that shouldn't effect their customer service."}
{"text":"NOTE: [Every time you read the word \"Groupon\", you have to take a shot.]

I've been here several times, but haven't felt the need to write a review until tonight's experience.  Let me preface, that most everyone's dinner was 4 to 5 star.  Everyone raved about the panko fried fish.  The food was exceptional, except for the fried shrimp, which was overcooked.

Let take this step by step.  First, when my wife called, the woman who answered the phone was very rushed, and hung up on my wife as soon as she completed her order, but before she could ask a few questions.  OK, they're probably pretty busy, but they should know that they're going to turn off customers with poor service.

I rolled up with a $20 Groupon in hand, and the woman working the counter (who presumably was the same woman answering the phone) let me know, in no uncertain terms, that the Groupon deal was costing her money (now I'll assume that she is the owner).

She complained that patrons would tell her that the menu prices are too expensive, but that once the company offers a Groupon deal, the same people show up with a Groupon, and they usually have a line out the door.  Then she mentioned that the economy must be pretty bad for so many people to get in on the Groupon, and asked me where I acquired my Groupon deal.  I replied, \"The internet\".

Trying to make her feel a tad better about this losing proposition, I reminded her that the benefit of the Groupon was to bring in new clientele.  She said that the deal does bring in a lot of business, but that she lost money on all that business

I replied that the payoff would be return-business, and she said something to the effect of, \"Yeah, most Groupon people don't come back.  What about you?  Am I going to get your return business?\"

My plea to the proprietors of this location would be:
1. Don't complain to the customer about the promotional deal they show up with.  If you must complain, then complain to the people at corporate who entered into the Groupon deal.  NEVER complain to the customer.
2. Don't be rude to your customer.  I know if may be hard to hold your tongue, and you're probably really busy, and you're a little overwhelmed at the prospect of not getting compensated for your hard work, but you can pretty much ensure a customer wont return if you're rude to them.

I think this location serves great food, they just need to get their customer service in order.  I want to see this business thrive, because I like their product.  C'mon guys, don't ruin it with poor, preventable choices."}
{"text":"Macoroni salad was good and white rice. The chicken and beef could have been better it's seems they need to cook it longer really tough and rubbery. I would like a little more crisp with a nice break to it when you bite and chew the food. Little under cooked for my likings

I may try agian and request well..well...done"}
{"text":"Compared to the Onos in Tempe, this place only gets one star, while Tempe would get a five... 

First of all it is over 105 degrees outside, and just as hot inside? They have A/C but chose to keep it over 85 degrees and run ceiling fans... Seriously? 

Next the customer service is horrible... Not only was the cashier slow and rude, she wasn't very smart about their own menu. I asked for a chicken Katsu and kalua pig mixed plate, she said so you want one kalua pig and one Katsu plate, I said no mixed, then she got confused, so I repeated very slowly... I WOULD LIKE ONE KALUA PIG/CHICKEN KATSU MIXED PLATE... She finally got that right...

Next I asked if I could get a mini Kalua Pig plate, her reply was we don't serve a mini Kalua Pig plate... Ok Fine, so I said can I get the Kalua Pig plate then... Her reply was MINDBLOWING? she says would you like the regular Kalua Pig plate? I wanted to tell this (insert swear word here) NO I WANT THE FRIGGEN JUMBO SIZE PLATE? you just told me 5 SECONDS AGO that you didn't serve a mini one so what's left? Super Size? JUMBO? Seriously management?

I would rate zero stars if I could..."}
{"text":"In a crunch for time? Catering is quick and easy! Had to go to a pot luck and I got Mac salad from here!! Quick and \"Ono\"!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, since there's no Poi Bowl here not to mention all my other favorite places in Hawaii, yes I'm a regular. I usually go to the one on Thomas unless I'm doing my shopping up this way. But so far I've been disappointed every time with the rice. Who ever is cooking it doesn't know what they're doing. It's sticky rice, not chewy rice with hard bits. Other than that, I've only had my usual, chicken katsu, and with that I have no complaints although I seem to get more chicken at the one on Thomas."}
{"text":"My favorite is the chicken katsu. Just like back home with one scoop rice and authentic mac salad. The cooks and servers are always friendly and the food only takes as long to be made to order. Great portions alway have one order for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was not unlike everyother store front restaurant and the service was efficient. The food itself was if'y, and I'm not saying that because I was born and raised in Hawai'i...the kalua pork was watery and the portion was ridiculously small for the price. The mac salad was over salted and the haupia was too sweet. The barbeque amd katsu chicken were the saving grace to the meal. Stick with the chicken!"}
{"text":"Walked in no hello or welcome no eye contact or smile. Customer service was Ass. Food was alright, though they didn't accept my gift card. They hate their jobs and it shows"}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the past few months and I really like the food here. The service could be a little better and the place could use a good detail clean. I always get the Island Fire Chicken which is pretty spicy (which I love!!) It is a little pricey for the portion size. I will come back and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I went here for the 1st time today because I was craving some Japanese curry rice so I ordered the island chicken curry. I was truly disappointed because it wasn't a Japanese style chicken curry that I'm  used to getting in other Hawaiian bbq joints. It tasted ok though....it was bbq chicken thighs with a curry flavor along with chunks of carrots and potatoes. I was really wanting the curry gravy to mix with the rice, but it didn't have any gravy :( Other than that the menu had all the items you would expect like kalbi, bbq chicken and beef, fried seafood, noodles, salads."}
{"text":"What the heck is up with your A/C Ono? It was 107 degrees today and the inside of your restaurant felt like 100 degrees. I met a friend there for dinner tonight and we were so uncomfortable and sweating. We actually had to end our meal early and leave to get the heck out of there. I noticed prior to writing this review that I am not the first one to mention this issue, so apparently this is normal here. Sorry, but in Arizona if you want customers to come to your restaurant you need to crank down the A\C! It felt like it wasn't on at all."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and inviting. this was our first time and we were satisfied. The ribs were a little tuff but the chicken, rice, shrimp and cabbage was good. We ordered the fish but they gave us more chicken instead (oops!). We will be back to try again. beautiful establishment. Very pleasant experience.."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the katsu chicken and BBQ chicken combo.  Must say though that a lot of business lately with the economy so bad that service and the amount of you use to get is just not the same.  The price goes up but the quality and quantity goes down.  Also if there is a Groupon or some deal going on please make sure everyone including the manager is aware of it.  Pretty bad when you have to wait for them to call around to the other locations to make sure that the deal you have is still on."}
{"text":"We go here a lot because my wife loves it. It's good affordable food. The thing's I dislike the most are I always order the same dish and sometimes the servings are huge others it's like I think you forgot something. Also I'm always getting hit up 3-4 times in the parking lot for money before I make it to the door.  Service could be better last night it took 25min to get my food and they were not even busy. No I'm sorry for the delay or anything just kinda left the tray at the counter and walked away when the number was called"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars for quick and courteous service, 3 for food and 5 for convenience.  

I could easily be the duchess here if I remembered to check in here on each visit.  
This place is so simple quick and easily accommodates my 30 min lunch break, I choose it over many of the other Fast Food options in the area for take out.  Their kalbi ribs are pretty darn tasty but it can be a lot of food for lunch with the 2 scoops of rice, a scoop of mac salad and the ribs over steamed cabbage.  I find myself choosing from their Mini Meal menu for under $6 I can get a scoop of mac salad a scoop of rice and a choice of their chicken options (bbq is a favorite) or their pulled pork (which I have yet to try) over steamed cabbage.  Most of their chicken unless otherwise mentioned is boneless skinless thighs, makes for juicy tasty pieces. Don't forget to get a little extra cup of teriyaki or katsu sauce near the drink station. 

They also have a special that offers a seasonal fruit cup. The last time I got this it was quite sweet, fresh and refreshing.   

All the employees have be polite and efficient.  I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"A short an sweet report about lunch....

This was a quick lunch with my best friend Melissa and was well worth it!!  

We were greeted by the counter person with a warm welcome and when I advised I had never been here before, she took me through a quick tour of the menu and suggested what to order.  Following her suggestions was a great choice!  

We both had the same thing, The Hawaiian BBQ Mix.  This comes with BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef and Kalbi Short Ribs.  I also added Teriyaki sauce to the Chicken.  The meals came with 2 scoops of rice, a single scoop of macaroni salad and veg.  

The flavors were wonderful, the beat tender and juicy.  The ribs were a thin slide and you had to navigate around the bones but it was delicious!

For months I have been threatening to stop by but never have,  Now I am sad for all I have missed!!  Definitely going back!!  

Overall:  This place is a keeper!  Good service, great food, served fairly quickly....We are already making plans for your next visit!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD, but at this certain location the girls who work there are not very polite. They kept staring at me while I was eating my food, and made me feel like I was bothering them when i asked them for napkins. Won't be going to this location."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan; however, I've noticed that the food has not been as great and service has slowed down.  Tonight, I called my order in at 6:48 and said my food would be ready in 10 minutes. I know they don't usually have it ready on the dot so I arrived at 7. I paid and then waited for #311. I watched people order their food for dine in and take out. I was so puzzled by the person who ordered their family meal like 10-15 minutes after I've been waiting and they got their order first - please explain Ono. They got all the orders up to #328 and then my #311 order was ready.

To make things worst, the Kalbi had a lack of taste. Why oh why? Why do you have to do this to my favorite food? The beef was a smaller amount than the usual.

I was totally disappointed. I don't know if I'll give them another chance or find an alternative. Please review this location and make things better."}
{"text":"I love One Hawaiian but not the Surprise location, which sucks because it is close to my house. Although it is friendly and clean my orders have been wrong multiple times. The fish is almost never hot and crispy as it should, seems like it is cooked and then heated up when ordered.  Plus I have ordered a side of fish and got two pieces once then one piece the next time. I hope it improves as time goes on."}
{"text":"I grew up in Waikiki, Oahu and have been searching and searching for good Hawaiian food. I am happy to say that Ono's lives up to my expectations. I don't think anything will ever compare to actual authentic Hawaiian BBQ but this place definitely brings me back to Hawaii. The food always comes out within 15 minutes and the portions are large. My favorites are the Katsu Chicken, Kalua Pork, and the Spam Musubi. The macaroni salad is great, my daughter loves it. I also always enjoy the music they have playing, it definitely sets the mood for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"The food was good. We didn't have to wait long. We chose to dine-in but our food was still served in a plastic take-out container. Real plates and silverware would have been nice. The bathrooms were filthy and the floor sticky and wet."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today and I will not be back. We Ordered the fish and when I went to bite into it it was completely raw under the breading. The chicken was fatty and chewy and the cabbage was hard and flavorless because it was the core. When I brought it to their attention they threw the fish back in the fryer and overcooked it. After they replaced the cabbage I heard the staff in the back talking about us. 
There was little apology for their error and they did nothing to make it right. In addition to the food and service the dining area was filthy. Many of the tables had not been wiped and there was sticky sauce on the floor.  Absolutely disgusting place."}
{"text":"I love their lemon chicken and macaroni salad! Fast, friendly and very good!

The place is clean, the staff is friendly and food comes out at a decent time."}
{"text":"Very clean place, but have never eaten there, it's always been take out for son and i.  Service has been great the past 3 times and i would recommend this place.  Korean rribs are awesome, but if not sure just get the combo cuz it has just about every meat they grill.  Actually, the combo is the one my sin i always get. Rice is a little too starchy and sticky for me though."}
{"text":"This place has roaches. Not good. Stay away unless you like to dine with creepy little uninvited friends...."}
{"text":"I went to this place to use a Groupon and because I miss the food from Hawaii (well..some of it anyway). The food here was pretty typical of a fast food place, not very fresh and the meat was very poor quality and fatty. I got the curry chicken and the BF got the bbq beef. They were pretty meh. I also have tried the veggie noodle soup which was probably the best thing I have had here. It was not 'good' but it was better for sure. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"If I can't go across town to enjoy my other fave Hawaiian BBQ (Leo's) I always make it a point to have lunch here. They have great Lunch Specials Monday through Friday. I always get the BBQ Chicken which I love!  Everything always looks great. They are speedy with your order and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they are only a 2 1/2 star? We don't have many Hawaiian BBQ places here in AZ, however I'd say Ono's is one of my favorites. I've ordered the Chicken Katsu, Short Ribs, and BBQ beef, and everything is always delicious. I absolutely love their Mac Salad as well. They also have different combos so that you can try a little bit of everything. 

Their customer service isn't great, and if you want super authentic Hawaiian food, well you'll have to go to Hawaii, however for what they have, I'd say it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Went to pick up four meals tonight for family's dinner. Got home and the Hawaiian Beef from one of the meals was missing. EVERY time we go, at least one item is missing. Anyhow, I called and asked to speak with a manager to let him or her know. I was placed on hold for 7 mins and then hung up on. Tried calling back and line was busy. Phone has been busy for past 15 mins. So diappointed that my husband was missing half his meal. And, no way to reconcile the problem bc they won't answer the phone."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE food!  The Kalua pork looked like cat food and tasted horrible.  They don't have Loco moco, now what Hawaiian restaurant does not have Loco moco?????  Chicken Katsu tasted old and re fried to serve it warm.  The noodle soup is gross.  The noodles is over cooked and the broth tasted like hot ginger water.  The macaroni salad was Luke warm.  What a waste of money.  When you've had authentic hawaiian food, you know that the food here is GARBAGE."}
{"text":"I give it a three because of the quality of food. I really enjoy it. But the service is absolutely terrible! The girl running the cash register barely spoke and looked super angry plus she was texting on her phone the entire time I was there. In Addition my food took almost 20 minutes! With three people in the restaurant, that's a little ridiculous. I was also skipped over with my take out order, so the person who ordered 5 minutes after me got their food first. Just think the staff should be more friendly and not Like they are serving dinner in a prison."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken katsu plate  because I wanted the macaroni salad. They won't let you put macaroni salad on an island plates that is the same price as the katsu you plate but you get two items you get a lot of food, but your paying $9 a person just for lunch meal of one meat. The macaroni salad was not the greatest it was okay the chicken katsu is good fried fresh but was all dark meat not a fan of dark meat I've had katsu so many other places in it's always white meat. This place is very busy and very hot the AC does not work very good so plan on sweating as you eat your lunch. I should have had lunch somewhere else tables are dirty staff are not cleaning them appropriately to keep up with the amount of people coming in and are  rude."}
{"text":"I brought in a coupon and they wouldn't take it. They've wasted too much of my time already."}
{"text":"Not trying to give out backhanded compliments here, but let's face it, even bad Hawaiian is good, right? No, it was not bad, but you can tell when it's chain-store type Hawaiian. Get em' in, and get em' out type food! But it was still enjoyable and beats a fast food burger any day! And for those who do not get to eat Hawaiian often, a nice respite from the norm.

I ordered my go-to, Kahlua Pork! It was ok, not the greatest, just OK. The rice was a bit dry, but the mac salad made up for that. As all Hawaiian food lovers know, there's just something special about Hawaiian style mac salad, isn't there? Yup, it did the trick! In fact, it might have been the savior of my meal, I really enjoyed it.

Portions were nice and large, which is expected with Hawaiian, and their chicken looked good. In fact, if I find myself in there again, I'll probably sway from my normal Kahlua Pork and order that.  No pork hash, though, that blew."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Friendly , clean and GREAT FOOD.   The portions are perfect.  The best chicken ever! AND THE KALUA PORK is so tender and very tastey.  You cant fo wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Just had a terrible customer service experience with an employee named Rosa. It's hard to understand a hateful and disrespectful attitude such as what was encountered. Will never come back and advise others against patronage of this location."}
{"text":"The Girlfriend has been raving about this place for some time now, and seeing that we were in the area - why not stop in for lunch. The price wasn't too bad, you'll be looking to spend between 5 - 15 bucks a plate/dish. I went ahead and ordered the \"Hawaiian BBQ mix\" , pretty much gave me a taste of everything besides the sea food. The meats were jammed pack with flavor and a one of a kind taste. Would come again. =D"}
{"text":"I been to this place twice as well as once at another location.  At this particular location the food is pretty good for lunch but the staff does not seem to be in any hurry.  When I go to the trouble to dive over to this place during a 1 hour lunch break, I really don't like waiting 15 minutes for what is more or less fast food.  The last time I was there I was kept waiting so long that I finally asked for a refund and left.  You'd think that if your chicken combo (first item on the list) is going to take more than 20 minutes to prepare that they might inform me of it, but instead they just left me standing there.  That won't happen again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE cook old and nasty beefy.
Do not come here
I bough 2 entree and had to get and walked out with my refund
Its not even real Hawaiian 
I've been to Hawaii TWICE
So I know what I'm talking about 
Okay?"}
{"text":"I love their food! Everything is delicious! Staff is very friendly! Tiffanni was so helpful on explaining different plates! We will come here again!!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a strip mall and offers a good, filling meal. I got the Hawaiian BBQ Combo (Beef and Chicken). The white Styrofoam container was bursting at the seams when I got my meal. There is a good amount of meat for $7.99 and the rice and salad were decent.

There is an indoor seating area that is ample and a bevy of sauces available for your consumption. However, the sauce that the meat was marinated in was very sufficient. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Dear Mr Jew,

I think it's really sad when your employees don't even know who the owner of the company is. They had to open their \"manual book\" to see what the names of the managers were. Back when I worked there, the owners used to come in regularly, checked the cameras regularly & even the owners wife worked shifts.

I came in tonight to order a family meal. Being that I used to work for Ono Hawaiian BBQ several years ago, I was expecting it to be how I treated my customers when I worked there. But boy that was way too high of an expectation. I never received a greeting (which, when I worked there we used to yell \"aloha\" or \"hello!\" To greet customers + with a smile), floors were sticky, garbage was overfilled & the sauce station was lacking stock. 

There were two young ladies working the front & two gentlemen working the back. When I walked up to the registers, I received just blank looks from both the ladies. Umm, hello to you too? So finally one of them asked if I was ready to order. Sure. I ordered then went next door to grab a smoothie.

When I came back, I waited to get katsu/teriyaki sauce. Both front end girls were flustered about another customers order. They were staring, pointing & whispering in front of the customer who was sitting right in front of them. How much more rude can you be? If we had issues when I worked there, we used to go to the side where no one can see us to talk about the issues.. or move on. It's not a highly stressful job. 

I rated this 2 stars because our food was great. But I sure hope you take this review seriously by taking the time to say hello to your employees & give them a lesson on customer service."}
{"text":"Always consistently great.  Pasta salad is some of best I've ever had.  Beef is tender and sauce is very flavorful.  I always enjoy the dinner which gives a couple options."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of rubber chicken and warm macaroni salad.

The place sits in a dilapidated mall, and since it's close to my homebase and being hungry for something different, I thought what the heck. It was after lunch time rush, but still kinda leery walking into an empty restaurant. Taking these things into consideration, I took my time at the overhead menu, and chose the Hawaiian Chicken lunch combo.

Counter help seemed to not want to be there, but my change was handed back accurately, and the food came out surprisingly fast. The best part of lunch was the Guava Nectar, which isn't saying much, since the can was questionable."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru tonight only to be told that what I wanted wasn't available in the drive thru. However, I was able to place my order in the drive thru, then park and come inside to pick it up. Seemed completely ridiculous and unnecessary and absolutely no explanation was given as to why it was necessary for me to come inside. There was no one waiting behind me outside and no one in front of me inside. If someone had maybe taken a moment to explain why this was necessary, I might have been able to understand but this seemed to totally defeat the purpose of a drive thru."}
{"text":"Food is OK, but gift card holders beware!! I had a gift card that expired on Dec 31st that I wanted to use, but to my surprise, the gift card was already expired on that day! I've been a lifelong gift card/coupon user, and they should work up to and INCLUDING the expiration date. Isn't that what the term \"expiration date\" means? This is the only store/restaurant I've ever experienced in which this wasn't the case. Very shady, deceitful practice. Filed a complaint with corporate and not expecting a positive result. Will update when that happens."}
{"text":"Classic Hawaiian barbecue place serving Kalbi ribs, chicken, sliced beef and some seafood. I usually get the number four mix. Good food at a good price for that style."}
{"text":"I love having a nice combination of Hawaiian BBQ.  I like two scoops of mouth-watering macaroni salad, a scoop of warm fluffy rice, and some deliciously grilled meat all in one plate.  Ono's offers this and sooo much more.  ::saliva gurgle::

The first time I had Ono's, I was running around, trying to organize a bridal shower.  The lovely Bridezilla had me one, \"no, like this\" away from snapping her head off.  So one night, I decided to grab some yummy Hawaiian BBQ at a reasonable price [the princess wanted a *nice* bridal shower].

So *nom nom* later, I'm hooked.  I love Ono's!  The place is clean and bright, service is speedy and friendly, portions are huge, and the food is good.  I've been there a million times and I really don't see an end to it any time soon!"}
{"text":"Great rendition of some traditional Hawaiian flavors. The menu is displayed on TVs above the counter - we were happy to see crab rangoons (a fave) is the suggested side for just about everything!

I chose the BBQ platter, my wife the grilled chicken, comes with rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and a side - we both chose crab rangoons. 

There are a few dipping sauces available - the meats they are meant to go with on the labels. I went with the suggestions and was very happy with the flavor pairings. The breaded chicken (katsu, I believe) deserves a shout out - thinly sliced (or pounded out) fried chicken, very tasty. 

A very tasty meal, atypical and fresh - I hope to try something a bit weirder when I'm back."}
{"text":"Love the chicken! Perfectly grilled and not swimming in sauce, it's a great healthily alternative for lunch I also really like the cabbage noting else too special about the place but you can count on fresh quick food that doesn't disappoint"}
{"text":"Not very good. Stopped in for a quick lunch while I was in the area. The restaurant is in a strip mall with a decent amount of parking. There's plenty of seating, but the restaurant is pretty dirty and cramped. I ordered the chicken katsu mini meal. It was very plain - nothing remarkable about the flavors or cook or anything. It was pretty cheap, but greasy.

Staff seemed bored and irritated that they worked there. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I've tried other locations around the valley and I was excited to try this one since its right down the street from my house. I went on opening day. It was chaotic. The employees were all over the place and forgot a few items on our tray but that's completely understandable for the first few days. I was patient and the food was great. 

I returned today, weeks after opening day, and hardly anything changed. We waited over half an hour for BBQ chicken and a salad. That's a little ridiculous for fast food. I could only imagine the headache of going through the drive through. The seats are all very hard and uncomfortable as well. 

Overall the location was still very clean and the food was amazing, just need to speed up their process. Maybe try hiring someone over 20 years old in that kitchen."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked right back out. It smelled so bad like sweaty mildew. I can't even explain it. It was unbearable and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Does this place know da word Ono means good food I'm Hawaiian da food here wasn't that good tasted like junk da workers there didn't even know da dishes they were serving id stick to Hawaiian kitchen it's far and da food twice as better I should of gave you guys half a stay they didn't let me lol"}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to try all the local island restaurants and heard that Ono was a great place to get Hawaiian.  Inside there was ample seating with faux marble top tables and bright yellow painted from the ceiling to mid-wall.  The island décor is subtle with the exception of a single surf board mounted on one wall.  In fact, it seemed random and out of place given the lackluster island theme.  But who really cares about décor if the food is good, right?

Their plates are pictured so if you've never had chicken katsu, you @ least know what it looks like.  I ordered the mahi-mahi & BBQ chicken combo served on a bed of cabbage, with rice, a scoop of mac salad for about $7.  The fried fish was a little on the dry side and the chicken was a boneless thigh that was moist/juicy but I attribute that to the fact it was dark meat.  The mac salad was a little heavy on the mayo but otherwise ok.  It was quite a bit of food and I split it into a few meals.  The fish was horrible on day 2 and the grease from the chicken was even more pronounced.  (Sigh).  I did find it interesting that they also had musubi on the menu!  If you're not a fan of Hawaiian BBQ, they also have burgers and salads.

The service was good and the food was decent.  I'd return if I were in the area but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I have a good experience here Everytime I go. The front of the house staff are younger but still put together and pleasant. I have not had a bad experience here. Always take away but not bad thing to say. Usually busy and some times the counters need cleaned, but nothing often enough to keep me from dining here. Food tastes good and freshly made."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week. WOW. I was amazed how much food you get for your money. I had left overs for the next day. I had the Hawaiian mix plate. Love the steamed cabbage and their macaroni salad too. Definitely will be back again. Thanks for having a drive thru too..."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened, but this will be my last time. Food is great but very poor customer service and lack of accommodation. If you order the spicy island chicken dish, which I love, you have to walk inside and wait for 15 minutes for them to make it. If I'm waiting that long for food, I'll go to a full service restaurant where a nice looking waitress greets and sits me down. In this instance, I drove through and paid in advanced, then came back 20 minutes later to pick up (give them time to make it) and the female server literally stuck her head out the window and reprimanded me and said next time I had to come inside! Eating out and ordering food should be a pleasant experience. Mine was anything but. I will take my money and business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always great barbecue . Everytime I'm in Scottsdale I come up for barbecue. It's so good I come up from Gilbert on the way to see my wife. Perfect for some great food after work"}
{"text":"I haven't run across authentic Hawaiian food in the Valley until coming to Ono Hawaiian BBQ.  Unlike most Hawaiian BBQ places that give you a ton of food, I like this place because you can order a mini option and get the right amount of food that I need.  Everything here is really fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Cute little place. stopped by for a late lunch. Food tasted amazing and was super hot, I had to wait for it to cool a little. :) I loved how the place was set up with an ocean type of decorative lighting and ornaments. The place was quite during my visit which was nice even those the place has a more fast food type of layout. Great pricing."}
{"text":"Second time same location around the same dinner time.  When going through drive thru, the person has had issues taking orders. In no way did I ask at any point for did I ask for bbq combo, when initially asking for bbq beef and katsu chicken, while repeating my order for confirmation.  For this becoming an ongoing issue, my family and I will take our business to leo's"}
{"text":"I love this place until today, as a loyal customer I pre order so my food can be ready to pick up and go back to work. I have ordered before and it has been the case until Kayleigh Marie Reyes took my order today. Here is my short story.  I get to the location at 11:13 am and paid - wait in the counter as I have waiting for my food. It's been ten minutes in and Kayla goes to the cooks and tell them that I was there and to start the order. Errrrr this got me pissed off, and we wait for another 8 min for the food. This is unacceptable. Really tell the cooks ten minutes later. Very Rude!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the $5.00 lunch meal with their best seller of the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. It was not bad with a lot of teriyaki sauce on it. The Maccaroniii salad I could have done without. Overall okay place to go would have to be pretty hungry/have no where else to go back"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was great!  The workers were nice and the food was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"We thought this place was somewhere else or another place.  Had the mixed bbq and a Hawaiian bowl. Nothing to write home about.  Seemed a lot like Kyoto Bowl.  It was fair.  Tea was brewed but old and skunky.  All in all it was meh."}
{"text":"A massive homeless and hobo population makes this a disgusting place to attempt to eat at. Maybe if you take out only it wouldn't be that bad. Lots of action in and out of the bathrooms and coughing bums populate the lobby getting free water and whatever handouts they can get. 

Pretty good if you are armed with a sturdy pistol you should be safe during the daytime."}
{"text":"Got off to a late start for diner so we went somewhere we could get stuff quick.  As we drove through the parking lot we saw this place.  They had banner that said 50% off with the purchase of a large drink.

For what it's worth 50% off should have been a clue...also for what it's worth I do know better but occasionally I do like to do something stupid.

Anyhow, I ordered the chicken katsu.  Rice was good...but rice isn't that hard to do if you have a decent rice cooker.  Mac salad was actually pretty good (a weird Hawaiian thing which after years of living in Hawaii I still don't fully get).  Now for the chicken.  On the one hand it wasn't bad.  On the other hand, it seemed to be more breading than chicken and in some places it had chicken fat (yuck).

At 50% off it was ok, but I'm real sure I wouldn't pay full price.

Two and a half stars wasn't a choice, but I might go with that."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today. I received a voucher from the google offers and tried to use there on my iPhone. Cashier lady called the store manager to redeem my voucher from my iPhone. The manager refused to accept voucher code on smart phone, only print out paper voucher. I did read the offer instructions how to redeem smart phone voucher or paper voucher to the store manager, but he still insisted not accepting smart phone redemption. I called Ono Hawaiian BBQ Headquarter customer service to valdiate the offer intructions or they do need a training for branch store managers before advertising their specials. I am very dissatisfied with the store manager at 2415 E Baseline Rd, 85042 and have serious doubt about continuation of running this store to success."}
{"text":"Shopping at Walmart is never a pleasant experience, especially with a hungry 9 year old. He says, I wish I could have some of schools teriyaki. Hummmm. Ono here we come.

Arrived at about 12:30 on a hot summer day. Open arrival the dining area was clean and inviting. We had never been before and the decor was not at all what I was expecting. Very modern and contemporary, for some reason I thought it would have more of an island vibe.

A lady took our order. Nothing special about her customer service skills, but I'm not going to take points off. She was quick and efficient, I don't need small talk.

Get our order to go. It was fresh and hot. The smell nearly killed us on the way home. 2 entree Aloha plate. Teriyaki and katsu. Both kinds of chicken were great. The teriyaki was slightly charred from the grill. Katsu, crispy. Rice fluffy yet gummy, just like we like it. The side salad didn't have enough dressing and way to many sliced onions. I still have that onion taste in my mouth, but ingredients were fresh.

Our first time visit would have been 5 star except for one thing. Our order came out much later than the people that were 2 behind me even though my order was behind the counter waiting to be bagged.

$9.26 for lunch for both since we shared the rice and salad. Not bad. We will be back!"}

They have been working on this place for months and finally it is open. 
Friends or ours went today and brought me a chilled coconut. I really enjoyed it. The only time I ever get one is when we go to the park and swap at Aloha Stadium. First thing I look for is a coconut, then shopping. Theirs was good. There was plenty of water. Then it was out to the garage to get a hammer.  The coconut meat was of an ok thickness. My wife will not touch the coconut and it is not for everyone. If you have been wanting one they have it. 
My wife got a mini dinner of BBQ chicken and there was plenty of food. She brought enough home for a meal tomorrow. I got the mixed BBQ dinner. Yes I ate it all and now am so stuffed I wish I had saved some for tomorrow also. There is actually enough in that dinner for two people. Plenty of meat and two scoops of rice. I am not an expert of Hawaiian BBQ but I do know what I like and this was very eatable and priced well. 
The people working there were very friendly and helpful. Hopefully they stay this was. 
There were plenty of customers coming and going. I am pleased they are in Peoria and not far from were I live. Gives us another place to eat occasionally. Being on a low carb diet I will only be eating here on my eat what I want days. 
Support your local business and give them a try."}
{"text":"This place is home to some fantastic food which gives you a false pretense that if this chain has such great bbq beef if you go to Hawaii it has to be insanely good. After spending 6 days on Oahu and sampling various degrees of dining places, I can tell you you are way better off going here rather than trying the native \"kobe\" steak for however much an ounce.

 The beef is amazingly tasty the macaroni salad with a dash of tuna is the best I personally have tried. The white rice compliments the saucy meat and I even eat the cabbage at the bottom of the tray. The portions are huge and if you don't want to feel like your a disgusting lush afterward, I would recommend the mini-meal versions.

Service: 4/5 They are always pleasant but sometimes to food takes a while, most times it doesn't.

Ambiance: 2/5 its like a panda express or any other fast food chain so I usually pickup.

food:
bbq beef 4/5
bbq chicken 4/5
katsu 3/5
macaroni salad 4/5
spam 2/5 just not too good and I do like spam."}
{"text":"Just like eating at a food truck off the beach in Hawaii. 

Love the Kalbi,  Bugulgi, BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu. 

Lots of choices but generally get the Chicken Combo #3 and then get a side of Curry to dip the Katsu in or mix it up with rice. Eat the macaroni salad before it gets to warm.

Every once in a while will get the spam roll but the last time the seaweed wrap was overwhelming. 

I like how they also sell the tiki punch soda and other Hawaiian sodas.

Good stuff brah!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to go to during lunch hour. And that was changed after my visit yesterday. 

Service: the cashier was slow. Very very slow. I don't know what happened with the kitchen staffs yesterday. They were usually very quick at delivering food. However, it took them 15 minutes to finish cooking our menus yesterday. It doesn't help when you are on an hour lunch break and in a bit of a hurry to get back to work. 

Food: I ordered a Korean BBQ rib (off menu item) yesterday. It was greasy but somewhat ok. Shortly after I got back to work, I started throwing up part of my meal. 

Rating: I will never come back here again especially after getting sick from it."}
{"text":"I love this place! First off the chicken Katsu is crispy and moist, the macaroni salad is delicious and they don't skimp on the rice. The lunch special is a steal at 5 bucks! Some location give you steamed cabbage but this location gives you raw, you have to ask for it here. The reason for the 4 stars instead of five is that some times our chicken is not always consistent, always good but not always as great as before. Also the spam musubi is just way too much rice and not enough spam. However all in all I do love this place, I go often and will continue to go often!"}
{"text":"I go there once a month or so when I have coupons that you can find in the entertainment book or elsewhere. 

I usually stick with the grilled chicken Teriyaki and ask only for rice as I am not a big fan of their pasta salad. 

It is a lot of food and proteins for the price! This fills me up all the way to dinner so I like to have some when I am going to work out the same day after work. 

You can easily make 2 lunches out of it. Also, they have a special running where you pay 50% off the second entree but you have to buy large drinks which are expensive so it is barely worth it.

I guess if you have a BOGO with no requirements for drinks it is worth it, otherwise it feels overprice even if you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Went to order food was in line and when I made it to the front ask a couple questions and the counter girl actually said could you order there is someone else behind you. So I ordered and she did not get it right and seemed offended that I canceled the order and requested a refund. I have eaten at this location before and did not have this problem. Word to the girl when you have a paying customer in front of you focus on that person the next customer will be there soon enough. I don't force anyone to take my money but if you want it give me what I want."}
{"text":"Very yummy. Good service reasonable price. Please frequent to keep these yummy places alive."}
