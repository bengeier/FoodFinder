{"text":"went there for lunch break. me and my coworker received a water that we asked for after about 20 minutes. the food took so long we asked for it to go, then had to go inside before we were going to be late getting back to work (which is less than a minute away) for us to receive our food that was boxed. we get to work and open the boxes and the food is ice cold, no sauce was included that even comes on the food let alone extra we asked for. and hair was found in the cottage cheese and side salad. if i could rate half a star i would and only half because of how close it is to my job. would not return after this terrible experience"}
{"text":"Ordered on Uber Eats tonight. It was pretty terrible. We ordered the Arizona Chicken salad and the Indiana tenderloin sandwich. Maybe it is better in person?"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write a review.  I am surprised to see that this place gets good reviews.  My experiences here have always left me regretting that I gave this place another chance.  I've lived in the neighborhood for about 5 years now.  I've been to this restaurant probably a dozen times over the years. Each time my husband and I always say the same thing.... WHY did we come here again???  Service is slow,  the bartenders are slow AND unfriendly.  I read a comment below that they seem bothered that they have to wait on you and I totally agree.  The food is very hit or miss, and from what we've had it's usually a miss.  We use to catch UFC fights, hockey, and football games there.  Now that there are more sports bar options in our neighborhood, our days of throwing money towards Half Moon are no more."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to Half Moon for Happy Hour. The Buffalo Chicken Dip is the best!  Great customer service.  Also have some great deals on Living Social.  We come here often.  Would recommend Half Moon to others."}
{"text":"Always been a good place to visit. Always a pleaser. Good for a quick drink or to hang out in the well maintained patio."}
{"text":"I have come to this establishment two times both before and after renovation. Before said renovation the bar top was sticky even after being cleaned. The tall, short blond haired male bartender became upset when I gave him a 30% tip and wrote on the credit card slip that the bar top was sticky and it wasn't up to standard. He sent a bar back out side where I was smoking on the patio to chastise me about my note.  I came back after the renovations and found the same bar tender serving me again. I had two beers(draft) and two shots of liquor as well as two appetizers .  After he admitted to over serving me, which in Arizona can result in a fine for the establishment. I subsequently left. Won't spend another dime in this establishment."}
{"text":"Food is great, but I usually go for the drinks. All is well unless you go on a Friday after work because they are never prepared for the number of customers they have, resulting in rather slow service, or if you get the male bartender. If he is \"serving\" you, you better order all your drinks for the night the first time he asks what you want. It will be the only time."}
{"text":"$10 for 10 tiny chicken wings with very little meat.  Disappointed, but seems like a nice place to watch a game."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food, drinks, and the staff here.  We used to live next door and we went several times a week.  We moved to  a different area but we still go back because it's our favorite sports bar.  Love this place!  Amazing burgers and fries.  In fact, I dont' think I've had a bad thing to eat here.  Buffalo Chicken dip is my favorite.  I wish they had better beer selections.  They only have local beers."}
{"text":"Terrible, slow bar service.  6 servers standing around. Feel sorry for the owner. Lost revenue for sure."}
{"text":"Our bartender Whitney was great, my drink was weak-more margarita mix than alcohol, my friends drink however was perfect for him (he's been here before). After Whitneyll left, I couldn't get the time of day! My empty plate sat in front of me at the bar for at least 30 min and I never could get the someone to stop so I could ask for a water. The guys next to me had their dirty plates sitting in front of them even longer!  Even the waitresses were standing with their arms crossed waiting and not smiling!! Shouldn't you be happy to have a job?!! Food was good, drinks-not so much,!servers sucked!!!"}
{"text":"I recently hosted an alumni event here and they did a wonderful job of accommodaing us! Katie, the manager, was very helpful even though it was pretty busy.  A lot of televisons makes it great to go and watch games. A very nice bar area, however, I do wish they had more beer selections. Kid friendly, too, which is key. Great place to host an event. Hoping we go there every week!"}
{"text":"I'm a sports bar fanatic....HUGE.  And by no means am I comparing my experience HERE to what's in Vegas...but....  Atmosphere is neat.  Love the tv's in the restrooms, as in, the womens restroom.  I kinda feel like I'm at ESPN Zone.  Pool table is convenient too.  Other than that, it's just another place to go.  Nothing really impressed me about this place....other than it was super easy to find.  I've been here twice and will probably go back, but only because it's convenient to where my friends live, not because I'm thrilled with the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sports bar. I love that I can relax and watch the game/fight while enjoying a cold beer and a side of boneless honey chipotle wings, which are amazing by the way. My husband and I usually bring our 4 year old daughter with us and she likes to order their grilled cheese. During the game, the waitress checks up on us every now and then to make sure we're still good on drinks, etc. Towards the end of the game/fight we like to order their cookie pie. It's a large, hot and gooey chocolate chip cookie, fresh from the oven, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and a side of chocolate sauce. It's a little piece of heaven! I like the crowd here, it's a good mix of young and...no longer young folks :) everyone is chill, which I like since my daughter is usually with us. I only knocked off a star because it does take a while for the girls to stop by our table and take our drinks. But other than that, I love this place."}
{"text":"Any of the Valley's Half Moons have better food and drinks than any other sports bar. Great place to watch UFC!"}
{"text":"Cool bar with hit or miss service. The food is above average but not having a server help you for the first ten minutes sucks. Normally a good time on Friday nights, can be expensive if you plan on staying there all night."}
{"text":"Me and my friends (3 men, 3 women) decided to try this place out for a friend's birthday. We arrived around 9 pm on a Friday night, it wasn't busy at all. We decided to sit outside on the patio because the weather was great.   That was where the problems began. The service on the patio was non existent, there were servers who addressed the regulars but didn't seem to care about our party at all. We tried to ask the waitresses to come to our table, no luck. My party was forced to go inside to obtain our drinks and put in our food orders.  We asked the bartender if they could send a server out to our table and he agreed. We never had anyone come to our table. We even had to go back into the bar to pickup our food! We were never rude or being abnoxious so I don't understand why we were ignored.  I'm sure if you're a regular this place would be great but as a first timer, I had a horrible time. On a side note, the hot wings that I ordered were good, but not good enough to make up for the horrendous service. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because everyone did like the food. As soon as we were done eating, we were outta there.   The service was bad enough to make me write this very long review....."}
{"text":"We had our 45th Camelback HS '71 Class Reunion in April here. Jeff LeClere, Manager and Chef Marlene, helped with menu choices helping us to have a great time along with fantastic food and drink for our 60 person event. Both of them were so helpful and extremely accommodating to our requests. So very happy with the way our reunion was presented by Half Moon. The alumni also mentioned how pleased they were we the chosen venue. An extra added bonus for us; we didn't have to pay for a room charge, this helped tremendously as our budget was tight when we began our planning for the reunion.   Half Moon would be a wonderful place to have a catered dinner for your family or just a gathering in a room by yourselves!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have come here several times now, and we really enjoy it. The food is superbly prepated, and the atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. The chef has a great way of blending flavors to produce a savory treat for your palate. Super friendly staff as well. Highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich, and the sunny side up burger."}
{"text":"WOW     I am happy to say that I have been going here for awhile. I like the friendly employee's.The over all time I have had there is great.Food is excellent and the owner of the bar really cares what his customers think!!The manager who worked on Saturday is very customer friendly.  GREAT PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere for sports. There are tv's at every angle, even tv's in the restroom; never miss a play. Service is still really good despite the fact this place is popping with customers. The customers are respectful of each other...as in, I don't think the place will get so rowdy that a fight would ensue. I give it a 4.5  The food is decent. They have good appetizer and drink deals. I give it a 3.  So if watching a game with a beer with the guys is your m.o. Hit this place. If food is your priority, I'd say eat here but don't expect to be blown away with flavor."}
{"text":"Seeing as how i work about 14 seconds away from this place, I'm here a few times per week.  The menu is pretty good.  Lots of TVs.  It was awesome for World Cup Soccer this summer, great for Baseball all season and packed for Football in the fall.  Great patio... nice fire pit in the fall.    The best part about the half moon is the staff...  Chelsea, Liz, Candy & Courtney behind the bar are absolutely fantastic.  The servers are all also excellent.    Thanks to the ladies at Half Moon for making this bar better than average."}
{"text":"Half  Moon is a sports bar that is very close to being a really, really, awesome place. Luckily, they have the best hot wing sauce in the universe.  Half Moon has a ton of huge TVs. The servers are hot. The food is good. There are TVs in the bathroom! It's just missing something, though. I think the problem is that it tries to pawn itself of as a sports bar but lacks some main features.  What it lacks first of all is fans. I have never seen this place very crowded. Let's see... the weekend of the ASU @ U of A game I stopped in here to watch the second half of the game. There was also an NFL game on, and the Suns were also playing. A sports bar should be packed for this, right? Nope. It had more people than usual, but was not close to packed.  What it lacks second of all is affordable drinks and draft beer selection. Everything here is just too expensive for a sports bar and I can't recall but they either completely lack draft beer or are damn close. This is the main problem. Come on. Perhaps if they fixed this problem, the crowd problem could also be fixed.  All of the above noted, what keeps me coming back? They have a great reverse happy hour. They have half off appetizers during Suns games. Probably has the best TV setup in North Phoenix other than Santisi Brothers. More importantly, they have the best wing sauce I have ever had in my life. I cannot remember what it is called, but it is their version of \"hot\". It's pretty damn spicy and has an amazing taste to it. But yes, let me repeat, this little sports bar has the best wing sauce I have ever tasted. It is that good. Try it. You can get a pound of wings for $4.50 during the next Suns game and I can assure you that it will not be crowded.  Half Moon gets four stars due to the amazing wings. Otherwise it would get three."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good bar food, reasonably prices drinks. Ladies, be warned: if you have a vagina, the female servers are going to be total assholes to you. It's so blatantly obvious, it's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Meh!! Maybe cool for beers and games but food is very average.  Servers lacked a genuine desire to help as well.  Seemed forced into having to do their jobs.  Stopped in because staying at nearby hotel, so perhaps they sensed the out of towner and simply could care less if I enjoyed my experience there since I won't be returning anyway."}
{"text":"I like the location and the lay out of the place.  They have a free shuttle that will pick you up and drop you off. The beer is good and some of there food is ok.  I had great service on a thursday night and a good salad But i did not like my hamburger at all.   The outdoor seating area is roomy and big. Which is grat since phx has great weather for outdoor dinng.  Happy hr is 10pm-close. I went there at 8 and stayed till midnight it was a good night."}
{"text":"This upscale Biltmore bar invested six figures on televisions in the bar. The drinks and food are pricey - but you're in the middle of the Biltmore. Whaddaya expect.   The waitstaff is attractive...no...fuckin hot is a better description.  The place is pretty crowded for happy hour and during lunch but it's a great place to catch a game.   They have three private rooms that are first come first served. These rooms are set up just like your house - you know with your leather couches and huge flatscreen TVs and the hot chic giving you beers."}
{"text":"my usual hang out. Great food great atmosphere. Beautiful women serving you what more do I need to say"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for happy hour. Great specials, $3 domestics that go perfectly with the beer sauce fondue and pretzels! Really friendly staff and fun atmosphere.. Great place for meeting up with friends after work"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I went for my first time after not going for at least 5 years. Boy, have we been missing out!! We went on a Saturday afternoon to watch the playoff game and we were impressed! We ended up having several waitresses/waiters because of shift changes but loved everyone of them!! I couldn't believe the amount of tv's..and I was worried we wouldn't get a good seat! They have a pool table on the patio, shuffleboard and really clean restrooms. There is not much more I could ask for. Their happy hour during football is awesome. We didn't try any of the food, but drinks were good and service amazing. I cannot wait to go back!! And can't wait until next football season!"}
{"text":"One of the best sports grills around with LOTS OF TVs and even private rooms. The food and drinks aren't half bad either--they're Greeeaaat!! We can always count on getting to watch venues not available at home. Really looking forward to my Starbucks certificate!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Andrea is an amazing waitress. Very friendly, upbeat, and suggested the Chile Verde tacos. Surely didn't disappooint. If you try anything here try the tacos and fries. When the owner first took over I was disappointed with the new change but he sure did bring back great food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We go here to watch the Florida State games. They are very accommodating for our group and the drink specials are great on game days. They have goose island here on tap-which is my preferred draft. You can catch most games here and UFC fights. The restaurant is clean, modern and family friendly. There are multiple areas to sit, including a spacious patio. The staff is very friendly for the most part. Bathrooms are interesting.. there was a cardio hip-hop video playing in the women's restroom the last time I went, but it was clean.    The food is okay, grades below:   B buffalo wing dip - very filling and large portion, waiter/waitress will refill chips B + Buffalo wings - boneless, tasty, medium was not as spicy as I would like but they give you the hotter sauce on the side if you want it B - Pretzel Fondue - the pretzel is really good, but the cheese sauce is a little too thin for me and lacking some flavor, might try adding a more fragrant cheese  Our friends had the thin crust pizza and that looked pretty good. I think they would give it an A."}
{"text":"Best Place to watch UFC for free. Best place to watch regular season games due to the many Tv's. if its on TV they got it .Best place for 2 and 3 dollar beers. Appetizers are always half off. You can even request games on the Tv' near you. Ive been coming here for 4 years and love it.  Anyone that doesn't like this place is a moron or a snob plain and simple."}
{"text":"Nice local sports bar. You can always count on them for watching any good games. Kid friendly section too. Shuffleboard pool and darts. Daily food and drink specials."}
{"text":"Not fine dining but really good bar food. Sports bar with patio pool table. Sweet attentive waitresses/ bartenders. The hot wings are fabulous - not breaded.  Sauce has heat but doesn't over power (if you like it hot) and is quite tasty So good I had to get a second order.  Prime rib sliders are good. Angus burger too. Nice crowd. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with friends for the ufc ppv and before it was always packed and the service and drinks were great. Now a few months later I came here and the place has completely gone downhill. The food has changed and I ordered a margherita and I got some fruity drink that has a rotten lime in it. New management or something ruined it. Never again will I come here."}
{"text":"Had a decent burger and nachos.  Nice atmosphere and helpful staff"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place, the people are horrible! Fights happen in the outside patio, can't enjoy our selfs"}
{"text":"guys wearing sports jerseys, beaters, and baseball caps on backwards yelling \"YEEEAH!\", etc.... oh Lord, save me... WHAT was I thinking allowing the hubby to talk me into lunch here on a lovely summer afternoon??? OK,OK, I admit I found my self thinking that my reaction was a bit snobby (maybe it's my age....?) but yuck, who wants to yell over the televisions to talk to the person next to you?? I'm tellin' ya, they are loud.   Food-wise, I should have stuck to typical bar food and maybe I would have had better luck, because the big pretzel was tasty; traditional chewy with coarse salt. The salad with tri-tips was a dissappointment...actually the salad part was fine - fresh romaine and avocado, but the tri-tip was dry and tough and the balsamic dressing on the side was an overly-sweet, gelatinous blob (truly weird). As the hubby pointed out, what was I thinking ordering salad at a sports bar??   If you are really looking to watch TV sports and drink beer... I guess this place would be fine. For LUNCH...waaaay better choices out here."}
{"text":"I too was there celebrating my win on Saturday night and what an awful experience. Basically the whole time we were there it was a bother to management and the servers. Hmmm, let me get this straight. A bunch of young, happy, athletes who just won a game trying to spend money at a bar....... Sounds like a terrible idea if I worked there. Each and every server/ bartender working that night should have gone home with a ton of tips in there pockets but I doubt that happened. You people should be ashamed of yourselves."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks!! I showed up based on an advertisement announced at the AZ Rattlers playoff game. Read that last sentence again. Not only did they did not honor that deal, but they didn't even offer a compromise. I'm sure I am 1 of only 1,000 people who will potentially show up tonight based on that advertisement, which we drove 20 minutes from.   I forgot to mention, the advertisement was 6 wings WITH the purchase of a beer. This \"manager\" needs a clue. We drove 20 minutes, of course we were spending money beyond the first round. NOT to mention it was bone dry empty... You don't have to wonder why. Get a clue or close the doors."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my South American wife, had tacos for taco Tuesday which the young gal Mary suggested. She also suggested that we start out with their award winning wings but we decided to start out with some New Belgium Voodoo Rangers along with the free Queso since we signed up for their no hassle rewards program POSiq. It was so easy! This is the best place ever. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. I love the flat breads and the Ahi sliders. We live in the area and go here often with our 2 kids.  We only go on the weekdays because weekends are a tad too busy to bring kids. I do love that kids eat free in the evening - that's a bonus!   Of the 30 times I'm been here, I think we've only had one bad experience.  A few months ago, we had a large table of 12 and our waiter kind of forgot about us, we had 5 kids with us and needed to get in and out.  Food arrived and the kids mac and cheese was prepared spicy in error. I asked if they could remake it cuz its for my 2 year old. He looked at me like I was crazy ridiculous.   But eventually left the spicy version and came back with normal mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Service was a bit lacking...took 20 minutes before I had a beer in my hand...and even though it was a game night it was not busy from what was expected!  Waitress even had someone walk out on her, which does not suprise me, honestly.  But at least the wings were awesome,  the chili dog was alright enough,  and did I mention the wings were extra awesome!  Grilled is the way to go,  people! Medium flavor gelled...tasty chat flavor that I really loved tonight!"}
{"text":"A great place for UFC fights and above average bar wings.  But dont show up early for the gifht if its a Tennessee game day.  Those fans are not too appreciative of anyone not wearing orange and dont understand that nobody cares to watch their team when decent sports are on other stations."}
{"text":"We went here with high hopes looking for some bar food. While the staff were very friendly and helpful, the food was absolutely terrible. The Mozzarella sticks were cold and rock hard, and the marinara sauce was something right out of the freezer. Chicken tenders were very dry and left much to be desired. Stayy away from the ranch dressing, as it was very watered down.   Can't say anything about the bar itself, but my fiance and I will probably never come back here when craving bar food."}
{"text":"Wow... Let down, the food was great, best burgers ever....Not anymore!!! Thinner than In & Out Burger. The waitresses are awesome but the food took a turn for the worse with their recent remodel... What were the owners thinking? How do you fix something that is great? You don't you leave it alone!!! Too bad, so sad... Won't be going back, was in there on Saturday night and very few people there...  Now I know why."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here.  First 2 times were awesome. Great waitress, great manager, just the whole staff was amazing.  TONIGHT- not the same at all. Awful waitress!!  More concerned with talking with other wait staff.  Forgot us. We asked for water, she went to get it and within a moment started talking with other waitresses, then turned around after at least 5 minutes, and looked at us, and you know the look she had.  Then came over to check on us finally after I think a long smoke break.  We had to ask for a check.    We go out to eat a lot and my daughter is a waitress,  so I tip very well. Tonight I tipped her but not like I usually do.  If fact I didn't want to tip her. And I never feel like that.  Our table was right in front of her the whole time, and it wasn't crowded.  I have thought of everything that could of cause her being a bad waitress.  But I can't come up with anything.  We are the easiest people to please.  All we like is friendly attentive attention.    I don't think I will be going back for a while.   My first time was 3 weeks ago and 2nd time a week ago and now tonight."}
{"text":"Drea, the bartender is the best, most attentive bartender I've ever had. I know this place gets a lot of negative reviews, but between the bartenders Shelby and Drea, I just don't understand why. They are such sweet ladies with wonderful hospitality. I have never had a bad experience here and I will never tell someone to not come here."}
{"text":"FREE UFC. Above average bar food. Speedy service. Ideal layout for starring endlessly at favorite sporting event on TV."}
{"text":"Great place to relax. Near the gym where I work out. I like the Buzztime Trivia and I am a regular customer. The service is friendly and they have some good specials   Unfortunately  i like my wings and like them grilled as they taste better and are much healthier   Recently new kitchen management made a decision they will no longer grill the wings even when they are not busy  This is a real minor point but demonstrates to me their lack of consideration to their customers health and flexibility   I will continue to be a guest here but when I want my grilled wings I will go to Ammacapanes"}
{"text":"Food is great and the service is even better. We wanted to watch a game during the NCAA basketball tournament but another game was on with the overall sound. To accommodate us, they put us in a semi-separate room with the sound of our game. The wait staff is is very friendly and attentive. If you want a good place to watch the game, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"So this is mine and my bfs go to bar for UFC fights and sporting events. The service has always been decent if not GREAT.   The amount of TVs and the set up gives this place the potential to be one of the top sports bar in the Biltmore area if..... the food and beer selection kicked it up a few notches. I was going to give this bar more than 3 stars but after reviewing why other yelpers gave Half Moon a low star rating it reminded me of my first here and why I was disappointed in this place. I guess over time I have adjusted my view since it is the only bar I know of who shows the UFC fights in the area.   I can say over the past 3 years the food has improved some, but the establishment could really beef up the number of beers they have on tap"}
{"text":"I was flying into town and needed to catch a place to watch the Bears game. A quick search brought this place, which is less than 20 minutes from the airport.   Started with some Chi-fries from the menu. Great taste; great starter.   I chased it with the Godfather Angus burger. If you're doing Chi-fries I'd recommend switching the fries that comes with the burger to a side salad or comparable. I requested the burger well done. It had a nice, smoky taste to it, which went really well with the Italian beef and peppers.   Highly recommend. If I'm ever back in this area, I would certainly keep this on the list."}
{"text":"Went here for the Suns game - plenty of TV's. Food was okay and it was 1/2 off burgers and wings on the weekends. $5.40 for a burger and fries is definitely a plus. $3 Tecate is okay too, especialy when you want to support a mexican beer at an american bar.  Anyhow, I would check it out for a weekend game if I were you."}
{"text":"Our office just recently reserved a room at the Half Moon Sports Grill for a going away party for one of our co-workers.  We reserved the room during their happy hour (4-7 pm).  The service was fantastic, and all of the staff there were very prompt and courteous.  Candie Lee (the General Manager) was extremely helpful in setting up the room for our group, and our server Bree did an outstanding job as our server.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone looking to reserve a room at a place near the Biltmore area to make a reservation at the Half Moon Sports Grill for any type of event.  They have great happy hour prices on drinks, their food is terrific, and all of their staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but it isn't happening.  I've been several times and I just never feel welcome.  It's not that I've got bad service or anything like that, I just think it's not my crowd (whatever that means).  For example, I was there by myself (hey! I just moved here and don't know anyone so stop judging!) and some guy asked me to move so his recent arrival of a girlfriend could sit next to him.  That's normally fine except that it required me to sit behind a post which blocked views of all TVs.  I was about done so left.  And that reminds me, the bar is a square, but you can only see TVs on 2 of the 4 sides.  In other words there are a lot of seats with views of nothing.  Nothing wrong with the place - I could see it being 5 stars for the right person, just not me......."}
{"text":"Once again the food and service was great. The best wings I have found in Phoenix by far. Definitely going to be my weekly neighborhood grill/bar."}
{"text":"Good food. Service is sometimes not great but normaly ok.  Go on the weekends, for the half price burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"Go to Halfmoon all the time... Really friendly environment.... Good food... Good people.... AlwAys my first choice to go especially when Alexandra and Shara are working..... Excellent service..."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad night here and I always enjoy watching the sports I love! The wings are good but they are small in my opinion but you can't beat the Burgers here ! Especially when they are half priced on the weekends ! Happy Hour is always good here and so is the atmosphere . I always take friends here when they need to get out and relax for a bit ."}
{"text":"Take warning! Do NOT go here for sporting events, especially football! I gave 1 star bc the wait staff was ok. They did not make the home town team thr priority game. I was tucked in a corner for Cardinals game watching a tv with no HD. I ended up leaving after the first quarter... Better off at home... Or ANY other sports bar in town! In all fairness, I cannot speak to the quality of food or atmosphere when it isn't a game day."}
{"text":"You gotta love a good sports bar, and Half Moon is a pretty good one. They have tons of tv's, decent food and a pretty good beer selection. If I were only going there for that, I'd rate it a star higher, but we meet at Half Moon on occasion to geek out and use the free wifi. Unfortunately the last time the wifi was spotty and almost non-existent. I kept getting dropped making it difficult to accomplish what I'd met there to accomplish. We gave up and left after a while, but I was disappointed. Might have to stick to just sports for this bar."}
{"text":"Best BBQ cheddar hamburger ever!!  Huge monster Long Island !  The burger was the best, the guy in the kitchen with the beard my my day seriously!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered from Half Moon on Ubereats and it was really good. However, the portions were ridiculous! The food was delivered to us in containers that looked like they were already half eaten. There were about 10 fries in the container and it was a little ridiculous for the amount we paid. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great waitstaff that goes over and above. The food is much better than your typical bar food, with great selections and good value. Awesome happy hour prices and great drink selection. We really enjoy spending time here with friends and neighbors. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"A large group of us, 20 to 25 + people showed up a few nights ago.   Half Moon is surprisingly large. As another poster said there are hidden rooms and lounge areas off nearly every dining area. Fortunately it's easy enough to find your way around. Lighting was dim. Music was a little loud though; I don't think the sound on the TVs were even on. Even when people were in there for the game (which was that evening) it wasn't overly noisy. It was though hard to hear one another in our room which surprised me as our room separated us from the rest of the restaurant.  They have a good beer selection and beer-food. I had a simple appetizer, the burgers my friends had smelled delicious (bbq sauce, cheese and bacon, yum!) and the wings looked decent enough but a lot of the food seemed over priced to me. $4.50 for edamame in a bowl similar in size to a Like It from Cold Stone....  Also, while their bathrooms were great looking (very clean which is always nice) I was extremely surprised that none of the stalls had a hook for a purse of a jacket. I'm glad I left my purse at my table, I'm not a fan of sitting it on a public bathroom floor but I had to throw my jacket over the stalls door and while that doesn't bother me greatly, I'd much rather have it hanging in my stall.  I've been to better sports grills (Goldies, Fox, Zipps) but I've been to worse."}
{"text":"VERYYYYYY slowwww...if you are in no hurry this is worth a shot.  Good food and decent music."}
{"text":"Me and my group of six friends originally came into Half Moon just to try it out. We were searching for a new bar to watch the UFC events. Our server, Rikki, was amazing. Straight up rockstar. She was fast, always checked on us, got all of our orders right and extremely friendly (Even though we can be quite the hassle to deal with) One big thing with a couple in my group is they don't like having to wait for their drinks to be refilled so getting Rikki worked out perfectly. We enjoyed our experience so much we decided that we would continue to bring our service to Half Moon.   I went there for dinner one night and I had a misunderstanding about where I could sit to get service from Rikki. The Manager, Ashley, came out to talk to me. She squared everything away immediately, she made sure everything was ok and all concerns were met. I can't ever remember being wowed by the management from a sports bar before! She was extremely professional about the whole thing and I appreciated that a lot. It really felt like she would bend over backwards to keep everyone having a good time (Customers and employees alike) without sacrificing the integrity of Half Moon. We went back for lunch later on in the weekend and Ashley remembered us and even came to see how we were doing. And as always, Rikki did awesome, and the food was great AGAIN.  We've only just begun going to Half Moon but so far I'm really enjoying my experiences! The service is great, the Managers exceed expectations, the food is great, the beer is cold and THE TVs! Oh man I can't even begin to go on about how awesome it is to have the private rooms on the sides, and even in the common area you can have sounds from multiple fights/games going on at once!  I'd definitely recommend Half Moon. I see some shaky reviews being posted from the past, but I wouldn't give up on this place. The more recent ones seem to have enjoyed it and my friends and I have had 3 top notch experiences in a row. I dunno, maybe they took the earlier feedback to heart :)  Thanks for the experience Half Moon!"}
{"text":"Ordered spinach artichoke dip, and to be honest it was by far the worse dip I've ever had. The dip came out looking like mashed potatoes. Note the menu did say \"creamy\" spinach dip. Then after taste of sour milk topped it off.   Our waitress was probably the slowest waitress in american history."}
{"text":"Love 1/2 Moon on Greenway! This is our favorite sports bar. We are there every Friday and during special sporting events. Food is awesome and so is the staff!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  Run of the mill bar food.  The thing that I wasn't thrilled with was that the menus were sticky the floor dirty and the tables had crumbs on them.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen is like"}
{"text":"Food is decent sports bar food.  Dissappointing is the staff.  They appear to not want to be there.  Not friendly or smiling.  Usually grouped together chatting.  I like neighborhood sports bars to be that, neighborhood feel.  Also dissappointing were the draft beer choices, only 3.  They have a wide variety of beers but in cans and bottles.  I've been to half moon about five times now, same experience."}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a lunch during the work week or catch some college football action on Saturdays in the fall. They usually run sandwich/burger specials which make Half Moon a fine value. I enjoy the prime rib sliders."}
{"text":"Half Moon is a good place to go grab a burger and brews either solo or with a group of guys. I enjoy watching sports on their big screen TV'S strewn throughout the restaurant and bar area. They usually have decent specials during local teams games like the Cards or Suns."}
{"text":"Food was good, had the pretzel fondue, wings, sliders & burger,  but you better have allot of time because the service is SLOW to almost stagnant, it was not even that busy... Won't be going back for some time."}
{"text":"Great place for fun,food,drink and entertainment and the prices are reasonable. They provide a free shuttle service. Lots of TV's for all games even on Sunday NFL. Outside fire pit  when chilly outside with misters when it's hot. This is a sports bar not a fancy restaurant but the food is good and they always have specials on food and drink plus a reverse happy hour.Management keeps this place clean and neat with great help from staff and servers."}
{"text":"Just watched PART of the World Series Game.  Food was definately down hill from a year ago.  Beer was not cold and staff mentioned that changes were made to make the restaurant more profitable.  BUT, we the customers suffer... bad business plan.  Went to a competitor just north at the  Colonnade  and was blown away fridgid beer, great food and better prices.  My half moon chicken sandwich tasted like microwave frozen unseasoned garbage.  Then to top it off the order of fries was cold, small and probably out of the freezer as well.   I WAS A FAN, BUT NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come  here pretty much every Friday night after work  now we always make sure we either sit at the bar or any waitress but the bleach blonde dummy. We were sat in her section 2 different times and the service was horrible, she kept making excuse after excuse.People  in her section were standing up trying to get her attention as she was not focused and always texting in the back by the waitress stand. We waited forever for drinks, water and just an appetizer, never even got to order dinner as it took an hour to even get her to come back.The sad thing is we love the environment other staff is  so friendly and the wings are absolutely amazing. We had not been back since the last horrible experience. We just went there on Friday and had way better service and our waitress was great food out fast and on top of drinks and water.:)"}
{"text":"So I have been here several times and have yet to be disappointed. For a sports bar the food is really  good...and the service has always been great. My sister and I like this place because it is about a mile away from her house, and I think we will keep coming here to watch all of our favorite games!"}
{"text":"I will give two stars,  one for a well priced happy hour and a lot of TV's. The other for the food being pretty good. Everything else about this place is below mediocre , the service is slow. I went in last week and was one of 5 people at the bar and the bar tenders were still  more caught up in engaging in conversation with one another than taking my drink order. Then the refill process took twice as long, finally I asked for my bill because after multiple poor experiences I was done. It took 15 minutes to get my bill. What a joke."}
{"text":"This place is ok at best...my husband and I went to meet friends for a drink one night and sat on the patio. It wasn't very busy for a Thursday night. Our server was nice enough, but soooo slow! I told my husband to order me a beer when i went to use the restroom and when I came back she still hadn't come by. I then went to the bar to order a beer and the bartenders didn't even acknowledge me, so it took me a half hour to get a miller lite bottle from the server.They didn't have a good selection of draft beer at all, weird for a place that calls itself a sports bar. My friends like this place so we'll try it again I'm sure. I've heard the food is pretty good so I'll have to go back and try it. Hopefully the service will pick up next time."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Food but came in for Dinner today, unfortunately the app and burger were poor. Buffalo chicken Dip- Bland! Burger- no seasoning with guacamole that tasted like \"nothing.\" Love the drinks and servers."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the service and food at Half Moon. When I have friends visiting from out of state I always make a stop there for some good eats, music and neat stuff on TV. I generally avoid the busy sports nights as it can get very noisy but for a sports bar, it's amazing!  Make sure to check out their monthly specials. Sometimes they have half off burgers and appetizers all month!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in one night after work. Was immediately greeted by Sally and Alex behind the bar. Great drinks and quick friendly service from two beautiful ladies. What more could you ask for? Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"In the end I do still enjoy this bar. The atmosphere is usually very friendly, and the staff is friendly as well, and they're food is good. A little sad they started charging cover for the UFC fights, but I can understand their need to cover costs - though I certainly hope the front door personnel are better the next time around.  Oh, and I do wish they'd go back to the old happy hour time slots..."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! Seriously. Get it together, Half Moon. It's too bad because the food is decent. Waitresses have no idea what is going on. Asked for a manager and no one knew who it was. It's complete chaos."}
{"text":"Was here w/2 friends on Saturday 9/20 (at about 6pm), then again this past weekend. The visit on 9/20 was -really- good, mostly because of our server, and the food (prime rib sliders w/cheese, the buffalo chicken dip, and a burger-entree). Our server on 9/20 was very attentive, and helpful w/menu suggestions.   Unfortunately, when my two friends and I visited on Saturday 9/25 (at 4:30pm), we had a -very- different experience. The place wasn't -that- busy, but our service took FOREVER (first water, then another 15-20min. to order drinks, then another 20min. to receive said drinks; the worst part came with paying the bill - the process of receiving the check, getting the check picked-up, and returned with receipts - 45min.). I asked the hostess as we left, she informed me a server had walked out, and our server had been working there 'only 4-weeks'.   Completely understand that when staff walk, it creates a ripple effect, and also understand that new servers can be clunky in their delivery . . . but 4-weeks is PLENTY of time to learn to ask for help from others (at the very least other servers should have helped her).   We -may- be back (but only because it's a convenient location for my friends)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Bartenders are great. They always have events like UFC and other sports on. Great place to go for those weekday nights. Actually, those are my favorite times. A great vibe in non peak hours."}
{"text":"It's ok. I go here now and again because it's close by. Good happy hour drink prices.  Fish tacos are good. Yesterday I felt very rushed by the waitress. She was eager to take plates before we were done and brought the check when we were thinking of ordering another round of drinks. I'll go back but will speak up if that happens again"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good sports bar, but it's clientele seems to be only the happy hour employees from area businesses and business travelers. The food here is ok, but nothing special. The wings are the only food that gives you \"bang for your buck.\" The happy hour is good... but they only have 8 beers on tap. I only go here because it's walking distance from my home. It's a good happy hour place for a group of 4 or less, but any more and you may be waiting to get a table. And the service is ok, but not particularly fast."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst service I have experienced in my life. We had to personally walk to the bar to pay and order drinks. The waitress checked in on our table once and forgot our orders multiple times. Service is outright HORRIBLE here. The table next to us was smoking while we were eating and their huge dog was running around outside. If I could give it 0/5 stars I would. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Food is always on point and Alex is the best bartender. The ribs are fall off the bone delicious and if you haven't tried the chicken tacos yet you should! They always have great drink specials too."}
{"text":"This is our local, go to spot. Great drinks, food and service. Seriously, their fries are bomb and their prime rib sliders are pretty good for a sports grill! My favorite waitress is Jennifer (I am pretty sure that is her name! (we share our love for cats and Jagermeister)  The bartenders have great beards and personalities so that's a plus.   Price wise, I'd say they're fairly reasonable. I indulge in their moon valley trashcan (don't judge me, it's like $7, huge and gets you smashed.) Its basically an AMF with redbull. SO. MUCH. LIQUID. GOODNESS. :)   I have yet to try their wings, but it's definitely going down on my next visit."}
{"text":"None. Not a one and yet I have to to be able to post a review... Type in \"Best Bars to watch PPV Boxing in Phoenix\" and this place is in the top three through Yelp. Just called to make plans to try their place this coming Saturday for the Sergey Kovalev vs. Andre Ward for the unified WBA, IBF and WBO light heavyweight world championship. The young lady who answered did not know what I was talking about. No biggie. She put me on hold to ask a manager. Came back and said, \"No, we are not.\" Absolutely stunned silence. This will likely be the biggest fight of the year, if not the past two. And if you look at ALL of the pics through what was once Google Places...Plus... and whatever it's called now, along with the dozens on Yelp, the owner is CONSTANTLY touting his place as something special. I would agree: special in a Bizarro Superman context meaning \"awful.\""}
{"text":"I've been to my share of sports bars and usually both the food and service is hit and miss.  I've been to Half Moon several times now and have never had a bad experience.  Saturdays are especially busy in the fall due to football, and I never have to wait to get my water filled and the food is out quickly.  Talking about food....I'm trying to lose some 'holiday pounds' and have been impressed with how good their chicken caesar is.  It comes out with flavored, crispy bread which really makes it delicious.  Keep up the great work everyone at Half Moon!!!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this to be my local bar...But the big bearded guy refused service because of my shirt but mostly because I asked for my usual female waitress.    Ok place to eat but we had rude male servers with very long beards on two different occasions.    Mike."}
{"text":"Looking for our Cheers.  I live in the area and wanted to check this place out for some time now. I've been looking for a comfortable place to hang out for a couple, three happy hours a week and maybe a weekend meal.  My girlfriend and I dropped in on a playoff football Sunday about 2 pm. First thing we noticed when we walk in the door is the hostess is very cute and the place is loud. I mean really loud. Not with your normal every day sports bar chatter but the game audio coming from the ceiling mounted speakers was deafening. The hostess asked if we wanted a high-top table and that is usually our preference though the one she suggested was positioned directly under a speaker. I quickly surveyed the speaker system and chose a table slightly off center of a speaker, though unfortunately I soon came to realize it was right near the patio door access to the outside smoking area. The door was used often and some smoke did seep in but for the most part the smoke stank that clinged to the patrons was even worse.  I was in clear sight of about 10 flat screens which was nice but they all showed non-local Washington v. Seattle playoff football. Is this the only sports on Sunday afternoon? I would rather have watched bowling. The worst wasn't so much the really loud football broadcast but every ten minutes came on a just as loud, ridiculous commercial for some pharmaceutical remedy. I've never been more annoyed by the noise in a sports bar.   I would have enjoyed viewing some sport in peace and according to the server this volume level is common at night and on weekends. The volume of crap gets this bar strike one as far I'm concerned; who needs to tolerate blasting cialis ads to know what's going on in a football game?  Strike two was just as bad. I thought the fact that they supported local breweries was an attractive option. I like the San tan hefe and was looking forward to trying the Phoenix ale frenzy hefe on tap. After I ordered it the server came back saying they were out. She offered just about anything in a can or bottle as a substitute. I'm at a loss here...how does a bar run out of beer? It's akin to a gas station running out of gas - it only happens during a disaster. And if I wanted something canned or bottled I could have consumed it at home for a fifth the price. I wound up having a draft coors light which reminded me why I don't like it...too much carbonation.   Two strikes and we're thinking we should just bolt to a more comfortable known locale like the close by Fridays where I could get a big frosty mug of blue moon. But with our three strike rule we decided to be fair and give them the chance to hang themselves.   My gal ordered sliders and sweet potato fries while I ordered a Swiss burger medium with regular fries. It seemed to take more time to come out than it should given the about one-third to half full patronage or maybe my perception of time was skewed due to the ambient attack on my senses but when it finally did arrive I wound up with a bacon burger, no cheese. If I hated bacon this would have been strike three because I know if I sent it back they would simply peel off the bacon, slap on a piece of cheese and call it good. I chose to keep the bacon burger as long as I wasn't charged for the bacon.   Honestly, the taste of the food was the only redeeming quality of this establishment on this visit and saved them from a third strike. My girlfriend says excellent, fresh tasting sliders and some of the best sweet potato fries she's had. My burger was cooked to order and fresh, not frozen as well. My shoe string fries were seasoned and had a little zip, much better than the bland fries you might be used to seeing as bar food. I like the fact that our food came on a plate as opposed to in a basket, especially for the price.  $35 out the door with the only alcohol being a $3 domestic draft is a bit pricey and given the other negatives this isn't our Cheers and we won't be going back any time soon. But the food was good so we won't discount this place completely and if and when we choose to return we'll make sure to check out the atmosphere and beer gauge before committing butt to seat."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, not really busy less than 10 tables but waited 45 minutes to get my food and when my order of wings came they were cold. The manager came, apologized an made everything right. That is why I am writing this review, now a days not many managers take fault for their staffs actions and Nate did. Come and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos and best service! We love half moon!"}
{"text":"Out of all the places to eat, my son chose this place for his bday dinner (he wanted to watch some of the Cardinals game this past Thursday).  For the record, we are long time customers. We've eaten here dozens of times.   We arrived around 530PM and were seated almost immediately.  Here is where the experience went to hell in a hand basket.   Waitress made her appearance 15 min after we sat down.   It took another 15 min to get our drinks and get our order in. We were a party of 4, in case you're wondering.  The food finally arrived at 6:45 and we haven't seen our waitress since the order was placed. The food was wrong, and the waitress is still MIA. The hostess helped us more than the waitress ever did. I requested to speak with a manager two separate times and he never came by.  The hostess continues to run around doing the waitresses job.  She was amazing.  She attempted to make excuses for the manager, short staffed etc. I didn't care, you have a manager to deal with these issues and when they don't, why have them?  We were finally eating, but by the time my daughters order was corrected it was 7:30PM. 2 hours after we arrived!  Now, they were busy but never busy enough to excuse the lack of care and service. From the top down. If the manager didn't give a rats ass about what we had to say, I certainly wouldn't expect the waitress to.  Now, it was busy but new patrons arriving were also seated quickly. So it wasn't that busy.   Needles to say, we finally paid our check at 7:57PM, per my CC slip.  My kids bed time is 8:30PM, so as you can imagine that didn't help. As for the tip, the waitress didn't deserve one. I told my wife to write \"not earned\" - but I know she didn't. On my way out, the hostess received the 20% gratuity, because she took care of us best as she could.  For the record, I have never not left a tip. But this experience put me over the edge.   My opinion for a solution: Cardinals were playing the Niners, and you're managing a sports bar - no brainer right?   The manager MUST ensure he/she has adequate staffing to deal with the event. If there were call offs, call people in to help you. You can't allow the bad service to continue. I know we were not the only customers voicing our displeasure. You should have heard the folks next to us.  In this business you want to retain customers-and this isn't the way to do it.  Unfortunately, you must Terminate the on duty manager!  He/she should have never allowed it to get this bad.  My primary reason for being so harsh, a customer requested to speak with the manger - twice!  The manager rejected the request! As for the waitress, she's a product of her leadership.  Leadership that has completely failed her.   Happy bday to my son!  Too bad it included this experience."}
{"text":"Hooray! A sports bar & grill with a decent menu. Can we all get a woop-woop for the tasty ahi sliders? Service is solid--attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable. And the patio, while it looks onto a road, is comfortable and never crowded for lunch. Definitely a go-to spot when you want a solid meal and aren't willing to risk trying a new eatery."}
{"text":"This place needs to be demolished!  The inside smells like an old rotting keg of beer and the service was \"eh\" at best.  I ordered the special sandwich and got a fried hunk of who knows what.  Definitely won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Kind a mixed review. Went in for a quick bite after arriving in town. While the food was VERY good the service was TERRIBLY slow. In addition, ordered one of my favorite IPA's and it tasted like it had been on tap for 6 months. Definitely not fresh. Ordered a different and it tasted fine. But, based on the service alone I'm not sure I'd return with all of the other options nearby."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Never coming back here again.  They can't handle a crowd.  Took 10 min to get a draft beer like cmon it takes TEN seconds to pour a beer and you make me wait that long?!  Then I guess 2 girls were trying to clean the bathroom or something and they literally walked in on my boyfriend going to the bathroom in a stall!  Who does that?!  SMH."}
{"text":"Used my Local Dines coupon today at the Half Moon and I must say the food and service was top notch.  I had my fears due to all the reviews knocking the service as slow!  We found just the opposite to be true!!  Service was both timely and attentive.  Waitress stopped by our table throughout our dining experience, couldn't ask for more.  Ordered a large order of bone in wings along with meatball sliders.  The wife had a small house salad and a small order of boneless wings.  Wings were excellent and cooked to perfection.  Meatball sliders were tasty with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce and were a real surprise, very tasty.   We've added the Half Moon to our sports bar list of go to places.  Hope you give it a try."}
{"text":"In the words of a Jo Dee Messina song, \"You and me, we had a pretty good thing...I'M DONE!\"  Been going here since it opened, with it's ups and downs, but after three bad visits in a row stayed away for months.  Decided to give them one...more...try last night and will never go back again.   It looks like they completely changed the menu and got rid of most of the good things, leaving some really weird sandwiches.  First off, I can't figure out how this place makes regular Grey Goose vodka taste like green apple.   Oh well, that will remain their secret.  My husband ordered a Bleu Cheese Burger and I ordered the Philly Sandwich.  After quite a long wait, he received a BBQ Burger, so I was nearly done when he got the correct order.  All I can tell you about my Philly was it tasted like soggy bread and provolone.   Since I didn't like my vodka/green apple drink, I ordered something else and received the wrong drink.  So I asked our waitress (Sammi or Tammi?)  if she was new and she said \"well...kind of.\"   So zero tip and out the door and I'm sure she's still wondering what the heck she did wrong.   I'm sure glad this wasn't a $5 cover charge night I'm reading here for the first time.  What a joke!"}
{"text":"The bartenders and servers are excellent.  They are friendly and outgoing.  The atmosphere is great, especially on game day.  There are plenty of TV's for viewing.  The food, on the other hand ...  It use to be great until management changed their menu to reflect Chicago style food.  If this is Chicago style then I would not want to eat Chicago style food.    Fortunately, I have had Chicago style food and Half Moon Bay's food is not representative of it at all.  It's like everything is from the freezer and they simply put it in the microwave or quickly fry it up.  The food does not taste fresh at all.  It is very unappealing.  It's a great place to hang and have a beer (great beers on tap).  However, even my friends don't want to meet me here because the food is so terrible.  I have been to this bar numerous times over the last year, and I have sample most of their menu.  There are few bright spots, but in general, I just can't recommend their kitchen.  I'll be back for the great service and selection of great beers.  I hope management can do something about their atrocious food."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I have been here over 7 times with my husband and we try something new each time and everything is delicious. The service is great each time and the food comes quickly. If you want to catch a game, this place has televisions and everywhere so you don't have to miss any game. It does get busy on big game days or fight nights so reserve a table. If you come here and you won't regret it and you'll turn into a regular."}
{"text":"Success!  A great place for beer & wings. This place is pristine & cool. Not a dive bar look at all.  All of the TVs are in easy view & the staff was great (Ainsley was charming). On to the wings. One gripe. They sell by the pound. Roughly 10 wings so why not go with it. Oh well. They had a 55 cent special so I filled up. Had the teriyaki, honey chipotle & medium. All were crisp, good size & well flavored. Because I'm so health conscious I got grilled veggies instead of fries, adding years to my life. Plenty of beers on tap in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service and food were horrible had cheese sticks with no cheese in them wings were cold I would rather go to a fast food restaurant then go to this place not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Two words: buddy pack. Four beers, two pounds of wings $20. Instant regulars upon this discovery!"}
{"text":"After waiting over an hour to be seated we went to the hostess and the had crossed us off their list and said they tried to contact me. No apology or anything. Said if I wanted to put my name back on the list I could but would need to wait.  Worthless staff and over priced food.  Hostess doesn't understand her job is customer service.   I would spend money else where."}
{"text":"Service needs help, not as attentive as should be or intuitive with urgency/timing. Pretzel bun is wayyyy too thick and bread-y in my opinion, not a good ratio to the rest of the burger. Also, I'm all for a short skirt but not everyone should be rocking that... Just saying  Wings are great though!"}
{"text":"The long islands are strong, and a great deal during happy hour. This place is just your typical sports bar with typical pub food. It's a little fancier, I'd say, compared to other sports places, but still casual. Waitresses in tiny outfits serve you beer and food, and pics of sexy bodies (women) in sports gear or holding a football let you know this is a great place for dudes! I'm just not that into sports so this place is just average and predictable. But honestly, if you love watching a game, good beer and drink specials, and want to nibble on some buffalo chicken dip this is your place."}
{"text":"It's a shame!! I live less than 6 mins away from Half Moon Grill and never been until this past Monday. Shame, shame, shame on me!!   Monday night the home team (Baltimore Ravens) played the New England Patriots. I started watching the game ... first 2 quarters at Applebee's. It was a dreadful game watching experience. I left, on my drive home I said ... Man, let me give Half Moon a try. I wanted beer and wings!   I'm soooo glad I did! I ordered the Im wings grilled, 1 beer and because I checked in on Yelp I was able to get a free slice of cheesecake.   Sometime next month I plan to host a happy hour for my Meetup group on the patio area. They have a pretty big patio actually. It wraps around the building, has a fire pit and plenty of seating. I'll definitely come back really soon with my Meetup group"}
{"text":"Meh.  For a game, this place is kinda low-energy. Menu is big but nothing that really really looks good. Wings were tiny and off flavor.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very pricy for the quality of food you get...definitely don't come here for the service."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if it was at all possible...  Went there a few weeks ago to meet some friends to watch some preseason football. Out waitress was nice, the food was good, and the beer was cold. It was a good experience till the 4th quarter...  The table in front of us had a female drinking a beer who was standing for a bit blocking our view. Finally, after a few minutes out friend leaned over to their table and asked nicely if she could sit so we could see the game. She responded, \"I work here\" and gave us a dirty look. Really? And? What does that have to do with the fact that we couldn't see?   She was clearly not working at the moment (she was holding a beer and an unlit cigarette) and asking her to sit seemed like a simple request. She sat and began talking about our table to her friends who were with her. Our waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything and as she walked away the \"standing girl\" pulled her aside. We watched her talk and point at our table to our waitress and when we made eye contact she flipped us off. Yes, she literally told us she worked there and then flipped us off! I have never been so disrespected as a patron of a restaurant!  Furious now, we asked for a manager and he came over. We told him what happened and he apologized for her and said he would talk to her. A few minutes later she came back over and sat at her table proceeded to talk about us again. Finally the manager told her to leave. He came back to our table to let us know that she had been drinking, he asked her to leave and would be talking to her when she was sober.   Just to confirm I wasn't crazy or overreacting, a woman at an uninvolved table came by ours after it was over and told us she watched the whole thing and was on our side. She couldn't believe that an employee would be so rude and flip us off.   I guarantee I won't be back for anymore football games or anything else. I will not give a dime to a restaurant that employes people who think it is ok to disrespect patrons regardless of it they are on or off the clock."}
{"text":"Good food, decent beer, average service. Towards the end our server engaged with our table, however, it was only because the shift was over. I would recommend if you are looking for a Chicago themed sports bar and appreciate some Chicago area beer. Other than that, this your average neighborhood sports. The locals get the attention and service."}
{"text":"Couldnt even get a glass of water. Waitress too busy talking to the guys . . .really? Very dissapointing cause its a nice place, just need to revamp the help. Training would go a long way . . .like how to be server. I dont want to go out and chase anyone down."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place!! We were greeted immediately by the hostess. Sally was our server and she was very attentive and prompt with everything. The happy hour is amazing, I got a glass of wine for $3 and the starters were only $5. Try the Buffalo Dip and the Fish Tacos! Delicious. Cute servers and great service!"}
{"text":"Just ate here on a Sunday morning, we wanted to watch football and relax, heard this was a fun place... we went and they had the Steelers game on, we were the first table in the entire restaurant.... and we asked if we could get the cowboys/ rams game on the voice over... they said someone called in and asked for it the other day () so we were good sports and ran with it.. the Steelers game ended up being a complete blow out.... so we asked for them to change it to the last 4 minutes of the cowboys game... they said no... then when the television channels were changing it over to the cowboys game because it was the (most entertaining game) we asked again and they said no because the cardinals were starting their game. I saw ONE cards fan in the entire restaurant... then the angry Asian guy (which I think was the manager) said well we live in AZ... which I get but it's just 2 minutes of a football game! Come on guys! I am in the business don't you want everyone to leave happy? I know I do... this all being said our server was really really good and deserves props, so props to her! I believe her name was Lindy. Also their famous wings are awfully chewy and nasty!  On another note- we won't be back, I'll go watch the game at a place that cares to make their guests HAPPY!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place... not terribly different from the one on Highland, but definately not as upscale. Also, no offense, the waitresses at this one are not as hot as the ones on Highland.. see photo on Highland Review. Lots of TVs, open spaces.. Sometimes there are even good drink deals!"}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoy my food and spirits here! A great place for a quick trip or for a meal and a few drinks. My visit was actually a week ago# but I had to come here and give em love!"}
{"text":"We came from out town for a football game and wanted to watch the big UFC fight at nice, drama-free bar or restaurant. From the point I called here to verify that they were showing the fight I was impressed with their service. The person who answered was extremely friendly and went out of her way to describe the usual fight night crowd and advise us what time we should show up if we wanted a seat. Our waitress was just as friendly and took great care of us. The food especially the Chicken Alfredo was delicious ! Mix drinks were not that strong. But we stuck to beer. Nice place over all I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Small portions. Nickel and dime you with every side and add on. Expensive drinks. Service was slow. We won't be back."}
{"text":"So went to half Moon yesterday to go eat some wings for the wing Tuesday, ended up sitting for roughly 30 minutes while watching all the severs go in an out without any acknowledgement. Finally we asked for some drinks from another server walking by. I got my water but not my beer waited for about another ten minutes to see if we would be recognized as guests and we were not. I could understand if the place was busy but, as empty as it was the place could have been run by a two girl floor and a Bartender. Ended up leaving before we were served."}
{"text":"So sad that this place has gone so downhill lately. Our waitress was terrible and so unfriendly as well as genuinely uncaring about any issues. Then a manager was running around asking every table if they were the ones that had an undercooked burger. My tip would be to figure that out with your staff before you just go asking every table. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"No cover to watch major fights. Very convenient. I haven't had trouble getting a spot to watch or even a table, and I don't exactly show up hours before the show. Food is hit or miss. Don't get the boneless wings. Absolutely try the fish and chips. So weird, but they have the best and they hardly hype it up. Better than Hobe Meat's and Rose & Crown's. Seriously, probably the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the homerun derby, fell in love. We sat at the bar had a great time \"Beaver, uncle al, and Candi \" were awesome had a great time and even got our own souvenir 25 oz mug we can bring in on Mondays for $3 domestics $4 imports . had the pork tenderloin sammich it was pretty tasty. Service was quick and the girls definitely made sure we were comfortable. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First and foremost the waitstaff and bartender are nice! I mean really nice. They were helpful and friendly and made great recommendations. My husband had the wings and I had the southern fried chicken wrap. Both were great. Along with cold local beer. Sports and great TV options are available. There was even a group doing a fantasy baseball draft. If we lived on Phoenix, we would be there a lot!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but the service and food are not. Drinks were serviced with no napkins so our table was soaking wet until we asked for some. Our food came out and we had to ask for plates and silverware. My friend asked for pepper flakes for her pizza and the waitress said \"not unless I can find some\". Um, what?  The Italian sausage sandwich was something I could have made myself and the pizza had a great crust but was nothing to write home about. We also ordered the pretzel fondue and the calamari. The pretzels were great but the cheese was thin and gritty. Not sure what cheese they used but it tasted horrible like it came from a can. The calamari was by far the worst. When the menu said it was hand sliced I was really excited but, WOW was I fooled. Bad calamari can be dry and rubbery. This calamari wasn't even close to being that \"good\". When the waitress came back to ask how things were I said I'm not sure what this is but its not good (calamari). She LITERALLY said yeah, I know, sorry. Then walked away!!! She could have cared less that we were not satisfied. I will come back and sit at the bar because it's close and the drinks were good (Bloody Mary was really good) and the lady next to me had a burger that looked awesome so I will try that but other than that this place will never rank high in my visit list. I'm sad that this place looks so great but tastes so bad. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Wow.. I've been coming here for a while because I live close by, but omg these wings. They're not normal, there's something to them. Trust me, get the honey chipotle boneless wings here and I swear best wings of ur life! Best food I've ever had Im serious, honey chipotle boneless at half moon is the shiz-nit!"}
{"text":"The service here is not the problem, nor is the the saturation of tv's (quite impressed with the fireplace screen) it's the bad food.  How can you mess up nachos and pretzels? They serve these appetizers with a bland cheese and the salsa is also bland!  The calamari..... No comment at this point... With all this bad food they also lack beers, nothing more than your average domestics.  Maybe if the parking was better I would give you the second star  Definitely no baby making here :("}
{"text":"Really chill sports bar with great food, good music, tons of TV screens, pool, killer drink specials & good ambience."}
{"text":"Just ehh. Food was unimpressive. Craft beers were the best thing we had there and good price! Buffalo dip was a weird texture and taste... Seemed like hummus almost but not. Burger was just okay, glad I got it at half price. Fries on the side were very small serving but the best thing I ate."}
{"text":"Well, beer cheese fans...I have tried several in the Valley and found Half Moon's to be the best. I ordered the pretzel and beer cheese from Postmates, and I got queso instead. I called the restaurant and they told me they got rid of the beer cheese a week ago. BIG MISTAKE. Nothing against them, but their beer cheese is what set them apart. If a manager reads this, they need to know they had the best recipe. RIP"}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is price...expect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus."}
{"text":"I went to half moon a couple months ago with a small group. We experienced inattentive wait staff and being asked by other customers to move mid meal so some people could play pool. Decided to give it another try because of the delicious fish fry. It had been removed from the menu effective that day. While looking at the menu we kept getting bumped by servers walking by. We split. I can't see any reason we would return."}
{"text":"How I write Yelp reviews, by Andrew K. Fromaz. (this IS my real name. my real nom de plume)  I start out by identifying an establishment I vaguely want to try, and finding an occasion or reason to go there.  In this case, a fellow Yelper Christina P set up a special Happy Hour event on a Friday at Half Moon Sports Grill on Highland.  I'd been to Half Moon before, and it was not exactly on my list of places to hurry back to and try again, for reasons which will gradually become evident...  I get to the restaurant, and go in, briefly (if at all) taking note of the decor, the attitude of the staff I encounter along the way, the crowd, the music playing, occasionally the lighting... anything that jars or that i happen to notice that i like.  This is how I (and anyone else fortunate enough to have full use of their five senses) determine the \"vibe\" of a place.   Half Moon seems like a typical upper-tier sports bar, pleasant hostess, apparently clean, lots of big TVs, small booths...  Nothing not to like, honestly.  The \"vibe\" is that this is a pretty nice place.    I sit down and look over the menu, searching for anything that particularly catches my interest.  I'm not a picky eater, so usually I have a hard time narrowing it down to one thing.  The first time I was here, I was pretty hungry, so the blue cheese burger caught my eye.  On a more recent visit, appetizers were on Happy Hour so I tried a few of those.  Here's the bottom line.  None of it was very good.  Like, I would actively avoid eating any of the food again.  The pretzel, which was recommended, was dry inside and oily outside - like it had been coated with some form of fake butter.  The burger was only ok.  The boneless wings were the only thing that I would order again (I think we got medium?)  Anyway, over the course of the visit I put together all of these impressions and write a review, usually deciding whether or not I'll return.  Sorry, Half Moon, I want to love you, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome after 10! REVERSE HAPPY HOUR.  The food they serve for H/H is HUGE portions. UFC is also shown here, no cover, but they kinda rape you on the drinks during the fight... 4.50 for a blue moon.... BUT they also discount the burgers half price... Do the research. call or check the site or fb for specials, or sign up for the email list.  I say, CHECK IT OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hours and the proximity to my workplace... though I would probably go there for their deliciously crispy fries even if I didn't work nearby. The outdoor fire has been perfect these last few weeks, and the waitresses are accommodating and nice to large groups of people with separate tabs. I really enjoyed the beer suggestion the bartender made for me (from SanTan Brewery), and appreciated that she was trying to help keep it local."}
{"text":"I have been going to Half Moon for 14 years. I have always loved the food, environment, and atmosphere.  The food and drink's prices have gone up, but they aren't that far out of line for the area. I am glad i have been able to see this bar grow over 14 years."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Chicago/Indians world series game. Its expensive. Our waitress seemed put out we were there for some time t watch the game. She wasn't very friendly. I imagined as $$$$$ signs . that she didnt think were worth it. Its expensive and a lackluster place. I will not be back"}
{"text":"I come here all the time for years and sadly the service and food have now consistently been horrendous. I have returned food to the kitchen several times, it was either wrong, freezing cold or torn wraps and burger buns. Attitude sank to such bitchy lows, no quality control, a new menu that is just retarded and over priced. I will not return to this place ever again, me and my crew of 6 regulars have all agreed this place went to hell and is run by 15 year old children that don't give a damn about no one but their friends that come in after high school and get free drinks."}
{"text":"Ain't no thang like a damn good chicken wang.  I love watching football here. They are carefully sectioned off so you can sit with your team. It's pretty crowded on Sundays but the service is great. With great game day specials, it makes it easy on the wallet to order wings. their awesome seasoned french fries, burgers (are half off on weekends) and end everything with their better-than-Oreganos cookie pie.  I know cookie pies are the thing but this place really knows how to make girls fat. Cooked in a skillet, the dough is still gooey in the center and topped with delicious vanilla ice cream. I just drooled on the keyboard typing this.  Come on down to Half Moon to cheer on your favorite sports team!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they could care less about the customer experience on ANY level here. We come here from time to time, usually for happy hour. Tonight we came on a Sunday night about 8:30. Our server wrote nothing down and subsequently our order was missing an entree and some of it was ice cold to the point that we took it to go to re heat at home. Our server never came back to check on us until my husband went to the bar to let them know we were missing food, she never asked how everyone else's food was, she never offered to get us more drinks and we do drink. It was a pretty sad experience all the way around and I'm embarrassed I brought our out of town friends in. Halie was our server.  By the way, it was very slow. I was a server most of my life. Her attitude was awful and I rarely feel that way knowing how hard that job can be."}
{"text":"This is a great little bar.  I live walking distance to it and enjoy walking in to a nice clean place.  I always sit at the bar.  The bartender Amanda - is super nice and knows everybody's name.  She even knows what to pour me each time.  I like the burgers a lot.  It's not a creepy crowd or a high and mighty stuck up crowd.  It's the perfect in between mix.  The Ranger is good beer but I wish WISH WISH they would get Four Peaks on tap."}
{"text":"Best calamari I've had n phx! Awesome local bar, good atmosphere. Sunday guest bartending w/ DJ nice change of pace. Music videos on TV late nite fun vibe."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time Saturday night with a large group celebrating the end of our season. This event has been booked for weeks so management had plenty of notice to staff properly HOWEVER it took us about 30 to get a beer after waiting for a server, standing at the bar... We eventually got a table sat there for another 10 minutes with servers walking right by us. I finally got up asked a manager of we could get a server. She informed me that she had Two servers working the area with probably around 100 people and one would be over shortly. A very unfriendly server finally came over to our table. We had a huge fiasco trying to get quarters to play darts, it was just a really bad unfriendly, unorganized mess which is rather unfortunate because we were there to celebrate not to get dirty looks and terrible customer service! Needles to say I will never return to this place! I am on the board for this event so we will certainly NOT go here next year! What a disappointment!!"}
{"text":"I first learned about Half Moon when my barber told me he goes there to watch the UFC fights because they don't charge a cover.  The fact that they even show the fights was all I needed to hear, because I still haven't found a bar I like where I can watch them.  Now, having been there, I can say I'd probably go there again, even if it weren't for the UFC fights.  It's a well-kept sports bar, with TVs galore, pretty decent bar food, and attentive service.  Whether it be for a beer with friends, or to watch sports on the weekend, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.  It seems to fill up quickly, though, so get there early if you're going for a particular game/fight."}
{"text":"This is where I go to watch hockey because they have NHL Center Ice. This bar is arranged well for watching sports in general and the food is quite good. There are even two side rooms with their own private TVs and couches.  I had the mushroom and swiss burger last Monday and it was to die for :) The guy next to me ended up buying one after seeing mine because it smelled so good.  The service is variable here but usually good. This is definitely the place I go to watch sports near the house."}
{"text":"It was amazing! The atmosphere was festive and fun, the service and staff detailed and attentive, and most importantly the food was delicious! My wife had the Mushroom Swiss Burger and I had the BBQ Cheddar Burger. The food was delicious and the spices on the fries were a delightful added touch that was yummy.  This was the first time for me and the expectations were met above and beyond. This place is the place to watch football, enjoy a rich selection of wine, and relax with a variety of cold ones on tap to chose from. Don't miss their Thanksgiving specials, the doors open at 5pm. (That was a nice touch along with the free WiFi)  The Half Moon Grill is the establishment to go to in Moon Valley. I will make it a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"This place only caters to themselves. We have been sitting at the table for 10 minutes outside and no one has come to see if we want food or another drink. Did the Bloody Mary bar...."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that this place is close to my house I dont have much positive to say.    Great cocktails, but NO DRAFT BEER.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"21.50 for a buffalo Ck wrap ff and an ice tea. Wow. Wasn't very good either. No refill on the iced tea I got. Didn't even asked how my food was or if I needed anything. I asked for ranch and napkins and I think that offended the bartender. I don't think I will be back there again."}
{"text":"Met another bad date at this bar for happy Hour action. Half-price appetizer's are nice and $3 Beers are also available. Only about 7 craft beers though, but Magic hat #9 - one of the originals - was available on tap. Mostly older businessmen here on this night. The panko breaded zucchini was good as was the cool cucumber dip on the side for dipping. My original choice of chips, guac and salsa looked good, but I never have had a version of guacamole that was so hot. Ease up on the jalapeno's fellows. I had to return the stuff because nobody likes to sweat while eating guacamole. Bartender was nice and I exchanged it for a large Hot pretzel. This was very good, nice and hot and salty and not too much butter. Used the cucumber dip as I'm not a mustard fan and no cheese sauce was offered. Sandwiches, etc seemed pricey and the Biltmore area upcharge appeared to be in effect. Lots of TV sets, so seems to be a pretty solid sports bar, although I could do without the picture of a guy's butt crack in the men's room. Put that poster in the women's room please - homophobia still exists."}
{"text":"This place is your local bar that you love to always have as an option. I know that kinda sounds negative, but is very much the contrary. They have friendly staff and a decent value for good food. I almost said \"bar food\", but it truly is better than that. Great place to watch sports or fights. They have a pool table!  Outdoor seating. Fire pit. A great example of a neighborhood bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a quick date with the boyfriend and had a good time. The server was very friendly there were tv's everywhere and the food was great. I'll definitely stop by again. Its a great place to grab a beer hang out and relax."}
{"text":"I'm so over this place. I used to go all the time and I've been going less and less. Pretty sure last night was the last night. The food is pretty good but the service is terrible. I've been there twice in the past week and I left angry at the end of our meal. It's nearly impossible to get the servers attention, every time she walks past she looks away like she's avoiding us. Service is so slow and their not even that busy. I was drinking premium vodka and the third one definitely wasn't premium it tasted like they gave me well but charged premium. I would've said something but our server was mia, so I drank it and left. Halfway through the meal some lady behind the bar- not sure if she was the manager because she was dressed nicer than the servers just randomly steals our glasses that were pretty empty- I over heard her saying they needed glasses. She didn't ask if we needed refills or anything she just took the glasses and left. If you wanna piss me off its not offering me a refill when I'm paying 7$ for each cocktail, instead you take my empty glass and leave. Towards the end of our meal our server acted pissed that we wanted to split the bill she stormed off like splitting a check was so hard.   Overall a bad experience. Slow experience and poor customer service. I won't be back anytime soon and I'll share my experience with my friends."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and watch the games. Super friendly staff and cool crowd !"}
{"text":"I have a new reason to appreciate V necks.    WARNING showing up on Saturday wearing the wrong shirt may result in uncomfortable stares from rival college alumni, which may ruin anything you eat.    The food was good enough, one and half grade above your stadium fare, and even better when your is team winning.  The $3 draft from local only beers is AMAZING, I recommend the Lumberyard Porter paired with anything.  The staff attentive staff, enough to know when you need something and when to leave you alone to watch the game.  I recommend to bring your team friends.  There are large secluded regions and the  restaurant will meet your TV demands.    Stop by during game time and everything else will take care of itself.  This of course  assumes your team is not a heart breaker.  AKA the"}
{"text":"Great experience, I enjoyed the food very much and the service is excellent! The waitress was very helpful in helping us choose from the menu and the steak tacos were pretty good. I'd go back to hang out again anytime."}
{"text":"Great lil patio with fire pit! They play top 40 on the weekends. Great place to catch a sports game. Food is decent....beer and drinks are better."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Probably my fault for coming here 3 times but the waitresses only check on you once an hour."}
{"text":"I just came here this past weekend for a baby shower and I was pleasantly impressed due to all of the other reviews.  The waitress that attended to our party was wonderful.  She was very attentive and nice.  The food was wonderful.  We had fresh caesar salad, boneless chicken wing bites and pizza.  Everything was delicious and the space that the shower was in was perfect.  I will come next time I am in town and see how it is when I'm not with a party.  But until then I give this place 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from our hotel. Tried it out on a Thursday and Alissa was great. Liked it so much we came back the next day. Malea took care of our group during the day (which grew from 6 to 12 within an hour). This is our new Old Pros hangout for March Madness and Spring Training."}
{"text":"My friends and I are happy hour regulars around Central Phoenix.  We're always in search of a good deal and good food/drinks.  The good deal was found at Half Moon... the good food was NOT.  We ordered 4 appetizers to share during our recent happy hour, and I was completely underwhelmed.    The pretzel - the high point of the apps. Simple, tasty.  Perhaps a little too salty, but nonetheless, yummy.  Chips with queso - Queso?  Really?  More like microwaved Velveeta with some salsa stirred in.  Just screamed \"processed food\".  There are so many places with a quality queso dip around - Half moon should ask for a recipe suggestion.  Boneless wings - Not bad.  Fairly tasty little nuggets.  Unfortunately, there were only about 6 tiny little pieces.  They obviously price them high to make up for your happy hour savings.  Frito/Chili Nacho thing - Really? That's IT? Just a handful of Fritos with some seemingly canned chili poured over the top.  SO boring.   Half Moom: Please, please, please... don't rely on your happy hour prices and big tvs to bring people back.  Without decent food, I definitely have no incentive to return."}
{"text":"Bad food. Bad service.   My Brother and buddy went to Half Moon to watch Monday Night Football. We arrived right around the end of the 1st quarter and the place wasn't all that busy.   All of our rounds were ordered within the Happy Hour time frame, i even looked at the time when we ordered out last round at 650pm. That round of beers didn't get to us until 710pm and my buddy joked i bet these get charged full price. and when the bill came he was right.   My brother and I ordered wings when we first got there which took 30min to show up. When they finally did come we ordered 2 hamburgers and my buddy ordered wings. 40 min later my burger showed up completely wrong. wings and the other burger no where. When the waitress came over she was shocked the other food hadn't come out. when the other items did come out there were cold. All the food except for the wings was terrible very greasy.  The place has some nice TV's but one of the TV's is constantly running an awful and tacky slide show of photos from the bar and random specials.   We wont be going back and wouldn't recommend to anyone going to this bar."}
{"text":"This is my third time trying Half Moon and it was still underwhelming.  Great location and numerous TVs would seem the perfect place for watching the game.  But... The food is expensive.  And mediocre at best.  Service was iffy and it was fairly empty after we played golf at the Pointe circa 4 p.m Saturday."}
{"text":"This place has a great loud busy vibe every time I visit. It is a true sports bar atmosphere with the loud customers and games. The food is great but I feel like the menu is too small. I also wish they had more of a selection for happy hour food and drinks too. I think out of everything I have had the burger was the best. The wings are supposed to be award winning but ours were so over cooked the bones were brown from oil and the inside of the chicken was dried out from over frying. Since they are award winning we will give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again, maybe it was a bad batch. Bummer. Truly we go here to drink and watch games not eat"}
{"text":"Always a good time.  I've been here many times for football Sundays.  Spacious, always room for big groups and super clean. Who doesn't love a clean bathroom. Their name recently changed a lil', but still kept the integrity of \"Half Moon Sports Grill\"."}
{"text":"well, this is certainly not my style of bar, but it's about 500 feet from my apartment, so  i find myself here a lot. i would prob give it only three stars were not for two things: a bike rack out front - total, unexpected score, and TVs in the bathrooms; excess at its finest. it's definitely trying to cater to the more \"distinguished\" sports fan, and looks like a more contemporary and i hesitate to say, upscale, bar.  there is NO beer on tap. ket me repeat, NO BEERS ON TAP.  which i don't understand for a sports bar... no pitchers? weird. they do have about six import/nicer beers in a bottle, like bass and heineken, and i believe fat tire is $3 all the time. the long islands are on special for $3 at HH, and are big and tasty.  there is a large, fours-sided bar right in the middle, and lots of tables (both regular height and bar stool height) inside. on the covered patio is a fire pit, pool table and three very large TVs. also inside are two private rooms with their own TVs, couches and tables that can be reserved, i think at no extra charge.  service is spotty, and take it that it's because i'm no where near what the young, pretty things that serve it up here are looking for in an ideal customer, so perhaps i don't really warrant as much attention as that group of guys wooping it up while watching the game.  i agree the food is definitely overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"I love Half Moon best bar and bar tenders I love all the girls there and the owner clay is really cool! Its my go to bar! On top of it it's a Chicago bar..being from Chicago I feel at home here. Great food, and it's really nice inside with plenty of TV's to watch.  Chicago born..Arizona bred  Go Blackhawks!"}
{"text":"Great food! Fried zucchini is amazing. Fun local bar with TVs, great happy hour and menu. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Great HH and great service.  They have $5 appetizers.  TV's all over the place so it is good for sports."}

{"text":"Have been going to Half Moon for years but today is the last time.  I ordered the grilled cheese with a slice of tomato and my guest had the bacon cheeseburger.  I had to search for the cheese on my grilled cheese and you could read through the slice of tomato because of the thinness.  The only thing good was the bread and the fries.  We were surprised at the size of the cheeseburger; it was half the size of the bun. The burgers used to be good size.  This is probably great for sports watching but for business lunch - I would pass on Half Moon.  Our server was really sweet and efficient but the service was VERY SLOW (don't think it was the fault of the server)."}
{"text":"Going to bump you all up an extra star since your manager was quick to respond to my review. I don't live in Phoenix but will most likely hit this place up again because it shows that he values what customers say about their food and service. Well done sir."}
{"text":"Basic bar menu and normal service.  Nothing extravagant. Vegetarians and vegans have very limited choices. The pepper cheese soup and guacamole were good. Pizza crust is super thin. Fireplace in outside patio."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time iv been in and every time i get a bloody mary and its perfect. I had the blta sandwich with some chicken tequila soup and it tasted heavenly.  My server jessie was amazing and even though i sat on the patio, i wasnt forgotten about. They have great specials and deals for football and throughout the whole week. Half moon is where its at!"}
{"text":"This has been the third time and will be the last time we will go to half moon, unfortunately it's within walking distance but being served crap food and getting an attitude has made the cab fare anywhere else worth it. Food is COLD and tastes like it has been sitting around, Cold greasy pasta, cold burgers, cold greasy chicken wings, stale pretzels and cheese dip that smelled fishy and rotten.  Rude staff that you practically have to chase down to order or get a check and overall horrible customer service. When you do tell them there is an issue with food they roll their eyes and disappear for ten mins only to come back with an excuse."}
{"text":"The owner seems to be a nice guy, however there are definitely things that need to be addressed ASAP. See below...  Atmosphere- 4 stars ( sports fans, nice tv's, Chicago Games. )  Service- 1 star (Horrible and they are not prepared for game day crowds.)  Food- 2 stars ( With the Chicago theme, I was hoping for better and they had small portions for the high prices. Disappointed!)  Management- 1 star (Had an incident and they did not have any urgency to resolve. Did not follow up with me and did not offer to comp my meal. Acted like they did me a favor by comping $9.89 Chi-fries appetizer. Don't want to go into too many details, but make sure you check your glasses for chips because they served me a lemonade with glass shards in it. Needless to say that I will not be returning!)"}
{"text":"For the Central Phoenix area, I consider this to be one of the bigger and better sports bars. They have obviously put some serious thought and effort toward the design and maintenance of both the interior and the patio spaces. The staff is very attentive and friendly, the establishment is conveniently located south of the Town and Country complex, parking is no problem, and of course there are more than enough TV screens for sports fans.  This is definitely one sports bar I'd recommend to friends for viewing sports and enjoying drinks and good bar food at reasonable prices - especially if they enjoy dining, drinking, and socializing in a patio, as this has one of the better and more spacious sports bar patio spaces in the city."}
{"text":"I hate YELP so the fact I am leaving a review on this extortion based site says a lot but Valerie the bartender deserves it.  So yes YELP extorts business owners to keep the negative reviews from either showing up, and if the business owner doesn't pay YELP for monthly for marketing services positive ones never show. I wouldn't have posted this but too many good businesses get screwed because of their business practices. Now I would go into detail about this but this review is about Valerie not Yelp so Google \"Yelp unfair filtering process\" , \"Yelp extortion\" or better yet \"Yelp loses in court\" to find out more.   Okay now back to Valerie. I am leaving this review based solely on the staffing. The management here must have made a significant investment in the interior and the staffing because it seems slow when I come in, yet it's always chic and has more than ample servers to take care of the customer; that shows they care about the customer experience. Here's what impressed me about Valerie, no matter if you order a coke like I do or a beer, she gives you consistent service.   I am a former New Orleans Bourbon Street bartender and restaurant GM, with over 20 years of experience in the industry, and usually two-three refills is all you get if you sit at my bar, not because I want to give you bad service but I am thinking to myself, \" Who really want five cokes in one sitting?\" No, Valerie refills drinks like they are all Blue Moons! She is friendly, can strike up a conversation, and keeps your area clean.  Kudos to Val and the staff, even though Yelp sucks!"}
{"text":"RUUUUUDDDDDEEEEE!!!!!! Girls that work there are ALWAYS so against any girls that go in there. Which is dumb of them since my friends and I are ALL bartenders!   Whichever two bartenders worked st Patty's night were absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"1 star for being a Chicago bar 1/2 star for being close to my home   0 stars for the awful service and crappy beer selection.  I have been here for an hour and a half. I was greeted at the door and told to find my way to the patio since it was busy for the Blackhawks game. Server comes 5 minutes later; ask for a menu? She returns 10 minutes after that. Try to order beer #1 - oh. Sorry, we don't have that. (Pet peeve when it gets to two beers that are not available anymore). Okay, order my second option. She returns 10 minutes later and goes on her way. Order the chicken strips with ranch and honey mustard the next time she finds her way back outside. 20 minutes later a random person comes out to each table - did you order chicken strips? No? Did you? No? Four tables later she gets it right. Do we not put tickets on our food to know where it goes? Because this has been happening for every table that ordered food out here on the patio.  (Dear Half Moon, if you are serving finger food, make your servers bring some damn napkins). Oh, and they forgot the honey mustard. Then, I'm left alone for 30 minutes. Girl comes back to ask if I want more. Nope, but I'll take beer option #3. Oh, sorry, we don't have that. But we do have this and you know, rotating handles. OK, but seriously! Print different paper beer lists if you can't keep the same taps on for long periods of time - it is not hard. There are plenty of good sports bars around here that figured that shit out already. Ask for a water and my check. Water comes after 10 minutes and tastes like pool water. As I write this, I am still waiting on my check. Maybe she got lost.  Sorry, Half Moon, your being a Chicago bar is not enough to bring me back. Get more servers for busy nights, or at least get one or two with some hustle."}
{"text":"We always wanted to try this place so we went there for my birthday.  So disappointing.  It's a  very noisy place. The wings were dry and the burgers were so greasy you constantly  needed to wipe your hands. The servers are friendly but it took forever for our food to come.  As I looked around nobody was getting any food.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok the food is ok. But now it's not just the service that has suffered. Now the menu has changed and me giving it one more chance clearly was a mistake. No more half off wings, 5 dollar appetizers as standard during happy hour. I'm incredibly disappointed. Last time was now."}
{"text":"Most of the servers have no clue what they are doing. The only good bartender they have is the woman with the chest tats who works during the day. She's attentive and makes a fabulous drink. Everyone else seems to be clueless.  -a local bartender who comes in on his days off. (My advice is either hire more people or train your employees to be more attentive.) food is amazing but service at night needs help."}
{"text":"Fun place, great happy hour specials $5.00 appetizers. Try the calamari  Rich the bartender was great fun, likes to cut up and keeps your drinks coming.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago, sorry about the late review entry, but this place was pretty good.  I was surprised to see some options on a menu in a sports bar with more then chicken wings and pizza.  Stopped in her on a Friday night.  Not extremely busy for a  bar/restaurant but I liked the extra attention we got at our table.  Opened up the menu and found a few different selections to choose from.  So I ordered a beer or two and ordered some wings, yes I was craving them from the time I cited this sports bar.  They have some different selections of flavors to choose from and you can have them bone in or out.  I decided not to juggle with my wings so I got them bone out with the Thai sauce.   I also ordered some fish and chips, I know odd choice, but hey that's the kinda girl I am...  My husband ordered the jambalaya.  After waiting around for a little while getting a little tossed, I noticed a huge room full of TV screens to watch whatever games are on, they also have smaller screens around the whole bar, and a mix of all sorts of people gathering.  We got our wings and weren't impressed by the amount we got... We ordered a pound of them and it was a really small portion.  They were good though.   Then our main courses came and I dig into my fish and chips, pretty darn good.  I also dipped into my husbands  jambalaya and tasted that too, it was ok I guess, kinda bland for how I like to have mine.    The cost were right on, except for the wings for amount of food you get, the drinks were average prices for this type of bar.  I might stop in again if in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to give this place 5 stars, but they took away the AMAZING $9.99 all-you-can-eat Friday fish fry (which included all-you-can-eat garlic fries) and you just can't do that to a Wisconsin transplant. [Insert tantrum here.]  I've been trying other all-you-can-eat Friday fish fries in Phoenix but sadly no one measures up.   I'm sure their new Friday smorgasbord is probably awesome to those who love Cajun shrimp, but I'll just be over here drooling about their dreamy beer-battered filets until they're back... (Not willing to accept the possibility the deal won't return.)"}
{"text":"Over priced, poor quality. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad \"crispy\", my son ordered chicken tenders and my I other son ordered the burger. The salad would have been better if they used the same chicken as the tenders. Instead I got little Tyson Anytizer nuggets on my salad. They were soggy like they were bathed instead of tossed in sauce. The sauce was sweet and not really buffalo. The ranch dressing was watered down and tasted like mayonnaise juice. I ate some of my son's tenders ad they were really good - and real! The burger had a ton of gristle and was subpar at best to be 10 bucks!! The manager did remove the salad from my check, although he tried to convince a culinary graduate that the nuggets was real chicken... Right"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Half Moon since all the new changes and definitely miss some of the old menu items, such as the french fries. Not that the new version of the fries are bad, but the old ones were sooo good. I ordered the chicken cesar salad which wasn't bad but nothing that knocked my socks off. My husband had the triple decker club which was good, and my son had the kids pizza which was also good. There was really nothing bad about the experience just nothing great. Maybe we were just too used to the old menu (and fries) that it's hard getting used to the newer items. Overall our experience was good. Our server was very friendly and even the host was nice enough to offer to pull down then shades so we could sit outside which I thought was very nice. If you're a sports fan, this is definitely the place you want to be on game day but parents be warned, it's very LOUD on big game days. So I wouldn't recommend bringing very young children when a big sporting event is happening. Otherwise this place is very child friendly."}
{"text":"Three stars is pretty spot on.  I actually was going to give this place two stars, but they got a bump for friendly service.  I came here after work for happy hour with some co-workers and their significant others.  While the waitresses were attentive and friendly, the food and the sports setup were unimpressive.  The restaurant is squished in between an office and hotel complex just southeast of the Camelback Colonnade.  There's a decent amount of parking, though finding it was initially confusing as its mixed with reserved office parking.  Inside, its a pretty standard sports bar, though perhaps going for a modern edgy look.  The TVs around the bar and restaurant area are actually not as big as you'd find at some other sports bars like Zipps.  I also noticed they had issues with the satellite feed for some of the games they were showing on their televisions.  Some of the TV screens just froze or went black numerous times.  Alright, to the grub.  Its a Chicago sports bar and proudly displays a Bears flag outside so a lot of the menu is geared towards Chicago fare.  Fair enough.  I love a good italian beef sandwich and some italian sausage, so I went for the combo sandwich.  I've had a sandwich like this before at other Chicago themed restaurants in the Phoenix area and I know to expect a little bit of a peppery kick, but this place took it WAY too far.  The size of the sandwich was okay (though in my opinion a bit small for the $10 I paid), but the proportion of peppers to meat was probably 2/3rd peppers, 1/3rd meat.  I really couldn't even taste the meat as I could only taste a fiery painful burn.  I can handle spicy to a point, but eventually you reach a pain threshold that prevents you from enjoying the meal.  The overabundance of peppers ruined the dish.  On the good side, I was very pleasantly surprised to find Lumberyard Red on their beer menu and the fact that it was discounted for happy hour.  And as mentioned before, our waitress was excellent.  She refilled my glass right on cue and was equally attentive with my friends.  Perhaps they'll step up their game for the NFL regular season.  Its a Bears bar so they'll have plenty of Chicago patrons come kickoff.  I don't expect out of this world food at a sports bar, but I would hope it would be adequate (particularly the Chicago theme dishes).  And I would hope I could watch games without feed interruptions or unforeseen technical difficulties.  Perhaps today just wasn't their day, but I probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service. Don't go there expecting to watch an out of town team like the SF Giants. It's the Diamondbacks on all the TV's ( of which they have many). The will not change at customer request."}
{"text":"Below average food. Not enough interesting beers on tap. Specialty cocktails were bad. Service was nice, but not very attentive. Lots of tvs and a good place to catch a Chicago game."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. Friendly staff and the food is consistent. I really like wings when going to a dive bar and their wings were great!"}
{"text":"Another amazing night here tonight. Alex is fun professional bartender that is attentive and friendly. Love the wings & cocktails! My new go to place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Wasn't impressed with the food. Beer was not cold. over all not satisfied with first visit and probably last one."}
{"text":"Great place in the Biltmore area to grab a beer and watch a game!  Friendly bartenders, nice atmosphere and good drink selection."}
{"text":"Food is terrible :(  eat at casey jones!  Otherwise the TVs okay, plenty of seating,  shots well poured:)"}
{"text":"Back at my favorite Biltmore sport Bar watching the superbowl and I gotta say the Italian sausage sandwich along with the bottomless mimosas are the bomb! However my waitresses Olivia and Chloe are the real reason I will keep coming! They alhave been the best, so accommodating, attentive and fun! They made my and my parties experience today! Thank you   Eric"}
{"text":"Our networking group meets here weekly. The service is good and the food is, too, although nothing exciting. No real complaints --- I just think some more creativity in the menu would be fun, but this is a good place."}
{"text":"Nothing special, don't go out of your way.  Ordered fish and chips.  Two small pieces of fish, over cooked with limp garlic fries. Onion rings also over cooked with too much batter. The only thing good about this place is happy hour. Prices for food and drinks drop to what they should be all the time. Nice and loud. TV's could be better placed."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and have had no issues until my most recent visit. But allow me to start with the positive though.  The food has been good. The wings and ribs were nothing short of yummy. The sauces they used were fantastic actually.The service has been above par for a sports bar. My servers have been attentive and alert. Location is good and not too far from my house making it an ideal place for happy hour.   The negative.  This last visit I decided to take my dad for happy hour. Again, our food and service was good up until we paid our bill. Keep in mind, my dad is an older man now and getting in and out of booths is sometimes a little more difficult than it used to be. Everyone had gotten up to leave but my dad was struggling to get up. To make things easier, my brother moved a table out of the way to give him a hand standing up. As soon as my brother started assisting him a blonde, male, manager walked by and arrogantly/rudely said, \"don't move the tables, it blocks the pathways for staff.\" Mind you, this is right as my dad was struggling to stand while my brother was pulling him out of the seat. Are you F&%$##& kidding me? Walk around, say nothing or give us a bad look if you feel so indignant!  I was in shock at this display and shaking with anger as we walked to the car.  I'll probably come back here because there is always one bad apple in the bunch but I promise you I wont be so nice the second time around."}
{"text":"First time to visit this establishment. Was here for a special function with a group. Found the place to be very decorative clean and the staff is very friendly and efficient. Had the fried calamari and the wife had a chicken Caesar salad.  Both items were delivered in about 15 minutes they were tasty and very fresh. Friends of ours had a chicken wrap and boneless wings. They said that both of these items were very good in fact the chicken salad matched that at one of the better restaurants that we normally visit. Drinks were competitively priced."}
{"text":"One Star is too many for this place.... This was the worst experience I've ever had with the service industry in a really long time.  I used to be a Hostess and understand when places get busy.  This place wasn't that busy...they were very unorganized for a Sports Bar for first game of the football season.   We decided to come here to watch opening night of football.  It was just about time for kickoff and I had to go tell them to change the channel from the NFL Network (which is what they thought the game was on) to NBC.  They were great about that.    Here's where it gets bad...When we first got there, we joined a group of friends who had been there a little earlier to wish a co-worker farewell.  The service at the point of our arrival was bad.  The waitress barely took our drink orders, and we asked to add another table for more room.  They agreed to add the table but we were the ones that had to move the table because they started to ignore us.  The other people in our group were ready to order food and more drinks, and the waitress pretty much ignored our waving her down or she was avoiding eye contact as she walked by several times.  She would come to the table and help one person and not ask if anyone needed anything and if you tried toThis was the worst service experience I have had in a long time.  We came here to watch the Opening Night of Football.  It wasn't really busy when we got there.  Just as it was about kickoff time, stop her for someone else at the table, she just kept on walking.    We had another person join our table and she order a drink along with a couple of other people who had been waiting for some time to place another drink order.  We also order appetizers at this time...Chips and Salsa and Zucchini sticks.  About 20 minutes passed and we had the bartender apologize to us because the service was bad...making excuses that didn't make sense for a sports bar on opening night of football.  They finally brought the drinks and said they would have to remake our food (again...chips and salsa and zucchini sticks).    Another friend joined our group (others had also departed) and asked for a water (again...waitress only asked the new comer what they wanted to drink).  People were waiting to order another round of drinks at this point.  We were still waiting for our appetizers (they had come out with stale chips and Calamari instead of zucchini (sent it back)).  Told the manager that we were not happy with the food and she apologized and said she would comp it.    We said enough was enough.  We finally flagged down our waitress, who had copped an attitude with us (she wasn't on good terms with her other big table as well), to tell her we wanted our checks.  After about ten minutes, she came back all happy and told us that everything had been comped.  We all got up and left.  This was all before half time of the game.  We proceeded to go to Zipps just down the street where we had service 150% better than this place.    I am sure the Manager wasn't happy because she not only comped our table, she comped the other table that wasn't happy with the waitress and attitude as well.  This was a chance for them to prove this would be a good Thursday night football place to stop at near work and they failed miserably.  I wouldn't recommend going here if you are interested in having great service while you enjoy a game."}
{"text":"This place is ok....average...nothing you haven't seen before.  It's your typical sports bar restaurant.  They have a lot of TVs which makes sports watching great.  It's extremely LOUD.  The prices for food are typical for this type of establishment.  Service has always been good here.  I wish they had something unique about the place.....like a menu item, a drink, or even a happy hour special.  Unfortunately, they don't....it's your typical sports bar restaurant....   Which is too bad because the location is great."}
{"text":"I am new to town and had a recommendation by a friend to come visit this place. The interior is nice and the atmosphere is as well however the service I had was awful. I waited in front to be seated for 5-10 minutes before someone acknowledged me. Once I was seated and ordered my food took almost 40 minutes and tasted like everything came out of the microwave. I got the late night happy hour menu and cheap does not mean poor quality !!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected.  It is a huge open space with a large bar stuck right in the middle.  The menu is more upscale than the usual sports 'bar' selections, but I guess that is the difference between sports bar and sports grill?  The food was good, but if I remember correctly they had little to no draft beer.  They could have had Bud or Coors or something, but to me that translates to no beer on tap.    They have a lot of flat screen tvs as they should,  but I like a little bit more character in my sports bar.  This is much too commercial for my taste."}
{"text":"Tv's everywhere and a great place to watch the Blackhawks during the playoffs. I enjoy the Chicago treats but I don't remember the service always being so slow.. Lunch lasted late into the second period and felt inattentive at best. Still a good sports bar.."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the beer. The food sucked. Our chicken buffalo dip was cold. The hamburger was well done when ordered medium rare. The \"buffalo\" wings were wings covered in sarrachi sauce. To the managers credit she comped the bad food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The chefs here are bred from gods. Every food here is utterly delicious. I'm going into debt from eating here too much. Plz help."}
{"text":"Ok...so I am updating this due to the owner contacting me. He has been diligent on replying and getting things sorted out and making my situation fair. Stay tuned as to how everything turns out...at least he is trying..."}
{"text":"I travel for work and have an office close to this place and I love it already.  I'll be a regular for sure. Angelica is a wonderful server. The food and drinks during happy hour are a great price. Best part of this bar is that it's a Cubs bar!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun for a football game but the food is subpar, nothing special. But what bothered me the most was the Woman's bathroom, it was clean & well stocked but the smell of nasty grease oil is gross! You can see the smoke alarm in the late lights- Nasty! Owner needs to invest in a better vent! Kitchen is on the other side of bathroom!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. I got the Bleu cheese burger (can't remember the exact name) and it was excellent. Very well cooked, perfect amount of spead, and thick slices of meaty bacon. The fries are excellent, obviously made to order, very crispy and we'll seasoned. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because when you check in using Yelp, you are supposed to receive a free slice of cheesecake. This offer has been on yelp for nearly two years, and the staff/management never honors the coupon. Every time you ask about it, you will get a different excuse as to why they can't do it, very frustrating and unprofessional."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have been this disappointed at this place. Service was beyond horrible! We went for lunch  there were about 5 people there so not busy and yet it took 90 minutes for a lunch special lunch. We had to ask for our bill. Such bad service  she never asked how the food was or if we needed another beverage,  we were sitting at the bar! It'll be a while before we go back, the bar stools need to be recivered they are all cracked..."}
{"text":"If you're into the trashy clientele that come out for $2 Long island's and free UFC fights and bar guests starting fights then you will love this place.  Or you could go to a place that actually has good food and drinks at a place that exhibits at least a little bit of class.  Choose wisely."}
{"text":"Decent \"bar food\" for a sports grill.  Good selection of sandwiches/apps and good portion sizes as well.  Unfortunately was a bit noisy and crowded but what does one expect during a UFC fight.  Service was not all that bad given how crowded it was.  They have numerous TVs and an outdoor big screen on the patio.    I wonder if they will have bar specials during games because the beers are a bit pricy.  I would recommend this place and look forward to going here during football season."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here on a Friday night for some food and drinks. Was moderately busy but not slammed by any means.   Service was ok. Slow but all my drinks came out and food came how I ordered it (ish). Neither my server nor the bartender knew what tequilas they had. She could \"only remember Don Julio\" which was $12 a shot.   Food was meh. I got a burger that was terribly overcooked, even for a bar. My girl got some fish tacos that looked beautiful and she liked a lot. Appetizers were pretty bland and not that hot.   Drinks are what really killed me here. I had a pint of beer, 3 margaritas, a shot and finished my girls drink and left with a slight buzz. For spending $60 on booze I was pretty disappointed with my level of intoxication.   Bottom line: I spent $120 last night for a crappy meal, mediocre service and watered down drinks. Won't be going back even tho I live a quarter mile away."}
{"text":"I guess this is one of the better sports bars in the Biltmore area but I still think it misses something... the bar is a great place to watch a game, but the main dining room lacks seats so that everyone can see the game.  While there are lots of TV's they tend to be on one wall so only half the table can see them...  The fat tire and Pyramid everyday beer special is great and the pictures on the walls are awesome... the food is decent... but I still think there could be more...  PS... the video in the bathroom is hilarious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The food is great and the service is great! Ashley is probably the best bar tender I've ever met! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"The mimosa bar on Sundays is tasty and inexpensive. I haven't had the food, but this appears to be a classic sports bar."}
{"text":"First time here food was great are Service was number one or food or drinks came on time would like to give a big two thumbs up to our service Ashley great job will be back again"}
{"text":"I feel that there are much better sports bars in the area you can visit. Half moon is your typical sports bar with young employees who don't care about their work. Their selection of beer and hard alcohol is also lacking in most areas. You will only find the cheap brands here."}
{"text":"Chloe is a friendly, cute server!! :) pizza was delicious and she was great at recommending drinks!"}
{"text":"I came into the restaurant last week, it was my first time and my experience was great. The hostesses were very welcoming and polite! I started my meal off with a Monster Margarita and loved it! Dinner was decent, food was better than the service. Our waitress seemed rather busy and a bit flustered. Another girl delivered our food and checked up on us, Fanny, she was upbeat and very attentive. She definitely turned the attitude of the meal around. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went here last Friday and the bartenders/waitresses were pretty and very attentive, the food was good and the people were friendly.  It's a little pricey compared to other places I have visited in Phoenix and their draft beer selection is very limited but overall this is a great place to have a couple of beers."}
{"text":"This is only a place to watch a game. Staff is wonderful but the food sucks. Also got a mixed drink and it was all sprite.... not like I need a ton of alcohol but at least a little in a mixed drink. So just beer and tv only for this place sorry!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence. Half Moon is almost a 3.5 (or 4) stars establishment...but I'm having a hard time rounding up. The highlights were their appetizers: I didn't verify with our server, but they all tasted like they were made in-house. The apps didn't taste like the typical frozen-from-a-bag fair that you get at a lot of sports bars. The breading was too high quality for that.  The fried zucchini was phenomenal. The boneless chicken wings were good (with a variety of sauces); ours didn't come out very speedily or warm though. The staff was friendly, but it was hard to get service; they'd just disappear for large chunks of time. The ambiance is nice. But, I wish they had more local beers on tap. [*It still puzzles me why EVERY bar in Phoenix doesn't carry the Gold Medal winning Hop Knot IPA from Four Peaks. It's local and one of the best IPAs in the world.]"}
{"text":"VERY disappointed in the service. Had 2 waitresses and we had to go to the bar for napkins, water and beer.  TWICE!!!!.  While playing pool with 2 men the waitress took their order and walked past all 4 of us women.  Will not hurry back!!"}
{"text":"We came in last night to watch the Tigers destroy the Red Sox which was great. We ordered a bunch of apps.  Regular wings - cooked nicely, not rubbery Boneless wings - very meaty, hated the Thai Peanut flavor which I expected to love Calamari - smelled HORRIBLE. Way too fishy smelling. I didn't eat any but the guys said it was OK. Edamame - it's hard to screw up edamame, it was great.   Our server was wonderful, she was attentive and brought us refills and extra plates with out having to ask.   It's close to the house and they have a great happy hour, half off all apps.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So as a born and raised Chicago kid i want to love this place. As it's a cool venue with tons of space, great tvs and a cool patio. I have been there several times however and not had great experiences. I think it comes down to service and the demeanor of the staff. The main issue is we have hosted two post charity events there two years apart. We organize it contact the venue so they know 100 people are showing up at 9-10pm both times they cut their whole staff 1 hour before we arrive so there are 2 bartenders and a couple servers for 100 people. Time to get a cocktail at the bar 30-45 min in most cases, ticket times for food about 45 to an hour.  The staff is very pissy about it to. They could have earn 30-40% more revenue in both cases as people were scared to order food and just did not order drinks. It's really frustrating that after working hard for this charity event for 3 months to show up to a hostile environment to celebrate. Anyway if you looking for a good place to watch sports it fits the bill but i would avoid any large group events or busy days if you are sensitive the a side of attitude. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have been punishing myself going to this place for years because my friends go there to watch football. Today, was the last time, ever! Walked into the bar area and waited for 15 minutes before I finally flagged the bartender down. Then we she walked over she gives me attitude, I wasn't the one talking to my coworkers ignoring everyone at the bar, why should I get attitude? I told her I wanted to order something off of the breakfast menu and she informed me they stop serving at 12:00 (it was 12:08) so I replied,  \"if she had asked me what I wanted to order  when I came in it would have been before noon.\" Her reply'\" I guess, I can go ask them if they can still make something.\" She returned about 5 minutes later and said if I ordered immediately  they would do it, so I did.  About 5 minutes past that, the manager came up to me and told me \"Sorry, they had just thrown all the breakfast away.\" Customer service at its' finest, let me tell ya ! It's not like she doesn't know me, its' not like I'm some grease ball who doesn't tip, I actually over tip.   I think it's telling as you read these reviews, you pretty much get the same subject through all of them, good food, good facilities, TERRIBLE SERVICE !  If I were the management or ownership of this bar I'd be reading these reviews, because your staff just lost my business !  Only reason it is getting one star is because the review won't post without it !"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, fare is standard for a sports bar, they do have a great TV layout for sporting events etc. And staff has always been very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, decent prices and NO COVER FOR PPV events. So one of my buds suggested this place, we got there at 6pm for the WEC  fight a couple of weeks ago and the place was pretty bare. One thing that kinda perplexed me was the lack of beers on tap, but i got over it quickly. We drank a decent amount for a decent price. My biggest complaint was their wings. The medium wings tasted like sweet and sour and a bit fowl (see what i did there). After tasting those crappy wings i decided that the only food i could trust was their alcohol. If you're only going to drink i would recommend hitting up this spot."}
{"text":"Food - average. Decent Ambience - cool enough, lots of tvs and activities  Service- great. Polite and honest. No complaints Price - overpriced. I paid $24 for a bottle of guinness and nachos. I would say you'll pay about $4 more compared to Zipps or any other main stream sports grill not in happy hour  Recommendation- you can try this place out. see for yourself. I would only go here if I do not want to drive and go to BJs or Zipps."}
{"text":"Had to split the stars in half.  Service - five stars. Drinks - five stars.  I ended up eating three different meals here over the course of my visit to PHX (and not just because of the hot waitresses!), and not ONE of them was even remotely edible. There isn't enough alcohol to make their food good. So, food - one star.   If you're going there for the drinks and the views, though - definitely worthwhile."}
{"text":"Came for the ufc fights. We were sitting out on the patio. There was no sound on the tv's out here. We did however have to listen to three drink chicks. They broke glasses on three occasions the third time it was multiple glasses. The server wasn't coming out fast enough for them to get more drinks. They fell off the wall and thought the waitress should given them more shots. Seems to me this group needed to be cut off. Management should have stepped in and made them leave. I do have to say on the plus side the Chicago fries were yummy"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!!!! I used to love it a few years back, but now the food and drinks are terrible!! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I checked out Half Moon on a Saturday afternoon to watch the SEC championship game. It seems as if the LSU alumni association chapter out here has a deal that they get one of the back rooms for game watching which is pretty cool (I'm not an LSU alum or a SEC fan...go Big 10!). The back room is pretty small, but it was the perfect size for the amount of LSU fans that showed up.   Our waitress was not very good at all. She never came back with ketchup after a friend asked for it. My table started with chips and queso as an appetizer.  The queso was pretty disgusting in my opinion and the chips were a tad too salty for my taste.  My BLT wrap was OK. The bacon was pretty well done like I requested, but the lettuce and tomato definitely dominated the sandwich. The beers were pretty cheap which I liked. The one thing I didn't understand was that the waitress requested a credit card from each of us upon our first order to start a tab.  I haven't encountered that in other restaurants so it threw me off guard.  I didn't even get an option of paying cash, as everything was charged to my card when the bill came out.  The actual restaurant area was a bit small, but the bar area was good sized. There was a nice outdoor patio with a fire pit as well. I would definitely go check it out again for happy hour, but probably not another sporting event."}
{"text":"We frequent all the time for Chicago sports games. A great place to hang out and great happy hour deals. Our server Andrea is fantastic.  The owner clay is awesome too."}
{"text":"Best place to watch a sporting event with sound. The speakers are all in surround sound. Even if it's loud you can hear the game being played. Alex is a great bartender with friendly attitude and efficient service.   The food is a little over priced for what you receive but decent drink specials. If your a Blackhawks, Bears or Cubs fan it's always jumping on those games."}
{"text":"Definitely use your GPS since this place is a little tucked away by the hotel. The happy hour prices are amazing ($3-$5 drinks and $5 apps) and service is great. They have a ton of TVs both inside and on the patio. I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese that came with the pretzels, very watery, but the buffalo dip is good. It's big enough for a large group of friends yet still small enough it's not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Great place where everyone remembers your name.   The cooks are all incredibly well trained and the food prices are within reach."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Very friendly staff!! I will definitely come back! Very good environment to watch a game or hang out with buddies. Jeff at the bar was great!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why Half Moon is listed as a '$' place. I would go 2 '$'. The daily specials are a great deal (especially the $4 Long Island/Long Beaches all day)... but it stops there. You open the menu to be greeted with $9 mozzarella sticks... Who charges $9 for deep fried mozzarella?  The service is decent if you sit inside. The wait staff was clearly hired for their looks, not their intelligence. Bartenders know how to pour a drink. They only have 2 draft beers on tap, so if you are a big fan of anything but Coors Light and a rotating craft brew don't look for draft.  I'd recommend the wings or the burgers. The prime rib sliders are out of this world.   Free UFC fights!"}
{"text":"Good Food and service.  Defiantly a higher level of sports bar food."}
{"text":"Half-Moon has the best bar food in the valley hands down and the happy hour is very good in my option. Do yourself a favor and get the Buffalo Dip!"}
{"text":"Wally rules! Lindsay and Randy are pretty cool too! Everybody that works here is pretty awesome. Good people. Good service."}
{"text":"First off, NICE BIG TV SCREENS TO WATCH SPORTS... Always a plus for me. It was decent bar food... I shared some nachos and wings but the highlight was the BIG Pretzel. It was really good especially with Hot Mustard.   A little upset that they were so limited to beers on draft. For a sports grill, that is a big no-no for me."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience working with Richard Kim to reserve space for a fantasy football draft at the Moon Valley location. Richard went out of his way to set us up in a semi-private room including tracking down extra power strips to plug in laptops and even getting out a ladder to fix a burned out light bulb. What made this more impressive was HE DID THIS ALL ON HIS DAY OFF. Service was great, beer was cold, and food was good. Can't recommend this place and Richard Kim more, especially for a fantasy football draft."}
{"text":"I already don't like football that much, but I like bar food and drinks.  My boyfriend is a fan of a certain Midwestern team that is often not shown in bars around here. We called ahead and they said yes, come on down, we are playing it.  Once we arrived we asked to sit in that section.  The television they played it on was on the wall of the long booth near the bar, sort of a weird angle to try to watch it.  With craned necks, we asked if they would consider switching us to an area in their mostly empty restaurant to be more comfortable.  We were told no.  We ordered some food, and it was very low quality.  With such a great location and less than 10 feet away from a Whole Foods, how can an establishment serve such a  mediocre burger and mushy chicken wings?  Next, I'd like to address the soda gun on the bar that is available for the waitresses to use.  It is not attached to a holder.  It is used and placed on the bar counter where the bartender passes the drinks.  I saw the soda gun used for multiple refills and get knocked into the trashcan below.  The waitresses would retrieve it and replace it on the bar without even a swipe of the sanitizer towel.  I would only recommend to order bottled beer as it is the safest item to consume here. By the way, everything is sticky."}
{"text":"it's been a whille since i have been here actually haven't been there since the renovation and man i think they did a pretty good job! drinks were on point and I'll be a customer once again."}
{"text":"I really like the waitstaff and bartenders here. I am in town for 2 weekends a month and they still remeber my name. The calimari is delicious, the burgers are tasty, the wings are meaty. The only flavor I don't reccomend is the hot. It really isn't a flavor, more of a temperature. I also love the outside patios with pool tables."}
{"text":"Two stars for the hard if harried work of our waitress. Otherwise, this place was awful. It was a busy night due to the MMA fights what is this an excuse to be unable to produce drinks within 30 minutes and get food orders right? How about another 20 minutes plus to pay the bill at the end of the evening? Staff kept explaining that they were very busy. Did they not expect to fill the bar? Drinks were mediocre because the ice had melted significantly by the time the drinks made their way to the table. Fried calamari tasted like something from Long John Silver's. Hummus was good. Wings were average. When I spoke to the manager and explained that I could not go to his establishment anymore if service was going to be like this his reply was, \"then don't.\" Unlike his waitstaff, I don't need to be told things twice."}
{"text":"Awesome bar great food great atmosphere. Came here right after moving here from Chicago. Owner sat with us and gave us free tshirt"}
{"text":"I may have been in a really good mood when I went here in November, but I really liked this place.  The parking situation during Happy Hour is not so good, but we made do parking across the street.  The only thing I've had is appetizers and there was this cream cheese and chicken dip served with a huge bowl of tortilla chips for 5 bucks that is to die for.  I believe my 2 beers were about $2 bucks, but I don't really remember because I was watching my Chargers beat San Francisco.  For a sports grill, they made it so even if you were in the bathroom you would not miss any of the game.  Gotta love a T.V even in the girls restroom.  Nice!"}
{"text":"So the foods not excellent but then again, hold on - its a sports bar and as far as sports bar food goes, its pretty darn good. The kitchen closes only at 12 and the bars open till 2 which gives me ample time to get off work at 10 PM, drive home , get out of scruffy clothes and go grab a drink and kick back. And just when I think I would be the only 'loser'(sic) at the bar the place is rather filled even on a Monday night !   They carry shocktop - my new fav beer which makes them more awesome. And the service is friendly (although this can be a bit slow) but then I could always look past it. I wasnt going anywhere anyways !   For the smokers who must complain they dont have a place to smoke the fire pit outside serves them well and the Marlboro man has enough and more space to make his stand.   All in all its a pretty good place to hang out and just chill."}
{"text":"Great neighbor spot for a game or happy hour , fish fry on Friday is not to be missed , friendly bartenders , good food , cold beer"}
{"text":"I've read the reviews AFTER my very own first visit, but I'd have to agree with most of the yelpers. Food is OUTSTANDING...at least the boneless wings that I had tried. I also like that there is a variety of beer on tap to satisfy the boy in me! Furthermore, I also agree that the place appears to be clean and nicely decorated...parking is easy in their private lot (this is HUGE for my impatient and against-forcing-customers-to-valet-park-even-if-\"free\" self!!!) ...plenty of TVs for the sports fans...BUT...the wait staff does a disappearing act about halfway through my meal. She was attentive at the beginning, but when I needed more sauce for my wings -POOF- she was gone- now you see her, now you don't!  Even after I was eating my tasty wings WITH NOTHING TO DIP IT IN, I could not find her to cash out. After reading the reviews that give props to the food and the place in general, I would think that management would put emphasis on making sure that superb customer service is delivered. I'm giving HM four stars because my overall visit was a good experience. I'm going to give them a get outta jail free card on the customer service aspect and will try them another day. I would like to check them out for a UFC fight night."}
{"text":"This brings the heart of Chicago to Phoenix!  JoJo is an amazing bartender.  I highly recommend Half Moon"}
{"text":"So my boy friend and I come here a lot. I like coming for the long islands and karaoke. A couple of the bartenders are rude though. This one Mexican dude, and candy. We walked in there sat down one night at the the bar. The Mexican dude and some other girl were both just standing around flirting with other customers, they knew we were sitting there. I almost walked out. Then candy is just rude whenever we order from her. I guess you could say the service sucks but everything else is OK."}
{"text":"This place gets the nod whenever I feel the urge to watch my sporting event amongst drunken strangers.  The screens are nice, plentiful and accommodating.  And the clincher is that this place has the best food of the sports bar category."}
{"text":"I like coming here because it is the ideal sports fans bar. There are tvs absolutely everywhere: Up behind the bar, over by all the tables, above the pool table, in the back rooms and outside on the patio. That means I can literally watch football from wherever it is I am either sitting or standing. Can it get any better? Oh, well yes, it can. Their wings are just out of this world delicious and finger licking good. I always get them crispy and lightly dipped in the sweet chili sauce. It is spicy and kinda tangy just like I like them. If you don't order them crispy though, they come out a bit underdone in my opinion. I have found that it is just easier to tell them exactly how I like them instead of expecting them to figure it out. that way I am happy and in turn they are as well. My hats off to you all the work here, see you Sunday!!"}
{"text":"I love their BBQ wings its the best an they have the nicest patio .. An they open till 2 which is perfect for people who work late"}
{"text":"We have a fan club for the Arizona Rattlers and Half Moon is a new sponsor, so we organized game watch parties here.  The staff has been terrific, taking good care of us, even as we got in their way and made tons of noise!  Food was great and the drinks were delivered quickly!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a bad place to go, our waitress had zero personality though and I'm someone that's big on service, otherwise I'd given a 4 star"}
{"text":"I decided to branch out and try a different sports bar near me for a Cardinals game. The place, as I expect on game day was full of patrons. One thing it was not full of was busers and bar backs. The place is a logistical servers nightmare. The tables were full of half empty beer bottles and the poor wait staff not only had to try and serve everyone but keep the tables clean. That my friends, and I timed it on my phone, made for a 25 minute wait before a server came to our table for the first time which was full of empty glasses and beer bottles. That is new record wait time for speaking to a server.  Our server was nice, but they they were all drowning.  As far as food, the wings I had were good and place is big and has a ton of TVs and a big patio which is why I give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my family and it's always good. They have a pretty decent draft selection and the wings are above average (they come in your choice of 4 or 5 different sauces). Prices are fair and we usually sit out on the deck which is nice.  ."}
{"text":"Customer service is a culture not a option and half moon must have good managers because everyone is trained to be attentive supportive and informative, it truly seems like a family or team rather than a staff of turnover teenagers, there are many options in the area but give this place a try; it's a Hidden Gem. The food is exceptional and the drinks are cold and plentiful. I met the manager Shelby and feel as though she has created a customer-centric environment. Give this place a try  You will not be  disappointed"}
{"text":"I am on the fence about this place. While I love the fact that they have so many tv's and the dos Equis is $3 all day long, the food and service is mediocre. We have been going there since last summer ( we moved in right across the street) and we have had good service and horrible service. Besides the wings and chicken tenders, the rest of the food is blah and over priced. When we started going to half moon, they had an awesome happy hour, now it's horrible. We used to go there 2-3 times a week and spend a generous amount of money to watch games, but now things have changed horribly that we might go there 1-2 times a month (and that's if we really don't want to go anywhere else). I won't discourage anyone from going there, but don't set your standards super high."}
{"text":"Feel like getting ignored by the female bartenders while getting hit on by drunk old dudes and paying for short poured shots? Then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Half Moon is \"A-OK\" as my 3 star Rating suggests.  It's a very decent sports bar in my hood, so I'm happy to report that they carry some good brews and have some decent beer specials.  They currently have $3 Mirror Pond pale ale and porter bottles all day every day, which is pretty awesome.  For food, we enjoyed their Mozzarella sticks, which are pretty good, except for the price ($9). Luckily, it was happy hour so they were half price at the time, which is about what they're worth. I can't imagine paying $9 for mozzarella sticks normally.  Since I'm all veggie all the time, my entree choices there are limited. Basically I can choose from a salad, a grilled cheese or a pasta primavera.  This time, I opted for the pear gorgonzola salad, which I have also enjoyed on a previous occasion.  It really is a delicious salad, with mixed greens, candied pecans, pear slices, gorgonzola cheese crumbles all topped with a dressing of sweet vinagrette & oil. I do wish the salad had a bit more pear on it.  So what makes them just \"A-OK\", well, our service was pretty lackluster on this occasion. The waitress took a long time to make her initial visit after we were seated. I'm talking at least 10 minutes, maybe 15. After that, she disappeared for long periods of time, including when we were ready to pay our bill. The place was busy though, but I didn't see her helping other people, just not being around. This may have just been an isolated incident though, as our service has been just fine there in the past.  The other problem they had today was that they were \"out of stock\" of their highly touted $3 Mirror Pond pale ales, which was exactly what we wanted.  I'd also like to see other veg-friendly item on the menu, like a veggie burger or something else.  I'm sure I'll be back, I just hope that they're not out of stock of their #1 beer special and that the service is better next time."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best bar to watch a game, or just to hang out at.  The food is excellent.  I absolutely love the pizza, Italian beef and chi fries!  I can't even call it bar food, because it far exceeds any bar food.  We always have such a great time here, and the people and staff are great!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the theme of this place and think it could definitely be a national chain.  I use to go up to the north Phoenix location back in the day for their cheap Long Island Ice teas and great food, and all their big screen TV's to watch all the games on.  The service at this location is great but the food is not what it is at their northern location and I think it is a little pricier because they are so close to the Biltmore. They also don't have the Long Islands!!  In any event if you want to have a chill place to watch the game I would definitely advise going here for drinks.   Would probably opt out on the food...they are a bit off if you have eaten at any of there other locations."}
{"text":"The food is good here with a wide assortment of classic bar food and a little more upscale cuisine. This place is UFC central. They carry all of the fights and the crowds come in for the action.   Meals are reasonably priced. There is a large patio out back for the smokers. I don't think they service food out there but I could be wrong. They have pool tables and lots of Tv's to catch the action. Staff have always been really nice when we have been there. It's a good stop for drinks and chow. #Vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Not bad. Claims to be a Chicago style place. I can say, being originally from Chicagoland area, the wings and pizza was not Chicago style. The chicken was very good, moist and done perfectly, but the sauce was subpar for buffalo wings. The pizza was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. Doesn't compare to what you'd get in Chicago."}
{"text":"This sports bar is walking distance from my house and I visit their often. They always have great service and a great happy hour menu! This is a very inviting atmosphere with pool tables and darts to have some fun.  When the weather is nice the huge patio area is available for seating and even has an outdoor pool table. I defiantly would recommend this place to others to go for good food and a fun environment!"}
{"text":"Half Moon living to its name. I'd give it half a star if j could. Are you kidding me? My roommate just bought us food from here tonight. First timers here. I ordered fish n  chips and literally got 2 small pieces of so called \"fish\" and literally 10 little tiny pieces of fries!! ive never had fish and chips the size of a happy meal from a cafeteria from a bar! My roommate ordered the Arizona chicken salad......where TF is the chicken???  Not even there. Come on. I never write bad reviews but come on...."}
{"text":"If you like sports and Chicago grub then this is your place, period. Upon walking in, I immediately noticed the plentiful flat screens everywhere I turned. I must have counted 40 flat screen TVs. There are several sections of Half Moon Sports Grill, including a back room with a stage that would make for a good private event. I truly is the perfect location for a sports game.   Besides the massive amounts of TVs and plenty of seating, Half Moon Sports Grill also has good food! Owned by Chicago natives, this is your one-stop-shop for Windy City eats. I've enjoyed their pizza, Italian Beefs and sausages, all of which are flavorful and filling. It's perfect food to enjoy while watching a sporting event and enjoying a beer or three. They have a spacious bar and sit-down seating, so you could either come with your family or come with friends."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to watch the UFC 200 on Saturday night with some friends. We got there early around 5 to get a table but everything inside was reserved unless we were willing to pay a $250 fee that could be used for the tab. We ended up sitting outside on the patio which ended up being a total disaster. The tables literally had holes in them and were so warped and broken that you could not even set your drink down. The flys were everywhere drawn in by the bags of trash the bar tenders kept setting by the door. Their \"misters\" came on about every 10 minutes and then dripped the rest of the time on guests and food. We were soaked, sweaty and ready to just leave when the fight was over. The food was ok, but everything else was dirty, gross and the waitresses were really snobby and rude."}
{"text":"Very good customer service on a Sunday morning. Lots of TVs to watch all the games. The buffalo chicken dip was delicious! Happy hour special was a great deal for Sunday!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends on a Friday after work. It wasn't too crowded, but it was still pretty early. I just got a couple of the $2 house wines, but my friends got the dollar margs and some lettuce wrap fish tacos. Pretty chill spot overall, good starter with cheap specials if you're planning to continue elsewhere."}
{"text":"In addition to being a Chicago bar with great food, they will be showing all of the World Cup games!!"}
{"text":"Ashley.  Best manager I have ever come  In contact with.  Knows hers surroundings!  I can't say enough good about her or  this place. Go there for sure. You'll love it"}
{"text":"This was the only place near by I considered an option for stealing a delicious beer during lunch (which at the time was 6pm) to deal with the hell that is Big Box Office Land. Of course, Moes next door always has dirt cheap domestic beers (top secret!), but not really a place to relax and enjoy a beer or two with friends.  It is a really BIG place, and I have never seen it filled. The servers are sweet, but seriously lacking in the getting the drink order and getting the check department. The first time I came there, I had to find someone to just run my card since we had to get back to work-LAME. There are PLENTY of other office space dwellers that frequent here happy hour time, so be prepared for a rather eclectic (yet oddly generic) mix of people at this bar-there are plenty of office flirations and gossip being played out here. The beer selection isn't fantastic and their prices are east coast range average, which is pretty lame, but I always enjoyed whatever I ordered.  That being said, their Frito Pie appetizer may be the most disgusting and delicious food item I have paid for. It seriously tastes like something my stoner brother in high school would have concocted at 3:30am to eat while watching MTVs Headbanger Ball. \"Layers of fritos, chili, cheddar cheese, sour cream, onions & tomato\", reads the on-line menu....yeah people. Its fucking DELISH. And its almost 9 bucks! Yeah,,,you see the problem. The fries are tasty..and too much. They do have soy beans...for 4 bucks, the most I have ever seen edamame for-and while they can replace any burger with a veggie burger, the burgers cost like 9 bucks! I could buy two big packages of veggie burgers easy for that amount!   So not really a destination bar, more like a \"well...this is the only bar\" kind of bar. But if you give your full order when you first sit down and give the waiter your card to run, you will enjoy your time much more since it won't be wasted waiting for beer or checks."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Came in with my friends for some lunch. The server Mary recommended their pick 2 special, however we went with regular lunch menu. We had 2 burgers a pizza and chicken sandwich. Food came out quickly and delicious. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Awesome burger,  great sweet onion rings and wings are very tasty. It is loud but great to catch some sports on the many tv's. Patio is dog friendly though no pups with us tonight. And $5 long Island iced teas to boot. Great neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Holy Calamari! This place actually has really good Calamari. It shocked me it was better than some high end places serving this as an appetizer. The happy hour price was half off. This dish only costed me $6 dollars hard to bet that deal. I would have given it four stars except I was not as crazy about the boneless chicken wings. Had I only ordered the one dish this would be a better review. Expect to see me back at the Half Moon to get this tasty little sea fritters. Really good happy hour here people with a nice vibe. Perfect place to pregame with some drinks before you hit some nightlife."}
{"text":"So this used to be a five star place. A few months ago I wrote a review about the changes in the menu that made me switch it to a one star review.   I came back tonight for the first time since to watch the Wildcats game and drink a beer. They are now charging a $5 cover. Are you kidding me? We aren't in downtown Scottsdale. Goodbye. Never again. Such greed. Wow"}
{"text":"I thought I'd review this place as I've been watching soccer games here. This is a sports bar. There are a million screens to watch all kinds of sports on from all different spots. The place is fairly large, with 2 bars, booths and tables, an outdoor seating area with misters and TVs, and some back rooms that seem to have enormous TVs set up. I've sat at the bar all times I've been (during the day) and have received pretty prompt service. They only have 1 beer on tap, and not a huge selection, which seems strange for a sports bar. Their food is also mediocre at best; I had a salad that was only OK, and boneless chicken wings that were less than OK. The real draw here is all the sports broadcasting. They had both soccer games up on screens next to each other last time I went, so we could easily go back and forth between the games. I would say that this is the bar's redeeming quality.  Pros: Good place to WATCH sports, lots of TVs            Friendly servers  Cons: Food and beer"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Food is always delicious! Great atmosphere with plenty of T.V.s to watch and gorgeous staff!"}
{"text":"2 stars only for the Hal way decent food, and cold beer. But they don't fill your beer glass all the up, maddening. As for the service, 1/2 star. Our waitress was terrible. She took a very long time to bring beverages, we are talking 30 mins at some points.  Go elsewhere!! Plus the crowd is obnoxious. ***UPDATE*** The owner got ahold of me concerning my review. While I stick to my original review I would like to acknowledge that the owner took the time to reply to me to try for another chance/review. If I stop in again I will perhaps change my opinion, or they will help change my opinion."}
{"text":"Half Moon is a great place to grab a burger and watch some sports. Friendly service. They have delicious wings, bone in or out! I LOVE the SWEET CHILI sauce, but they have the standard flavors as well. If you're a dessert eater, the baked chocolate cookie & ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"Myself and two friends hit it the place in time for happy hour, and I have to say, the food was great. we got two different kinds of wings (sweet chile and honey chipotle) and those were probably some of the best wings I've had in town in awhile. Meaty, crispy, the sauces were delicious. We also got a small cheese thin-crust pizza, which I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  The drinks were strong and tasty, and I honestly didn't mind paying full-price once we decided to continue on after happy hour ended. I recommend the Chicago Bull if you're a fan of ginger anything, like me.  I would say if you're not there on happy hour the food/drink might be a little on the pricey side, but the quality speaks for itself overall.   Can't review the waitresses since we sat at the bar, but were I attracted to the ladies, the verdict would be \"Schwing!\"    The bartenders were quick, super attentive and accommodating. I'm normally one to just kind of let them work but they were all very friendly and sociable in a genuine way. They were waiting on us, not working us for a tip. Refreshing!  Shout out to Autumn and especially Dan for taking care of us drunken brauds on a Friday night. Thank you. :)"}
{"text":"The. Best. Pretzel bun! 1/2 priced burgers on weekends! The tap beer selection has improved. Yep, I'm a fan!  PS I never noticed the \"detail\" in the artwork that reinforces the Half Moon name, until someone broke it down for me. Now, I can't miss it and I think it's BRILLIANT! :)"}
{"text":"I love half moon sports grill! The service at this location is amazing and everyone always seems so happy!:) my girlfriend lives up the street, so we always go when I go over. We love always sitting outside! Perfect patio! The food here is amazing. I'm a big wing fan and I haven't had one I don't love! They have a good happy hour and great Sunday specials!"}
{"text":"Remember those old sponges in elementary school that no one wrung out for weeks and it has a strong musty odor? How about an old mop bucket with water that hasn't been changed in a week? That's what this place is like, it stinks from when you first walk in the door. I couldn't believe the manager didn't do anything about it. The bar service is mediocre, (they seem to pick and choose based on who they know), and the drinks are average. The patio with pool tables are nice, (and it gets you out of the mop bucket), we ordered food which was good but I was highly suspicious being if the restaurant stunk what was the kitchen's shortcomings.   Not a fan of this place. I can still smell the stench! There are WAY better sports bars to spend your money nearby."}
{"text":"Great food and cold beer. The service here is great and the atmosphere can't be beat. If your looking for  a place to watch a game or have some good wings check this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent bar food, great service, fair prices. The team atmosphere among the staff really helps create a good environment."}
{"text":"Samie was great she told us about the new tacos and they were amazing! Love the service and the food!"}
{"text":"Such a cool hangout spot to meetup with friends after work. Happy Hour is until 7pm, which gives us 9 to 5'ers a chance to take advantage of the half off prices. The music is a versatile which is great and gives a person a chance to listen to a variety. I ordered the calamari, it was okay,  nothing to brag about. However loved my margarita...A nice clean, orderly establishment ran my millennials."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are great. I love the atmosphere and everyone was really nice, I am not big on sports bars but this one I truly didn't mind eating at. Def will come back and bring more friends along!!!"}
{"text":"This is typical neighborhood bar and grill type food. The beer is cold, the service was good enough and the food was eatable. It does get a bit crowded at times and not always with patrons I want to be around."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with a friend that lives in the area.  We always sit at the bar, and recently I've noticed a decline in the service.  It takes forever to get someone to take our order, grab a fresh beer, bring our bill, etc.  The bartenders are definitely more interested in their personal conversations than serving their customers. The happy hour specials are really nothing special either.  The burgers are pretty good, but that's about it and I don't indulge in burgers very often so.....  Next time I meet my friend for happy hour, I'm suggesting somewhere new!"}
{"text":"This was my first and only visti to this sports grill.  Went there for lunch today and I will never ever go back.  Unless you are a male or have a male in your party good luck getting any service.   The men got refills on their drinks four or five time, my female cowork and I had to ask for the one refill that we did get.  The men got their food in a timely manner, we had to ask how much longer for our food, maybe she didn't put our order in right away.   We both had burgers and needless to say they were nothing great.  The bun used on the burger takes away from all the other flavors in the burger.  The food was just plain,  When we were done eating I had to go find our serve to get our check.  We spent almost an hour in this place and it wasn't very busy.  All the other tables seated after us were empty and cleaned up and we still had our dirty dishes sitting there.  Again, not a good place for two females to got grab a bite at."}
{"text":"Good menu and great sports watching for the business casual crowd.   I'd been to their other location around Central & Greenway, so I knew what I was in for.   There's great sports watching from every seat in the house, which was essential for Monday Night Football. The sound is perfect as well--loud enough to yell at the screen without looking like too much of a weirdo.   The food is good as well. Wings are stellar, and on Tues/Thurs you can score killer deals! The pizza and burgers are just OK, but you really can't go wrong with these. Just make sure your tongue is trained if you wanna try the nuclear variety. ;-)   Drinks are inexpensive while still packing a punch. The Tropical Breeze, with coconut vodka, rum, and some juice was hella groovy. And best of all...service rocked. Every single server was helpful! I would return for happy hour on a weekday any time."}
{"text":"Went to Half Moon to watch the UFC fights and thought it was a great set up. Rather than seating you in a random place they ask what event you're watching so they can place you with the same fans and sporting event. The food was bar food, but their burgers are half priced $4 on Saturday and Sunday all day so not bad. It's a huge establishment but fills up quick so get there early."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. The margarita was terrible and we ordered the chicken wings and they were tiny and chewy.  Not good at all. And for sure not a pound! Definitely would not go back.  There are too many good places to go for wings and margaritas. I suggest do it better or do something different! The bartender was nice though and very attentive."}
{"text":"We got a calendar from Half Moon on Super Bowl Sunday and have gone in many times since then.  There are free items when you buy the calendar every month.  Happy hour and reverse happy hours are great with $3 draft beers and half off wings and other apps. My husband is a huge fan of the wings!"}
{"text":"I had mini date night and we decided to come here on a whim. I mean it is close to my house so why not. Plus they have reverse happy hour and their boneless wings were on special in which they were half off all month with any drink purchase. Score. My friend decided that he wanted to try the Eclipse Burger challenge in which included 3 half pound angus patties, topped with 4 strips of bacon, cheddar and swiss cheese with crispy onions and a side of fries. If he finished it, he got a t-shirt and his picture placed on the wall. Well he finished it with no problem. He doesn't eat like that all the time and he said that he was full but not overly stuffed. Kudos to him. It looked amazing and I so wanted a bite, but alas he had to finish it all himself. Hmm maybe next time I will try. LOL ( NOT!)"}
{"text":"4 stars because the manager was nice to me. The food and service is good. They've got a great catering service (after talking to the chef.)  A lot of tv's. Good for groups. Try it out a few times and see for yourself.   Cheers."}
{"text":"For the longest time I didn't care much for this place. Recently I got a new job in the area and I've found myself catching a lunch or two there. My perception was a little dreary, but after the few times going for lunch I'm in love. The bartenders are not only gorgeous, but the food is impeccable! Great burgers, wings, and probably so much more I haven't tried yet.   It looks like they have a professional chef whipping up all the goodies.   Awesome place, check it out.."}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  This place is fun.  I had a salad and my hubby had a club sandwich with fries.  I will be back.  They have a pool table if you like playing.  They have plenty tvs if you like watching sports.  The music is loud but I like it.  I will be back.  I am visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"The name, Half Moon, is not referring to the beautiful beach in California, no, it is actually referring to the extremely short shirts that all of the girls wear, even ones that probably shouldn't (sorry). Anyways, the food was bland, the atmosphere was dull, and the service was tepid.  This is generally the type of place I try hard to avoid."}
{"text":"The Waite staff is wonderful.  We had so much fun watching sports having a wonderful variety of appatizers to munch on made the experience even better."}
{"text":"Went here for Monday Night Football. Great Sport for Bears Fans!!  They have a ton of TV's and 3 big screen projectors. Great food for a sports bar as well...  Half Moon is a relax chill sport to hang out afterwards as well. We had Great service and drinks were resonable....   It has a big Patio as well, looks like it could use a lil remodel however. Otherwise this place is great. You should go check it out."}
{"text":"We came to Half Moon Sports Grill to watch the UFC Fight. It's a nice big place, yet we had to get there early since it filled up quick.   The place is fun, the girls wear short skirts and knee socks. They have a full list of local beers in bottles and on draft. They boast a monthly special, which July's is a burger for 1/2 price if you buy a drink. That's almost $4.50 for a giant burger with fries. Unfortunately I was full from lunch and did some light snacking with my beer drinking.   First up, I wanted the Watermelon Wheat - Perfect for any hot Arizona day (which is most of them) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#MrdXI7O_NSKVvqgGTcIYOA  Then, the Dirty Guera Blonde Ale, because I love blonde ales and cute names. It was great and encouraged us to visit Nimbus the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#5nzmTTMOmGj_sVIxkTM51Q  In between, we ordered a couple appetizers, a gigantic pretzel that was served with both queso and mustard. I love to dipp! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#lMQuuVAuKQAL-RKfEYkPWg And my guy ordered the Prime Rib Sliders (4) served with carmalized onions, french dip sauce and horseradish. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#seP7cR-l6f3xjnJtzFQIxA That was a meal in itself, really.   For Dessert, I ordered the White Chocolate Ale which was by far the most dessert tasting beers I have ever tried. It was so much like a sweet white chcolate, you really need to savor every sip. If you see this anywhere, order it and thank me later. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iB9By3dVS6BydSUiDHxLyw?select=0TZG-EndU48FUsm_K39bmQ#1jzaMBgdEa9YyVasa8rukQ  After all that, I needed a couple sugar free Red Bulls to snap myself back in action. We had a fight to watch and I was not going to be the first to TAP OUT."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Beer selection isn't bad either. Service was friendly and attentive. Would definitely make this my usual place to go. I also love how they have a lot of tvs for game days."}
{"text":"Food is blah.  Maybe because I went for the seafood dishes in the middle of the desert... service is good, so is the beer.  Atmosphere is nice outside (except for the smokers)... the only real complaint was the food - which is.... you know.... kinda important."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly staff with lots of TVs to see the game. Food was really good for bar food. We had the pretzels and wings - both of which I was surprised by the quality."}
{"text":"The occasion was not planned but the starters menus with the happy hour prices until 7pm was nice ! I did have the usual calamari plate and the buffalo chicken dip to compliment the refreshing local Papago orange blossom ! Service was outstanding and you know you you are ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"Great service & food....and it was packed. I would definitely recommend but also visit again."}
{"text":"Boy-o, have I've put in some good hours here at The Half Moon, particularly because many of my friends-slash-footie-teammates are servers, bartenders, and managers and insist that we drink their booze whilst we watch them work, i suppose.   Inevitably, this ends up as a free-for-all alcohol orgy that will always involve several Mechiladas (they will make em for you if you write the recipe down on a napkin with the special, final ingredient being \"lots of love\" as a reminder not to forget the extra love that goes into a perfect Mechi), some chick-shots that sadly include Red Bull and something else equally garish so that it tastes like almost-flat Squirt, a death swig of Wild Turkey out of the fanciest slingback shoe in the group (If you do two consecutively, we call it a \"Bingo-Bango\"), several double-tall Vodka/Soda/Lemons, 250 Parliament Ultra Light cigarettes, and a single Chicken Caesar Wrap.  By this time, I am usually craning my neck to see the HM's awkwardly placed LCD screens and drunkenly rambling very loudly about how \"Tim Duncan can suck my cock\" (2005), or how \"Nowitzki can suck my cock\" (2006), or how \"I wish I had multiple cocks so the whole city of San Antonio can suck my cocks and then beat David Stern with them about the neck and chest until he begged for clemency from my multiple cock beat-down\" (2007).  Anyway, this location is a decent spot for some casual game-watching, but IMO, not for the nexus of critical game watching, like your alma mater playing your sister-kissin rivals from that fucktarded state to the (east/west/south/north).  My buddies and I particularly like catching the US Men's National (soccer) Team here -- once they even put it on the Mexican Channel to enhance the excitement!  Later arriving patrons seemed very cautious and confused upon entry, but felt the Sunday mechilada love as we put a \"Dos-a-uno\" mudholing on 'El Pinche Tri' (Mexican MNT).  The staff here is friendly enough to put it on any channel you'd like too -- I've had to specially request the Titans game on a few occasions (why the fuck doesn't anyone like to watch Tennessee, anyway?) without any kind of eye-rolling despair from the bartenders/servers.  Its also surprisingly entertaining as a pre-bars destination or even before that for Happy Hour.  The mood is more \"lounge\" than \"sports bar\"    One thing I always thought was unusual, however, was the lack of taps.  I mean, there is no draft beer at all.  And their Mexican Beer selection could use a little upgrading from the college selections (Corona, Dos XX) to the big boys (Negra Modelo, Bohemia).  Otherwise, this is a pretty cool bar in a typically stuffy part of town."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Half Moon in North Phoenix.  The food is amazingly good for a sports bar!  My favorite is the Greek Salad!  They also do special menus on holidays -- this past year we did a low-key Valentines date and were pleasantly surprised they offered a \"coursed\" dinner.   Also, the wait staff is dressed super cute without it being a \"breastaurant\".  It's kid friendly in the dining area."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to watch UFC. Then new management took over and food quality stood in the high dive and jumped off. The burgers - previously very good- are garbage. Gone is the quality cheese. Enter the crappy Kraft slices in plastic wrap. Think McDonalds and you won't be disappointed. Campbell's soup is better. Honestly. The dessert we tried was the saving grace. Our server was great - very on point. Overall we will probably not come back."}
{"text":"I don't see why people complain. It's nice to be able to go to a bar later at night and have a few good drinks and chat. I been here a few times. Service is not the greatest or fastest, but a pretty busy and nice spot to enjoy late night friends gatherings and watch some games."}
{"text":"We used to really like this place, but lately they keep disappointing us.    Good things:  They have all night drink specials, so if the game goes past happy hour, its not a big deal.  Lots of TVs, good atmosphere, good food, never overly busy to accomodate a group.  Their food is pretty good and drink prices are fair.  Some of the wait staff are nice.  Bad things: They've changed their menu a little bit so some things aren't included in happy hour appetizers anymore- throw some chicken tenders or something in there please.  A girl can only eat so many chips.  They need to get more beers on tap- that's just weird for a sports bar.  But my biggest complaint.  If I'm coming to a sports bar, it's to watch a game.  Don't take 15 minutes to get it on the TV.  And if there is a group of 5-10 people sitting in front of a TV cheering on our team, don't change my channel.  This has happened a couple times at this place.  And it's not like there aren't a million other TVs that nobody is watching- this place isn't that busy.  They need to get a more organized process for managing the TVs.  Most sports bars walk up to the TV, point at it, and ask if anyone would mind if they change it....sounds fairly simple.  And seriously, if we start screaming when you change the TV, don't fill 5 people's beers before you put my game back on."}
{"text":"So as my first time here at the bar I heard somewhat good and bad reviews from friends so I decided to go check this place out. I was taking a look at the menu and I realized there are some options for bone-in and boneless wings with a few different varieties on sauces. I asked the waitress the differences between traditional and grilled for each of the wings and asked for a recommendation for sauces which she said the \"sweet chili\". I told her that I will order 12 wings, 6 of them being boneless and 6 being bone-in which I am pretty sure she either wrote down and took notes. Later I received the wings burnt and pretty much uneatable with all the wings being bone-in. I asked her what happened to the half and half she responded with \"you can't mix the bone-in and boneless together\". If I was told that from before I would have changed my order and the fact you brought something else kinda just told me she really didn't care much. At least what she could have done was re-make the order or tell me in advance that I couldn't have order the way I did. So thank you, Half Moon for the burnt and tasteless wings. Literally, this place puts McDonald's as a 5-star company which the employees wouldn't even get the orders wrong.   Try avoiding this place by all means."}
{"text":"The worst sports bar I've been to in Phoenix.  I'm sure it's fine if you want to get blasted however the service was horrible and the food was worse.  If I could give this a 0 I would."}
{"text":"Love the buffalo chicken dip and the 4 dollar long islands... Staff is great."}
{"text":"Went here for game 7 of the NBA finals. Service was good. Food was good. The main issue with this place was the temperature inside - it was too hot - everyone was sweating profusely. Cool the place down a few degrees and it will be a more desirable place to go during the Arizona summer heat."}
{"text":"The TVs are nice for hotels, not like Yardhouse or Blue 32 Sports Grill.  They position delas to you (like 2014 Mug Club) but don't tell you it's restrictive on Monday Nights between 7 pm to 10 pm.   This is a last resort place for me, now I walk in her and wonder what crappy new thing will happen .... On this Monday, they only have Coors light on draft ... this place is sarcastically brilliant!"}
{"text":"I have had just about everything on the menu. And it has all been so tasty!  I am never let down. The wait staff is always super nice, helpful and educated onthe menu. I would highly recommend eating there. And try it all. You won't be let down. And always check out their specials. They always have them and they are always awesome!!  The owners are great guys and really care about their restaurants and that shows vigorously throughout the food and the people."}
{"text":"I have been coming here a while but I am leaving a 5 star review today. I came with a friend to hangout for a little bit and ordered the boneless wings hot. If you like spicy these have like a chili paste that makes them unique and full of flavor.   The service was beyond exceptional this particular evening. We had ordered the dessert, the baked cookie, which takes 15 minutes to prepare. We didnt mind the wait but the manager had let us know it was taking longer than usual and that he would give us dessert on him.   The dessert is extremely delicious, we got chocolate chip.   Our waitress was very helpful always keeping our drinks full and checking on us.   Overall, I have had the pleasure of good food and good service here. Thus, I keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad here,  but the service is soooooo friggin slow its unreal. The wings are good,  very tasty.  Bartenders are cool and helpful.  Plenty of tv's to watch the game too."}
{"text":"Oh how I love the Moon! I'm a beer girl and they carry a wide variety of both local and goose island beers. Try the Sophie it's DE-LISH! I love their happy hour $5 starters & personal pizzas can't beat it. They even have half off bottles of wine Wednesdays! Its a sports bar so they have tons of TVs everywhere different sound zones and like every sports channel. We went out to the patio to smoke and they even allow dogs! They got a pool table darts you name it. really cool place to grab a beer and watch the game I'd suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Watching Shelbie go out of her way to make customers happy is amazing. Phenomenal staff from the host to the Cooks. Would recommend this place to my closest family"}
{"text":"When we arrived there wasn't a hostess to seat you (on a Friday night). Drink specials were great. Started with traditional wings, not bad. The chili cheese dog however was disappointing to say the least. Dry over cooked chili and hot dog, and hardly any cheese. Dessert was delicious.  Maybe I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"I haven't had any food here, but it's a good spot for a beer on the patio at a good price. There are misters on in the summer. I've seen karaoke here. I've also seen the underaged get kicked out from time to time so I know they follow the rules on that one.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The beer selection here disappointed me, very laid back bar that can be a great hang out for friends on the weekend. The drinks are fairly priced but the whole theme of the restaurant/bar threw me off. It was disappointing that the whole patio was smoking friendly I do not smoke and could barely breathe out there so I was left with the only option to be inside....disappointing."}
{"text":"Friends like it me personally not so much.I Had a experience where a female bartender charged me  a different price (extra ten bucks nore)  for a pitcher of the same beer my friend ordered.  Besides that,service is alright. Mix drinks can range from  hardly any  alcohol to it tasting like they give you the bottle."}
{"text":"I was wanting some lightly beer battered cod fish with fries and cold slaw as well an order of freshly batteted zucchini made at the restaurant! What I got for 30.00 was cold food two finger size pieces of fish and and an order of cold fries not enough and a raised cup of cold slaw to save them money, cup looks deep but its a joke too! There was so much breading on the zucchini pieces, who wants that! I had bread at home! Not to mention the sauces where not good either!The price was out rages for one person meal on a Friday night! I could have done better at the Mexican Taco Fish place across the street from me! This was a bad place to ever order from again! I will not order from this place again! If your thinking of ordering from this place! Save yourself a trip and the money! Please don't take a date there unless you don't like that person at all! This restaurant is bad all the way around! Do not order from this place!!! The only reason I gave this place one star is because I was hungry and it sounded good on the menu! Don't let that fool you! I may have been a sucker once! But not again! Good Bye!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first bar I was taken to when I moved down to Phoenix. I love all the bartenders, very nice, and I thought the wings and food was delicious. Honestly my favorite thing on the menu is their grilled cheese. I got it one night when I wasn't that hungry and it comes on this buttery ciabatta bread with their AMAZING french fries. The only down side is they only have 1 draft beer. Everything else is bottles. But awesome happy hour ($5 bombers, 1/2 price apps) and great TV setups."}
{"text":"I love going to half moon! First of all, it is in a great location that is close to my house. Second, they have pretty good happy hour specials and they also usually have specials on food and drink when local sports teams are playing. They have a really big Long Island Iced Tea that is always $4 and that is really good too. One of my favorite reasons to go here though is that they have half price burgers all weekend. These burgers are fantastic! They also have a lot of TV's if you want to catch a game that is on.   Although I personally can't stand UFC, if you are a fan then you need to go to half moon. They don't charge a cover to watch it like a lot of other bars do. And if you are a guy you may also like all of the pictures around the restaurant of girls with their butts hanging out. Personally, not my thing but to each his own.   Last, if you have a sweet tooth like I do, then you have to try the cookie pie. Make sure you order it 20 minutes before you want it (they warn you on the menu it takes a while). It is yummy!"}
{"text":"Quick shout out to Rich (Angry Panda) such a true class act! One of the best bartender/server/manager/PERSON/ there is! His attitude and demeanor every single time I walk in his superb!. I literally come to this place because of this person. Thank you so much Rich you make my experience awesome every time I'm there."}
{"text":"Drink and App Specials are great during Happy Hour. The food will leave you wanting more. The Italian beef is a nice attempt but it isn't an authentic Italian Beef, the pizza was appealing to look at, it was good but something with the sauce wasn't great to me. Service in the bar was fantastic, just wish they hadn't turned the place into a hotel lobby bar."}
{"text":"Glad to have finally tried this place out. Moved into the neighborhood not too long ago and at first look I thought it was a Chinese restaurant because of the name for some reason. Later found out it's actually a sports bar so I had to try it out! Went on a Thursday afternoon during happy hour and the prices were great! 5 dollar drinks and apps. Hubby and I also shared a small pizza which was surprising really tasty! Only thing that wasn't so great was our waitress. When we were ready to order or needed napkins or anything, we had to stop her for her attention. Some of her time was spent chatting with some guy that was sitting by himself. Hopefully next time we just get someone different!"}
{"text":"We found this place because several people wanted to get together before our sons' football game for a little happy hour pre-party....otherwise, there's no way I'd stumble across this joint.  It's located in the middle of Phoenix somewhere and is a pretty cool bar/restaurant.  I saddled up to the bar and ordered an IPA to get started on Happy Hour and then we ordered these items for $5 each (happy hour pricing):  1/2 Medium, 1/2 Sweet BBQ Wings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=YXKrnuDpFyhAm2af4eTg5g#YXKrnuDpFyhAm2af4eTg5g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=Yj_9ysSNU7HcjcCiovTYqQ#Yj_9ysSNU7HcjcCiovTYqQ  Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/half-moon-sports-grill-phoenix-2?select=8ehj7xtOySrjAzCV8S0PaA#8ehj7xtOySrjAzCV8S0PaA  At the recommendation of the bartender, we split between the Medium and Sweet BBQ Wings....he was spot on...both were awesome!  I preferred the Sweet BBQ Wings between the 2.  The Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza was good as well...not great, but good.  This place is pretty impressive.  The bar is fairly large and was busy on the night we went. They have a large patio area and could easily handle large groups.  Plenty of TV's in the bar area for sports.  There's also a large dining room area.    Overall, we had fun hanging out here for 1 night.  However, it's too far away for us to be regulars here.  But if we're in the area, this will definitely be on our list of possible joints to visit.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"I'm very fond of the drink specials. Specifically 'Wine Wednesday' the pretzel and cheese dip is to DIE for its so delicious. I'm giving a two start because I waited half and hour to be waited on and they kept forgetting to come back to my table. Normally I don't mind if it's busy, I understand that. However it was slow and they had a huge staff... from what I could tell. The service was poor; food was great."}
{"text":"A good spot to grab a craft brew and enjoy the game(s).  The kids menu is small - but very generous. The Cali chicken sandwich is very good and loaded with fresh flavorful ingredients  The wings are a bit different from typical buffalo - more a unique sweet and sour - very good.   Our server was ver friendly, bailed the Bloody Mary and gave us all the dipping sauces a table could want. Ice teas were always full.   Good spot, family friendly"}
{"text":"Waiter argued about what I ordered after it was brought wrong.  Another person in our party's order was wrong.  Pretty disappointing.  Food was ok."}
{"text":"This was a bar that we frequented on a regular basis, but we went there today to watch UA v ASU, only to find it would only be on one TV with NO sound.  This place would rather screw over locals and the in-state rivalry to show the WVU v OU on one side and the TN on the other side.  We will never return to a local bar that screws over the locals In favor of snowbirds.  This is UA v ASU after all."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday night around 9:30 as I was staying in a local hotel and a Sports Bar close by seemed a no brainer. Boy was I wrong  Positive first;  really good service by our waitress,  lots of TVs  OK atmosphere.  The negative;  Only 4 beers on tap in a Sports Bar (are you nuts) The food was horrible and overpriced. How do you mess up nachos? The worst I have ever had; left most there. Tasteless burgers, Calamari chew toys, and so it went. The only thing edible was the fries.   Too bad, because this place has real potential, but crappy overpriced food and an extremely limited draft selection overrides atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"If you are a Bears fan, then do NOT go to Half Moon Windy City Sports Grill. This bar calls itself a Bears' Bar, but after watching one game there, I can honestly say that this description is a fallacy. I called ahead and, they said they aired the Bears game and the audio would be turned on. We drove 20 minutes to get to the bar, and were excited upon arriving. We were seated in the corner near the bathroom (this didn't bother us as we had 4 TVs nearby).  The audio for the Bears game was on and we were pumped up. Then everything started to go downhill rapidly. We attempted to order the only beer 'special' (it's the same price everyday) they had, $2 Old Style cans. They were sold out, and didn't offer a replacement. On opening day of the Bears 2014 season they didn't even offer any sort of beer specials. They did have $12 bottomless mimosas (excellent deal and no complaints as they were usually topped off before empty). I understand that it is an early game (10:00AM), but there should be some sort of beer special. That was strike one, strike two came as the game was about to start.  We anxiously awaited kickoff, then we started to glance around the room. Out of the 4 TV's immediately in our vicinity, only ONE had the Bears game on. To make matters worse, 2 of these TVs had the Rams-Vikings game on! I immediately thought that there was a mistake and asked our server if they could change the TV nearest us (which was one of the two TVs next to each other that had the Rams-Vikings game on) to the Bears. Our waiter politely said they could not change the channels, but would talk to the manager for us. The manager was quite rude with us, and said that there was no way to possibly change any channels. As she was stating this, we noticed that the fourth TV was switched to the Falcons vs Saints game. I love being lied to directly to my face. After the manager left, I decided to look around the rest of the room, at the 9 other TVs I could see from my seat. The Bears game was on ONE more TV, but don't worry, the Rams-Vikings game was also on another TV. This place is clearly more supportive of the Rams and/or Vikings than of the Bears, which seems odd since the owner claims to have been born & raised in Chicago. I highly doubt the owner was from Chicago.    Their menu includes a section labeled \"Chicago Thin Crust Pizza\". As most are aware, Chicago is famous for their deep dish pizzas, but they also have a thin crust pizza that is almost as delicious. This is definitely not it though. The 'pizza' they serve should not actually be called pizza, it's more accurately described as crackers with a little bit of cheese on it. Although that is not even an accurate description, as crackers have some thickness to them. This pizza featured a crust that was at best postcard-thin, and at worst toilet paper-thin. Everyone that has been to Chicago (let alone born and raised) would be offended by what they call a pizza.  One friend of mine ordered the Kale & Quinoa salad. She loved the taste of the salad, but was disappointed at the size of it. It costs $7.89 and is served in a large bowl, but the salad itself is barely larger than a standard size side salad. The waiter graciously removed the salad from her bill, so I can't complain too much on that.  My girlfriend had the Fish & Chips. The fries were excellent. They had a great crisp and flavor to them. She also stated that she loved the fish.  So, Half Moon evidently is capable of making quality food.  The men's bathroom did feature the Bears game at one of the stalls, however, the women's bathroom just featured advertisements for exercise classes. Both of the women I was here with commented at this and they were quite annoyed as they both came to watch the Bears play. I would think most fans (whether male or female) would much rather watch the game than be bombarded with whatever sexist advertisements this bar picked out.  As a Chicago native, I am appalled at how Half Moon calls itself a Bears bar, or uses Chicago anywhere in the description of it. If you want to say you support a certain team, then you should make sure that said team is on the majority of the TVs in your establishment. Having the game on ~15% of the TVs is just unacceptable. They should also drop the Chicago from their pizza titles as it is clearly misleading. It is akin to someone making a Chicago Style Philly Cheesesteak, you just don't do something like that. The only upside to this place was that our waiter was excellent and apologized 10 times during the game.  Ideally management would never put it's staff in the position of being forced to apologize so much.  We seriously debated leaving the bar to go to an actual Bears Bar (there are some great ones in Phoenix), unfortunately it is nearly impossible to get a table after kickoff anywhere. We took a chance on a new bar to watch the games at, and it bit us in the ass. I will NEVER return to Half Moon even if they offer me free food and drinks to do so."}
{"text":"Always a great place to hang out with friends. Good vibes all around. Food is awesome & the Best long islands iced tea!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to do another review of this place for quite sometime since everything has changed here.  They totally changed up the menu and specials and remodeled.  The new look of the dining room is pretty cool and much more open and they have a shuffle board table which is cool.  The patio is still pretty cool when the TVs are operational.  Service overall seems to have gotten better since they have reopened.  I am not a fan of the new menu at all.  They have changed the recipe of their hot wing sauce and I am not too found of them (they used to be my favorite wings in town).  I have had the pizza a couple times and it is absolutely awful, even for the 5 dollar special they have most evenings and weekends.  The crust is a good crispy thin crust, but the sauce has all of the flavor of maybe ketchup at best and there is barely enough cheese to cover the thing.  There are also now a handful of overpriced Chicago type of items on the menu like Chicago dogs, polish sausages, Italian sausage/beef, but there are so many other Chicago style restaurants in the area with better prices I find it hard to try any of them.  I have tried their cheese filled toasted ravioli which were cool on happy hour, but I think they have since removed those from the menu.  As far as drinks go if it is happy hour the $3 wells are the way to go.  Draft beers are I think $4 for HH and $5 regular which is strip club/night club pricey to me for a regular pint.  Wells are almost $5 when it is not happy hour as well, so I would suggest getting a long island for $5 which is huge and also good.  Overall even though I still frequent this place, I just cannot enjoy myself here like I used to and find myself going to Zipps more and more.  They have also kicked smokers off of half of the back half of the patio, I guess so they can open those doors on nice days.  This used to be a place where you could enjoy a nice cigar, a drink and watch the game.  Since they have moved the smoking area, you really cannot enjoy yourself the same way.  The space is more limited over on that side and the TVs are much smaller.  Not to mention only one of the two TVs over there works.  I would also think this change would bother non smokers too since the smoking area is now right next to the front door making all the customers walk past the smell.  Such a shame what happened here really."}
{"text":"What more does a guy need than a basket of chicken wings and a Suns game at any angle?  Happy hour is great but it gets crowded during games so it's a good bet to get there early. If you can score one of the private rooms, most definitely do so."}
{"text":"I still prefer Zipps for the food, but Half Moon has very good bar food too. Burgers and wings are great (again, Zipps are better).   Half Moon is way better for watching a game though. Way better seating arrangement.   Go when it isn't busy and you can have one of the side rooms all to yourself, rearrange the furniture however you want and get the remote so you can put on whatever. I shouldn't be sharing this.  Nice outdoor seating with a fire pit for all you smokers."}
{"text":"Enjoy going here, great atmosphere!  The food is delicious which is a good thing, because you get what you pay for.  Love the patio here as well!  The servers are mostly well attentive.  They do get pretty busy which is understandable."}
{"text":"Kudos to the manager for reaching out to make our next visit here better!! The wings still rank high in my book, alongside the buffalo chicken dip!!! Our waitress was super helpful & gave terrific service! Thanks for making our 2nd visit to Half Moon one which makes us want to return again in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bff Katy and we had a blast at the bar. Shelby was a phenomenal bartender made us a lovely personal shot and was a great conservationist. Definitely deserves a raise. She's great!!!   Never been here before and I'll def be coming back :)))"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm not one to typically complain but this was a HUGE let down.   First lets start with the positive aspects of our meal....   We were seated right away   The beer was cold  Now, on to business.  The waitress wasn't particularly friendly or outgoing, but whatever.  I ordered the Italian beef sandwich, my husband ordered the Italian beef salad and each child got a kid's cheese pizza.     To be fair, I am from Chicago and consider myself an Italian beef connoisseur so I may have high standards, but I have found that a true Chicago Italian beef sandwich is consistent at most Chicago places in the valley.  For starters it was pricey but not a big deal if it's good and big.......it was neither.  The bread was a soft roll you can find in any grocery store, the beef didn't really have any flavor, they were really stingy with the beef, the sweet peppers were more sour and tasted pickled and the whole thing was dry.    My husband's salad wasn't much better, they had ran out of spinach so the whole thing was made with romaine and everything was basically coated in oil from the beef. Definitely not the quality or size you expect from $10 salad.   The kid's pizza was actually decent quality, however, the crust is not what I would consider traditional Chicago thin crust.  The only issue with the pizzas was that they were brought out by Ms. Congeniality piping hot, any experienced server knows you don't bring out kid's food when it's the temperature of molten lava.  Not only did she bring it out hot, she told us it was hot as she placed it 2 inches away from my toddler. My hungry little quickly guy grabbed a piece before we could stop him and crammed it in his (pizza) pie hole..................you can imagine how that went.  Fairly certain my little munchkin now has PTSD from that pizza and was terrified to eat the rest of the night regardless of how much we blew on his pizza.   A lovely young lady came around asking how everything was, I can only assume she was a manager of some sort.  I gave her my honest review of the Italian beef to which she replied \"well, everyone likes their sandwich differently\".  Ummmm, not the response I was expecting but whatever.  I did disclose that I am from Chicago so I have a high standard for beef, she explained that she was from Joliet so she understood.  Hmmmmm, maybe this is how they like their beef in Joliet?  Although, she did offer us a free dessert or appetizer next time since our card had already been ran.    Not gonna lie, I felt like we were legit ripped off, 2 out of 4 meals were terrible, the service was borderline depressing and the kids meals weren't even free (per an advertisement I found online).  Not gonna lie, I felt like it was a complete waste of $50 but at least I know now that Luke's or Portillo's are still the best places to get a good Italian beef in the valley."}
{"text":"The chicken wings with out the bone are the best I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"I am not much of the sports bar type. But after one experience here I was amazed. The service is great and they offer free pick up and drop off shuttle service within a five mile radius so no holding back necessary"}
{"text":"Does the New Times have a better opinion than me?  That was the question I tried to answer when I went here to try out the wings.  The New Times Best of Phoenix declared this restaurant as having the best wings, so I had to check it out.  *Side note* I used to regularly hang out at the Half Moon on Bell when I lived up in that big box/corporate chain infused section of town.  We went almost every weekend to partake in their real long island iced teas for $2.50 and enjoyed it despite it being a sports bar (we are not sports fans).  The food was pretty good and the booze even better.  Back to the review - It's a nice sports bar that manages to accomodate a plethora of sports fans with an insane number of TVs.  The hostess even asks which team you are trying to watch so that she can seat you accordingly.  Because we were there for the food, and not the sports, we were seated immediately and without hassle.  Luckily, we happened to sit near the TVs playing the Bills, so we payed a little bit of attention.  You can order the wings by poundage - 1/2, 1, or 2 - not by number of wings, which was a little confusing for us.  We're used to ordering a dozen per person if it's the meal, half for an appetizer.  Because neither of us were overly hungry ,we ordered 1 pound medium with a side of hot.  What we got was 9 wings without sauce and a side of \"hot sauce\" for $9. That's right, $1 per wing.  I already felt hosed, but I was willing to forgive the price for the allegedly best wings in Phoenix.  No sauce on the wings.  They were cooked crispy as we asked them to be, and they were somewhat meaty.  The side of \"hot sauce\" was a small container of gelatinous chili sauce, like the stuff they give to you at Asian restaurants. No flavor, just hot.  Luckily, the Long Island Iced Tea was just as tasty as I remember, otherwise I would have left very unhappy.  I wouldn't make a point of going here for wings.  They aren't even as adequate as the \"good\" wings I've found in Phoenix.  But for all of you non-purists, they do have BBQ, Thai Peanut and other flavors.  Oh yeah, I forgot about the statement on the menu that claims that separate checks \"MASSIVELY\" slows down the service. Really? Seriously?  This isn't a problem at many restaurants at which I have attended with a large group.  This isn't really conducive to a sports bar, as far as I'm concerned.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet a bunch of friends to watch your favorite team and not have to worry about separate checks \"MASSIVELY\" slowing down your service?  Don't try it here, they warn you against it before you even order food."}
{"text":"was my first time to this bar, was a great environment till i met the manager she has the worst attitude, and then when someone told her it smelt like puke around my seat she cut me off from ordering anything, i was even there 20mins and she assumed it was me, she was very rude about taking orders talking to customers and handling the situation my friends caused. the worst management i have experienced and me being a manager i know how your suppose to handle things like that and the attitude your suppose to have, she was not even close!! the bartender was amazing, always smiling and very attentive! over all they need a NEW manager someone who is not a bitch and handles situations more accurately!!"}
{"text":"It's okay. Drinks could be better, specials could be better. Service is good. Menu just feels outdated. The two lounge rooms are pretty cool. Like all the TVs, pool and darts. There's just something that feels a little off. Maybe it's uncoordinated, old menu, new looking lounge, drinks are more meh. Doesn't feel brought together.  Overall positive review. I like it there. Servers do well and are really nice. It's clean. Bathrooms are fine.   Side note, should change happy hour hours with time change (football games are later now)."}
{"text":"Three stars; nothing more, arguably less.  First and foremost: the name of the restaurant is Half Moon, but the logo is quite obviously a crescent. I know, knit picky, but come on.  Second: was excited to come here for the wings. Supposedly award winning? I call bullshit. Maybe the award winning pigeon wings.   The atmosphere was fine; typical sports bar. Wait staff was fun, and got most of the order right. Was some what smokey inside? Not sure how or why.  All in all: we don't come to moon valley often. It served its purpose as a family rendezvous. But I doubt we would ever intentionally return.   Merp."}
{"text":"My friend reserved one of the small side rooms here for an event.  Now, this reservation was made to have a viewing party for a popular TV show. You would think that they would put us in a room thats sheltered from the majority of the noise coming from the bar. They put us in the opposite. We could barely hear a thing. Terrible.  On the upsaide, our waitress was a sweetheart and did her best to get the volume up and try to at least get captions on our TV. She was very attentive and did a good job of keeping all of our orders straight. The food was good. I got the boneless wings in 2 flavors: BBQ and sweet chili. The chili ones were really good, the BBQ, not so much.  While this is probably a great place to toss a few back while watching the game of the day or after work, I'd think twice before reserving a room for an event."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the fact that they serve \"Chicago favorites\". Being a Chicagoland native, I was stoked to get a dog from a place a lot closer than Portillos. I had the food delivered (postmates) and I opened the side of fries and they were amazing. Crispy, well seasoned, and not over-fried. When I opened the dog.....it visually was not appealing. The bun was damn near rock hard and it eventually split in half and became very difficult to chew yet alone swallow because it was obviously stale. So stale. I don't even know WHY the person who prepared the dog thought a rock hard hotdog bun is okay to be served.   I also ordered 6 \"nuclear\" wings for a coworker. They're advertised as stupid spicy or whatever. The wings were dry, looked like they've been left out for a few hours, and are definitely not stupid spicy. After the disappointing hotdog, I did not want to stick a shriveled, dry chicken wing into my mouth.   Next time....I'll make the drive to portillos or fly to Chicago for quality food."}
{"text":"I'm down wit the half moon, happy hour that is. The prices are right and the food was good. I like that you can tuck away if you want. I love the ample parking and the outside seating. It's clean and classy yet you could cut loose if ya wanted to. Some good eats are the Honey Chipotle boneless wings, sweet with a kick nice crunch to them as well. Also a must try is the Buffalo chicken dip scrumptious!  I was here in the evening last year with Cedric the entertainer. I have known him for years and he did the after party at the half moon. That was my first experience there. I like the half moon. Guys can hang at the bar or around the pool table. They have big screens everywhere and a dance floor for the ladies. Regular prices are a little high but happy hour fits my budget.   I am going there tomorrow for a little Happy time ya know. I would give 5 stars but the regular prices are a little steep for me. What can I say I guess I'm just a cheap skate or date. : ) Hey people we are in a recession!"}
{"text":"Arrived for a late dinner and service was great! I'm glad I came here! So many great deals throughout the week !!! AND they have excellent sriracha chicken tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"Bartenders were friendly and amusing. Drinks and food came quickly. Food is good for bar food. Kitchen is open until midnight and we walked from our hotel.  Totally fine.  Oh yeah, calamari was worth a mention. Great for an easy app."}
{"text":"This place confuses me.  You walk in, and think that this is a pretty decent sports bar.  Then you get up to go the bathroom, and see all the hidden rooms and lounge areas.  I don't understand it, is it for the people who get bucket of beer service?  Why do you need to section it off?  Is it a club later at night?  Food was pricier than it should have been for a half-assed sports bar.  And there was no creativity in the menu, which there should be for the prices!  This place gets a pass."}
{"text":"Great food and BEST service in the business!   Plus everyone has a different experience at the same restaurant each day.  So reviews are actually pointless.  Go find out for yourself.  But dont write something bad about a restaurant because maybe the server is having a bad day.... do you not have bad days at your jobs.?.... and im sure old employees of businesses write bad things about the business on here as well... just something to think about."}
{"text":"I walked in to watch the SF/St Louis baseball game.  I ordered a beer and a pizza: sausage, mushroom, onion, green pepper, it was a combination THEY made up and close to what I would order on a pizza.  When the pizza came, all I could see was the sausage.  The bartender/mgr actually showed me a minuscule piece of mushroom and onion.  Wait, what?  YOU HAVE TO SHOW ME PIECES OF MUSHROOM AND ONION TO SHOW THEY ARE ON THE PIZZA?  I don't think any real Italians would have any more patience than did I in this instance.  Waste of time.  A complete waste of time.  If I rule out Half Moon, and I have, that leaves me with 547 other sports bars who, at least at this point, won't wast my time.  One last thing: the entire restaurant is a homage to Chicago sports.  Fine.  Really cool stuff, actually.  But the name is not remotely Chicago.  \"Half-Moon\" doesn't say Michael Jordan in any way.  What's up with that?"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the big screens. And the appetizers. But the service was below average and there where not many people in the bar"}
{"text":"I decided to go to the Half Moon restaurant on St. Patricks day for their corn beef and cabbage,  suggested by google.  My lunch was was the worst corn beef and cabbage I have ever had.  I want to sue google,  they sure got this one wrong!!!!!!  The corn beef was fatty and then more fat.  I spit the first bite out,  awful!!!!  I could hardly cut the cabbage.  Almost asked for a steak knife to cut it.  I wondered why at noon time the place was empty and after eating that awful food,  I now know why the place was empty!!!!!!!!!!  I will never go back there!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry Halfmoon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place mainly serves the hotel adjoining their parking lot. We went midday for cocktails and wings. What else? My copilot got a club sandwich. For touting \"award-winning wings\", I was expecting more. The place is large, we were greeted by a cute young girl. The waitress was attentive. There are TVs wall to wall for your viewing pleasure. The place had a few over 50 guys sitting around.   I did try their award winning LAVA sauce, which was interesting, fruity , sweet with a slow burn. I would have liked a jar of that. I wouldn't go back to this location. If I am in Moon Valley I might try again and pray for some actual \"award winners\"."}
{"text":"Food is great, like the ambiance but get the wrong waiter like we did and it's painful. If you value service with a smile look to any one of hundred of better run establishments in town"}
{"text":"Uggggh.  What a disaster.  I came here with a group of people for happy hour and the service was attrocious.  It was 15-20 minutes between server sightings.  Worse than that though was the fact that a portion of our group came here specifically so we could watch a baseball game.  They kept changing the channel from the game to another.  After we explained we were watching that, they'd change it back...until they changed it again 5 minutes later.  This literally happened 5 times until we just gave up.    The lone bright spot here is they have some pretty good beer on tap.  There were 3 New Belgium handles and some Goose Island."}
{"text":"I mean it's a bar they have drinks. If that is what you are going for cool. You can catch a game there, its not bumpn like it used to. Its a little on the quiet side.   The crowd looks like its about a 40+ group. and a good handful of random creepers checking out the serve staff there.   I wouldn't say i wont come back. But its definitely not first on my list for the kinda of bar scene i'd normally be looking for.  Service was good. but thats because there wasnt many other people to serve the day when i went."}
{"text":"WTF!?! I'm so surprised with this place. It's either very good service or super HORRIBLE service and tonight has been beyond me. I ordered a \"punch bowl\" it's the only place I've ever gotten one or even tried one.  It was on their menu for Sundays before they changed their menu to something new. Asked for it and I get a \"yeah....no don't know what that is and my manager doesn't know what that is so we don't have it.\" What do you mean you don't have it? It was on your menu?!?!? This place has so many memories for me and I truly mean great memories. I got over the waitress spilling a glass of wine on me, getting the wrong orders, waiters taking forever and people being rude... patience I do have. But when you give me a shitty attitude when I ask for something on your menu.... it's simply unacceptable. Gave it 2 stars only for the wings and fries. Otherwise it would have been 1 star. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The beer list is pretty good but the food is very average.  Ambiance/atmosphere is outdated and feels like a 90's sports bar."}
{"text":"Half Moon is right next to my house so I consider this the bar of choice if I don't want to drive far. The only problem is, there wings suck. They are too small and don't cut it compared to other bars. I understand that they aren't a wing place, but when their menu says that they have the \"best wings\", you better back up your claim. Trust me, at this point, they aren't. Name ANY other bar and they will have better wings. I am hoping that they read this review and go back to the drawing board and introduce some new and improved wings. Go check out Zipps or Buffalo Wild Wings for some inspiration!   Other than that, it is a great place to watch UFC fights. Beer prices are fair and the service is above average."}
{"text":"This is a great place to hang out with friends and have happy hour. Happy hour is from 3 to 7 and we had the best service for 12 people. They stayed right on top of our orders and our craziness."}
{"text":"I've probably driven/parked around this place a couple hundred times in the last year (no exaggeration) just from going to the LA Fitness it shares a parking lot with but hadn't actually stopped in until tonight.  A friend lives across the street from it so we decided to meet up for a low-key night.  I got there around 7:30 and was seated right away as the place wasn't busy at all.  The server showed up a few minutes later but first complained about the other table she was taking care of and that \"OF COURSE\" they were ready to order.  I know that she said that as a way of apologizing for taking longer than she'd planned to get to my table but it really wasn't that long of a wait and I didn't like hearing her complain about other people there.  The rest of the time was average but nothing special.  My friend and I each had a couple beers and I got the half pound of wings which were good but not great.  Our waitress took her time in checking on us and bringing/cashing out our bill.  So I just feel like while nothing bad happened, there wasn't really anything great that happened either which is why I'm giving an average 3 stars."}
{"text":"I live close to the greenway half moon and loved this place so my fiancé and I decided to try to other location, heard they had different food and different interior.   We sat at the bar, I ordered some wings (cant get enough of half moons wings) and my fiancé ordered a burger and a side of wings. WINGS WERE PERFECT. My fiancé didn't like the bun as much on the burger but it was still pretty good.  I really like the change up of this bar, I loved the environment and the way everything flows.  The best part about this visit was probably the bartender, her name was Alexandra. Because of her my fiancé and I stayed at least an hour past the time we intended on leaving. She did a damn good job getting my fiancé drunk and we had a blast with her.  Very outgoing girl and the customers around me seemed to think the same.  We will 100% be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I love the atmosphere and I love the food, but I have been extremely displeased with this place in one area. I love places with primo cards and member cards where you can accumulate points for free money. Which Half Moon does which is great BUT the past 2 times I have gone to RECIEVE my ten dollars off my meal my card was restarted and the server said it was used on my last visit... I also order the same meal for my boyfriend and myself and I also pay the same price. I go there often to receive points so I can enjoy 10 dollars off every so often and the past 2 times I have not received... Very displeasing, I feel like the servers are going after I pay and adding the ten dollars off and keeping my tip. I would hope not..   -After several confusing incidents with my promotional card the team of half moon really took the time to work things out with me. I appreciate it when Customers have an issue and management takes time to address it so I'm changing my 3 stars to a five star."}
{"text":"I have come here for years and have always had great service and food.  It is nice that they change up the menu at least once a year. Unfortunately they removed some of my favorite items.  I have made Half Moon my destination for Halloween and New Years Eve. They have great specials not to mention how conveniently close they are to my home."}
{"text":"I prefer going to this place to watch UFC fights because there is no charge or minimum tab. The restrict the place to people 21 and up so you don't have little kids running around (a la BWW)....  I really like how the place is set up, you can choose between sitting at a bar, or watching a sporting event from one seating areas that have couches.   If you go here on a fight night, be sure to arrive at least 2 hours early, the place fills up quick. I stood the entire time during UFC 118. The menu is pretty standard for a sports bar: burgers and deep fried foods. I recommend going on weekends because the burgers are half price.  Also, the other reviewers are right about the lighting. They keep it pretty dark inside so people might be turned off by that...."}
{"text":"I just finished my fantasy football draft in the Colangelo room 8/24/14. We had such a great experience! The two ladies that took care of us (one was in training) were very helpful and didn't fret if we needed anything. We drafted at buffalo wild wings last year in a crowded room with terrible service. I don't remember their names but from the management that helped me set up the draft, to the servers who provided everything promptly, to the cooks who prepared the delicious food on time, thank you and you can mark us down for next year already                             Sincerely,             The Wu-tang Ninjas party"}
{"text":"3 stars is middle of the pack, because thats exactly what this is. a decent sports bar with ok food that is either over priced OR too small of portions, however you wanna phrase it (they equal about the same: you dont get a whole lot for your $$$)   if you are staying at one of the nearby hotels: this is a better place than the other immediate surroundings, but if you live here...there are definitely better options."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're looking for a sports bar that has more thought and effort into their menu than other sports bars.   They offer all the faves, Burgers, Wings, Fries, tons of drink choices always something on special it seems. But they also offer more craft options like flat bread sandwiches, pastas, and even jambalaya.   i also love a place that has projection TVs, so you can REALLY see the game, they have three here. It's also a pretty good place to go for UFC, even though I think it's lame. Either way, if you want to chill with some good food and drink and watch some sports, check this place out. They even have a nice patio with some big screens showing all the action."}
{"text":"This bar is set up as the perfect sports bar and grill.  Bartenders make great drinks and my food was awesome.  Outside pool table, tables to sit at and TVs.  Sunday football ticket, and everyone was great.   I only withhold the five star rating because there wasn't more people for the Sunday night game."}
{"text":"When we first came to this place we were turned away because they did not have enough waiters to serve everyone. What kind of business turns away customers? An alternative could have been to seat the guests and set the expectation that you're short staffed and it may take longer. We then left to twin peaks which was nearby. We then, regretfully, gave this place a second chance. The food here was terrible. No joke it gave me diarrhea and the wings tasted old. We didn't even finish our food and left hungry. On top of that we sat where we were facing a 22\" tv watching football so it didnt help the experience. We also felt bad for the waiter who was serving us because he was handling all the tables inside and outside, again short staffed. I completely agree with some of the reviews here that there is no management accountability here. We have been at the location in north phoenix and it is totally different than this location, it is a much better atmosphere and has much better tasting food."}
{"text":"A-Ok is the perfect description of Half Moon Sports Grill.  It's a sports bar.  That really is all I can say about it.  Half Moon Sports Grill really left no impression on me either way.  The food is OK.  The service is OK.  The Beer selection is OK.  The atmosphere is OK.  It's not bad.  It's not great.  It's just a sports bar.  So what does make Half Moon Sports Grill stick out over the hundred of other sports bars in this area?  It is on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  The gift certificate is $30 for $15 and alcohol is not restricted.  I believe Happy Hour and holidays are the only restrictions."}
{"text":"Warning: they do not put HD channels on their HDTVs. I would watch way more games here if they used HD channels.   They have a private room that is great for hosting large groups for parties or meetings, and there's no charge! Not even a minimum spending requirement."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. I should have known since the place was empty on a Saturday night (with a UFC fight on). I walked in and wanted to like it. Great ambiance. Nice hosts. But, once we were seated, our server just turned our night into a terrible experience. We had to chase her down to get our water glasses filled. And when she finally did come around she acted annoyed that we asked her to fill our glasses. Are you kidding me? Welp. Explains why the place is empty. Rarely are my reviews negative, but this 1 star is deserved. Terrible service = terrible experience. Management needs to change this if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"First time here. Was pleasantly surprised. Ampule TVs split between the Broncos game and the Hawks.  Ordered a couple starters since it was happy hour and they were both delicious.  Also had a couple of local brews which were good as well. In Phoenix every couple of months and will put it on the list to revisit."}
{"text":"Went to Half Moon for lunch recently.  Not our first visit, and more than likely not our last.  We arrived during lunchtime, and the place was basically dead.   The server was patient with us, as some of the other people in my party kept needing some time to review the menu.  Once we ordered, it did seem like it took a little longer than normal to get the food out.    I ordered the basic burger with cheddar and avocado on a whole wheat bun.  First, the menu lists premium toppings for burgers, such as avocado, bacon, grilled onions, etc.  This listing states I would receive a generous helping of my premium topping.  I definitely do not agree that the avocado was plentiful (in fact, it was probably 50% of the amount I received on an Earl's hamburger just a week prior).  Second, the whole wheat bun seemed kind of dry.  It was not toasted or warmed, which seemed unusually as well.  The fries that came with the burger, however, were quite good.  I scarfed them all down, along with a couple from one of my lunch companions...    Because the burger was only average and the food took a little while to come out, I'm giving Half Moon three stars.  I'm sure that I'll be back, and highly recommend this place for their 3-7 pm happy hour when apps are 50% off (though I do wish they would bring back the sloppy joe nachos...)"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Really good wings. The service is spotty,  but not bad. Great place to hang."}
{"text":"Always a nice experience food is really good, nice atmosphere and patio. The only negative I could say is the size of the fries servings keep getting smaller."}
{"text":"Granted it has been awhile since  we have been to half moon. Since we have been there they have done some changes and not for the better.  My husband and I ordered grilled wings, personal pizza and a side salad. The salad was the best out of all three.  The wings weren't grilled and the pizza had an off flavor and taste. The crust had some sort of weird seasoning. It was so bad, we didn't even finish the whole \"small\" pizza. To top it off the margarita I order, while huge, lacked alcohol. Being we went there on a Saturday during prime NCAA football season it sure was quiet. Sadly a place we use to enjoy is no longer on our list to attend!"}
{"text":"Okay this I literally the old man bar of Arizona!! I felt so weird coming here watching s baseball game!   The staff was awesome though! The bartender Alex kicked butt! She was very personable and very attentive.  PSA THIS IS A CHICAGO BAR!!! I hate the cubs so I didn't love the ambiance or vibes.   They offer a great happy hour. Personal pizza (just okay) and chicken fingers plus 7 beers only $40!!!   If you don't mind old men (or you're one yourself) this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Great place to go especially during football season!  Good food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"Another great experience at half moon this Sunday. Mitch took great care of our large group and we took full advantage of the owners party at the next table where they shared fireball shots and birthday cake. We tried the champagne bucket for $12 and the triple starter for $20 deal. The chi fries and chicken strips with garlic fries were great and super filling. Reasonable prices, great drinks, tons of large tv's help make this one of our favorite places to watch football on Sundays"}
{"text":"It's ok... Took ten mins to get a beer.  Great Happy Hour prices!"}
{"text":"Solid food and atmosphere. Great place to watch a game. The wings are pretty good and the happy hour is also very good."}
{"text":"Had a few beverages and the Buffalo Chicken appetizer while watching some hockey.  The beer selection was pretty good and I was impressed with the Buffalo Chicken.  Instead of a over creamed chili pepper dip what you get is more fresh chicken with buffalo seasoning which I would definitely eat again.  They are also able to vary the heat of the dish for varying tastes."}
{"text":"I can't think of a place id rather be any day of the week after a stressful day of work.gyms close by.then a relaxing drink with many friendly beautiful girls to serve you.I always try to find my favorite bartender or waitress.but I like them all.always respectful and nice."}
{"text":"Ordered our food through Uber Eats- The quality of the entrees were high, however the portions were extremely small. Ordered three chicken finger entrees that came with a side of fries. Haven't eaten in-house, but would hope the portions would be a bit more substantial for $11-$12 per entree. Not sure if we'll eat here again due to the amount of food delivered."}
{"text":"More Beer!!! That's right, they got rid of the Microbrew they had, Bottoms Up, and now have Fat Tire on draft and are getting another beer on draft soon.  They also carry Blue Moon now (thank God!) and a half dozen or so other popular beers they haven't carried in a long time. They also have daily kitchen specials they are doing a little better job of promoting and, so far, they've been really good.  Still a great place to go, still lots of fun.....now with more beer!"}
{"text":"Hi my name is missy we came in to get a full belly and have drinks before we got more drinks. Derek helped us by bringing us our adult beverages and he was all spritely about it which made me happy to drink my awesome, super yummy beverage. All and all Derek is wicked badass and he better remember us next time we come back. I'll remember him cause he's the only awesome fella here yay!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots!!  Pizza and wings are awesome.  Beef nachos are supreme. Cheesecake is special delivery.  And don't forget that Postmates will pickup and deliver."}
{"text":"Ate here on a business trip to AZ. Good burger and decent mixed drinks. Got a salad instead of fries but it was a joke. In a tiny bowl and was pretty tasteless. Just splurge and go for the fries. Not bad just not anything special."}
{"text":"Originally I didn't like this place but as I continue to go there it's growing on my husband and I. Were not a fan of the wings but the calamari and cold beer is nice. We like to go on Thursdays, half of bottle of wines and a few fingers food makes the atmosphere enjoyable. My husband likes to sit outside so he can smoke other than that it's fun place to just hang-out and enjoy the sports channels."}
{"text":"Food was just average due to it not being very hot.  We had wings and fries that were just barely warm.  Thinking the grilled chicken made it all take longer and was poorly planned or it sat for a bit.  Service was so so. We'll try one more time."}
{"text":"Thursday night.. Place was about one third full. not busy at all. Service was running about as fast as a sloth in reverse. Appatizer came out ok.. not bad.. Wife's salad came out.. Cobb Salad.. with Chicken.. but.. yeah no chicken.. They brought her a side.. But it was damn near frozen chicken. My salad.. came out right on time with my sandwich. I ordered the Chicago Combo (Italian Beef w/ a Italian Sausage on a roll) with Sweet peppers.. got it with the spicy peppers. At this point I just wanted to get out of there.. so handed over my card.. took a good 10 minutes for the waitress to bring it back.. and my debit card was broken. She snapped the corner off.   So in short.. if you have a few hours to kill, want poor service, and food that really isn't all that good.. this is the place for you. And as a bonus they will happily snap the corner off your debit card."}
{"text":"Ask for Savannah. Outstanding service. And try the buffalo chicken dip. It's fantastic! Good place to watch ufc fights...no cover.  Great drinks specials during fights and games. Smoking is allowed on the patio where they have about ten tables and three tvs. Inside their are tables, high tops and a large bar with every seat in the place having a great view of one of their many big screens ( including two projector screens)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now at different times of the day, each time was a great experience  my bartender made sure I had a cold beer in hand always and the food was always on point"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and inside of this bar is really cool especially being from the east coast. It is pretty great to see a Chicago bar out this way because it is a different atmosphere than other bars. It is overall a good sports bar that has some games to play inside. The food is average and the drinks are pretty good as well. They have great happy hour specials that anyone can enjoy and it is in a pretty good location close to many offices."}
{"text":"Friday 5-9 pm happy hour is the best one they have. Food is ok, service is adequate depending if it's a busy sports day. In times where it's slow bartenders are on point."}
{"text":"Football Sunday~As a first-timer at Half Moon I wanted to like this new sports bar adventure. I really, really did. I wanted to hang out, I wanted to order food, I wanted to drink beer & I really wanted to enjoy an afternoon of football. However, there was not one single, itsy-bity, tiny thing that was redeemable about our experience.   The restaurant/bar was nearly empty. There were more food servers than patrons. When we were seated conveniently next to the kitchen we were quite optimistic. We thought, \"YAY! We will receive good service & the food will be prepared properly and not rushed.\" Ha-ha, (resounding laughter) on us.   We began by ordering the nachos, the pesto hummus & 2 ice teas. The nachos were a horrible culinary choice. The chips were stale, the cheese sauce was 2 opposing colors of orange & yellow & it had the same food film that pudding gets when it's old.  We had to send it back. I was absolutely astounded as my dining companion has a stomach made of steel & would eat asphalt if it were deep-fried.  The hummus place was nearly as unappetizing, the pita bread was hard & the accompanying vegetables were soggy. The hummus was a curdling swamp of what we believed to be pesto soup.   At this juncture, I literally had to stand up & wave with manic jazz hands to get us a refill of ice tea. After an extended period of time, our 2nd or maybe even 3rd, server brought  our ice tea, which was neither iced nor in any possible way resembled tea. An oxymoron for sure.   Still we asked our server what she would recommend on a re-order & her response was an hysterically emphatic, \"I don't eat here.\"    In conclusion, I want my $30.00 back so I can use it next time a Zipps.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Sliders & drinks, a regular here (well at least up until I moved back to LA)  :)  Crowd is young & energetic, GREAT sports bar during NFL and Bball season.  GO SUNS!!!  There are small alcoves good for private gatherings which can accommodate varying sizes of groups.  Just call ahead they'll make it happen."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewherfe to catch the MMA fight on my way home from work as I discovered not all sports bars show them. Half moon was right on my path home and showing the fight. It was over crowded (expected) even the patio was full. I was able to watch the fight from the tvs outside without going in even though I would have loved to sit. I was also starving and thirsty and even after the fight was over everyone was just lingering with still no room for me to find a seat to eat so I left and found somewhere else to eat"}
{"text":"This place is frustrating. It's not really a great sports Grill. TV set up is just really subpar. And many of them aren't on HD!? That said, happy hour specials are good, The Patio is great with Misters, fans, a suncover, and cool furniture. The wings are great, You can get a half pound of them on HH for $2.50.  no paper towels in men's room (air dry only). Yuck.   Subpar TVs ESP at bar. Not HD/properly aligned. Too small. Only 3 for bar. All TVs waaaaaay too small.   Very small beer glasses.  If you pay full price for appetizers you're a fool.  Small portions. And expensive."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere to host a business meeting for an alumnae group. I need to seat about 20 people and was working off of a very minimal budget. After doing some research on Yelp and calling around to a few places, I decided to go with Half Moon. I've never been here before so I was a little weary about it in the back of my mind because their reviews were just average.  However, I'm very happy with the way the event went and with their service. Their Platinum room was pretty spacious. It can probably fit as most around 35 people. There is one large screen in the room and several flat screens. The room was free to rent and they required no down payment (huge bonus!). We had a PowerPoint presentation that we wanted to display and had brought the wrong cable. Luckily, someone (the manager?) helped us out and located the right cable for us, what a life saver!   I ordered about $50 worth of food during Happy Hour and it was the perfect amount to feed 20 guests, some who came straight from work and didn't have dinner yet. We had one waitress assisting us but that's all we needed. She was very quick and efficient. The food was pretty good for bar food, nothing spectacular, maybe a little on the pricey side too. I ordered off of their starter menu and got some wings.  While the room is private, it was still pretty loud. I understand that there was Football going on so they were pretty packed. I would keep this in mind as you're booking the room. If you're looking for something quieter, this may not be your place.  The parking situation is kind of a bummer. I arrived at 6 and the lot closest to them was full. I finally figured out where their other lot is and parked there. It's a little bit of a walk though. They're tucked away in between all these office buildings so the parking is pretty strict too.  I don't live near this area so I don't see myself really coming back but I had a great experience and appreciate their hospitality."}
{"text":"Decent food menu, friendly staff, and big screens everywhere."}
{"text":"I've gone many times. The bartenders are awesome and very personable, and the staff all together are great! Chase and Alex are the best bartenders, and they have really really good food. Chicago style and really good. Also they have shuffle board, darts, and 2 pool tables with an outside area. Really big spot."}
{"text":"A Chicago style bar with some cute quirks. They served their cans of beer in little paper sacks. There were sports/Chicago quotes all over the walls. And the framed pictures were of people playing sports, with their plumber crack sticking out.   The bar staff was very friendly. The drinks were just right and they handled the crowds with ease. Oh, and they've got great Happy Hour deals all night long.   I went out on a Thursday night and they had karaoke in the bar. The DJ was great and the singers were having fun!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, but it had been a while. I came back today for the UFC 207. I called earlier and was told that they \"do not make reservations on event night\", which is fine by me. I got here at exactly 6:05pm. The place was full but not packed, once I got to the hostess they asked if I had a reservation, which shocked me at first since I was told they did not make reservations. I needed a table for 6, but I told the hostess she could put me wherever there was space and we would figure from there. I waited for 2 hours and saw people who got there AFTER me getting seated before, so I once again told them they could fit me at ANY table and I would be ok. That's when I noticed a table for 6 opened up, after 2 and half hours, which made me happy, BUT of course not. A couple that got here 30 minutes before that got seated at that table, and when I questioned about it I was told 3 different stories. THREE!!!! 1st was that they had been here for 4 hours. LIES. 2nd was that they PAID for that table a while ago. I'm sorry, what? They don't make reservations but they accept payment? And last one, which was the worst to me, is that they had made a reservation, MISSED THEIR TIME, but once they got here they spoke to the manager and the manager made the call to sit them BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE! I'm sorry, what?! ABSURD!! Do they make reservations or not? So bribery works? The manager never bothered to come speak to us, clear things up. HE DIDNT STAND UP FOR HIS DECISION. The hostess was also very weak because she couldn't even get her story straight. It was ridiculous. I felt disrespected as a customer. Why does someone get special treatment?! I even offered to pay for a table if that was what it took to be seated at this ridiculous restaurant. Absurd. Never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome crowd  Awesome service Renata rocks  food was great ! Do the wings. We will be back for more"}
{"text":"I found this place to be extremely mediocre. The food was okay and the drinks were over priced. The bartender seemed more interested in the regulars and her phone to pay any attention to me."}
{"text":"Great spot in the biltmore area. You will love it if you're from Chicago or just looking for some Midwestern hospitality. The bar has some Chicago eats plus a Chicago skyline that retracts! I loved my Italian Beef! I got it wet style and was delish! Found out they have private room and catering available. Great lunch specials and happy hour! They even have karaoke on Thursday nights! Heyyy!"}
{"text":"Always a good time here! Half Moon is a local bar that has been around a long time. Excited to see some fun new menu items. Everything sounded delish. Had the bacon blue burger on a pretzel bun with sweet potato fries. So good! This pretzel bun was legit. Awesome happy hour specials and reverse HH specials. Cheap drinks and starters. In my Arnold voice..I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Food is half way decent, service is just OK.  Def better places if you are looking for REAL Chicago style food. Called to ask if they are showing the mayweather fight. And  they want $30 cover  plus $25 minimum tab per person... talk about money hungry! that was a reminder why I stopped coming tho this place.."}
{"text":"This place is so smoker and 420 friendly. We smoked on their Patio all night. Because the doors were open and the Hawks were playing, some Lincoln Park Liberals complained about the smoke. The manager was cool and closed the doors then cam out and laughed about the looser nonsmokers at the bar. Defo coming back for 4/20!!!"}
{"text":"This was a big \"ok\" beer selection was ok, bartender was very unaware of her guests and said anything to please them. Overall, it wasn't the worst experience, but wasn't the best (by far) either! Wings - ok (ish) beer - fine chips/salsa/guac - huge portion and not the best, but it's a pretty basic dish."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a negative review. I decided to stop here for a quick Wednesday night dinner. It was busy, but not a friday night busy sort of evening. We opted to sit out on the patio-once we were seated, is where my experience at Half Moon went sour. We sat there for at least 10 min before someone came to take our drink order. Our waitress disappeared, and it took another 15 min for her to reappear with our drinks. I'm annoyed at this point..25 min just to get my drinks and you havn't even taken my order?! In that time..about 3 other tables fill on that patio..those same 3 people get up and walk out because of the lack of service. Our appetizer finally arrive i(we've now been there for 45 min), and I say \"I was wondering if we were forgotten\", and the food runner then decides to YELL AT ME. Yes, me, the customer. The customer who has been waiting close to an HOUR for a sandwich and a soda. He screams at me, and I quote, \"LOOK-the upper floor is packed, and we can cook only so much at a time\"...and storms off. What just happened here?! Did that employee seriously yell at me and try to school me on the workings of a restaurant?!  We had been sitting there for so long that by the time we would have left, we would have been stuck waiting elsewhere anyway. I couldnt believe the complete lack of service, courtesy, and the outright  rude employee, who needs a serious training course on customer service. We ate our meal..chuckled at how insane it all was..the 'upper deck' is a 2 step elevated section inside so we had a good laugh at that too. To top off the miserable experience, the food was below mediocre Over cooked, the cole slaw was awful, and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye. It was like we were the exiles on a deserted island begging for a beverage.  Half Moon will never see my hard earned pennies again. I'd rather run down the street to Sonic!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really LOUD!  Bacon bleu burger-not bad. Spicy chicken tortilla soup-needed to be heated longer. Soup should be hot, not warm. Ginger ale-too sweet.  P.S. This place is really LOUD!"}
{"text":"So shortly after I wrote the review, management came on over and actually comped our entire meal. It was pretty refreshing to have that done as customer service nowadays isn't the priority of most businesses, but I must say I was very satisfied with management for doing that for us. KUDOS"}
{"text":"I was told about this places wings, so we decided to make the trip today. Well, we came and tried them out and they weren't bad, but they weren't amazing. The sweet chili sauce is good, the amount of meat on the wings are decent at best. I'd come back for the atmosphere and beer though!"}
{"text":"We went to Half Moon Sports Grill on a Wednesday night when we had nothing to cook at our place. The fish and chips was awesome and the fish wasn't too greasy which can sometimes be the case with fish and chips. My wife had the fish tacos and also enjoyed it. Our waitress Drea was polite and attentive. I would come back again maybe on all you can eat Fish Friday."}
{"text":"Half-Moon... should change their name to \"Jeans\". I came here for butts and a nice atmosphere, but without the butts this is basically like... Applebee's or something.. three stars is generous."}
{"text":"Came in for the burgers. First timer. Burger was just alright could get a better burger at BK. You cant do substitutions,  they just charge you extra. Bacon was over cooked as well as the burger itself. Manager didnt bother to come by just walked around looking at us. Wont be back thats for sure."}
{"text":"Love the layout of bar and football watching. Outside patio is great too. Keep up the great servers that we gave had too."}
{"text":"Here is a tip for the bartender. When a person walks into your establishment, stands three feet away from your bar, and this person has not been in your establishment before, say hello. This customer is looking for some guidance and support from the staff with a bar that is 75 percent full.  I know the girls sitting at the bar are cuter than me, but I tip better.  My eventual waitress, Rachel saved the day. Good food. Good Sports Bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just about everything I want in a sports bar!  -A VERY comfortable viewing experience.   -Ample seating  -Big patio  -Good bar food. The wings are legit. Awesome, even. I tried the nuclear sauce. It kept my friend writhing in agony for a minute, but I thought they were delicious. Tastes like a hotter sriracha.   -Awesome mixed drinks at reasonable prices. And the bartenders, who are great at their jobs, really seem to enjoy using their creativity.   -The beer selection had a couple of unique choices in the seasonal New Belgium collaboration, but was otherwise mediocre.   I'd come back here to eat, drink, and watch the game. Even when there's not a game going on, people can chillax and socialize as if it's just a pub. That right there elevates this into five star territory.   Staff and atmosphere make a huge difference!"}
{"text":"Came here for a UFC fight. Horrible service. The hostess sat us down and then asked us to get up again because she made a mistake. Very unprofessional and gave an unpleasant impression for my first time in AZ. They don't do you like that in Cali."}
{"text":"Happy hour is good. Love the wings!! Reasonable drink prices and even after happy hour ended mid-meal we continued to get happy hour prices so that was much appreciated. Kids eat free damn near always! Always a good spot to hit with the wife for quick drinks or to take the kids for a bite."}
{"text":"Probably the best Half Moon location in town!   Everyone's gotta love a good sports bar. This one is centrally located, close to my gym and set up nicely. They recently, well within the last year, renovated their patio, it needed it! They have a fun fireplace in the order, high top tables, a pool table and new flat screen tv's out there now. Inside, the bar is big, tons of TVs and a private room that you can reserve for you and your friends for less distraction while watching the game or fight. **They don't charge for Pay-Per-View fights!!! :-)   As I said in my review of other Half Moon's their food is really good for bar food and they have some of the best fries I have found in this state. I also recommend the Long Island Iced Tea, be careful though, more than two and you will be on your ass."}
{"text":"Had to pay a $5 cover to sit on the patio and endure one of their salads, which consisted of lettuce, chicken, croutons, and nothing else. Maybe a good environment for football, but not much else."}
{"text":"A Half Moon is a Half Moon....   There are several locations around town and I have been to this one a few times. Great spot to watch a game or a fight; they have plenty of TV everywhere and great drink specials. There food is pretty decent for a sports bar too. However I have never eaten at this one.   The down fall for this location is the patio and how dark they keep it inside. I thought I was in a movie theater at one point. The patio needs some serious TLC. The table and chairs are years over due for a replacement and they chairs are flimsy and rock back and forth, and weren't meant to do so.   It's not too bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Random dinner location while out.  Fried zucchini:  my wife liked these.  Something about the flavor was off to me--almost had some sour fruity taste.  Not my favorite.  Hamburger:  they were out of mustard.  Who the fuck runs out of mustard?  Apparently them.  Ketchup tasted weird, overall hamburger taste, mediocre.  Service was pretty friendly, atmosphere fine, just the food was, well, kinda non-descript.  The Valley has a number of these Chicago-type places around, but I don't know if I'd call this one of the better ones.  No, it was not really that bad, but with other spots around that are much better, Half Moon really didn't stand out for me.  YMMV."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It is spacious and the building is really cool.  I liked that it was modern and clean.  They even have flat screen t.v.'s above the urinals in the men's room.  It was easy for me to find a parking spot which is always a plus.  I like going here to watch a game, for happy hour, or to meet a friend for a drink.  The customer service has always been great."}
{"text":"After seeing my negative experience/ review the manager reached out to me and gave me an all around better experience on my second visit.   The good: Responsive management who seemed to truly care that I had a bad experience at his restaurant, the wings, decent drinks and a good selection of beers.  The bad: After some great apps I was hoping for the entrees to match in quality but unfortunately they didn't - as others have mentioned its your typical bar food with typical bar food quality; the seating to the right when you walk in is practically an entirely different establishment with how shut off it is; a little pricey for the quality of the food.   Takeway? Better than my initial review indicated but it didn't live up to the promise of its very delicious wings and beers."}
{"text":"Oksy food and service. Wouldn't let our 19 year old daughter come in at 8 pm. Said they are a bar yet 2 teenagers were sitting behind us. Won't be bsck"}
{"text":"I would never go here again. Went to watch football but they barely put on the Arizona Cardinals game. I never did see my football game because we finally walked out when the first quarter of my game was over and they still had yet to put it in despite saying it was suppose to be on multiple TVs. They seem disorganized and there are servers running all over but the service is poor and customer service non existent. Save yourself the headache and hassle and go to a REAL sports bar."}
{"text":"Great bar,  however I was there on Friday 4/8/2016 and the place was busy but not crazy busy.  We were able to get seats at the bar with no wait.  However the bar is kind of big and only one bartender,  so we waited almost 15 minutes to even be acknowledged,  let alone served. Bartender was slightly rude...."}
{"text":"Went to Half Moon for an @SMCPhoenix after party.  The room we were put in was nice and large, and basically private.  Our waitress, Claire, was very attentive and personable.  Good selection of beers available. I opted for the Blue Moon, because I am partial to hefeweizens. It didn't disappoint.  I wasn't extremely hungry, so I looked to their appetizer choices. I ordered the garlic breadsticks.  Wow. They were FUCKING AMAZING!!!!!!  The garlic had a particular sweetness, and the cheese was slightly gooey, but not like napalm on your tongue.  The sauce was pretty good too, but I was so focused on the breadsticks, I couldn't say for sure.  They easily made a meal. I was full, and happy.  The location of this establishment dictates I won't be back often, but I will back."}
{"text":"I've been kicked out of here twice but I keep coming back. I'd say that is a pretty good endorsement. Their fries are phenominal. The rest is pretty much standard bar fare, but with the dearth of nightlife options in this part of the valley, you won't hear me complaining. Service can be hit or miss depending on which bartender/waitress you get."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this establishment.  Will not be back.  Changes in management was a mistake.  Would not recommend coming to a place that is so shady."}
{"text":"Had a Living Social coupon. Went on a Friday night and it was busy. Our server did her best and she was pleasant. We ordered the spicy wings and a large pizza. Both were really good. I was skeptical when the pizza first came out, but it was really delicious. Wings were cooked just right.  I would recommend and would go without a coupon. Their Happy Hour specials seem great."}
{"text":"The Good:  -Virtually any sport you want to watch, they'll have it on one of their many TVs for you.   -Strong drinks, made correctly. Their bartenders are great. -The staff is very friendly and usually quite attentive. -Patio seating is plentiful, along with a firepit for the winter and misters for the summer. -Bouncers at the door know their stuff and will take out a crazy drunk before you even have to ask.  The Bad:  -The food really isn't very good. Most of it is run-of-the-mill bar food that came out of a package and tastes like crayons (bland and boring). Their garlic fries and cheese sticks are delicious though. -It can get very crowded on big game nights, and as such service can get very slow or the servers may even not be told you've been seated (the hostesses aren't great). -Sometimes at night they play the music ridiculously loud - it's a bar, not a dance club. No one goes there to sit and not hear their company.  Go There For: A sports game with your friends to drink. Don't Go There For: A hearty meal with grandma after church on Sunday."}
{"text":"Worlds tiniest portions.  Wings so small barely any meat on them.  We ordered the breakfast skillet egg whites w extra egg...pretty sure it was only two eggs.  I'd never come back again.   Service was good  All games shown  But I came here for my Sunday football cheat meal  What a waste!!!!! I have no clue how they could ever win best of Phoenix for wings  When the waitress came by to fill our waters she said they were running out of ice.  I don't know how that's possible at noon on Sunday during football season"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT!   Not only did they have a ton of tv's but the happy hour prices are great!  The food is delicious, and the servers friendly and happy.  A group of us went for the Univ. of Washington game and they were fabulous to us. Greatly accommodating, and very friendly. LOVED that they put the sound on pretty high for us and our server even joined in for some boo's and cheers.   Definitely planning on going back!"}
{"text":"Decent service, decent prices, decent food. I'd go back, but wouldn't be my first pick."}
{"text":"Good food but a little pricey. Have only tried a couple dishes. Chilly Cheese Dog & cheese cake we're super yummy."}
{"text":"Very good chicken salad sandwich! Maybe yogurt in the mix? Will return. Also, the bartender and manager were very friendly. Cool spot!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here years and the place is always fun and the food is great! A big reason I come back all the time is because of the staff. Samala is always smiling and makes the experience that much better! And of course Alex, she kicks ass!  Two big reasons why I enjoy this bar!"}
{"text":"I go to the Half Moon Grill six or eight times a year with my wife... And everything is acceptable the only complaint I would have is that it's a little pricey"}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped jalapeños are just awesome,  plenty of TVs, and good service.  Try the fuego burger if you like the spicy side of life !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, polite staff. They had my favorite beer Kiltlifter, fish and chips were really good. The humus appetizer probably needs more pita bread. I sat outside and enjoyed the fire pit. It was a bit more pricey than I had expected maybe I'll come by @ happy hour."}
{"text":"This place has been there for a long time, I visited for lunch, its was okay.  I went back a few months later for lunch and it was new business.  It is now a Chicago-esque sports grill.  Same art work on the walls of women working out with their crevices exposed, all tastefully done of course.  The space is layed out the same, dining area, bar area and a nice sized outdoor patio.  There are good views of TVs from just about everywhere.  Happy Hour is a good mix of professionals who work in the Biltmore area to locals. Service was fine, although somehow my tab for 4 beers came up to over $30 there, which my domestic draft taste was surprised by.  The pretzel was ginormous and came with a cheese dipping sauce that was more upscale than the norm, good stuff."}
{"text":"The service is typically bad and they didn't put the ASU football game on for us."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood bar for me. I love coming over and getting wings or a salad and a couple cold beers. The food is not award winning but it's what you would expect from a bar. Being from Chicago I like the Chicago aspect of the bar"}
{"text":"Half moon has an average atmosphere and the servers appear to be helpful and nice; however, after spending some time for a birthday party, it became very apparent that the staff's motive was to make as much as they could off a large group. The female servers catered to the male customers and ignored multiple requests from female guests. Who's giving the tip in the end? It also appears to be a very shady practice of this place to say that their shots are \"chilled\", but are in fact 75% water. Altogether, a group of 3 ordered 13 shots and accepted the \"free\" shots handed out--the end result: ZERO buzz. Somewhat questionable?? This will be my first and last visit. Please beware of A. Going in a large group and being taken advantage of, B. Female customers vs. male customers, C. Buying shots and being \"fooled\" into thinking your buying the real deal. I beg to ask the question how this place is still in business and has the reviews that it does."}
{"text":"Not such a good place to eat. Had wings & a burger w/ onion rings. So dry. Plus the service was HORRIBLE the ladies were rude!"}
{"text":"Stopped there around 8pm on a Saturday night.  Place was filled with Alabama fans screaming their brains out.  Could hardly hear the server, and vice versa.  Ordered Chicago Dog... Barely warm and bun soggy.  Husbands Italian beef was tasty.  Server never returned until we were finished eating, when I would have loved a beer with dinner.  Great prices, but not worth returning.  Many others places to try."}
{"text":"Service was good plenty of TV's to watch a playoff game BUT food is at best marginal.  Highly processed or lacks inspiration."}
{"text":"The place is decent, it was a Sunday around 6pm and roaring with both happy and angry football fans.   Our waitresses weren't the greatest. I had to get up and find someone to place our food order. Our waters never got refilled and they never came back to our table after the food was delivered. Sub par service, but the food was good. I had the beer battered shrimp and would go back again just for that.  I noticed on their menu they have different themed days of the week including karaoke and wine down Wednesday's, etc. which is cool. Will have to check them out again. It's definitely A-okay for a local sports bar spot."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night while visiting Phoenix.  I expected this place to be packed!  But it wasn't, there were less than 10 total people there.  Watched the warriors game, in a corner.  Supposedly people come here for the waitresses, according to yelp or tripadvisor or something, possibly to look at, but definitely not for their personality or service.  Food was fine, service was fairly slow, tap list was boring. Wish it was busier, maybe it was the time of year, maybe this place isn't that popular.  Too many other sports bars in the area, probably wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"It's one thing to have terrible service, it's another to be extremely rude on top of it. I can promise you I will never be back to this place. Worst customer service ever!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have never had a great experience, but never a bad one either. My last trip turned it into a \"very poor\" rating.   The food is only sub par and the service is average. My last visit had me really put off while I listened to a half dozen or so staff members have conversations about their \"stupid ass hole boss\" and one bartender actually told a colleague that she wished her boss would die. I don't care what your opinion of your boss is, but I don't want to listen to your drama while I eat. I was really tempted to write the management about this but then I thought I'd just quit going here because really it kind of sucks."}
{"text":"Ehhhh.  They painted the bar surface (never a good move), cheapened offerings,  raised prices.  Food is so so, service hit or miss. Patio is nice,  but you likely have better choices."}
{"text":"Won't be going here again. Made the cardinal sin of brining a coffee to an early game. Denied entry. Last time I go with friends on a Sunday and spend $200 at Half moon. Zipps it is!!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to charge $13 for a pitcher of Bud Light you should at least fill them - just saying."}
{"text":"The food is usually good, but there are occasional slips.  Service can also be spotty at times.  My last trip had two out of three dishes either mis-ordered or brought out at the wrong time.."}
{"text":"Our office recently ordered 7 lunches from them through Uber Eats. Three of the meals were salads, and all were ordered with grilled chicken. What we got was breaded fried chicken instead. We were all disappointed but I was the one affected the most because I am gluten intolerant and unable to eat breaded chicken. I spent most of my brief lunchtime on the phone with the manager who couldn't have been less professional and less empathetic. She did acknowledge that it was their fault but offered no real solution to rectifying the problem. I could tell she was frustrated with me but if she would have put herself in my position maybe she would have been more empathetic. I hope she took this as a learning experience and had a meeting with staff about it. So I was stuck eating lettuce, tomatoes and salad dressing and was hungry about an hour later with three hours left to go in my work day.  Our manager who placed the order ended up emailing Uber about the problem and they did refund us immediately for all three salads. I commend Uber Eats for their timely response. As a side note, this experience soured me on ordering from Uber Eats in the future, although it's certainly no fault of theirs and no reflection of their service. But if there is no way to resolve an issue that the restaurant makes on an order, other than a refund, then why should I bother to use the service in the future?"}
{"text":"This place is great !very good wings !very good service. Super good sound system so you can hear the Game. lots of space tons of TVs great deals on food during football games"}
{"text":"If you want a real review of this place, Half Moon, just look at the \"Not Recommended\" section and find all the real reviews that yelp has not used. Even though i still have my receipt of my time here, my voice doesn't get heard? This place is not a good place to go to. It is amature at best. My experience at this restaurant was entirely bad. I am very disappointed at yelp for hiding these real reviews. Food is horrible, customer service was by far the worst. The only thing i can really say about this place is that you will always leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I came tonight with my friend who was his first time visiting! I love it here! Our server was Shelby, she was super friendly and gave great recommendations and made a good drink i might add.. The food was really good, we had the chicken tenders, bacon wrapped chicken poppers, and the spinach dip! We had a great time tonight and my friend wants to make this our regular meet up happy hour spot, and Shelby rocks! Go see her for awesome drinks and killer service  see you next Monday night!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently great, atmosphere is fun, staff unfortunately is inconsistent.  First time we sat at the bar and were ignored.  Second time everything was great.  This last time food was delicious, server Angelica was awesome, everything was perfect UNTIL bus boy grabbed away my beer before I was done.  Not sure if we'll be back or not."}
{"text":"Went back on Tuesday after a few months. Got here about 6:45 pm for the $5 appetizers happy hour that goes from 3 pm - 7 pm from Monday through Friday. Warm soft buttery pretzels & beer cheese. This time the beer cheese was good, but a little soupy. The last time it was thick & creamy. On Tuesdays they have wings .50 wings from 7 pm - 10 pm. They tasted yummy & were cooked properly. A lot better then our last visit. But now chose not to add celery & carrots :-( Staff was nice, as they changed the televisions to our requested MLB games. Service was sufficient. :-)"}
{"text":"The food is great, service is great, I'm in the eclub and will get a great deal every now and then.  I've only been at the Highland location.  And I love the pictures on the wall of the women."}
{"text":"I ordered their \"Award winning wings\" to go and was very disappointed in the flavor. There really wasn't much to it. My disclaimer: I love my wings and consider myself a wings snob, but I was expecting the wings to be great when described as award winning.   My order was ready pretty quickly and the folks were helpful. Unfortunately I have never dined in to rate that experience."}
{"text":"This is my Sunday afternoon Burger Paradise.  The fella's at HM make truly one of the best damn Angus burgers in the valley.  Get the Pretzel Bun.  The weekly burger special (off menu item) is my favorite.  The BEST fries in town; I don't know anywhere that has better fries, nowhere.  I get excited even thinking about it and look forward to my next Sunday trip.  It is filling to boot!  Plenty of screens covering sports if you're into that.  Cool layout.  They have a pool table as well.  The waitresses have been very nice and timely.  I haven't been here when its busy or during football season - some of the reviews I read are a bit rough and hard for me to believe, I speak from my experience only.  Get the burger, enjoy the fries and pretzel bun!"}
{"text":"Yea.. .I think I won't be going back.   I was there last night for a large group viewing of a football game and in addition to a lack of any type of air conditioning in 105 degree weather outside, the drinks were lacking any alcohol being paid for as well as much ice and that is even if you could get somebody to actually take an order and come back with that order filled.  (We were warned the service is sketchy, at best.  I should not be surprised.)  After 30 minutes, we finally got drinks and an hour later, finally our meal that was ordered.  Yes, there were quite a few people in the bar although the reservation was set over a month ago for this large group so of course staffing was plentiful.    And, lets discuss the comfort... NONE.  I have never been so uncomfortable in any establishment in my life.   An overhead ceiling fan would have made the entire difference... just a note.  BUT, I did have a great time with our friends and no matter where we decide to meet up again, I'll be there.. unless its this place."}
{"text":"Great drink prices and a good overall environment. Pool tables need a bit of work but all in all an enjoyable place."}
{"text":"All their 30 TV's were playing the Cubs parade on full blast. I know it's a Chicago bar but man I was surrounded by TV's Hahaaha couldn't enjoy my beer & \"food\" Lol Yeah NEVER coming back..."}
{"text":"Best place in town for a cold beer and to watch DA bears games.iam a Chicago native and this is where I like to go get a Chicago dog & some football."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go have some drinks and enjoy some football. The spinich dip is amazing,Good prices on drinks and a great staff can't beat that."}
{"text":"Always have a good time going here great staff, good food and good prices and specials on drinks plus good stuff usually gong on the TV."}
{"text":"Great food,  friendly service. Fast and speedy on a Sunday night football day.   Will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I had not reviewed this place yet.   Before I got all moved to PHX officially, I would stay at a hotel right across the street (practically in the lobby). When in the mood for a cool adult libation, and when the walk to Chili's just seemed too much that day, I would head here. While I can't speak to their food since all I have ever had to eat there is some chips and salsa or the olives in a bloody mary or extra dirty martini. I can speak to the service, the mood/ambiance and the facilities.  Everyone there from servers to patrons were always very nice and down to earth. I enjoyed watching whatever sporting event was showing at the time. And the fire pit they have outside is so nice on a nice spring/winter night.  They always had a food or beverage special going on. I thought it was perfect after a long day."}
{"text":"Great prices and great atmosphere! The bar was fun during the UFC fights. Would definitely recommend. Sally, Alex, and Shara took fantastic care of us."}
{"text":"Everyone here is so friendly. The service is awesome, food is awesome, everything is AWESOME!  Love that Asian guy! What a charmer!"}
{"text":"I had such an amazing time here. My roommate and I went to dinner before a movie and we both have never been here before. Service was pretty good and the food was amazing. Our waitress was very prompt with keeping my drink full, I suck those teas down, and considerate when we were choosing what to order. I had the Cajun Alfredo and although it is slightly spicy for my taste it really is out of this world. The atmosphere is just what I like in a sports grill and I can definitely see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried it again after a couple of years and its still pretty terrible. The atmosphere the nice remodel created is great-my only reason for the 2 stars. Parking area still stinks.   The food is \"as good as the chef can do\"!  The menu says they have award winning wings- ok sure whatever you say.  Was there anyone else competing against you? I guarantee zipps or hazelwoods or anywhere with a fryer wasn't involved on this hokie competition. They were worse than pizza huts wings or the ones you buy frozen at costco and bake yourself.  I had the spicy bone in. I ordered the full pound and the visual of the tiny skimpy wings in the basket made me wonder the whole time if I was mistakenly given the half pound order.   In summary- great bar to watch Chicago sports but eat before or after elsewhere. This experience made me realize that continuing to always look for a better neighborhood sports bar than zipps is a waste of time.    This bar should be embarrassed by the food. Our group felt the chi fries, pretzel dip app, Italian sandwich and buffalo chicken dip were all marginal and forgettable. The personal pizza was a piece of cardboard with sauce and cheese.  No one felt ordering something we had was worth trying again at anytime in the future.   I will give them a tiny bit of mercy as this was a HUGE  game and the place was full but the FOOD was not memorable in any way."}
{"text":"Ugh, I became the Duke of this place on my last visit, but will relinquish my throne willingly.  Happy hour menu antics are back in play and I have had enough (must be a football season tactic judging by the pattern). We will keep our money for a place with less wily tactics.  Here's a tip for the management always trying to cut corners on happy hour: hire less bitchy bartenders and hostesses. I mean c'mon, do you really need 2 girls standing at the door to beat back the crowds (~sarcasm~) of people you have just scared away yet again???  Oh, and don't even get me started about the one time we showed up and had to wait over 20 min. for a menu?? One Menu. ONE MENU... for 4 people and the table next to us was waiting longer for ... yep, you guessed it... for one menu. WTF??? Hello, you're a restaurant that wasn't even half full! I hope you bought enough of this new \"crappy\" placemat menu to go around to every chair until you close.  Sadly, I've removed this place from my Happy Hour list for the last time...  Please tell me the location down off Camelback didn't do this too."}
{"text":"Good service and decent food.  Deceptively sweet/spicy wing sauce - I was disappointed with the spice level of my buffalo chicken salad until I was about half way through it and I realized... yep... a nice burn had appeared.  Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Its right across the street from my house, so I definitely love that.  It is the Players Sports Bar of Arizona. Completely and utterly reminds me of San Marcos, CA with the younger crowd, addicted to sports and dying to drink.  The music was a little loud for my taste, but we did go for a later-evening drink. It had more of a local feel to it than anything, probably because of its location.  The beers were moderately price, and the service wasn't too bad.  The patio is legit though, thats where I would head if I wanted to grab a drink with a friend during the day."}
{"text":"I'll start with the most important fact first... this is a Chicago bar.  This means all Chicago Bears games are shown with the volume on!  Daaaaaa Bears!    Ok, now on to the other stuff...  The bar/restaurant is quite large so there are plenty of tables and seats.  I surveyed the view from many of the seats and most provide a good view of one or more TVs.  In the main room, I believe they even have a projector style TV with a huge screen.  One word of caution, if you're going for a Bears game, the seats do fill up quickly!  The servers all seem to be on top of their game (no pun intended).  Ordering food and drinks is easy even when this place is busy... and the kitchen and bartenders get the food and drinks out quickly!  I have had the pizza multiple times.  To me, the pizza crust is not as thick as a Chicago-style thin crust should be... but the taste is top-notch!  The crust has crunch, the toppings are piled on, and the sauce is just the right combination of sweet and tangy.    Drink prices a little pricey, but certainly not outrageous.  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place.... Love the bar... Whoever is making the girls wear jeans now is a moron."}
{"text":"Ok. So they do a great job by having different college sports teams for game watching. What they don't do is hire good servers. Most of them are very young, so maybe that is the problem, but young also means trainable so maybe there is a training issue. I mean I never had a rude server, it's just they are soooooo SLOW. I mean somebody needs to put a swift kick in their funky butts. lol     I've been here even when it was not crowded and the same type of service. No sense of urgency. Just whenever they get to it type of attitude."}
{"text":"While I do enjoy the cheap food and beer during happy hour, fighting for someone to wait on you is quite the process. I go out because I want someone to take care of me, to entertain me I guess. Otherwise I'd just stay home and eat and drink.   The last time I was there, I left my card on the bar to cash out -- my beer had long since been empty and the bartenders clearly had no interest in refilling it. Time to go. He came over, asked me if I was ready to cash out and I said Yes! and pushed my card towards him. Rather than taking my card, he ran off, came back with my check and ran away again without taking my payment. Still waiting over here! The guy next to me was quite entertaining telling me that they don't let you leave.  I've been up to the store on Bell. The service there is much better. As for this one near the Biltmore, I'll avoid it."}
{"text":"Horrible service and servers are congregated together having their own little party and ignoring the fact that the carbonated water nozzle has fallen on the floor.  This place is just nasty."}
{"text":"A nice different option for lunch, my brother and I enjoyed the burgers recently.  They were offered in an assortment of sizes and toppings, but since it was the first time there, I opted for a plain burger on a pretzel bun.  The flavor and consistency, while not the best in town, was pretty nice, and actually surprisingly good for 'bar food'.   Service was decent, although for the lunch hour it really wasn't very busy at all.  I think I would like to come here for llunch again, and try something different, although the menu isn't that large, and for a craving for a burger I will choose another place.  I guess this is around 3.65, but i'll round 'em up.  What can I say? The black and white photos on the walls of sexy chicks with their plumber's cracks exposed ('half moon\") may have swayed me."}
{"text":"This place has really tasty food, and a great happy hour.  I think burgers are half on Saturdays?  Something like that.  They have a decent amount of TVs, but should probably replace the old school projectors with flat screen TVs.  There is usually plenty of seating room, but you may not be able to see the game you are looking for.  The service usually isn't that great.  It's slow and takes forever to get served, but if you're not in a hurry this is a decent place to come eat and drink and watch a little sports."}
{"text":"Half moon sports bar and grill best place in Phoenix to watch football food is great great service and great company will definitely be back every Sunday"}
{"text":"The primary reason I am giving Half Moon a 3 star is due to the their audio programming choice when we visited.  I've been to Half Moon many times and the food is always pretty decent.  However this evening I brought my buddy from Chicago here to watch the Cubs vs Diamondbacks game.  Half Moon says they are a Windy City Sports Grill.  To our surprise they did have the Cubs vs the hometown Diamondbacks game on but the audio in the bar area was turned on to the LA Rams vs Dallas Cowboys PRESEASON football game.  I'm rather confused as how you can bill yourself as a Windy City Sports Grill in Phoenix, Arizona and when the Cubs are playing the Diamondbacks and you have Rams vs Cowboys audio on.  Go Cubs Go!"}
{"text":"It's really a simple concept. Acknowledge all customers and serve them when their glass is empty. The Embassy Suites was kind enough to take me there but the service at the bar was truly disappointing."}
{"text":"People... stop waiting in line!  Saint Francis, The Windsor,  Barrio Café, Oreganos, these places should be paying you to eat there, not having you waste your time waiting in line to be fed. If you are looking for one delicious hamburger, excellent service and not a 30 - 45 minute wait then look no further. Half Moon Sports Grill (Biltmore/Highland) I stopped in one weekend to catch the first couple of innings of a Diamondbacks baseball game and OMG, it was like finding a $50 dollar bill on the ground! I walked in on 119 degree day and was welcomed with a cold blanket of relief. It must have been 72 degrees in the restaurant. I didn't want to leave until late October. I was quickly greeted by a friendly staff member and was instructed to sit wherever my heart desired. The waiter/waitress in training notified me of the specials, $3 draft beers and half price burgers all weekend long. What else could you ask for- $3 beer and half price burgers. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar served on a pretzel bun and holy Gordon Ramsay it was cooked to perfection. The dish even came with sweet potatoes fries which I generally am not interested in but was quite flavorful.  The entire time I was eating I just couldn't figure why there was only 12 people in the entire restaurant.  It was an awesome experience and at a fraction of the price. It just solidified my belief that you don't have to wait in a 45 minute line to enjoy a good meal. So get off that ridiculous waiting list to be seated and get over to Half Moon Sports Grill and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ya know, I really had a good time at the beginning.  I went after a nice round of golf and it started out fine. Had a few apps and plates of food, a few beers, and the food came out tasting really well.  Then we moved to a pool table because my buddy's girlfriend came to meet up with us, and she had been babysitting the other buddy's daughter. So now we have three guys, two girls, and a three year old.  There is hardly anyone else in the bar, and we still had to walk up to the bar to get service. Annoying.  We got tired of the pool table and lack of service so we went to the bar to close out. This place charges $15 to rent the billiard balls. Are you effing kidding me??? In an empty bar, you are going to charge people to stay and hang out for a bit to play some pool? If the bartender had told us it was going to cost $15 we would have left. Two stars, only because the food was decent."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sports bars in the area. Its a very laid back atmosphere. They have a ton of tv's at the bar and throughout the lounge and patio areas, great for watching mutiple sporting events at one time. The staff here is always helpful and the drinks are reasonably priced with great deals on food and drinks during happy hour. If you're l(oking for a great bar to catch a game or fight i'd suggest checking this place out"}
{"text":"Came here with some co-workers.  Wanted something else besides my usual salad. I opted for the Prime Rib Sliders...they were not good.  They were cold and when I told the bartender he set them right back.  So the customer service was great, but even warm they were just not good.  Definately not worth the $16.00 plus tip I had to pay.  Guess I will have to stick to salads if I go back, at least that is suppose to be cold :)"}
{"text":"TVs everywhere, with lots of space and seats around the bar make this a welcoming place.  Super friendly wait staff make enjoying the good beer selection easy.  I was not starving and just wanted a bite with my beer so I was happy to see the zucchini starter which was breaded with a Parmesan crust and served with ranch dressing, it was the perfect side to my beveridge.  The only thing I would do different is cut the zucchini into spears for dipping rather than the coins.  Comfortable space that I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Four stars mainly for the vibe.  If you can sit outside, even better.   Mildly overpriced but pretty consistent with places with a similar vibe.  Solid wings and happy hour specials.   Overall, I'd recommend.  Even better with friends."}
{"text":"I went here for Happy Hour with some friends and it was very good.  I got one of those cocktails in a mason jar (the Chizona?) and it was very delicious.  They've got great service and good deals too."}
{"text":"I like this place the atmosphere is very chill not too stuffy and a good mix of people. The alcohol is cheap and the food is delicious I recommend their beer batter Mozzrella stick and their burgers. the wait staff is friendly once you can get one's attention."}
{"text":"Had an outstanding experience here tonight! It was obvious they didn't expect the place to be packed and they did amazing!! Jasmine was our server and she was amazing. I didn't get the managers name, but he was fantastic too! There was not an open seat in the place and they rocked it! I run a restaurant myself, and I was beyond impressed. Thanks guys for a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"This was probably my worst experience. I used to come here frequently, and tonight I came here to watch UFC 207. So i got here at 6 o'clock and stayed more then 3 hours waiting for a table. In this middle time they put a lot a people in our front. The manager simply disappear and all the waitresses were lost. The gave to us a lot of lies. The manager never bothered to come speak to us, clear things up. HE DIDNT STAND UP FOR HIS DECISION. The hostess was also very weak because she couldn't even get her story straight. It was ridiculous. I felt disrespected as a customer. I even offered to pay for a table if that was what it took to be seated at this ridiculous restaurant. Absurd. Never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Food was bland. Service was sloooooooooooowwwww. At one point my partner and I thought they might have been having a \"team meeting\" in the back because there were no servers to be found on the floor."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Good service, sports atmosphere, good appetizers, great food. I actually think this place has the best chicken fingers in town. They're thick, juicy, so flavorful! Mmm Delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Great! wings great grilled romaine salad but our server Renata was the BOMB!! So sweet and nice!!! Loved watching our hometown Blackhawks in the playoffs!!!"}
{"text":"After noticing the $6.89, 16inch garden thin crust pizza we got it, but it was cold and not near the $6.89 price on the menu. Total waste and lies! After telling the waitress our service got real bad. You can't charge different prices. Looks like a consumer protection issue here!"}
{"text":"Half Moon is a favorite amongst my group of friends. The staff is generally beyond friendly and the establishment is always very clean. Cant go wrong with 1/2 price apps and $3 drafts during happy hour (mon-fri 3-7) and reverse hh (10-close nightly). They also have the buddy pack (2 pounds of wings and 4 draft beers) for $20 during all Suns, Coyotes and Dbacks games! They have a rewards program that allows regulars to save $10 every now and then. Also one of the few places Ive found that does not charge a cover for UFC PPVs. In the case that you have too much fun, a free shuttle service is available for use within 3 miles. *Some constructive criticism* They desperately need to update their directv connection. The picture on many of the tvs often times appears distorted or stretched bc they dont have hd connections. All things considered though, if you live in the area you would be missing out by not giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Chicken buffalo dip is great, this place is very very over priced for what you get,  Happy Hour is best time to go... Service is questionable... If u have  left overs and want to take them home guard them with your life..."}
{"text":"OMG, their Italian Hoagie is to die for!!!  I went here with my guy to pass some time on Tuesday during their lunch hour.  We shared the Italian Hoagie, and he had a spicy enchilada soup which he was so busy eating that he didn't even slow down to talk.  He was still finishing his soup as I ate the last of my Hoagie.  Let me tell you, I was seriously eying his untouched half I had enjoyed mine so much.  The Italian Hoagie was on a delicious, perfectly crusty roll, with Genoa salami, pepperoni, cured ham, provolone, giardiniera, peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and Italian dressing. When ordering, I was tempted to omit the mayo (which I don't generally eat), but I followed my gut and decided to have the hoagie just the way they usually prepare it.  I was so glad that I did.  Taking a bite into the crisp roll, my mouth was then filled with delicious meat and cheese, spicy savory toppings and the juiciness of the mayo and tangy Italian dressing.  It was love at first bite for me.  Next time I'm having a whole hoagie of my own!  We sat at the bar, and service was very friendly and very efficient, and they seemed to be constantly available.  The ambiance was pleasant, and since they weren't too busy during my visit, the noise level was not a factor.  This is a trip across town for me, but I will absolutely be making the trip again soon.  It may be awhile until I get past the Hoagie to try something else on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best veggie burgers I've had at a non-vegetarian restaurant. Their guacamole is excellent! Will definitely be returning! The Postmates ordering sucks for them the menu details aren't very good I would suggest looking the menu up online. We called in an order for pickup and the girls were awesome to deal with! It's rare to order bar food and they get it right and it's delicious!! Oh and garlic fries do I need to say more!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks & sports viewing.  There are about a jillion huge screens with everything from football, baseball, surfing, racing, etc on tv.  Nice outdoor patio, comfy lounge chairs, some video games & pool table.  Reverse happy hour from 10PM-2AM is a plus!  Would totally come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and drinks are good a price, 3 dollar dos equis! The service is always excellent too, I love Shelby, Brooke, Hunter, the Asian guy and Sammie! They are always attentive with any questions. So if you come here ask to be in their section.   Also I would recommend the burger or spinach dip!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and good food. The service was horrible. Four of us ordered.  Two got their food and were finished before I received my food. I was finished with mine and 10 minutes later my wife got her food. The sauce she ordered for her Wings were wrong.  The waitress took my empty glass of diet coke and never offered or brought back a refill."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!! SERIOUSLY DONT WASTE YOUR $$  Being a native Chicagoan I had high hopes. As someone who has been a server and bartender for the last 10 years...I had mediocre expectations seeing as how it was game day. Walking in, the place was DEAD. I mean DEAD. The TVs were cool, the bar was nice and big...empty...nice big and empty. The restaurant was super empty. There were maybe a dozen people in here tops!   Our server was a millennial - so again mediocre expectations - even with the place being dead I was anticipating a half ass attempt. Maybe it was her unkept hair or the skirt she had on that was way to big...or that she dragged her feet when she walked as if to say \"I seriously do not want to be here right now\". I will nevermind the fact that she didn't even know whose football jersey she had on. Lol. The girl must have a severe allergy to smiling too because that was not happening.   The first round of beers took about 15 mins to get to our table. The waters ....about 20mins. Strange because beer comes in a bottle and water out of a tap. So...unless the entire bar was out of bottle openers and faucets...I can't see why this took so long. Whatever, overlooked it because I was anticipating authentic Chicago eats!!!   I ordered a Maxwell street polish. My boyfriend ordered a burger. His brother - a burger and his brothers wife - a salad. My boyfriend's brother had a plane to catch so we had time but not a ton of \"waiting for our waitress to stop facebooking on the clock at the hostess stand\" time.   The food came an hour later. AN HOUR for two burgers a salad and a freaking glorified hot dog. It takes less time to drive to Fry's, buy ground beef, heat the grill, make 2 burgers, chop a salad, and microwave a hot dog. Whatever, overlooking it because the food is going to be so good.......right?   NOT! NOT EVEN CLOSE! The burgers sat under the heat lamp in the kitchen window for what must have been an eternity, or at least thats what the burger texture told us. My polish sausage bun was so hard I could knock on the table with it. You know when you find old hot dog buns in the BACK of the pantry and say \"oh we'll feed it to the birds bc its obviously old and stale\", and when you do the buns just crumble into dust particles? THIS WAS MY BUN! The salad was \"fine\". SHOCKER  I ask the food runner (oh no wait she was the shift manager. Why the shift manager is running the food for the complacent millennial waitress is beyond me)- can you go get me another bun so i don't break my teeth on this thing. She says sure no problem and takes the entire basket of food away. My boyfriend's brother also asked for a new burger and asked to make it quick this time because he had a plane to catch. She whisks off into the kitchen and he and I wait. My boyfriend decided to keep his burger because he was starving and didn't want to hulk out in the restaurant. He ate a few bites of it and was completely grossed out. It was rubbery and the cheese was hard.   20 mins later still no new burger and no new hot dog bun. WTH!!!??!?! I go to the hostess station and the hostess is facing the corner texting on her phone. I stand and wait for her to finish......and wait........and wait........and shake my head giggle and wait. She turns around and says \"OMG I'm so sorry....can i help you?\" i tell her to finish her text, that I can wait. She laughs and says no its ok how can I help you. I ask to speak w/  a manager. She asks why and I want to say \"to rat on you for texting at the hostess station kiddo\", but tell her I have a question. I wait and wait and wait she never comes back. I walk BACK to my table and there's the manager...at the table. Wait she's the food runner? Apparently not...she's the shift manager. My boyfriend and his brother explain what an ordeal its been. She apologizes and brings a new burger and polish out. We asked what was going on in the kitchen and what is with the servers crap attitude? I mean not even pretending to be appreciative that she has a job! The manager kind of had the same attitude though. We got a very scripted apology and a $25 gift card. The manager said \" i will make sure we take the second polish off your bill and the hamburger\". I'm sorry the SECOND polish? I asked for a new bun not an entirely new polish sausage. Really? You really think you're doing me a solid by taking the second polish off the bill...as in...you were going to charge me for 2 but since we voiced our concerns w/ our service your manager in training etiquette and experience in customer service compelled you to \"comp\" the 2nd polish sausage? Get outta here.   We will NEVER come here again. We used the gift card to pay for the salad, the other burger that my boyfriend had 2 bites of, and the beers.   STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!! THE STAFF IS TERRIBLE THE MGMT IS TERRIBLE THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE THE KITCHEN IS TERRIBLE. I could see if they were swamped...then maybe I wouldn't be so brutally honest but they weren't! NO EXCUSE!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Homewood Suites across the parking lot. Wanted to watch the Kings game, so, how perfect was this!   Walked inside...they were busy, but not slammed. Waited, waited and waited. Counted about 6 servers walking around...no host??   Walked down to the bar......no contact.... Well...that's about enough of that!!  Walked right out!!  I'm patient...but...common!! You got a bus running around town to pick people up, but, don't bother with the ones that walk through the door!!"}
{"text":"In the past I've loved half moon, now my feeling are neutral.. The menu had recently (since I was here last) and I'm not that impressed. They've adopted the Chicago theme, which is fine but not beneficial. The burger has a great need flavor and very juicy, but served ala carte and not really noted on the menu, which makes it look like a great value until your served your food and have to wait for accompaniments. It appears they're cutting food costs based on the table spoon of ketchup and mustard that are delivered, also by request and not assumed with a burger order.. Lastly the fish was eh, so so. Soggy is the best word I can think of.. All in all I enjoy the atmosphere and fellow Chicago football fans but will only be back for drinks and the TVs not the food.. :( sad, im still hungry.."}
{"text":"I tried the Friday Fish Fry. The coleslaw was very good, the fish was good (small initial portion but they will bring you more), the tartar sauce was just a little off so I switched to malt vinegar, the fries, small initial portion again, were good as well. They will bring you more of any of the three items, I went with a second round of fish and coleslaw and for some reason they brought me a refill of ketchup as well. I went around 1:30 and the service was a little strange. I was eating alone so I brought a book. I ordered a beer and then the Fish Fry. The food came out very quickly, maybe 5 minutes, great so far. I ate the food while reading and kept reading for probably 10 minutes in a mostly empty place before she came by to ask if I wanted more. I said more fish and coleslaw please. For some reason, round 2 took over 25 minutes to arrive after order. Since I had a book, I didn't really care too much. I again waited for about 15 minutes for the check after I was done eating. Over all it was ok."}
{"text":"Wings are on fleek. Usually pretty stiff crown n gingers. Bottomless mimosas during football? Love this place. The football specials are awesome. The chicken tenders are legit and not processed; they use actual meat. If you get the wings try the the honey chipotle."}
{"text":"Alright, I love half moons food but gosh I can not believe the service! It's still horrible and I feel bad saying it because our server lastnight was sweet and all but I've never had such horrible service. Actually twice in a row. We came about a week and a half ago for the wings because hands down the best wings in phoenix but we kept getting ignored by our server she was more focused on her I'm guessing Co workers who were hanging out in the patio. We had to seriously wait almost 25 minutes for our check. Our plates were stacked up also which is a clear indicator that we were pretty much done with our meal.   Now we came again lastnight and I seriously was contemplating on even going there because I said to my roommate these exact words \"I don't know if I want to go because we always get stuck with the worst server\" and I totally jinxed it. We sat in the patio, I love the patio it's my favorite spot. Our table never got wiped down so we sat and ate on a sticky table. We ordered spinach dip first and it was sent to the wrong table. (I'm very observant, I'm a hospitality major and was warned if I were to continue with this career my whole restaurant dining experience would change because I pay attention to everything. I also work for a very fast pace busy restaurant who was rank top five for best service in all of phoenix) anyways, we ordered a burger to split, the California burger to be specific and it was delicious! However, it was very messy and we had one napkin to share, absolutely no silverware around and no plates. I've never had to share a napkin at a restaurant yet alone pass my plate back and fourth across the table. Then we got our wings, gotta get wings when you're at halfmoon.! They were of course delicious as always but she took our silverware when she pre-bussed our table and didn't bring us new ones  we were just so over it that we ate the wings chugged our drinks and asked for the check. Thankfully I have cash always because I also am a server. But I wasn't about to wait another 20 minutes for her to bring my card back.   Not all servers are bad we've gotten great service from a few girls, but I was taught that we're a team and everyone helps each other out, there were two other girls working the patio who never really acknowledged us. We made it very clear and obvious that we needed refills on drinks, napkins, our server or service! I felt very neglected as a guest."}
{"text":"This review is a 2.5 rounded up to a 3 now.  I've been to this location a hand full of times.  This review is heavily weighted on my most recent experience.  I came here last Friday for a Yelper UYE to watch the Kitchen Nightmares Finale.   I hate to complain because I wasn't the organizer of the event, but a reservation was made for a group of folks to come out and watch the season finale of a TV show.  One would think that the room that was reserved would have a door, that could be closed, to quiet the noise of the restaurant so that the group could do what it came to do to, watch AND LISTEN to the TV program.  Unfortunately, our group could barely here the television because the \"room\" (actually a 3-sided space) we were in was separated from the rest of the restaurant by a partition that didn't close off the entire walkway into the cubby-hole-like space.  I don't think any of the fellow Yelpers at that table were happy with the space.    I ordered the calamari and it was a downer for me, a never repeat again'er.  I was so hungry after not eating all day that  I ate that calamari and the entire time, I wondered why did I order THAT dish!   the only upside and bright spot was my cocktail.  I think it was called a dirty blue martini.  That  thing was delicious.  Would I go back here, only if someone else is organizing something at this location and I had no say or influence in moving the venue.   UPDATE: Their management told me that in the future they will no longer reserve that space for people interested in watching and hearing a TV program.  It might be ok for a sports show though, but not for what we were there for.  They have a different space that is quieter and more appropriate for watching a TV program.  That room was booked before the UYE was booked.  Hats of to their management for reaching out to me."}
