{"text":"Ok, this place is a GEM! This may be the first time I've ever been inspired to make a YELP review, but these guys deserve people to know about them!  It's INSIDE a tiny indoor 'mall' in the heart of idyllic Amish Country.  The place is small, only about a dozen tables. The whole place was being run by two young girls, one Amish, who couldn't have been more sweet and attentive to every person there.  The menu is simple... MEAT. They have 3 basic specialties: Smoked Beef Brisket, Pastrami and Corned Beef.  You can get them each separate open face style or in any of their great Sandwich combos.  We started with the days soup, a 'Chicken Mac' soap. Wow. The chicken was slow smoked and the whole soup had a smokey flavor and a peppery kick. Then to main course.  Being my first time I had to go with the \"Triple Threat\".  A Ciabatta roll stuffed with a generous portion of all 3 meats. My wife got the \"Big Dip\", your basic French Dip sandwich.  The issue.... Which meat to eat!?  It was just fantastic.  The Beef Brisket is thinly shaved, but with a crispy edge and SO tender, not dry at all. Lindsey's \"Big Dip\" was easily 2-3 sandwhiches worth of Brisket piled onto a Hoagie with an amazing Au Jus.  My Triple Threat was the hit. Each meat was as good as the next.  The Pastrami and Corned beef had deep flavor and the smokey brisket was killer.  The 3 cheese combo on top was not too much and perfect. I'll admit, although the mac n' cheese was clearly homemade it was a little bland but made a good textural combo as a side.   We left full, smiling and with lunch and snacks for the next day! The bill was $25. You can't beat that.  Want to TOP it off... .the door across from them is a small family Ice Cream shop open as late as the restaurant!  Even better, next to that is a 50 year family donut shop!  Beware, they close at 6pm and are only open Wed-Sat. GIVE BRISKET GRILLE a few moments with your tastebuds... you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"For the food, it's definitely 5 stars. However, we just drove 15 miles to have supper, only to find a sign on the door \"Temporarily closed at 4pm.\" WTH?!?  Does that mean just today... or this week...or does it mean they're closed at 4, but will be back at 5...?  We are not happy, but we will still be back for the food--I guess we will call first to be safe."}
{"text":"They are the only game in town for brisket. Its sliced thin, they use it mainly for sandwiches but we are gluten free etc.. It would be great if they made some more thickly sliced for a dinner. It was tender, not dry and had a nice smoke to it. We ordered it for take out and asked for 1# and it cost $15. Not bad.  I guess this was a new concept for them selling it by the pound but they were amenable.   We did not try anything else as we are limited due to diet.  They have salads, soups, grilled chicken tenders, and signature sandwiches which include Reubens of course. They smoke, in house, corned beef, pastrami and beef briskets.  The menu states they have 1/2# Pat LaFrieda burgers on a brioche bun.  They offer breakfast on Friday and Saturday from 7-1pm and you can get brisket with your eggs or hotcakes  or french toast.  The dining room was pleasant and clean and staff very friendly and willing to ask questions on our behalf.   This restaurant is in an odd little mall behind McDonalds and in front of Walmart.  Open Mon-Thurs 10am-7pm and Fri-Sat 7am-8pm, Closed Sunday."}
{"text":"My expectations for a brisket joint in Middlefield, Ohio were pretty low. Fortunately, the Brisket Grille knocked it out of the park on my first visit.   The Triple Threat is fantastic. I've been back several times but no visit compared to the first.   Keep the quality and I'll be a regular."}
