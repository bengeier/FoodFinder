{"text":"I like this place. The highlight was the beef. It was always fresh even during the summer time. (Some hot pot places changed their beef when summer time rolled around - which kind of makes sense because hot pot isn't as popular during the summer)

They have a communal sauce pot which gets passed around from table to table, something that I'm not too crazy about. The amount of sauces available are limiting compared to another hot pot place that's on East Wilmot.

Staff are friendly too. 

Their dim sum offering at lunch time is pretty decent and I recommend it, I go there frequently for lunch.

I didn't try the seafood option, I just got the regular beef option and I've tried different soups, all are flavourful when I've ordered them.

There is a decent section of food to choose from. 

Dessert was decent but not many choices.

They also offer all you can drink lemon or plum drink. You can even ask for regular Chinese tea."}
{"text":"I don't know what I  ate  after spending $20+. The seafood is not fresh at all. The fish ball stuff have no taste mix a lot of flour etc. The washroom stinks so bad this can tell you how well they prepare anything. And why is the egg dessert soooooo yellow? You think about it"}
{"text":"Absolute worst restaurant experience ever.

First of all, the food was absolutely disgusting. Not only was it something that was out of the ordinary for us (such as lobster cut in half, still alive and moving), but the food lacked freshness, and it was all so bland.

Second, it expensive for something we were completely unsatisfied with, and a 10% gratuity charge is automatically added onto the bill.

Needless to say, we went to timmies afterwards to grab a bagel cause we left that place still feeling hungry!"}
{"text":"One of my worst restaurant experiences.

The first issue was that our order sheet was 'somehow' lost, and we ended up writing our entire order again. This was our first order after waiting for 20 minutes. Second, when our revised order finally came through we asked for things like more soy sauce, water, etc. but they NEVER came. Lastly they forced a 10% service charge on the already expensive bill with such poor service.

They were extremely understaffed the night I went to the point where they had to call their sons and daughters to help out. I saw several people from other tables stand up with their order sheet waving down a waiter with frustration. The food was not exceptionally good for the price you are paying. With such bad service I would discourage anyone from trying this place to pay for their child labour..."}
{"text":"Umm, this review is gonna be short.

1. Terrible customer service, bad at best.
Reason - atrocious attitudes and hard selling paid soup base (sneaky little turds). I think I can choose my own soup, thank you.

2. Pathetic wait time.
Reason - ordered food and took at least 10 minutes to come.. Hot pot is all you can eat, and AYCE usually comes right away!

3. Very pushy, especially when we got close to finishing. 
Reason - you never EVER rush a customer to leave, no matter how busy the place is.. Unless it has a seating time restriction. What I learned from CS is the customer always wins. If you cannot acknowledge that much, then don't bother working there.

4. One star for such a terribad restaurant
Reason - listed above. Hell, if I had a choice, I'd vote it 0."}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum in the morning

++ Over 50 items on the Dim Sum menu provides a lot of variety
+ Dumplings are exceptional in general and freshly made
+ Pricing is fair, all Dim Sum with the exception of premium dishes are $3.00 flat each
- Quality of the food can vary from time to time, food came cold sometimes
- Service was below average, orders were mixed up and we were charged for things we didn't order

Overall a decent experience for the price, but there are better dim sum to be found in the Markham/Richmond Hill area if you are willing to pay a premium."}
{"text":"On our first at the beginning of the year, our experience was decent.  Service was good and we were overall satisfied.

However, on our most recent visit with the exact same people - we were in for one long night. One long night without food that is.

We had to repeatedly remind the waitresses of our food orders, not twice, not thrice but four to five times!  We even ordered items that cost extra on top of the buffet.  We literally wanted to give them more money but instead, they didn't want to bring us what we ordered!  

There were 15-20 minutes stretches in the evening where we did not have anything to dunk into the hotpots but vegetables!  Repeated reminders to the kitchen staff went largely ignored to please kindly bring us raw food stuffs for our 2 hotpots at our table!

I have not experienced horrendous service in a long time!  It were not as if the restaurant was super busy, but only half full.  And it being the weekend, management should have lent a hand or schedule enough staff to handle the higher volume of customers.

To top it all off, after we had paid in cash (as they only accept cash as payment) the waitress stood right there at the table and counted the money in front of us!  I have never seen this anywhere, not even at other Chinese run establishments!!

Needless to say, we did not tip more than we had to and we have no plans to return to Lucky Season Hot Pot ever again!"}
{"text":"Hey. Ended up here because literally, every other hot pot place in the area was SO JAM PACKED.. On a Wednesday night.. at 8:30pm.. (seriously, we went to like 3-4 other locations before ending up here).

And honestly, kind of glad we did. No line at all, actually it wasn't too busy. They have dim sum during the day, and you can also choose to order from their hot kitchen at dinner time, but everyone else in there eating that night was there for hot pot. $18.99 for beef and $21.99 for seafood (which includes a half lobster for each person). Pretty sweet deal, but we opted for the beef. 

The beef came in huge portions! This is my quam with most other hot pot places. You order a lot of beef and they only bring you about half of what you expected. 

The variety of things to eat are good also. The service was good too."}
{"text":"My family suggested going to this place for hot pot, and to be honest this place is not so bad compared to the other reviews. The service was probably better since I was with the parents, and they tend to treat you better if you speak their native language. 

We got the seafood all you can eat hotpot and it was delicious. The lobster was fresh. Each person got half a lobster which was pretty good. I had an extra one since somebody at my table did not want theirs. It can get a little messy, so if you do not want to get messy, I would not suggest going there. 

On top of that, there was dessert. The mango dessert was delicious and unique compared to the other desserts I've had in Chinese restaurants. They also serve ice tea in a pitcher. 

When the bill came, it was a bit confusing as they did not divvy up the price and I did not see the added tip people were talking about. There was tax they added of course. Regardless, I felt we paid a reasonable price for what we got."}
{"text":"My family discovered this place because of its cheap price for dim sum, $2.8 per dish is quite a good deal these days. 

The food was good, I like that all dishes were always hot making everything tasted much better! However, their dim sum menu needs more variety, it's always the same steamed dishes every time we visit. 

Service was ok, as it's with all Chinese restaurants, one male server was particularly lazy trying to avoid refilling our water pots or taking orders. 

Overall a good place for cheap dim sum!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? Let's try to keep this simple and quick.  Service was horrendous, food took forever to come, rude waitresses, and bland food. Recipe for disaster, highly recommend going elsewhere unless you enjoy all the aforementioned statements above. Oh they also charge for tea, thought I just plug that in."}
{"text":"$2.80 per dimsum with all the goodies. So good!!!! First time I tried this custard bao and it was pretty good. Sui Mei and ha gao were on point! Lots of tables and we didn't have to wait to get one Sunday lunch. 

Dimsum is a definite yes at this place"}
{"text":"***DIMSUM REVIEW*** NOT HOTPOT***
This place might have the lowest number of stars i've seen on Yelp (1.5* at the time of writing), but thankfully I didn't have the hot pot here and probably never well.

I asked my friend to pick a good dimsum place and he said his favourite was dragon boat down the street, but we had to wake up and get there before 10:30am so I said eff that. This was his second choice, with good food, and more reasonable prices...and never any line up. Given the ratings I'm no longer surprised. But he was right! This place was pretty good...for its dimsum! He's never tried the hot pot there either.

Between the 7 of us, we had a ton of food. For the most part, I got to eat some of my usuals, and some not so usuals:
- shrimp dumpling (hargow): good
- spare ribs and taro: very good
- chicken feet: very good
- chicken rice wrapped in lotus leaves: REALLY GOOD
- shrimp rice roll: good
- beef short ribs: okay
- fried octopus tenacles: okay
- braised beef tendons: okay

I did not break out in hives after having their shrimp, so it must be pretty fresh.

There was a bunch of other stuff as well and they were all decent. The bill was about $10 per person after tax and tip. Super cheap. Service is a little lacking, but not a huge problem."}
{"text":"2.5 star

Sometimes you wondering why all these AYCE Hot Pot restaurants all opened up all close together. Lucky Season is one of the newest one that opened up at the Leslie/Hwy 7 area.

This used to be a Cantonese Restaurant. A lot of work have done to the interior to transformed it to a Hot Pot Restaurant.  

Hot Pot with Seafood Platter ($20.99 per person, $2 extra on weekends)
- lobster, shrimps, oysters, mussels, salmon, white fish, squid, cuttlefish
- other selections are quite decent similar to other hot pot restaurants in the area

The complimentary soup bases are quite interesting too, aside from the usual, there is Laksa and Thai Coconut Chicken Soup too.

The sauces are served in the jars which they delivered to the table. I found the Laksa soup a little on the weak side, so I put extra dry chili flakes in....

There are also 5 desserts that they offers, I found they were all too sweet and tasted like they have left heating on top of the stove for quite awhile. 

Service is really friendly. The staffs checked on us all through the evening, kept asking if we need to order more food...... and asked why we not eating more since it is AYCE.

10% is added automatically on your bill which they calculate based on after tax total of your check.

Overall, Lucky Season is not too bad... but I found a lot of their items lack \"Freshness\" including vegetables, meat and seafood.... and even desserts tasted stale............."}
