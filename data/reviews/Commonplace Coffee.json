{"text":"I am very happy to have Commonplace Coffee at Smallman Galley! I've been drinking their coffee since they opened their first shop in Indiana, PA (now they have 4 spots in PGH) and they've never failed to have great coffee and specials. 

The spot at Smallman Galley might be my favorite because it's a great spot to work in the morning. Low-key and chill. There are outlets at the bar and larger tables for hangs/meetings. There are pastries to eat in the morning, and it's good spot to meet for lunch, as all the restaurants open at 11 am and everyone can chose what they like. Also, it's a really cool spot to take visitors as the concept is unique but casual. 

Downside is Strip District parking but whatever.

Most relaxed coffee spot in the Strip!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience here. Delicious drinks consistent with their other locations. The staff is so nice. 

Once I tried a new drink that I didn't particularly like. The barista followed up with me after I walked out and took it back to adjust after sensing my hesitation about the drink. Went the extra mile! That's what keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"So this Commonplace is located in Smallman Gallery of eateries

Very friendly happy to explain their beverages barista

{"text":"Located within Smallman Galley in Pittsburgh, Commonplace Coffee is a great, small coffee stand with some really good drinks! For those visiting, open seating is available for Commonplace customers as well as those visiting the other eateries within Smallman. 

We opted for a drip coffee which proved to be rich, robust and piping hot. The original selection of the Masala Chai tea was unavailable therefore an English breakfast was selected and also was scalding hot and had a really nice flavor to it once the tea cooled a bit.

There are a few different espresso drinks available on the menu in addition to the coffee and tea and a handful of baked items were available for purchase. Interestingly, Commonplace also sells a variety of coffee equipment for home brewing, as well.

Commonplace Coffee was a nice spot with friendly and helpful staff and made for a great location to pop in and warm up in a bitterly cold weekend in Pittsburgh. Would highly recommend checking it out and will visit again when visiting Pittsburgh again in the future!"}
