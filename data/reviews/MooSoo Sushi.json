{"text":"This cute little place is located on a small strip right beside a couche-tard.  Their appetizer was to DIE for, we had ordered the love boat which is tuna and mango on a deep fried leaf and it was yummmmyyyyy. We had also ordered the texan, which was maki with cream cheese, first time having that combo and it was amazing! We had also ordered dragon and red dragon which was yummy as well. 

The place is fairly small so I`m assuming it gets fairly packed during dinner time. Parking is right in front so easy to find."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the seafood pancake with squid and it was the best seafood pancake in Montreal! The squid was chewy and the pancake itself was very flavorful. It had a nice layer of crisp to it. and it was freshly made on the spot. The staff is very kind and friendly. 11/10 would go back for the seafood pancake!"}

{"text":"Came back to this place. Had the volcano, see attached picture. It was good, full of flavor."}
{"text":"Better than most and creative..no real ambiance and the language barrier is there. 

They *do* have the BEST shred tempura I have ever had. 

Soup tastes powdery. Meh. But love the purple rice. Tons of choices of fun sushi to try if you are adventurous. People are nice. 

Slow for take out. Be warned."}
{"text":"Certainement le meilleur resto de sushi dans le coin (DDO/Pierrefonds).  Plusieurs variétés, présentations soignées et très originales.  Les prix sont raisonables considérant qu'ils sont très bons.   

Ils ont aussi plusieurs sakés (chaud, froid, crémeux)! 

Découvert vraiment par hasard lorsqu'ils ont ouvert, j'y retourne régulièrement.  Ils ont bonifié leur menu depuis, la qualité et les saveurs demeurent très constants.  C'est une valeur sure si vous avez le gout de sushi.

J'ai toujours pris mes sushi pour apporter mais ils ont aussi un salle à manger d'une dizaine de tables."}
