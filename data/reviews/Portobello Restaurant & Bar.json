{"text":"We had a coupon from leaving deal. I was expecting much more. The place definitely needs an update. Every thing was old and cheap. The staff and the owner were friendly though.

It was a 4 course prefix. Unfortunately I didn't notice \"prefix\" word when I was buying the voucher. Anyways.. The Salad was good. The soup was awful. It was like they mixed what ever they had in a very mashed liquid. My main was veal Parmesan, not bad but the spaghetti could be much better. The veal was not so promising too but tasting ok. My desert, Tartufu, was very good.

I wouldn't recommend this place. Also, the price is high for this quality."}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon thinking it was a good deal. Turns out that it was a rip off. 

The salad was ok until I bit into the roasted red peppers and it had an acidic burning taste. My husband and I quickly removed them from our plates. 

The mains - my lobster ravioli was small, not fresh, and the sauce was not very appetizing. I can cook better than what was served. 

My husband's main was the veal parm - it was ok. The spaghetti was ok. 

The dessert - Tartufu was good. The tiramisu, however, looked and tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for a long time. 

We were the only table there all night on a Wednesday night, from 7:00-8:00pm. 

The place needs an update and the food needs to be better. It was a very disappointing night. I should have read the online reviews first. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Not only is the restaruant cheap, so are the foods. I was intrigued by how all the pastas are under $15. But we didn;t think we got more than we paid. Chicken fettuccini alfredo I ordered was so-so. It was bland and watery. And the pasta noodles were tough. Veal parmesan my friend had was so not delicious. He swears it was a leftover from a week ago. If you want your food cheap and quick, these budget Italian foods are not a problem as long as you don't expect quality to come with it."}
{"text":"Service was good. A very apologetic server on behalf of the cooks or owners, I'm not sure. 

The caprese salad had dry greens, dry boconccini cheese, and overripe tomato. The pizza dough was not cooked well, and it was also soggy. The veal was dry, tough and chewy. And the sauce on the linguine had kind of a sweet aftertaste that wasn't pleasant at all. The bread was day old stale. 

I ate here with my mom and daughter (1 year old). My daughter usually has a great appetite and she also didn't eat anything including the bread. 

I was hoping to find a decent place to have dinner locally. I would have had better luck at the pizza nova next door. 

The server knew about our dissatisfaction as I offered it to him when he asked about our meal. He discussed it with the cooks and the explanation for the dry and tough veal is because it's fried and baked. Really? We buy veal because it is tender. 

Came home hungry and my daughter was satisfied with the leftovers we had at home. 

Portobello is a big fail. I am not going back and I definitely will share my experience."}
{"text":"Received a groupon to this place as a gift. I tried to remain positive despite reading the reviews but this place has lived up to the disappointment as described by other yelpers here.

The melon prosciutto salad app and butternut squash soup weren't terrible but the veal parm and seafood linguine was something I honestly could have made myself and I am by no means an amazing cook. Neither the veal or seafood in linguine were fresh, we're certain they were frozen. The only thing good about the dish was that the pasta was made al dente. 

The tartufo wasn't bad, probably because it was store bought but the homemade tiramisu was a mushy blob on a dish.

This place shouldn't call themselves a fine italian dining restaurant. The quality of food was more like something you would find in a cheap food court."}
{"text":"The place is a totally run down. I will never come back. Almost empty for a good reason. The food is mediocre....I can cook better than them. The only think that was good was the Tiramisu dessert, but it was very small ...two spoons and it was done!"}
{"text":"I am unsure how other raters have given this establishment more than 1 star, nevermind a full 5 stars.  If I could give it a zero I would.

I must state however that I did come for dinner with a WagJag coupon for a prix fix 3 course dinner.  I have walked by this place for the past 8 years and never once did I think of dining here as it looked like an unkempt cheesy donut store with 80s fixtures and decor.  Think combos of salmon pink and ever greens, fake plastic ficus trees and hand painted murals of times past.  Not to mention the dollar store tealight holder in the shape of a house on our table.

Well I was right!  But I was open to giving their food a try no matter.

We made reservations for 2 but was told that I had to come either half an hour before or after if i wanted a seat.  I understood, as the photos on the website showed that it was a smaller establishment with only a couple dozen tables.  And it was a Friday night.

When we arrived, there were only 6 diners.  With MANY tables open.  We asked the server if we could sit by the window.  She looked at us as if to crucify us for what we said.  Then she looked back at the chef and asked if it was ok, he nodded, and she unwillingly showed us to the window seat.

We ordered from the 3 course dinner menu http://www.wagjag.com/?wagjag=58561

I ordered the Stuffed portobello mushroom with crab meat in a sundried tomato cream sauce topped with mozzerella cheese with sliced fresh tomato, rib eye and tartufo.  My partner ordered the Portobello Salad with roasted red pepper and portobello mushrooms topped with goat cheese on a bed of spring mix with their olive oil balsamic vinegar dressing, veal and tiramisu.  

May I add here that our server acted as if she couldn't give a damn that she was working there or that she was serving us.  I guess the owner didn't do his due diligence before he issued those WagJags... by perhaps bettering his service, food quality or offerings?

Our first course of appetizers were 'thrown' onto the table by our server.  Complete with a frown.

They were all mildly dissapointing.  The marinated portobello in the salad and the spring mix were the best parts.  The crab meat was NOT real.  It was imitation crab meat sticks (pollock fish).  The mozzarella cheese was surely shaved off from a block of Black Diamond from the supermarket.  That sundried tomato cream sauce was a watered down mayo with a tinge of pink colour, but no sundried tomato taste. There was about a speck of goat cheese on my partners salad.  

Once again, our entrees were 'thrown' to us.

The rib eye was tasteful (due to the canned, partially gelled gravy that was poured on top) but cold.  The breaded veal was paper thin and obviously from frozen.  It was over cooked to a jerky.

The linguine was most well cooked and lightly flavoured with canned tomato sauce.  I would be surprised if they could not get the pasta right.

The desserts were good as they also were taken out of a food service package and served to us cold.  At this point, I realized that no matter how nice were to our server, she would still throw us our order.

I do not usually write reviews, nor am I usually disgusted with a restaurants service or food offerings as I am a very easy person to please.  I never send food back (even if there is a hair in it!!).  However in this case, I felt I could do some justice for  any future customers of this place.  Save your dollars and eat at an authentic Italian restaurant who offers homemade pastas, sauces and meats.  Not this 'donut store' attempting to offer a fare they do not specialize in, charging the same as other restaurants, but not offering the same quality or value.

I am not trying to put this establishment out of business with this review.  I simply want them to improve their operations."}
{"text":"Redeemed a Groupon at this place.  I'd give them 3 stars for the food, but the 4th star is for the service.
The restaurant was COMPLETELY empty, which made the staff (of 2 people) very excited to have someone there.

Really, the food was alright for the price we paid. The salad was good, pasta was good, steak was weak and would never pay full price for it.

But it was quiet, intimate, and a lovely place for two.  The 2 staff (which dwindled down to 1 after about 30 minutes) was very chatty and attentive.

I wouldn't pay full price for their mood, but would definitely go for another Groupon sometime, even though I believe the options/portions that are provided for Groupon are made specifically for Groupon- that's not their regular food, otherwise they'd be in trouble."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go again. First of all, reservation is a pain! Sunday is closed, do not accept by reservation at 8pm on Saturday. The atmosphere seems like an old school restaurant. Restaurant is almost empty even on  Friday evening. I doubt there are more than 6 tables for the whole Fri night.  Food are soso, could have gone else for better food and location. Lobster Rivoli only have 4 pieces serving as a entr√©e?? Tips are mandatory added on the bill too."}
{"text":"Came here cause of a deal on groupon a few weeks ago. I told myself I'd never use groupon food deals anymore (have not had good experiences) but somehow ended up here. 

Entering the restaurant you can already tell something is off by the lack of patrons. Then sitting down and realizing there is dust on the utensils doesn't leave a good first impression. Nevertheless, this was a 4 course meal so we were just getting started.

The soup and salad arrived, which actually was not terrible. I had low expectations at this point, but these items were bearable. The mains on the other had looked and tasted like something out of a frozen food section of the grocery store. Dry stiff meat. Pasta that was not cooked al Dante and tomato sauce that came out of a can. The desserts were not impressive either with likely a store bought tiramisu cake. 

I'm not sure how anyone would pay full price and not feel like they just threw money away, but even the groupon price was not at all satisfying.

This is one of those places that likely has an owner with good intentions but completely poor business practices (seemed like their kid was serving us). Definitely a worthy restaurant to be on Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. 

1 star and don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"We had a really nice dinner here. Relaxing  atmosphere, very polite waiter, good price. The food (we got fixed price menu with a coupon from dealicious.ca) was good, don't expect fine dining but it was tasty."}
{"text":"LMAO, we are eating here now and like the other review, they have a new waiter and the bartender is pretty rude and loud to him in front of us.  I guess they don't read their reviews!  Food is ok so far but kinda shame it started with bad atmosphere."}
