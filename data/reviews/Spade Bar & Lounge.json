{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon to kill some time and have a drink. They should have just closed the restaurant because the staff was currently setting up for a party and was not interested at all in serving me and my husband. The bartender did NOT know how to pour a beer from the tap, she held the glass straight instead of tilting it. Then proceeded to scoop the foam out and then poured more beer into the glass, again without tilting it. We had to ask for our bill twice because she was so inattentive and kept running to the back/kitchen. 

It was a shame since space was nice and it looks like it would be a good lounge at night with the music/DJ playing...but since we had such a bad experience I will never go back here. Only reason we did go was because we did not know the area well and was just looking for a bar to have a drink or two."}
{"text":"The band was excellent, however it was a lousy dining experience. 9 of us came here for mothers day and waited an hour and a half for our food. I got the veggie roti, which wasn't good (barely any potato and no chickpeas), another person got the chicken roti which was average they said. The rest of the table got rice and jerk chicken, which they enjoyed. That meal was a decent portion (they took some home) but the roti wasn't. Moreover the waitress wasnt pleasant and didn't seem sorry. They said they'd give us a plate of fries for free but that never happened and I never bothered asking. I would come back for the band and ambiance, but for drinks only though. Don't waste your time with food."}
{"text":"\"Don't judge a book by its cover\" certainly applies to this place. Let's face it, the building looks like it's falling apart. It was even hard to tell where the entrance was. Their signage looks very temporary. I would never have thought to go to this place.

I was, however, invited to celebrate a friend's birthday. Stepping inside, my expectations were greatly exceeded. It kinda looks like a nice place. It's very spacious, with high ceilings and lots of space between tables. There are lounge chairs, pool tables, big screen TVs, a fireplace, and a large dance floor in the far end of the space.

There was a simple menu prepared for the occasion, which included wings and a salad, so I didn't get to try anything off their regular menu. The breaded wings were nice and crispy and the jerk wings were just spicy enough. Drink prices were on the cheap side.

This place might just turn out to be a hidden gem..."}
