{"text":"The Shmooz is such a nice place to have in the neighbourhood. Our favourite cafe in the area by far. Fantastic croissants. Friend from Montreal said they were better than famous ones back there. Nice selection of teas. Tasty sandwiches. Happy vibe inside and relaxed patio picnic tables on the side. Everything we have had is delish. Loyalty points with their app. Just go!"}
{"text":"For over 8 months I watched the old hair salon at the corner of Pape and Wroxeter be transformed; large wooden tables, huge mural, antique lamps and even coats hooks under the windows counters. When I discovered the Shmooz cafe restaurant was finally open I was first in the door. 

The organic coffee and a fresh baked croissants are how I start every day. Sandwiches like the carne with grass fed beef and warm gruyere have that satisfying crunch. The home made chicken soup \"is to die for\" and all their ingredients are fresh and organic. It's that attention to detail, eco consciousness, care and wonderful food and staff that keep us coming back. 

In the short time the Shmooz has been open it has already become a hub of the our community and our go to place to meet and eat."}
{"text":"Open for two months, this was my first time here and it's a beautiful spot. The decor and space is warm and very inviting. I had a cappuccino and veggie panini (roasted portobello mushroom, roasted red pepper, basil pesto, goat cheese, arugula). The panini was fantastic!

They buy their beans from a Quebec-based roaster who has a roaster in Toronto. They chose them for the European roast, which I find a little on the dark side, but there's no doubt that the espresso-based drinks are made with great skill and care as is the food.  They serve free-run chicken, pasture raised beef and sustainable fish.

The owners live a couple of blocks from their shop and took 20-months to get it open. Their care is evident. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A great place to spend an afternoon working on a laptop. Good coffee and treats, and the onion croissants - are to die for!"}
{"text":"Paid almost $15 for a tiny sandwich that would fit inside a sub anywhere else. It feels like one of those places where they hope hot servers will make up for inferior products. If I'm going to pay $15 for a sandwich I want layers of chicken, not single neatly placed slivers. It tasted good, I just wish it was more than an appetizer."}
{"text":"Great vibe, awesome eats/drinks and unlimited wifi?!?  I think I'm in love.  And the owners are local and lovely.  Definitely suggest supporting this great new spot!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Great place for an afternoon of reading/working or studying.  The food is always good and fresh and the coffee nice and smooth, never bitter.
Clean place with clean bathrooms also.  really great Cafe!"}
{"text":"I live up the street - my son's daycare is 2 minutes away. After passing by what seemed like a neighbourhood long-standing spot, my wife and I finally stopped in for thermosed coffee on new parent walks early last spring.
Now, it's my regular spot: great coffee, croissants, other sandwiches and snacks, and a delightful team that takes mega pride in their products.
It's cozy, it's comfy, and has a great side patio for warmer weather.
Oh!  An App for earning rewards and paying is a perk if I've forgotten my wallet.

It's nice to have a go-to spot so close and with this level of quality and consistency!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have an excellent selection of delicious gluten free pastries as well as a large selection of teas. They even have a tea-smelling section where you can have a scent of almost all their teas without it being unsanitary. Staff is really friendly. Coffee is solid. Pre-made shakes are pretty decent, as well. They have large tables that are good for studying or lounging about with a board game. The bathrooms are very nice; no paper towels but a forceful enough air dryer."}
{"text":"Great coffee and the people that work there were very friendly. I went there to get some work done and it was a perfect day to sit on their patio . I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, fresh baked goods and a nice atmosphere make thus a welcoming spot on an otherwise residential stretch of Pape. Wonderful, witty neighbourhood mural inside too."}
{"text":"Small cafe in a nice neighbourhood. Seats about 25 people. The sandwiches are good and the croissants are REALLY good! Def have that if you're here.  Service is friendly, only wish it was a bit bigger to accommodate more."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but an absolutely excellent time here! Visiting from NYC, and found myself here on a short walk from our AirBNB. Baristas were beyond wonderful, giving us so many suggestions of places to check out. We went to them all, and loved it! The coffee is fantastic, the poutine (which is gluten free, fellow Celiacs) is to die for. Don't even bother with the small-- go right for the large. You'll thank me for that! I learned that there aren't really any thickening agents in the gravy either-- just thickened with root veggies. Amazing! They have tons of gluten free options (pastries and sandwiches), as well as \"normal\" ones. The tea is served in a small French press and if you're unsure of which to choose, there's a wall where you can smell them all! None of them are a bad choice. It looks like I'll have to immigrate because this cafe is that great. :)"}
{"text":"I like the decor here, and there is an interesting selection of food.  I've been twice and the coffee is ok, nothing really special, and my Americano was bitter, which to me is unforgivable. There's an older gent working here whom I find off-putting and not very welcoming.  He just seems annoyed all the time! I visit such places to relax and if you don't seem to want me there I will oblige you. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, and don't dig the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Really good food. Really good coffee. Really good location. If you're looking for a quick meal or coffee drop in to the shmooz and prepare for some really tasty snacks, meals and drinks."}
{"text":"The best! Rare to have a coffee shop where the food is just as good as the drinks. Warm, friendly, neighbourhood vibe. Great coffee & tea, but also a wicked spot for lunch. All their sandwiches are great (I've had friends freak out about the Carne sandwich, but I'm vegetarian so haven't tried it), but I'm obsessed with their salads. They make all their food fresh in-house and even have their own little veggie/herb garden. The Queen Elizabeth muffin is the best gluten free muffin in Toronto, hands down. Love this place."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of gluten free food. Great choice! And it's an amazing neighbourhood cafe. Check out their green eggs,no ham croissant. One of my fav. It is quite busy filled with people with coming and going. Plus, they make a great cuppa flat white. Barry the owner is not only welcoming with his partner making an excellent cuppa coffee, but they both know a lot bout coffee. Certainly a coffee enthusiast and takes pride in what his cafe serves."}
{"text":"i had read a review in toronto life or blogto and since i live in the area i wanted to see what was up. plus driving to bathurst north for a good \"jewish\" chicken noodle soup is out of the question most nights.

chicken soup - just meh, they put in penne pasta which made no sense to me. croissant was pretty good. ambience is nice. i was rather put off by the cook that day who gave me unlimited stink eye (you're not cool lady).

could see returning for a coffee and a croissant if im in a pinch and probably not a bad a place to spend the afernoon working on a laptop."}
