{"text":"Very chill atmosphere, beer us of usual trendy quality. Service is very relaxed and quick. Food is a very unique taste from the UK. Much like a meat pie but a pasty. I recommend to all in the mood for something new and fun."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just had lunch an hour ago at the Guadalupe and Dobson location, we had never been there before and wanted to try it.

So there was a staff of about 12 people between bartenders, wait staff and kitchen staff, only 5 tables of customers.  My first impression was \"gosh this place is dirty and old\".  Torn chair seats, stuff all over the floor, windows incredibly filthy, outside patio yuck...But, in the interest of the food, decided to continue to a small table next to the gross window.  The table top was an old door with a piece of glass over it, cute idea until you look at how stains of old food and drink (obviously from spills) had gotten under the glass and were not cleaned up.  The waitress met us and presented our menus, and took our drink order (water and iced tea).  Three pages of my menu fell out, they were so old that the glue no longer kept them in the menu book.  After about 20 minutes, the waitress came to take our order the rest of the time, she and the other 7 \"non kitchen\" help were standing in a group in the back of the restaurant laughing and talking about personal stuff (we could hear them loud and clear)...a bit perturbed that it took 20 minutes to get our order placed.  Not once did she ask to refill our tea or water....

Really feel like the staff should be doing more than standing around bullshitting.  How about pick up a rag and clean? Sweep? Mop? Wipe down the fan blades (disgusting)?

The pasties that we had were good...but ambiance, cleanliness, service...no way!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, great food and very good selection.  Had bangers and mash along with cream of tomato soup which was homemade and delicious.  Even the bread and butter were above average.  Large, dark interior.  Good for a business meeting.  Deducted a star for service, slow and unmotivated."}
{"text":"When I walked into the Cornish Pasty Co., I immediately felt like I was home. I know how strange that probably sounds, but it's true. The restaurant itself is extremely laid back and comfortable, and set up very differently than any other restaurant I've ever been to. Instead of tables, they have pews with long tables in between and candles made from bottles on every table. My friends and I were seated immediately, and the server, Mike, got our drink orders quickly. 
 Once my friends and I decided what we wanted, we waited maybe 10-20 minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the Philly Pasty, which had meat, Swiss cheese, peppers, and onions in it. The food, once it was ready, took about five minutes to get to our table. The crust of the pasty was amazing: golden and crunchy, perfect. The stuffing, on the other hand was a different story. The stuffing was lukewarm; I wasn't impressed with the temperature. It was still delicious, but it definitely could have been warmer. The food was served on metal plates and the drinks were served in huge, heavy glasses. I felt like I was back in time, to be honest. 
 Our server, Mike, checked on us regularly, but he was listening to his iPod and eating on the job... that didn't inspire much confidence for this particular dining experience. He was also doing dishes intermittently, which is acceptable but at the same time it just struck me as odd that he was doing them instead of waiting his tables.
 All in all, it was a positive dining experience, and I would definitely go back to that Cornish Pasty Co. location. Next time, I would just make sure my food was warm when it reached the table."}
{"text":"Food is definitely true to its British nature.  And Irish Car Bombs are a great deal.  The prices are highly affordable a great place after an ASU game or just late at night with lots of friends."}
{"text":"first time here and really enjoyed the atmosphere. great food (lamb vindaloo) and a good selection of draft beer."}
{"text":"Please please please keep the Vegan Chicken Philly Pasty on the menu!! It was unbelievable and I would order it EVERY TIME! Also, how about some vegan desserts?? As always service was impeccable and ffod amazing, love this atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very nice extended menu for veggies. I tried majority of pasties here and liked lot of them. Chicken tikka pasty is my favorite. Pesto and rosemary chickens are also my favorite. Cream of Tomato with croutons is by far one of the best soup I had. Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding formerly known as Temple pudding  is heavenly and must  try."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go if you are on a diet. The food is heavy but oh so yummy. The pasty with the turkey and stuffing is my favorite. Their soups are great too. I love the bread that comes with the soups. The staff has always been attentive and friendly as well. The only problem is when I go there I have to sit outside. The inside of the restaurant smells really bad to me. It smells like a mix of old beer and barf....:("}
{"text":"If you never tried the Cornish Pasty Co, try it now! I never tried a pasty before, and I was surprised how much I liked it. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my brother ordered a steak on with a peppercorn sauce. We both really enjoyed our meal. Also, the customer service was great. Sadly, I am not from the area, so it will be awhile before I can enjoy another pasty."}
{"text":"What a cool and odd place!!  The service was wonderful, the people - staff and customers were  fun and friendly!! 

I went original - with the Oggie and loved it!! Their red wine sauce - YUM! 
I wanted a few more sides of it, but controlled myself!  Although when I asked for a take-home box, the waitress asked if i'd like more sauce!!!! whooo hooo - heck YES i want more sauce!!

My date had the Mexican -- pasty.  It was nice and spicy!! Interesting to have a mexican flavored irish pocket / sandwich - but hey, it works!!

Go give 'em a try -- it's a different type of place and all in a great way!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants forever and always. Every location is great, though the one on university is lit like a dungeon (get some better lighting up in there!). I have had nearly every pasty at this point and there has never been a bad one. There's a large variety to soot all tastes. Lots of vegetarian options (which is great when you have a vegetarian girlfriend) and even some rotating vegan options. Moderately good beer selection too, though I'd like to see twice as many on draft, but that's just because I like to try new things. All in all, one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"You must have the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup. It is amazing.  Great service. Open late. New favorite spot in town."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  It's a nice break form the limited varieties of food you can get in the East Valley.  The pastys are tasty and this location is 10 times nicer than the cramped hot and dirty location in Tempe."}
{"text":"I have been here on a few different occasions and each time the food was unbelievably delicious. I appreciate the variety of vegetarian and vegan pasties that they have available. You can even order the pasties ahead of time to pick up and cook at home which is very convenient after a busy day at work. Most importantly, they serve a wonderful selection of beers on tap! Overall, each experience that I have had at this restaurant has been 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company is my first stop on my quest to try the Hot on Yelp top 5...

I've had homemade pasties years ago so i was very excited to try this place.  I'm surprised its taken me this long to try this place because the hype is insane!  As i've said before about places that are super hyped....believe the hype on this one! this is one of those places where the menu makes it tough to decide on one thing.  

Based on previous reviews and a trusted opinion from a fellow yelper (Robert J.) that joined me for dinner, i decided to try the Royale with Cheese.  Bomb-delicious!.  Robert J. decided to try something new and he had the Rosemary Steak.  Since the pasties are cut in half by default, the decision go half-sies was easy.  Rosemary Steak was also Bomb-delicious.  I wish i could give a deeper description of each but it would really be tough.  You just have to try it yourself.  As a side we split the oven chips which are pretty much steak fries seasoned with salt and pepper (nothing to be crazy about but decent).

This place also seems like a cool place to chill and have an adult beverage.  They carry a nice variety of draft beers from across the world and i must say, a beer with the pasty is a solid combo.

Until next time..."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is a great example of my theory that food inside of food is always delicious!

I've never had a bad experience with anything on their menu, although I favor the Pesto Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Massala the most.

If you decide to visit after 5 on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  Any earlier than 5pm will usually result in quicker service, but in my opinion, the lack of a crowd sort of takes away from the unique atmosphere.

Their happy hour is great also; they have a fair selection of drafts, including one of my favorite Colorado breweries, Ska.  And nothing goes better with a piping hot pasty than an ice cold brew!"}
{"text":"This was the first time we tried a pasty, and we loved it! This place is just perfect. Great ambience, food and superb collection of beers. The selection was perfect for anyone and everyone!!! The table had the Pilgrim, Chicken Pesto, Italian, and Salmon Caesar!!!! Dinner was absolutely amazing and oh so filling.....But we were at the counter and saw all the desserts come out so we knew that dessert was a must!! We ordered Banoffee and Caramel Apple Crisp Pasty.....Such a great choice and fantastic way to end the evening!! Thank you Cornish Pasty for an amazing experience

We will definitely be going back here again!"}
{"text":"I got the original pasty for take out. It had a fantastic crust and it was a real nice size. The only issue I had was that it was a little dry. It came with a small cup of gravy but we used ketchup. 
Staff was young and fun and super nice."}
{"text":"I went there at night on a recommendation of a friend and didn't really know what to expect. The place is somewhat hidden and rather unpretentious compared to other restaurants. The place is lit by candles and soft lightings, with metal music playing in the background. Occasional rock and metal music plays in the back ground which goes well with the easy ambience. The place despite its unconventional getup offers intimacy for groups and also welcomes loners. They have a huge collection of beer, both domestic and imported, all reasonably priced. On to the main course - pasties. Comparing pasty with hot-pockets oversimplifies this delicacy. Alright, its roasted bread stuffed with cheese and your choice of meat, but there is so much more to it. Depending on what you get, you'll get to enjoy vibrant flavors that go well with your choice of alcohol (personal recommendation - get Buddingtons).
Pasty recommendation: Peppered Lamb"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better. They've now expanded for a second time and created a nice lounge off to the side by the re-designed bar. The food is as good as ever and the wait staff always friendly and helpful. I've had about a dozen or more of the different pasties, with my faves being the carne adovada, lamb vindaloo, eggplant parmesan, portobello mushroom, chicken tikka masala, and others too numerous to mention. The tandoori wings are also very good, a nice twist on the normal bar food. 

The homemade soups with the homemade bread are also very good, and go great with one of the nice-sized salads.

The bar selection is also very good with a great selection of microbrews. I always opt for the Rogue Dead Guy Ale, which I can't get many other places.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I literally cannot find fault with this place. As you walk in, they've got these super long booths that invite and encourage big groups, tall ornamental candles with long trails of wax that occasional reach down to the table, and just the right dimness to evoke an intimate atmosphere without necessitating a flashlight to read the menu. 

The pasties are all incredible. My one regret about this place is that I wish I could try every single one, but there are something like 30 to choose from, and it alway stakes me an inordinate amount of time to choose. They have thoroughly mastered the art of incorporating just about any cuisine into that delectable pasty crust. You like straight up Irish style? They got it. You want steak? They have that. Are you a fan of Indian food?! Yes, they have one of those. How about a cheeseburger pasty? YES. Each variation is so tempting, I've actually found myself considering their vegetarian options, and I'm about as vehemently anti-vegetarian as they come. So, yeah, the food's good.

Beer-wise, I love this place. Love. It. First, you get to pick what size beer you want (16, 20, or 32 oz, or pint, imperial pint, and stein). Then, pick from their draft selection. Yes, it's not a very wide selection, but look what you're getting: Boddington's, Guinness, Rogue Hazelnut Brown, DOGFISH HEAD 90 MINUTE(!!!). You simply cannot leave here unsatisfied. And if that wasn't enough, during happy hour Irish Car Bombs are only $3. I believe a better deal simply doesn't exist in Tempe. Do yourself a favor and eat here as soon as possible."}
{"text":"A-Ok in my book. What's better than a gourmet hot pocket and an irish car bomb for brunch?

I ordered the salmon pasty with spicy beans. The dough itself firm, but fluffy and the filling is great. I especially enjoyed the sauce that accompanied it. As for the beans. They were spicy as hell. I ate it all, but I don't know if I would order it again. It was almost unpleasant to eat."}
{"text":"Love their food, and the fact they have daily vegan specials, amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't exactly know how to describe a pasty if you've never had one before.  I had never even heard of them until recently, when I read a review of this place.  Always the adventurous type when it comes to food, I figured I'd give it a shot.  How bad could it be?

It's fantastic.  At it's simplest, a pasty is a beautifully filled pastry with meat, potatoes, veggies and some sort of sauce.  Like a chicken pot pie without the tin.  But better.  Oh so much better.  And if chicken isn't your thing, fear not - they have pasties of pretty much anything you could imagine!  

We went this past Saturday to try it out.  I like the decor, cool black wall, love the church pews to sit at the communal tables - also a long bar or some small tables to sit at if communal seating isn't your bag, baby.  

The menu is quite extensive, a few pages worth of different pasties - a full page dedicated to vegetarian options (certainly not for me, but good to know!).  They have a nice drink menu as well, I suppose depending on what you're looking for.  They nod their head to the winos with a pretty limited selection (think there were 4 different types, nothing too spectacular).  The beer list is extensive, and perfect for the setting and menu.  Lots of american and english brews, quite the variety actually.  And with the draft beers you get a choice of 14oz, 20oz or 32oz.  All of them decently priced.  (For the record, I had a Boddingtons and it was delicious).

$3 Irish car bombs, all the time.  (plus a couple other shot/drink specials) but that one jumped out at me.  

To the food.  I had the Oggie, which is described as the traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes, onions and rutabaga with a red wine gravy.  It was brought to me with ketchup or more red wine gravy for additional moist-maker if you so choose.  It was great.  Steak was tasty, not too tough (i'm sure it's not filet mignon, but it was certainly good quality for a filler).  I'm still not sure what a rutabaga is, but I know I like it, at least in this dish!  Couldn't decide what I liked better the ketchup or gravy, so I went back and forth with each subsequent bite.  

The wife had the spicy Asiago Chicken.  Perfectly cooked chunks of chicken breast with a slab of asiago cheese (melted and oh-so-gooey delicious), hatch chiles, black beans.  She was quite happy with this one.  

We also ordered a side of the garlic \"chips\" which are pretty much oven baked french fries - just like an order of fish and chips.  

We ended on the Chocolate bread and butter pudding served with creme anglaise and vanilla ice cream.  So decadent and quite tasty.  Perfect ending.

I can't wait to go back and try new varieties of the pasty.  The options seemed limitless.  Not to mention go back and drink all their beers and partake of the $3 car bombs.  

Service was good, although the pasties take a few minutes to cook.  So don't expect it to be \"fast food.\"  Good food takes a bit of time to cook properly!  They told us about this when we ordered, so the delay was expected and welcomed (gave me more time to enjoy the Boddingtons!)."}
{"text":"Great beer, Great food! Love this place! My family and I go here about once a week and the food and service are always fantastic! The patio is the best place to sit even during the summer! My favorite is the vegetarian Greek.  The apple and cinnamon dessert pasty is excellent as well.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a better rating because I love anything cooked in pastry. 

Overall, the menu is pretty interesting- something for everyone, whether you are a meat and potato or veggie type. There's something there for you. Problem is...they cannot make even the smallest changes because everything is pre-made- as in, already the pastry and frozen delivered to the restaurant, then heated up as people order. At least that's what they told me when I asked for no onions. 

We had the Pilgrim and Shepherd's Pie for the main course- they were ok. Fun to eat but nothing taste-wise that blew me away. The pastry was not great either- kinda hard and lumpy. 

We also had the PB&J for our son and peanut butter just didn't work- it was chalky and kinda ended up stuck on the pastry and very dry. The jelly was some raspberry with the seeds and that just made eating the thing very awkward. 

The restaurant itself could also use a bit of polish- drapes were coated in dust (maybe a nod to some medieval castle inspiration), menu's were sticky, but the bench seating and shared tables were fun. 

I'd go back because I'm hopeful that a different order might be better."}
{"text":"Liked the Tempe location but like this one better. I went there for the first time last night and it was refreshing having a more open atmosphere and the choice for outdoor seating. As usual service was awesome, beer was awesome, and food was awesome. I left very contented."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is awesome. I keep coming back again and again because I love the Cajun Chicken and the chipotle sauce that comes with it, not to mention their great selection of craft beers and the fun lounge area in the back. We also have tried every single dessert and they are all surprisingly amazing. Not sure what the other locations are like since this one is right by our house, but we love everything about this place. It's great for both a date night or for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great atmosphere and friendly staff. We had five people and we all ordered different fillings to share, each one was wonderful! Although I am partial to The Chicken Greek with spinach, feta, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, olives, artichokes and roasted garlic! Amazing. Don't forget to get the Pavlova you will love it. It's a huge bowl filled with a really wonderful sweet meringue topped with lightly sweetened whipping cream, strawberries, kiwi  then  topped with a generous drizzle of raspberry coulis.  Our party shared and it was like a pack of wolves scarfing down dinner. Then suddenly we returned to reality all embarrassed at our behavior, but it was well worth it! I will definitely be taking clients and friends  to dinner here!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great service. I had the Cajun chicken and it was the best I can remember having ever. The elderberry cider was great. The shepherds pie was also great. We also enjoyed the Italian. We had an issue with one of our kids not ordering the correct food, yet our waitress Casey was very helpful and her recommendations were dead on for us. We are waiting on dessert now. Although stuffed I can't wait to try dessert!"}
{"text":"This place has a reputation for hiring only douchebags for waiters and they totally lived up to it. I wish I could tell you about the food but after almost an hour without getting any, we decided to leave. I don't think that a restaurant concept of rude service is a good one. Good service is important and this place totally failed on it."}
{"text":"Yummy! Amy was a great server - sitting watching magic being made! Enjoying a Hanger 24 Apricot brew - it is the very best! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I would come here everyday if I could. It had a hipster edge.. Great for the beer, even better for the food. It's reminiscent for my guy who lived in Cornwall and misses the fare there."}
{"text":"I really liked the food, but have stopped going after four visits (and have downgraded my rating) because the music was too loud...it was at a late-evening level at lunchtime, rendering conversation with one's tablemates almost impossible without yelling.  If I learn that the place has moderated the music volume, I shall happily return!"}
{"text":"With a name like an English Strip club you know you are in for a treat. Had the Chicken Asiago, Philly Cheese Steak and garlic fries. Split between me and the boss, my wife. We agreed eating Pasty on a church pew should be practiced more than once a week."}
{"text":"As a British expat in AZ, I want to live in this place forever and ever I love you. Legitimately good English food, and the decor is perfectly put together."}
{"text":"Don't deny yourself the chance to eat here - the food is amazing. As a 5 star description says, \"As good as it gets!\" is the truth here. Great vegetarian options! Note to first-timers: just grab a table, it's kind of a casual system. Good beer, good music, great prices. Tony helped with the recommendations, and was spot on. Tell him \"Hi!\"."}
{"text":"Good ambience, decent prices but average food. Not the place to go for a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"I like this place. Definitely hard to get a table but unique concept and food is pretty good. I will caution you that it can make you a little \"bloaty\" FYI. Once you get a table, service tends to be pretty average but the place is always busy so comes with the territory. I probably visit this place a couple of times per year."}
{"text":"Quality eats.  Variety without trying too hard.  Love the atmosphere... am I in Mesa?"}
{"text":"Great food, there is absolutely no question about that.  However my experience could have been a lot better, the service was shit. I don't care about censoring myself here, because that is the only way to properly describe it. That whole high and mighty attitude doesn't fly. Sorry i dont automatically know everything there is to know about your establishment, when its my first ever time eating here. But whatever, Great food. Some of the best food around, but never will I ever eat in house again, ever."}
{"text":"So good we went back the next day.  I fell in love with the pasty in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and never thought I would find any as good in Arizona but these pasties are the BEST.
The oggie was fantastic and I love that I can go with my vegetarian friend and they have a PAGE of vegetarian options.
The oven fries rocked and I love HP sauce (ask for it as well as the gravy)
I think we will probably end up there once a month.  Good value too!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food that I have had.  We each tried a different pasty - every one was superb.  They were flavorful and crusty.  The meat and cheese pasty and the chicken pot pie pasty were especially tasty.  The atmosphere was what I would imagine a pub to be!  The reason for the 4 rating was because of the service!   We seemed to wait forever for the food , and the waitresses seemed to disappear for long stretches.  The first waitress we had was bitchy, but the second one seemed sweet!  We eat out a lot and know good service - this was not it!  The person from the kitchen that brought our chips did apologize for the wait.  It even took long for drink refills!  Too bad because the food was great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I ordered the chicken tikka masala. Fantastic is the only word. The history of cornish pastys is also quite interesting. worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great, love the food everything I've had is awesome... The lamb & mint is my favorite"}
{"text":"Great food. The service was a little slow but it was very busy so it's understandable. We will be back."}
{"text":"So good.. I had the steak and paper, my girl had the carna adv.. I'm definitely will back!"}
{"text":"I love pastries, this place was delightful and delicious. Everything tastes fresh and the tea was great. I'm picky with my tea but this was good."}
{"text":"Excellent and different. Huge variety of entrees and all that we ordered were amazing. Wait staff was great and fun. Save room for desert because they were to die for.  Think I will go back tomorrow night."}
{"text":"This place is truly a PHX must!! I have never been a to place this unique before. Also the ambiance is great, I have tried lots of the pasty's and their all tasty!! I always take my friends who visit to cornish pasty, and they all love it as well!! My personal fave is the chicken tikki!"}
{"text":"I would give the food a 4 the price a 3 and the service a 1. 
Not sure if I would go back but I can't say the food wasn't good. 

Probably wouldn't be too bad if I had a couple hours to kill watching how NOT to treat customers."}
{"text":"I travel for work and eat out almost everyday of my life (since 2003) ... and I asked myself, \"What the heck is a pasty... and am I even pronouncing it right?\" Well I have eaten here maybe 6 or so times and have come to love the pasty. The Pilgrim is my favorite, it's like Thanksgiving dinner rolled into a little hot pocket. The staff is typically college students with plenty of tattoos and piercings, and the service is so-so, but the food is awesome! Go."}
{"text":"I went here because it seemed to be highly revered among the Yelp community, but found that it didn't quite meet up to the standard I was expecting.

-The food:
I ordered the Oggie and their garlic chips. I thought the pasty tasted pretty good - nothing to write home about, but still good. The chips, on the other hand, were not crispy at all  (almost chewy), and had an absurd amount of garlic.

-The service:
It wasn't a very crowded day, so I suppose I expected a little bit better service than some others had experienced. I was wrong - the service was sub-par, to say the very least. 
First, our waiter took ages to even recognize us - and our food took even longer (far longer than most places I've ever been to, I should say). As soon as we got the pasties, he realized that he'd forgotten the chips. Not a big deal, except that the chips didn't arrive until we had completely finished our meals. 
I should also mention that at least a few of the people working there looked blatantly stoned (in fact, I'm fairly sure one of the waiters was smoking a joint on the patio during his break). 

-The atmosphere:
The first thing that comes to mind is the very bad smell inside. It's a cross between spit and feet. Because of this, I sat outside, which was decent, aside from being surrounded by a cloud of smoke (still better than spit/feet though). 

Wow, this review makes me sound like an overly critical prick, and I'm usually fond of \"hip\" places : \ . Maybe I came at the wrong time, but honestly, the only thing keeping this from being a one-star review is the taste of the pasty."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best place to eat in Mesa. Let me tell you what you are in for if you go. 

The CPC has taken these pilgrim pockets to the next level.  Personally I would recommend The Royale With Cheese or the Shepard's Pie. The pies take a while to make so now would be a good time to order drinks as well. If you are the beer drinking type I would suggest the Hoegaarden it's the best I've ever had. If you are looking for something more stimulating you may want to try their Irish Car Bombs. Or if you are you are up to it go with both.

When your pasty arrives don't touch the plate! It could be scorching bloody hot. Your pasty is probably going to take a few minutes to become edible as well, just stay clam it will cool soon enough. 

When you have finished eating get the apple stuffed pasty for desert. By now you will feel very full, I know, I do it every time and the only thing I can say is that it was worth it.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here whenever I visit from the pacific northwest. At this point I'm basically working my way through the menu of delicious pasty options. It is the one place where we can sit down at the table and order any meal from around the world or any holiday in a pasty. I love the mid century atmosphere with the hipster, family style vibe and excellent and friendly service. I highly recommend this establishment and wish they would expand their pasty footprint northward."}
{"text":"Why does this place have a FUNKY smell to it? The first time my friend and I came, it smelled. The second time was no different. I've worked at restaurants before and the smell replicate that of a DIRTY kitchen. Like the floors, rubber mats or the mops haven't been cleaned. The smell of sewage reaps over the entire restaurant. Instead of savoring the pasty aroma as it was being brought out to us from the oven, my friend and I couldn't get over the nasty smell of funk! 

The bathroom was also DISGUSTING! I remember being a busboy at a family owned restaurant in Mesa and the staff would always have bathroom duties every hour or so, checking on the bathroom and do general whip-downs and toilet cleaning. It's really a managerial duty to assign tasks like these to the staff.

Moving on to the pasty... well, it was pretty darn good! My friend had the Oogie and I ordered the Greek Chicken. I like the Oogie more... the sauce that accompanied it was delicious, it seemed like it was roux-based; but the second time we went there they gave us a totally different sauce with our Oogie. They had some other sauce with it that tasted like berries. We asked out server if they had another sauce similar to our first visit. We tried explaining what the sauce was like, in terms or color, texture, and goodness, but she came out with a comparable - H.D. (?) sauce. It was ok - not the same though. I was a little disappointed... 

Loved the flaky crust, btw.

I really like their food, but aside from the smell it was good! I'll try the Tempe location next time, maybe it'll be less stinky."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Staff is friendly and helpful. Would recommend to friends :) prices are just right. Check it out if you haven't already. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had a neutral experience. It was an interesting place. Everything baked into a bread. I was excited to taste but unfortunately mine had to be burnt on the bottom.. I give them a 3 star because the Portobello chicken was pretty tasty  OMG you MUST get the Strawberry Pavlova! It's so good."}
{"text":"My good friend brought me here during a visit earlier this year.  Interesting concept and pretty good!  I had never had a pasty before and it kind of reminded me of a cross between a pot pie and a calzone.  But it was definitely better than the pot pies I remembered from Maries Calendar's!  It was delicious!  It gets crazy busy in the evening, so I suggest getting there early."}
{"text":"I adore this place! There is a plethora of pasty flavors to choose from and a huge beer list. This is the perfect lunch spot and/or happy hour destination. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat i went on my first date with my know soon to be husband, and have come back may times since then. The service is great they don't rush you the food comes out fast and taste amazing. Also if you have not tried there deserts all of them are very good I like the banana caramel pie thing myself. The one done side with the pasties we found out is they are pre made in the morning so you can't ask for something not to be in it. Which i don't mind since the have a big selection but might bug other people."}
{"text":"This place is so great!  The atmosphere is comfortable, and the menu is expansive.  This is a great place for vegetarians.  We were starving so we started with an order of baked fries that were fabulous.  They were big slices of potatoes that were baked with olive oil, black pepper, and salt.  They were crispy and yummy.  Next I had a half order Greek salad that was very fresh and very tasty.  And next I had the vegetarian \"chicken\" tikka masala and my husband had the royale with cheese.  My tikka masala had great flavor, and the \"chicken\" seemed so real that it maked me nervous that maybe the waiter messed up and gave me a real chicken tikka masala, although I know that did not happen.  My husband and I really enjoyed our lunch and will definitely be back.  I already know what I am going to get next time, the vegetarian cottage pie.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"We had 12 ppl. They stuck us with a new waitress, first day. Almost as bad of a choice as her choice to be a waitress. A friend thought he got the wrong beer, so the waiter/trainer sampled it. That's right, he drank out of a customer's glass. I asked the bartender if I could speak to a mgr, she looked confused and said sure. Some dude came out acting like a manager. Food isn't bad, happy hour isn't good, service is horrible; expect every drink to go empty and to tell your waiter you're ready to order. Do not expect attractive waiters/waitresses, however, you can expect a poorly dressed, unattractive hipster bring this attitude into their service."}
{"text":"I'm so torn over the rating! The food was fantastic! I had the Cottage Pie, my husband had the Carne Adovado. Both were rich, tasty, and well-made, but the service was dismal! It took 10 minutes for our waitress to approach the table, which wasn't initially a problem but the service only went downhill from there. It took a half-hour to get our food, and our server never checked on drinks, we sat there with empty glasses and drinks with no ice, finally went to the bartender for refills. Again, the food was awesome! With my husband being a pastry chef we always want to try desserts and ordered the Bonaffee Pie and the Apple Pasty, after we ordered we waited...and waited...and waited, no sign of our server, finally waved down another server he checked and our desserts were right there! Again, our server nowhere to be seen, still empty glasses. After waiting for so long we weren't really interested in our desserts anymore unfortunately, then surprise! Suddenly our server was there with the bill!! After not seeing her for 40 minutes she drops the bill, doesn't offer boxes, no conversation, just drops the check. After we paid, she hovered at the next table which was empty and took the check before we were even completely out of our seat. 
    So TL;DR 
       For our first time here, food was excellent, but service was so bad we won't be back! I'll give the Tempe location a try, hopefully service will be better, but I won't go back to the Mesa location again."}
{"text":"When the kids come to visit they always have a list of restaurants they want to check out. We struck out for a late dinner and this location is close to my house. We walked in and liked the feel of the restaurant. Church pews for seats and doors for tables gave it a quirky fun feel to it. After a quick look at the menu we order the Oggie, the peppered steak and the lamb vindaloo. I also was forced to order a pint Guinness. The wait time for the meal was average and the pastys came out nice and hot. We liked the taste of the Oggie, full of flavor and balance. The peppered steak had the best texure, the steak was very tender and pastry just right. The lamb vindaloo was average. It was a little spicy but, the flavor was incomplete. I will have to back and try the lamb and mint next time . All in all a good light dinner and a return visit will be in order."}
{"text":"GREAT food! Excellent restaurant. The food took a little while to come out, but it was definitely worth it! We will definitely be going back sometime soon. I was pleased to see an entire vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"I have been going to cornish pasty co for a long time now. We always went to the tempe location, but once the mesa location opened, it was were we always go. It is closer to where my wife and I live. I have to say the best pasty to get has to be the carne adovada pasty. I have probably eaten this pasty at least 50 times, and every single time I get it, I enjoy it as much as the first time. A place with great atmosphere, service and food. A must try for any person who enjoys quality food."}
{"text":"Wow.  Just went for the first time and the food was incredible.  Friendly energetic staff too.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here a few days ago and it was terrific.  We started with a Greek salad (small size), which we split.  We each ordered a pasty. I had the chicken pesto and my husband had another pasty, which had mushrooms, chicken and red peppers -- I just can't remember what it was called.  Both were delicious!  Less than $50 for all of that plus a glass of wine and two beers, make this place very affordable! Plus the music was awesome!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Really good food and a great atmosphere. Food takes a while to come out but totally worth it. My personal favorite is the  chicken Greek pasty, also their Apple Carmel pasty is delicious for desert."}
{"text":"Awesome pasties - so many vegetarian selections!!
Awesome soup!
Awesome salad!
Awesome beer!
Awesome sides!
Awesome desserts! Ok I've really only had the bonaffee pie ;)
Service is hit or miss, but Pasty Co gets an extra star because they are so vegetarian friendly!!
** MAKE SURE you try a side of the chipotle sauce with any pasty!"}
{"text":"What can I say but this place meets all my expectations. Great location, service, menu and food. I have never had anything bad from the menu. The beer selection is good too."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Walking in the dark and warm atmosphere captures you right away. Everyone greets you with a friendly face and a hello as you seat yourself. Our server Mandy made us feel very welcome and was very prompt in every way. I am also a huge fan of craft beers and she did a great job of recommending a few that i enjoyed. I ordered the Cajun Chicken pasty and it was amazing! Great taste good portion and fair prices, I will definitely be returning as i had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food great price!  Atmosphere is awesome!  Try the Chocolate Bread & Butter desert, you won't be disappointed!!  Great place to hang with friends and chat the night away, especially on the patio which has ceiling fans and misters."}
{"text":"I've been to the Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe many times.  First time at this location was pretty bad for several reasons. First, the place smelled bad upon walking in. Sorry, it smelled like sewage. I've worked at many restaurants. Second, the church pews we sat in were filthy. No excuse. Third, a small roach scampered off the side of the table when I sat down. I had to flick it onto the floor and forget about it.

Yes, I actually stayed and ate. The food was excellent, but I won't be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Seriously people, I love this place! And one of the things that I love about it is that every time I go there the place has changed (okay, maybe not every time but at least the last 4 times. This most recent time the bar doubled in size, moved to a different area and they closed up the counter where it used to be. But enough about these paltry things. Here's the important stuff....

1. The girls who work there are beautiful, tattooed, and very nice
2. The beer selection is very good, although i wish they had Newcastle on tap
3. The food is damn tasty (and now they have breakfast pasties (!), which they sadly don't actually serve before 11)
4. The music is some of the best I've heard anywhere in the valley

I've been there probably a couple dozen times and never had anything bad, or even not-awesome. Sadly I don't go there as much anymore since i moved into Phx but the new booths look inviting so I will definitely be back. My lunch buddy/BFF said it's going to be her first meal when she comes back from Asia, carbombs and Mexicans. Sounds like a damn fine plan to me"}
{"text":"I have only had one thing and will probably never get anything else! The carne adovada pasty is out of this world! I never eat in because the wait is long! Be sure to call in advance and get it to go! The pasty stays crunchy and so yummy, don't worry! It won't get soggy."}
{"text":"Went to year for the first time last week with my family. The wait wasn't too bad. Service was fantastic. There was six of us at the table the waitress was very pleasant.we each got something different off the menu, it was all great. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Think Hot pockets on steroids*. Great Beer, Atmosphere and patio furniture.  I return to this place religiously.. Each time, eager to try something new. I'm about half way through the menu as it's rather extensive. I highly recommend the \"Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty.\" Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes. With a side of sour cream & salsa..ORGASMIC. 
You seriously can't go wrong here people. The Menu versatility is astounding; it's as if they have a pasty specifically tailored to your palate.Try the \"Strawberry Pavlova\"  for dessert. Perfect place for a date or to suck down some good food and beer with your buddies. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.   - Cheers"}
{"text":"O! M! G! This place is awesome! The staff is nice and personable. The manager came by to make sure our meal was good.  We love the ambience. Everything is so fresh!"}
{"text":"Let me just say this. WOW!!  September 16 was my Wife and I anniversary. We both decided to try some thing totally new, but did not no what. So after researching on the internet, we came across the Cornish Pasty Company. After reading other reviews, and visiting the web site, as well and researching what a pasty is, we both decided that this was the spot to go. Apon walking in, the smell took us by suprise, was a little overwealming for we both have never smelt nothing like it before, but being in there after a few we started adjusting and relizing how much we both enjoyed the ambiance. Apparently its one of the main spices they use in pastys. There service was really good, out waittress was extremely good. The one thing that impressed both my and I was that even the othere waitreses and waiters would ask us if we needed anything and how every thing was going. Oh yeah,  by the way. The food was awsome."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite places to go eat and have as take out.  I have almost tried everything on the menu here, and though I have my favorites, I have never disliked one pasty, salad, soup or dessert I have tried.  The food can take a long to come out if you go when it's busy, but with the large beers they offer the wait doesn't seem so bad.  My go to pasty is the Cajun, it got a bit of spice but it's amazing.  For the non-meat eaters they make two different types of vegan pastys daily but they can run out in the evenings so it's a good idea to call ahead if that's what you are looking to have.  They also have a lot of vegetarian options, all of which are delicious!  And if you are a sweets person the banoffee is a very sweet, graham cracker crusted, caramel filled dessert topped with whip cream and bananas (or strawberries if you request them).  Like it said its VERY sweet and big enough to share, but it's worth the calories.

The atmosphere and seating at the Mesa location are great, especially with the new expansion.  They have the place mostly lit by dim lights and candles which makes it a fun place to have date nights or even just go for drinks.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Very strong and good flavors. Very filling. I liked the on east side more then the Tempe location. Don't like eating there cuz way to dark and hipster ish lol . Worth a try"}
{"text":"The pasty's were good.  Went there on a lunch time last week. Sat at the bar .while waiting for our food. All the cooks were scruffy and dirty looking. Handling raw and cooked food with out gloves. Plus a cleaner climbed up on an oven and started cleaning the oven hood ?should this be done while the place is open ?? One cook went and got a drink and was drinking this while \"preparing\" food. The place needs a good clean. Two stars for the pasty's."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. I'm working my way through the menu. A truly original restaurant. The staff is always great and knowledgable of the menu. This is one of our go to places. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. A large selection of beers and pasties to please all palettes. Great apps - try the \"Scotch Eggs\" and \"Oven Fries.\" I love the $3 car bombs all day every day and reasonable prices on draft beer. Staff is friendly and helpful, ambiance is lovely, and if you sit at the original bar, you can watch the cooks whipping up pasties! Save room for the chocolate bread pudding or buy a PB&J pasty to go for later!"}
{"text":"For the epic win. Great food. Chill server. Awesome music and $3 car bombs! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I first went to the Tempe location for vegetarian food. Their greek salad (dressing) is great. I've been trying the pasties and I like them all so far. The wine gravy is different. 

The Mesa location has more room and the patio. The church pews add a touch of humor. Better when you're with friends. Cool place for a beer. The service is relaxed and good..try it!"}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for years and always passed this place wondering what it was.  Finally, my Husband and I decided to give it a try...we had no idea what to expect.  The place is very intimate.  Some of the tables are long with benched seating so yes there is a possibility you may sit next to strangers.  But who cares when the food is as YUMMY AS IT IS!!!  The menu pretty basic but has many options for a Pasties.  I ordered the Carne Adovada it was AMAZING!  My Husband got the Pesto Chicken he raved about how delicious it was (didn't try because I do not like pesto).  We ended with dessert some apple caramel sauce with ice cream it was to die for!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!  I've loved every pasty I've tried and always bring out-of-town guests here.  My favorite is to sit at the bar (especially during lunch time) and watch the delicious magic of pasty making.  Ok, that is a lie; my FAVORITE part is sitting at the bar when they bust open the can of dulce de leche and give me a spoonful :)
I love the tables made doors and church pews, the drippy candles in wine bottles, and the rockin' juke box selection.  I desperately need to try the full English breakfast pasty to reminiscence about my summers in London. 
However, for being such a hipster joint I am very disappointed that there is not a bike rack...."}
{"text":"I love their American Royale burger and the beer is always great. I like coming here with my coworkers and enjoying a nice kickback. Have also had company dinners here. Great atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. The food, staff and drinks are amazing! We describe the pasties as a glorified hot pocket. My favorite is The Royale and potato/leek soup.The $3 car bombs are a great \"dessert\" option. We are never disappointed when we go"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Tempe numerous times and usually had a good experience.  This one is just as good and a touch larger if you have more than a few people.  The outdoor seating is a nice plus and the food is always great.  Their draft beer selection is icing on the cake.  Hoegarden, Franziskaner, Kronenbourg, and many more on draft.  Can't beat that.  Can't wait to get my next pasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great people and service. Gotta try this place!  very neat!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the food is always great. Staff is nice, cider is awesome.  Only complaints parking is always full and I wish they had better chairs."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! The salmon Caesar salad is my favorite. One of our go to casual date nights."}
{"text":"I will always love the food here, but I had super shitty service. I don't know what it is about the nonchalant hipster mentality, but she took FOREVER with EVERYTHING. She also screwed up my drink order. Terribly. Pretty meh experience."}
{"text":"It was hard for me to believe that a non-American convenience food (similar to the Indian samosas) could become so popular in Phoenix. This restaurant gives me a new perspective, and I think that a fast-food nation could in fact get elegantly poised over a hot plate of Cornish heaven. Such is the power of this convenience food. 

The bangers and mash is the closest to the original recipe of the pasty and therefore is a must try. 'The Italian' is scrumptious but is not the smartest thing to go in for at a British eatery. For a more wholesome meal a side of mushy peas seasoned with salt and pepper is a good order. 

The decadent mix of colonial English interiors and ultramodern music weaves magic on Pasty Company customers, making them want to come back time and again."}
{"text":"This place was so good.I had the Alfredo pasty. The waitress was average but the food and the atmosphere are awesome. I think I'm going to be back soon."}
{"text":"So glad this place is 1 mile from our house. Have been going here for a few years, just now writing a review. Extremely laid back vibe, soft lighting, pool table, bar, yet great place for a family. Awesome idea putting an entire dinner in a pastry."}
{"text":"Awesome place! They always have great beer on tap and an amazing take on a traditional British dish."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! No body does chicken pot pie better!! Awesome atmosphere, defiantly feels like you're in the Silverlake neighborhood of Los Angeles. Stellar music, great food and the employees are always hard at work cause this place gets busy. Don't whine and expect to get waited on hand and foot cause it gets packed. Still the food comes out made to order and in a timely manner! Save room for dessert cause they are to DIE for!!"}
{"text":"We visited this place with our 22 yr. old daughter on her suggestion. It was a Sunday afternoon so it was not packed but had a small crowd. The ambiance is kinda 70's feel, funky, chill including the wait staff. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We took all her suggested favorites to heart and ordered the Peppered steak, the Cheese Steak and The Pilgrim. We also tried their Bloody Mary's which were very good! The Pasties were all to die for! Served hot, juicy, but not soggy. The actual pastry was light and flaky, the side sauces and gravy were all yummy. Me and my daughter each took a half home. Very filling but not heavy. This is one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Can't wait to go back and try more varieties and one of their desserts. We will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"We are great fans of the Cornish pasty Company and when we have visitors we always visit for a great unique meal. Last two visits however have really disappointed with unacceptable service and a feeling of disappointment when we leave. Last night with a table of 7 and the restaurant far from flat out we waited for 10minutes before been acknowledged, initial drink and appetizer order was too slow and at this stage the rot starts setting in. Our visitors are asking if this is normal service for this restaurant and we are squirming. Finally our main meal arrived, another drink order was so slow we were finished eating when the drinks arrived and the waitress kindly offered the drinks for free. Around us, service seemed proficient and normal as you would expect. As I read through these yelp reviews this does not seem like a infrequent event. We love your food, we live locally and we really want to come back.."}
{"text":"As a business traveler to find an eatery where you can walk in alone, feel comfortable, have great food and drink and excellent service in a casual pub like  atmosphere is rare.  This place has it all.  Wish we had one in NY.  Will come back again and again."}
{"text":"Service was super slow. Food was very bland. The food that needed to taste exotic did not taste exotic, salty stuff was not salty, sweet stuff was not sweet.  The hibiscus tea was watered down. How do you mess up pumpkin pie?  Meh."}
{"text":"I only order to go in order to avoid the staff, but the last 2 times I've been there it's been rude staff and a messed up order. Tempe location is not much better."}
{"text":"I've gone to Cornish Pasty Co. once a week since the first time I tried it last month.  Believe the hype!! Delicious food, ultra cool comfortable ambience, delicious brew and super nice staff, even if perhaps a little slow sometimes.

Seat yourself and enjoy, I tried the Cottage Pie first, which was good, my hubby ordered the Chicken Pesto, it was great.  Next time around I got the Oggie and there is definitely a reason this is first on their menu, soooooo delicious, like a delicious beef stew in a crust, newbies start here! The Cheesesteak is also soooo delicious, my husband hasn't ventured outside of that one since he first tried it cause he doesn't believe anything will ever taste as delicious. Their fries/chips are okay, and I've only tried their soup with black beans which was tasty and spicy.  definitely save room for dessert because the apple caramel pasty haunts my daydreams, its that good.

Unfortunately my pre-holiday guilt is kicking in so I'm gonna have to cut back to only going every other week so as not to tip the scales soon but I will definitely make my way through their entire menu eventually and report back =)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars (I've never met a place that I'd give 5 stars to as \"the best i've ever had\")

Very cool place.  I read about this in the newspaper and then heard nothing but great reviews.  After a night out with friends we decided (I convinced) that we should check it out for dessert.  I heard about the PB&J pasty so I wanted to try.

We showed up at 10pm on a Friday and the seating was ample for our group of 8.  The chairs are church pews and the decoration/ambience is really, really well done.  

The staff is extremely nice and helpful (and fast).  We had a few Banoffee (which although sounds like coffeee, has nothing of the sort in it) and PB&J desserts which were great.  Admittedly the PB&J was really, really sweet.  But I still ate it all.

I can't wait to come back for their other food for lunch/dinner.  I was recommended to try the Royale with Cheese pasty upon return (an homage to Pulp Fiction, of course).

Try this place out!  I don't drink, but looked like a great hang-out if you do."}
{"text":"As Brits who came to Chandler Arizona 7 years ago, we are always on the lookout for some nostalgia and comfort food from our birth country. When we stubbled on Cornish Pasty we were candidly skeptical, about the pasty and if they captured the true originality of this historic food. We found this small and fun eclectic restaurant staffed by interesting and pleasant staff. The pasties were amazing and they captured the very essence of why a Cornish Pasty is such a great meal on its own. That was a few years ago and we would have given it a well deserved 5 stars. 

However, since then with their success and growth into a restaurant 3 times the size, its become worse and the service is now dreadful. On the last 3 occasions we've been, its gotten progressively worse and the once attentive service has become the victim of added size and popularity.  

As an example, on the last visit we never even got noticed by the staff who basically worked around us, until I asked for a server. When she arrived, her attitude was as though her job would be awesome if not for customers demanding service and food. I asked for a Boddingtons Beer, which frankly is one of the reasons we go as its a favorite British beer for many folks. they had none left and it was 5:15pm. One star taken away. 

When we ordered our food, both our choices were \" sold out\" as they are, \"very popular\" , what at 5:15pm. Seriously. Are they holding back perhaps, to serve the to-go clientele ? So our second choice was ordered. That too was not available. Another star dropped. 

So third choice came and it was good, but we still remained disappointed. It remains to be seen if this popular pasty place, will keep its loyal customers, because with growth and success possible apathy and over confidence can creep into a restaurant. Sadly for us, that is what we felt on our last visit. Hence, only 3 stars. Pity because this gem of restaurant is losing its charm, as they grow their business. I only hope the owners take note."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!  I go here at least once a month.  This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in town.

The atmosphere is awesome.  It is hard to describe, almost like industrial meets traditional.  They have drip candles in wine bottles on all the tables.  They have a bar area that serves drinks and then a \"bar\" area where you can sit facing the kitchen and watch the cooks prepare food.  My daughter and I usually sit there.  They have a big patio as well.

The service is always great.  The food of course is the star of the show.   Even the beverages are great.  The tea is very fresh and I usually get the hibiscus tea.

So good!  If you have never tried a pasty, this is the place to try one.  The Oggie is one of my favorites but there are so many options and delicious ones.

It is awesome that they have many vegetarian options and even some vegan options too, as I have some friends who do not eat meat or dairy.

Everything I have tried has been amazing, literally a party in your mouth ;)   I love thier tomato soup it is so creamy and flavorful and comes with the most delicious thick slices of homemade bread.

I love their pasta salad which I order frequently.  It is bowtie pasta tossed in a pesto sauce with artichokes, spinach, roasted red peppers, feta, onions, etc  It is so yummy!

Desserts are fantastic too.  I usually get the banoffee pie which is a graham cracker crust with homemade caramel on top, then topped with fresh whipped cream and sliced bananas.  Simple ingredients but so amaaaaaazing!

Everything is made from scratch and you can tell.

Everything is fantastic here, you will not be disappointed.  I will be back again and again. :)"}
{"text":"As I walked into the Cornish Pasty Co, I felt as if I was walking into the pub in Scotland. The atmosphere was very laid back which I expected due to the impression I got from my friends. I expected the aforementioned laid back atmosphere, excellent service and great food. However, my expectations were not met completely. 
 Instead of tables and chairs, the restaurant was lined with pews and tables. I found the Catholic pews to be a nice touch, but uncomfortable; I felt awkward sitting there. The pews were far from the table, which forced me to sit straight up as if I were in church instead of a eating establishment. The only positive thing about the pews was the camaraderie my friends and I shared about not being able to comfortably reach the table. 
 The food was decent, however, it was lukewarm. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasty and found it to be mediocre, due to the temperature of the dish. It was served with a side of spicy dressing, that added to the dish. I had a soda to drink, which was refilled once despite my draining of the glass. 
 The service was abominable. Our server, Mike, who might have been nice to look at, only checked on us once. During our dining expedition, he was listening to his iPod instead of working. He was also more interested in his own meal as opposed to asking us how our meal was. In addition to all of this, he was doing dishes on the counter where our food was waiting to be served."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always impeccable and the staff is always very professional. This place is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I truly wanted to like this place but the wait staff turned me off. On one particular evening the staff blasted heavy metal to chase the last patrons away, my waitress said. \"That's just how we do it,\" she said. I like rock, good food and good drink. This place fails miserably on the music front, especially when staff refuse to ease the volume following multiple requests."}
{"text":"The jalapeno and garlic chips, and the rosemary and chicken pasty were incredible. Plus it's a cool atmosphere to boot"}
{"text":"This place is by far one of my best restaurant discoveries. Cornish Pasty is definitely a favorite. The atmosphere is laid back and casual. Church pews as chairs and doors as the tables topped with a lit candle in a Jameson bottle, definitely a winner in style and uniqueness. I typically don't like tomato soup, BUT their cream of tomato soup is a a must every time. I usually get the Cajun chicken pasty as my go-to, although I've tried others and they're also really good. But the Cajun chicken is my favorite. They also have a nice outside seating section that is perfect on a nice Arizona day. Service has always been great."}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty. I've eaten at all of the locations in Phoenix. I ordered a to-go order bowl of soup for my sick mother, and they gave me an amount you would consider a half of a cup. Huge waste of money ... bad management in quality. Cornish pasty isn't cheap. Never going to this location again, simply out of spite."}
{"text":"I ordered the porky and I'm not sure what it was but there's something about the flavor inside the pasty that did not sit well on my tongue. The order itself was pretty hefty and despite my first misgivings I was able to give into my hunger and gobble the whole thing up. 

The BEST thing about the meal was the desert- strawberry pavlova. The meringue shells were exactly as advertised; crisp, airy, and full of homemade goodness. I hate overtly sweet deserts and this definitely was not that. The fresh whipped cream and fruit were a perfect complement to the meringue shells. 

In fact, I would actually think about returning just for the desert."}
{"text":"Great range of pasty choices on the menu. Cool, friendly staff. Make sure you don't sit in the back as service there is a bit slower. Guinness on tap (amongst others). 

I have to come back a few more times to try a few other pasties. The oggie is tasty. Id like to try the royale with cheese.

Pasties are \"Cornish\", not \"Finnish\". Subtley different than what I'm used to but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"i would describe a pasty as an empanada.. but if you've never had one, think of a hand held pot pie.

a ton of options for vegetarians..  a whole page of veggie pasties!  we had the tomato soup and the mushroom/spinach/walnut soup.  followed with the salt and pepper british chips and the veggie oggie (portabella mushrooms, onions, rutabaga, potatoes in a flaky delicious crust).  finished off with an apple caramel pasty (apples, cinnamon and caramel in that same flaky delicious crust!).  

there are also two other pages of meat filled pasties..  things liked \"the royale with cheese\" and \"bangers and mash\"..  something for everyone.

interesting decor - candles dripping down alcohol bottles, church pews, and tattoo covered staff.

great food!  i can't wait till our next spring training trip so that i can eat here again!"}
{"text":"My brother turned me on to this spot. I was first skeptical about going to a place that sounded like all they served was large hot pockets. But to my surprise this place was anything but ordinary! The whole concept is very creative for a restaurant. I love the history of the pasty too. They also serve my very favorite beer in the world on tap...... HOGARDEN! I stop by on the regular now for a Pilgrim pasty (the best!) and a hogarden! If you haven't been you gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pasties and really amazing service. First time there and we are going back! Another awesome thing that happened is a very nice young man paid for our entire meal!!
We couldn't believe it!  Don't know who you are but your parents raised you right. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Brooke was amazing and super patient while I took forever to decide on a glass of wine to pair with my meal.  Ridiculous I know! But we were very appericative!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great beer on tap, reasonable prices, great staff, and killer music.  If you don't love this place, you're weird."}
{"text":"Food was great tony our server was awesome great person to have work for you.  Victoria was horrible very bad attitude from when my boyfriend and I walked in she walked and brushed paste us saying just sit done somewhere.  After that my boyfriend wanted to leave which I also did but really wanted to try the food.  Luckily we had tony who served us.  A few times this Victoria would come take things from our table very rude would not say a word and even grabbed a plate I was not done with.  I never want to deal with her again horrible for he business"}
{"text":"If you are reading these reviews and have never indulged in the tasty delights served by Cornish Pasty Company, you must get your ass over there as soon as possible!

The variety of options is astounding for a place with a menu largely dominated by a single item: the humble pasty.  Nearly every major cuisine is represented, and for the vegetarians, this place is mecca, because there are just as many options on that side of the menu as the omnivorous one.  They also have a few sides (Cauliflower and Broccoli Cheese Bake is f*cking INCREDIBLE), salads, soups, and desserts.  Strangely enough, I've never tried any of the desserts, but they all look amazing.

Me and the boyfriend's favorite flavors include Rosemary Steak, Lovely Bit of Salmon, Bangers and Mash, Peppered Steak, and The Royale with Cheese (yes, they have a cheeseburger option, perfect for a picky kid, just don't let them eat the whole thing!)  And speaking of portion size, don't think when you first behold your precious pasty that it is nothing to write home about in terms of size.  That little football will fill you to the brim, (this is probably the reason I've never had their desserts!)  They are great to split with a friend along with a salad or other side, if you are looking to lighten it up a bit.

I can't really comment on the service.  Since the Mesa location is a quarter mile from our house, we always order out.  From what I can tell, they are packed every night.  We never have any problems with our order, though now I think of it, the last time I called to place one, the phone just rang and rang with no answer, and we ended up getting My Arepa.  No big, though.

I'm so glad this concept is expanding in the Valley, Cornish Pasty is quickly becoming an institution in this town, so if you haven't been yet, make it happen!"}
{"text":"Y'all are fantastic. I always make sure to tell people about you when anyone comes to town. Even told my boss to take his lady Jere for date night with 100% confidence they would enjoy themselves. A few years ago on my birthday we had a party of 8 for dinner. It started pouring rain outside where we were at and the staff had everyone on the patio come inside. There wasn't enough open tables so they let us all sit on the floor around one of the tables by a couch in the waiting area to enjoy our food and continue my birthday. It was a birthday I will never forget and how they went out of their way to not let the rain ruin dinner was something I'll always be grateful for on top of every experience I've had eating here."}
{"text":"Six stars. This place goes above and beyond expectations for food quality. It's not the cheapest food in the world, but you damn well get what you pay for. So filling. Every bite is orgasmic. Excellent customer service. The place itself has a very weird atmosphere. I feel like the mood they're going for is: privacy. Like all the booths have really high dividers and it's really dimly
Lit. So much so that when you walk back out into Arizona sunlight it came be rather disorienting, especially if you've just finished one of their giant mugs of beer, which are almost a necessity to accompany your meal and complete the cornish pasty experience. Damn it's been a good couple months since I've had any and writing this review has made me crave it immensely. I gotta wrap this up and head over there now. It's almost noon so it's probably a good time to start drinking. (don't let this fool you- it's not standard bar fare. You don't have to be drunk to enjoy this food. But the option is available.)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is unique. The staff is chill and professional. All of the waiters chip in and helpful. I'm not a real typer so it'll be short and sweet. The pictures do a good job of giving a few thousand words. Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"This is my guilty pleasure. My boyfriend and I eat here AT LEAST once a week. All of the servers are laid back, but fast and friendly. The Cornish Pasties are amazing. I've tried many, but my go-to is always The Ruben. If you like ruben sandwiches, the Ruben pasty will blow your mind. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love the food here--if you can actually get what you want. Lately, every time we go in, it's a crapshoot if they'll have the pasty you want. \"Sorry we're out\" is to common a response. Just ordered three different pasties and got shot down each time. The wait guy finally said \"Would you like me to tell you all the ones we're out of?\" It's 6:45 p.m. on a Friday and you're out of a bunch of pasties? Who's doing your forecasting? I'm so annoyed at playing Guess What Pasty We Have? I'm just getting an appetizer. I've always sung your praises but really, get your shit together. The place is packed so it doesn't matter if you lose our frequent patronage (several times a month with my group of buddies), but keep it up and your business may eventually suffer.

And my buddy ordered an appetizer and the wait guy assumed I split it with him and charged me for a portion of it grrrrrr"}
{"text":"The \"hipster\" tag on Yelp was made for exactly this type of restaurant. This place was full of them; you'll see a lot of tattooed employees here and general indie-ness abounds at the Cornish Pasty Co. Luckily this also means good music. I heard El Ten Eleven, Minus the Bear, Crystal Castles, and Caribou while eating there. But onto the food!...

CPC has a great variety of pasties. I tried \"The Porky\", which was delicious. Inside it was pork, potatoes, apples, sage, and a few other ingredients. My table also ordered a side of jalapeno fries, which were very good and just the right level of spiciness.  You really can't go wrong with this restaurant. What's not to love about a place that has Strongbow on tap? I would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Literally, may have become one of my top favorite foods. I haven't had or even heard of a Pasty but I'm so happy I did. Came here with my hubs, and we had a hard time choosing what Pasty to even get...so many good options. We both were overly satisfied with our choices. This place is so bomb! Great atmosphere too and outdoor seating where you can bring your dog. I had a great experience here and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and fun vibes

Great beer selection and I love the pot pie pasty!"}
{"text":"Went once. No big deal. Nice atmosphere but I won't go back. Had a Pasty. It was dry and virtually tasteless. The pot pies at KFC are better."}
{"text":"I come to this location for business meetings all the time and love it! I get a different pasty every time and I've never been disappointed. Today I thought I'd venture out and get a salad. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad and it was delicious! The service has always been above par. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I had friends tell me about it and no one could quite describe to me what the food was like, now having been there I understand why. It is excellent and undescribeable. Its like the most magnificent hot pocket you could ever imagine stuffed with a variety of different delicious combinations"}
{"text":"I was there for a birthday kick off, meaning \"meet, drink, eat and leave\".
Glorified gourmet hot pocket..?? NO way beyond that! Good stick to your ribs food. Every combination of meats, cheeses, veggies and sauces you can think of, Mexican style to Thanksgiving!!
I will be going back to try another Pasty!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and Great service! I have tried several different kinds and have not found a bad one. You get a lot of food for a reasonable price. They have Strong Bow on tap and really cheap car bombs! What more could you ask for!?"}
{"text":"Greek Salad with pesto dressing is awesome! Walnut soup was delicious too. The Italian pasty is my favorite. Good red sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food and comforting atmosphere but there is usually so many people there it's just better to grab food and eat at home. There are always leftovers which is a huge plus for me!"}
{"text":"Great place for a couple, out with friends, and even children. Ordered the following pasties: The Ogee, Carne Adovado, Shepards Pie,and Cheesesteak. Also ordered the spinach, mushroom, and walnut soup & for dessert The Toffee Sticky Pudding cake. Everything was delicious and the server was relatively attentive. Whenever we come we can't wait to try a new Pasty. Great vibe in the evening and a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"We love Cornish Pasty! I like that the staff isn't all up in my face all the time, but they are attentive. I wish they had more than 2 vegan options per day. The vegan pot pie is incredible. The pub chips (fries) are delicious too. 
Bottom line: go there, with family or friends!"}
{"text":"I did not know what a pasty was until today. I decided to come here and try it out. There's many pasties to choose from: premium pasties (meat), veggie pasties, and dessert pasties. When I picked up the menu I think I stared at the menu for a good ten minutes before I finally settled on the chicken tikka masala (red curry) pastie. It has marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, basmati rice and green peppers. Today, I choose to sit by the kitchen so I could watch the chefs in the kitchen make/bake my pasty. I waited a good ten minutes or more for my food and I understood why. They make everything from scratch. When the pasty finally came it was baked to a perfect golden brown color. When you bite into it the shell just crumbles which made it more enjoying to eat!

Go get your pasty NOW!"}
{"text":"I thought their food was very tasty!  Although I wasn't a fan of their Oggie (basic one) - I really love their Cottage Pie Pasty.  Haven't ordered dessert, but they sound amazing too."}
{"text":"Being English and missing a lot of the things we can't get over here we were delighted to have found this place.  I have not tried all of the pasties and have stuck to the traditional ones that we get at home, i.e, cheese and onion and cornish and they are very good!!  I sent my husband there to buy their half baked ones so we could freeze them and have whenever we get the craving and I ended up ordering $80 worth without any regrets.  Needless to say my freezer is full of pasties and I even have a couple of ones I have not tasted before, so looking forward to trying those.  Have not eaten in the place either but quite frankly the food is that good I don't it would matter what it's like inside.  Also just noticed this is the Mesa shop we have only bought from the newly opened on in Tempe."}
{"text":"If someone put a gun to my head and told me I could only go to one place in all of Phoenix for the rest of my life, I would choose here. No jokin'."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Family friends took us recently when we were wanting to try something new. The combination of meals inside a baked pastry was definitely unique. I had the peppered steak pasty and my husband had the pot pie. We were full after eating half but it was so good we finished once we licked our plates clean! My husband was also thrilled with their large beer selections.make room for dessert or take it to go! The banana and the strawberry deserts are u like anything we have ever tasted! Will definitely be returning to try all the variety of pastries available!"}
{"text":"With the plethora of various Asian, Mexican, and other Central American cultural food places that scatter the valley, Cornish Pasty Co. was a much needed deviation from the typical outing. Until eating here I had never actually tried \"authentic\" British food, but I'm sure glad I did!  Both the atmosphere and the taste made eating here amazing. 

Perhaps it's because I am a part of the younger generation, but I am frequently drawn to restaurants that have a simple, modern aesthetic. The softly lit and rustic feel of Cornish Pasty co. fulfilled this desire to the brim. Not only did the atmosphere make it enjoyable (a wonderfully mellow alternative rock playlist wavered overhead), but the kindness and charisma of the servers helped as well. They weren't afraid to chat you up as you ordered, but knew to not overstep their boundaries. 

Finally, there is the food (mmmm yes. The FOOD.) As I mentioned, I had not indulged in what might be called culturally British food before. Because of this I played it safe and ordered the chipotle chicken pasty, whose name rang familiar with my southern grown tastebuds. What followed was a tasty adventure. The portions are well suited for the type of food, and I finished just as I started feeling full. The pasty itself was delicious, a great combination of meat that reminded me of the lovechild of a calzone and a spanakopita. But what sealed the deal was the sauce. Each pasty comes with a flavor specific sauce to accompany it and it was not something I felt I could do without. 

So here's a recap: Tasty, good atmosphere, friendly servers, delicious sauce. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is terrible. Be prepared to be ignored while you wait quite a while for your food. Don't get me wrong, the food is worth the wait, I just typically prefer my server to um...be of some service. Instead she was alternately on her cell phone and sitting at the bar talking to another waitress who was eating lunch in between waiting her section of tables. The music is also obnoxiously loud."}
{"text":"Oh The Pasty, how I love thee, let me count the ways!  I have never, not once been disappointed.  If you've never had a pasty, I would tell you that you need to go.  I really like the atmosphere, the church pews as seats and the alcohol bottles as candle holders are awesome.  I would say that the staff seem like hipsters, but they're all really friendly and helpful.  They have pretty good drink specials, and their hibiscus tea is mighty tastey!

PS.  Their vegetarian menu is LONG, and like I said, it's all good!  I think my favorites are The Greek and the Eggplant Parm."}
{"text":"This place is the best for late-night eats- I really love that they have such late hours, as we typically don't get home from work until after 9pm some nights. We've been coming here about 3-4x/month, for the last 6 years- one of our staple favorite places in the Tempe/Mesa area. Pasty is our go-to spot for casual, \"no-frills\" dining- great spot for enjoying some drinks/darts/pool with friends, and great food. Portions huge, prices are very fair, decent wine and beer selection, always cool music playing, love the laid-back vibe and casual atmosphere. Waitstaff is always pleasant. Variety of pasties on the menu is fantastic- really appreciate the vegetarian options (thank you!). Food quality is consistently- we've tried various menu options and all have been delicious, over and over again. My only suggestion (if I may) would be just a few more salads and a broth-based soup. Love the new side room recently added on- such cool, eclectic decor. Nothing \"typical\" about Pasty- in all the right ways!"}
{"text":"Cool place, good food, horrible service. I want to like this place but the staff is cold and inconsiderate. Makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by letting you eat here. If service is important,  go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband, patents and I love this place. We've hoped around from location to location and this location by far has the best food, most enthusiastic staff, and cleanest. The parliament wings have been our family favorite. I like the Greek salad and the bangers and mash pasty. The salad is huge so if you order that get it as a meal not as a side. It's a fun environment :) Shannon has been our server the last few times and she is friendly but doesn't over do it and she gets our food out fast."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!

My family is from England and let me tell u this is spot on ! If we ever have a craving for English food but don't have the time or ingredients to cook it ourselves this is the place to go.

My husband is a picky eater and being American not always a fan of straight up Brit food loves this place as well! I always get the shepherds pie and he usually goes for anything chicken or the Mexican style. I always get the mushy peas and he gets the fries. Just like home! We never end up getting through an entire pasty but it tastes as good reheated in the oven. And let me tell you my husband never eats leftovers and always eat his from here. 

The only thing I will say is that we had the pavlova one time and it's just not as good as my moms! Everything else amazing! 

All in all if u don't have the money to travel to England want to try the food and experience the English pub life go here! The Brits are not as bland as you think and they will prove it!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Great food and lots of it!! Gotta love the huge outdoor patio too.  Definitely
gonna be a regular!"}
{"text":"Consistently friendly and attentive service is only outdone by the tasty and original menu. Cornish's pasties always hit the spot and the menu is vegetarian-friendly. They have a great selection of pasties, sides, and beers. My family always leaves happy with a full stomach and intact wallet. They've got a great thing going here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Love the atmosphere. Drink selection is good. The decor is ol church pews with doors for tables. Great date place.  The food truly stands out. Im a purist so i love the simple Bangers N Mash.   Eat here you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, food, and only 3 dollars for irish car bombs! A different style of food totally worth every penny. I visit every chance I get."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co is one of our favorite restaurants... in fact, the one reason we don't eat there on a weekly basis is that everyone else knows how good it is and it can get PACKED.  

I always get the same meal because it's perfect: Hibiscus Iced Tea (addictively good) and Shepard's Pie.  Lamb, carrots, peas, onions, mashed potatoes, cheese - all in a flaky crust.  Ultimate comfort food!

BF loves the Chicken Greek, Spicy Asiago, the Pepper Steak, and pretty much every other pasty he's tried.  

It can be slow but the atmosphere makes the wait a bit easier because you can ALWAYS people watch.  There is a wait while the pastys cook so if you're starving, go with the soup - their soups are very good and come out fast.

We haven't had many of the desserts but the banoffee pie and the caramel apple pasty are both solid.  Can't speak much about the bar side, either, but BF does love that they serve Strongbow cider.

If you haven't gone before, you'd better go soon - used to be a hidden gem but now we have to worry about getting a table!"}
{"text":"We went there in April on vacation. We split our order. 
We both got food poisoning. We lost a total of 4 days of vacation time.  We will not go back. 
I emailed corporate ~ AND NEVER heard anything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't just drive by, go in!!! I've never been so full! Great drink specials, especially Sunday! Love the ambiance, low lights and candles, but don't forget to order some shots like my fav the Rotten Apple. Still working our way through the menu, don't have a fav yet all have been delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a great time last night. Music was good. Our bartender chad was great and on point. Food was good. I had the mock chicken tika masala it was good, the sauce that came with it was very sweet and didn't sit well with the dish. Next time ill skip the sauce or try another one."}
{"text":"What I live about this place their creative menu. The staff is so welcoming. It's cool to watch them prepare your meal. The bar has a great variety of spirits and beer. I have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"We went here earlier in the week. Oh my, this place never disappoints. The service is always excellent. The employees always make sure we get what we need. We always leave so happy from Cornish Pasty. I want to keep coming here every week. All the food is excellent and we love the deserts too."}
{"text":"Absolutely  love the veggie food options they offer as will as the atmosphere this place has. I bring out of towners here  for a rare treat. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"OMG!! Large selection of beer in big glasses and anything you would eat at dinner stuff in a loaf. I like the turkey, stuffing and cranberry pasty. Other good Pasties include the taco and the chicken fettuccine. Great food, kind of a old mine lunch motif and great story about Cornwall."}
{"text":"Went to the new location a friend just as the weather started to cool off enough to be able to sit outside. We got to watch a gorgeous sunset while eating our yummy pasties. One of the things I really like about this new location (aside from the outside booths) is the extended menu with lots more vegetarian options. So many things to choose it made deciding difficult. The Shepard's Pie made with Quorn Veggie Ground Round was way too salty (I think the chef should have tasted it to realized it's not like ground beef and comes already somewhat flavored and doesn't need more salt), but the other pasty I had with eggplant was wonderful. Looking forward to going back again this week to try different dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever!!!!! I don't why know I ever go anywhere else to eat! Awesome people, service and food!! Good for food with one friend or 10 friends! Also a awesome unique selection of beers! Champagne on Sundays as well!! Cornish is a A++ in my book"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been incredible. The royal with cheese is my favorite. The pasty version of a cheeseburger is everything you could want it to be. Obviously pasties is their main dish but amongst them there is a huge variety and something for everyone who likes pasties. The Cajun chicken was also excellent. The ambiance is a little dark so bring a flashlight for grandma."}
{"text":"Gourmet hot pockets. Plus they have my new favorite food scotch eggs. Its a hardboiled egg wrapped in sausage and deep fried. Glad they increased the size of the Guadaloupe and Dobson location. Foods amazing enough for me to overlook the hipsters."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something unique and a bit edgy, this is the place for you!  Cornish Pasties are yummy baked pockets of goodness, they are so flavorful here!  I recently asked Cornish Pasty Company to cater an office event, and they were a hit!  I had the oggie, which is the traditional pasty.  Check out their website to see their menu options and read a little bit of pasty history: http://www.cornishpastyco.com/index.html, but its much better to go in, grab a pint, a pasty, and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went at a bad time? I just wasn't impressed with this place. Nothing great about the service, the food was substandard... I don't understand because the reviews were so good? Maybe I need to be intoxicated to enjoy a pasty."}
{"text":"Food, good. Very good. Beer on tap choice was black and tan. Also very good. For kids...not so much."}
{"text":"Yummy Goodness!!! The Mushroom Walnut soup is Cozy Delisciousness (trust me on this) and the Hot Flaky Pasties are comfort food in a crust! Love the dark English Pub feel and the cool vibe of the place. The white candles in the old wine bottles are a nice rustic touch and add to the ambience. The one draw back is that the service can be hit or miss- but a plus is that if you don't want to be dine in you can order half-baked pasties to go for $6. I told an Australian friend I went here, and she said she had just been there a few days before and she could literally eat one of their pasties every single day. She loves them so much she wanted me to go again with her the next day!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love the pasties, there are so many and all the ones we have tried have been delicious. I love the banafee pie with strawberries instead of banana. The last two times I have got it it hasn't been as good as the first time I got it. One time the caramel was all runny and the last time I got it the whip cream had a weird taste and was just strange. It's disappointing because I crave it and look forward to being able to dig into it. I wish it was consist and delicious every time. I hate having to wonder if I'm going to be disappointed. My boyfriend gets the bread pudding and loves it. Still worth going to for the pasty"}
{"text":"Great place for both food and drinks. If you haven't tried the dessert yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"ok but the mushy peas are terrible"}
{"text":"It's this simple: how many good English Pubs with outstanding English Pasties (a folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables) do you know of in the Valley? Exactly... If you don't know what a good English--yet conspicuously American influenced--pub is like, this is your best shot in Arizona. 

The food is well thought out and straight forward. Some of the Pasties may be a bit more flavorful than your traditional English oriented places but the flavors are wonderful, and I dare say, healthy. There is a Pasty for you in there somewhere! 

This vegetarian and vegan friendly atmosphere is a find for those who want to sit back, enjoy a pint and enjoy a candlelit evening and relax for the day. If you're looking for \"vibe,\" you found your new place. The atmosphere reflects a relaxed and soulfully sophisticated crowd. Nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"All I know is that this place gets it. They know people. They understand people and they realize what regular people want. And the fact that they roll with great food and drinks.....wow! Can't wait to go back. Joel, the bartender, was outstanding. Be back soon. We'll done Cornish!"}
{"text":"The Cornish is THE REAL DEAL, I've never tried a bad pasty, but my go to is the Cajun Chicken and man is it the best. I'm recommend this place to any and everybody."}
{"text":"Soo excited that I finally went here. I loved everything about it; the atmosphere with the candles and awesome music playing on the juke box, the service, and the food. 
Last night we went and sat out on the patio and I was in heaven! the weather was perfect, Heidi the owner was great, and I was so releived to finally find a cool place with good food by my house. 
I got the spicy asiago chicken pasty and it was great; and I think I might go back already today, and get the Rosemary chicken! yay finally a place with a little culture :)"}
{"text":"When you have starving children and they refuse to eat the PB&J...you know your PB&J is messed up! When the kids refuse to eat the sugar free whipped cream it really upsets the kids because they had expectations. At least have the courtesy to warn the parents or offer the sloppy sticky drizzle on the side and to leave the nasty cream in the kitchen. 

P.S. Four napkins won't cut it in that situation either."}
{"text":"I am from Michigan and I would have never guessed I could get an authentic pasty in the desert. Had the traditional pasty and it was delicious. Didn't think I could get it on the plane back to Las Vegas or I would have taken one to go"}
{"text":"This is our first time there because we were meeting friends there for lunch.  The pasties menu selection was in depth. I chose the Meatball and S.O. chose the chicken pot pie. The food was delicious however, the waitress took forever to take our order, I had to literally find her and tell her we were ready to order our lunch after twenty minutes. SMH. Then, after we we're done I flagged her down and told her we we're ready for the check. I told her jokingly please, take this bill now before you disappear and her response was I can't help it I have to many (six) tables. I kept quiet, but whatever happened to great Customer Service!!!!!!! It's a lost art."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my food. Also, after accidentally leaving a card at the restaurant, I finally got a hold of them over the phone and the woman who answered said they couldn't even check whether they found my card unless I called back at closing or came into the restaurant. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place and whenever I have visitors in town, this is where I take them! In fact, I've had a visitor go to Cornish twice during their 4 day trip in Arizona!

My favorite pasty is The Pilgrim. It is so good that it has really prevented me from trying a different kind of the numerous pasties on the menu."}
{"text":"Very Unique food and great atmosphere!!! manager is awesome and they whole staff is very good!!! I love the Mexican Pasty and the Garlic fries are the best ever!!! very comfortable place and reminds me very much of English style food!!! owner is a very nice guy and hands on with making sure the food is well presented and it is always made to order!!! the manager Justin is very helpful and wants to know everyone leaves happy!!!! great place for out of town guests to visit as well!!!! also has to go half baked pastys which is great too!!!"}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty Co. I've tried several flavors - lamb vindaloo, the oggie, lamb and mint, rosemary chicken, the pilgrim. All of them are totally delicious, fresh, and the ingredients are obviously good quality. The sauces they make are all excellent and flavorful, although I prefer the red wine gravy with lamb or beef, not turkey or chicken.

The prices are totally reasonable. At first you think it's steep for what is essentially a handheld pot pie, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. I can only ever eat half and take the other half home. 

Sides are also tasty. Haven't tried the drinks or desserts but I assume they are just as good! 

Service is a little spotty (they seem to employ affable, somewhat spacey young men). But I suppose that's kind of in line with a British place, huh? ;)

Something I find disappointing, though, is that you cannot customize any of the pasties. If you don't like an ingredient in it, you have no choice but to order something else. I get that they prep the pasties earlier in the day to maximize efficiency in baking, but still.

This location is really nice and I prefer it to the location near ASU. Great outdoor seating area, misters, lots of shade, etc.

I will be back many times, I am sure."}
{"text":"Great food. HORRIBLE SERVICE! From the moment we walked in (were ignored for several minutes until we found out it was self service seating), through ordering (15 minutes later), to receiving our food (1 hour after walking in the door and the order wasn't complete)."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to leave two different sets of stars. My 2/5 will hopefully get their attention. I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon. 

The food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet. 

The atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE. 

The one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.

If you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Every time I come to Phoenix I come here. My go to pies are all the ones filled with Indian food! This place also does not shy away from the heat in the vindaloo so if you really like heat you should get that one. It is a bit dark inside but so good!"}
{"text":"My mother-in-law grew up on this type of food, so when she came to visit for Christmas, we thought this would be a fun place to take her.  The menu looked interesting and the high review scores were promising.  We went on a Thursday night and got there for a late dinner after running some other errands about 8:00.  

When I first walked in, I thought they might be closing because ninety percent of the dining room was empty and had been blocked off.  But a guy by the door - who I eventually figured out worked there - said it would only be a minute for the table.  So I gave him my name and we waited.  After about 10 minutes, he came by and told us they were clearing a table.  10 minutes later he said that again.  After 30 minutes of waiting, he admitted that he had no idea when seating would be available.  We gave up and left - the Thai food next door was fantastic.

If they had just been upfront and told us that most of their seating was unavailalbe, we would have placed a to-go order.  But don't say you're clearing a table if there isn't really a table..."}
{"text":"My first experience with Cornish Pasty Company was over at a friends house, she had ordered the not done ones that you bake at home...I did not have very high expectations, I was thinking something like hot pocket quality...boy was I wrong! Even baking them at home they were fantastic! I had to go and see what it was like in the actual restaurant! I have been many times."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Had the veggie rosemary chicken patty made with quorn. Great mustard sauce. With courteous friendly service. Crispy crust and more filling than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, kitchen is in the middle of the dining area so you watch them cook,  atmosphere is great, very chill and thematic,  service varies but been never really disappoints depending on the night and how busy they are, I keep coming back to this place, I make a special trip every time I'm in Arizona, my favorites the Italian, and the Royale with cheese,  but every thing I've tried there I'd happy get again, don't skip out on this place!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this restaurant 4 times now and really like their food.  You HAVE to try their dessert made with bananas and graham crackers. Unbelievable!

they are also really good about advising you what dishes to try based on your input.

I've been really satisfied with each meal there... and there is a lot of room for larger parties..."}
{"text":"I love this place almost more than words can say.  Inexpensive, delicious, and the atmosphere is outstanding.  It is British food done in a unique manner, and it doesn't make me feel like a disgusting cow, the way that Rula Bula does for instance.  The drinks are delicious, the servers are friendly and interesting, they have a free juke box with some pretty good music on it... what else can I say?  I visited the place three times in two weeks after I first heard about it, it is that freaking awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! Ok the soup is amazing! Oven chips are great! Pasties are unbelievable!

Dessert - English toffee - or bread pudding both are really good!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Everything was amazing! Go try it! 

4 stars because we sat at the bar on a not so busy night but didn't get very good service- too busy making busy work cleaning for the end of the night (before 9pm on a Saturday) but didn't pay attention to our requests very promptly. Not rude but borderline ignoring us! 

We will be back for the food but hopefully the service will be better!"}
{"text":"The Mesa location doesn't have quite the quaint charm of the Tempe location but the food is still great and the patio is ample. All the pasties on the menu are very good and the traditional ones do stay very true to the Old Country recipes. The dessert pasties are worth a try if you have room. I also enjoy picking up the ones you can finish baking at home. Drink prices are always good and they normally have specials going. My favourite is the Shepherd's Pie or the Bangers and Mash. Ask for extra red-wine gravy."}
{"text":"My husband is not easily amused, and he said and I quote, \"Best dining experience I have had all year!\" 

Food=phenomenal! Go hungry, it's quite filling. Make sure you try a Scottish egg, it was my first time and it was delicious! Hard-boiled egg with sausage and bread crumbs, so delish!

We got the \"oggie\" pasty which is basically meat and potatoes and it was so good, that pouch thing that it comes in is like what you wish chicken pot pie was, but 1000 times better. I got \"the pilgrim\" pasty as my dinner, and it was like thanksgiving feast in a pouch! I was in a food coma after that thing. 

They had a good beer selection too, and the ambiance is super cool. Overall, great vibe, great food, great service too! 

This place has been put on our list to take out-of-town friends as a must!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried a pasty, and I loved it! This place is just perfect. Great ambience, food and superb collection of beers. Great selection for vegetarians as well. Oh and their chocolate dessert is unbelievably good!

I am definitely going back here again!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Cornish Pasty! I usually sit at the bar because I love how they have old doors as the table. Super unique. I always get the chicken pot pie pasty which is so filling I usually take the 2nd half home and heat it up for lunch. It is definitely a great spot for a date night or a larger group dinner."}
{"text":"What can I say?  It was pretty tasty 
The only reason why im giving this a three star is because of where we were seated. 
The fan or a/c next to us broke down and we sat RIGHT next to the salamander/oven. 
It was so hot and hard to breath, no one ask if we wanted to move or not."}
{"text":"So bombdizzle! Great options on menu. I had cottage pie and it was delicious. We will definitely come back here again. Staff was really helpful and nice, I'm not sure who our server was but everyone who came by was super friendly. Would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a little biased toward this place, admittedly, being where I had my first date with my now wife.  But each time I've been back has been just as great as the first!  They know their way around a pasty, and I wouldn't change a thing.  The low lighting might be an issue for some, but to me it creates a really nice ambiance to compliment the experience.  Exceptional!"}
{"text":"This place has great food, has a great vibe, and the staff has always been very welcoming.  I frequently take visiting family members to Cornish Pasty so they can enjoy in the unique experience.  The food, though great, is portioned small.  Their pasties are certainly bigger than a hot pocket, but not smaller than a six inch sandwich.  For the size, i feel the entrees are a little pricey.  If you add an appetizer and drinks and the meal might get a little too close to your budget."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's in my top 5 list of places to frequent for good service experience. Great food, great beer, and very friendly staff, make Pasty House a hit with any friend or client I have ever met there. They do get very busy in the evenings, dinner service is slower than lunch, and there is often a waiting line even on weeknights, but the wait is worth it. My favorite entrees are the Portobello Chicken and the Meat and Cheese pasties, but they are all good, I have never been disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I have spent some time in Cornwall and have eaten my fair share of pasties.  So I was excited to try this place out.  Right off the bat though, I love that they have so many vegetarian and vegan options.  That's really nice.

I tried the balsamic portobello mushroom pasty, the chips, and the chocolate bread and butter pudding.  Overall, it was good.  I would say that, aside from the chips, it's not as authentic as I would have hoped for.  The pasty itself was a bit more \"posh\" than what you'd normally find.  To be fair, I didn't do a direct comparison.  In Cornwall, I had previously eaten the more traditional pasties like cheese and onion, pork and apple, etc.  But I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth, as I said, I was very happy to have so many veggie options.  But the pasty did seem more posh in term of the pastry being more refined than what you'd normally see.  I mean, basically, the pasties they serve are actually probably better made and prepared than real pasties... the pastry is crisper but also a little tougher.  Overall, I like my pasty though.

The chocolate bread and butter pudding though, I'm afraid, was really not what I was expecting.  Real bread and butter pudding is made with chunks of bread and, you guessed it, soaked in butter (among other things).  What I was served was something more like a sponge cake soaked with brandy and comes with a little pot of creme anglaise (which I don't think I was ever served at any time in the UK, but hey ho!).  The sponge cake has more of a consistency of treacle tart/pudding.  Minus the treacle, of course.  And again, it tasted really nice and was a lovely dessert in it's own right, it was just not bread and butter pudding.  It looked like a striped cube, by the way.

So I guess for the food that's my review, that the food was very good in it's own right, and possibly is a posh version of those foods, but I didn't get that authentic homey feel from it like I hoped because it wasn't the real thing.

I would definitely go there again though.  The service was really good.  I liked the vibe of the place and the decor is cool.  And the food was tasty overall.  It's a nice, casual, fun restaurant."}
{"text":"We were driving around, hoping for some last-minute dinner inspiration when my husband suddenly realized I'd never experienced the Cornish Pasty Company.  A quick search on yelp found that this was the closest location, and we were off!  We arrived in peak dinner hours, so it was fairly busy.  We offered to sit at the bar if that would be faster, and it was.  It was actually really cool sitting there; we had a view of the prep kitchen and we enjoyed watching everybody work around each other like a well-oiled machine.

Aware of the large portion sizes, the two of us split a salad (it must have been unremarkable, I remember nothing about it) some kind of fries (yummy) and a pasty.  It was called The Pilgrim, or something else Thanksgiving-y, and it had turkey, stuffing, cranberry, sweet potatoes, gravy... your whole Thanksgiving Dinner in each bite!  That was one tasty pasty!  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I found that half was plenty of food.  

The atmosphere was lively and busy and I'd definitely recommend planning ahead if you're coming with a group or during a busy time.  Bonus... they have those purse hooks under the bar to keep your stuff off the highly trafficked floor!

It was a fun and yummy time, and I would love to go back to try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"The long awaited second location finally open, Cornwall native Dean Thomas has another major hit on his hands! A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say \"Pass-Tee\"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.

Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering. From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!

If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guinness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.

With more room to seat folks, a nice bar/counter, outdoor seating (complete with an area for those that still smoke.) and TWO bathrooms the new Mesa location of the Cornish Pasty Co. is sure to be a huge success.

Take the time to stop by either location of The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again"}
{"text":"Tons of pasty filling choices - hot and delicious. Red wine gravy is awesome. Add a black & tan pint, relax and  enjoy the dimly-lit pub ambiance, w/ all British band music backdrop. My kind of place."}
{"text":"The Oggie pasty tastes fine, but the environment is not so great. The desert, Banoffee Pie, doesn't have a enjoyable looking, however, its flavor really worth a try!"}
{"text":"l love this roomy, pubby, delicious restaurant. Tried the Shepards Pie Pasty and it was really good (Rueben still wins). The joint was jumping on a Wednesday night which happens to be \"reduced price Guiness night\".  I like the hipster vibe and  can't wait to turn others onto it."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Went with friends and my fiancé. We loved the atmosphere. The service was even better. The food was amazing. Cannot say enough good things. I will be back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal. Super clean, affordable and enjoyable. Any pasty is legit, don't fill up without dessert. Many options also have to try all the sauces."}
{"text":"Ambiance is dark and cozy... A lot of group seating. They have a bar and billiard. We came for lunch on a Saturday at noon and wasn't crowded yet. 
No kids menu but there should be a pastry for them to share and sides. 
Will come again! Wanna try more parties, ingredients make my mouth water! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place!  I would have never even noticed it tucked in the corner of the Chiba Hut lot if someone hadn't pointed it out to me.  This is one of the more interesting 'homesy' places in Phoenix that I enjoy going to and taking out of town visitors to.  

The restaurant itself is very simple, it is very narrow and rectangular.  Most of the seating is at the bar/counter, which is right on the other side of the food preparation area.  There are about six or seven tables in the place, and they are all pushed up to the one wall that isn't the kitchen.  

I have only good things to say about the food.  I watched mine be prepared from scratch as well as many other dishes and their ingredients are extremely fresh.  If you're crass like myself you could boil everything down to gourmet hot pockets.  The crust is flaky and just hard enough to keep it's shape, and there is almost no end to the ingredients you can order inside, from the traditional to the exotic.  

I also noticed they had some great beers in stock.  I've never walked in to a Phoenix restaurant (excluding those attached to breweries) and seen Chimay on the menu.  

All-in-all a great place to eat, I've been back a few times since my first visit and been pleased every time."}
{"text":"We had dinner there for the first time.  Appetizers came out but after ~40 minutes I was about to check on our order when the manager came to our table and apologized that our order had been lost and our food would be out in a few minutes.  He also said he would take 60% off the check for our inconvenience.  A few minutes later our order came out.  Altogether we tried the Scottish Egg, Potato soup, Chicken wings, Reuben, Roast Beef, and lamb 'vindaloo' pasties.  With a little room left we tried the banana pie and the toffee cake for dessert.  All was very delicious and nice portions...  Sure enough the manager took the 60% off our bill.  Though we were there two hours it was a pleasant atmosphere.  Giving it a 5 star and we will be back.  JGH"}
{"text":"Back again on a whim... They just don't have any care in the world.. hard to want to come back really... At least the beer was tasty because they had nothing together other then the beer and we came in 45 min after they opened. Now it's strike 3 for my bf and at this point I'm pretty over it too. Bartender did the best he could so I'll give him credit but this place needs help. Won't be back after this."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Seriously, I couldn't find one thing wrong.  An amazing beer selection, great atmosphere, super cool staff, and the food was outstanding!  So stoked to have found a new favorite that is fairly close, and yet disappointed that I've been missing out on it for so long.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I use to live walking distance to this place and I went once a week! I have tried almost all of the pasties and they are super delicious. My all time favorite is the Portobello Chicken one! I miss this place the service is great and the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place!  We come here at least once a month and have been for the past 7 years.  Parking can be a bit crazy on the weekends, but get there early and it's usually not a problem.  They've added on quite a bit, offering more seating options both indoors and outdoors.  
  
I usually order off of their vegetarian menu, but they do have vegan options as well, while my carnivorous family will order off of the regular menu.  The hibiscus tea is our favorite, and they have a good selection of beers, which my picky husband enjoys.  Pasties run around $9 each, give or take a buck.  We usually get the veggie oggie, the veggie pesto chicken, the royale with cheese, the italian,  the mexican, and the chicken greek (either veggie or regular), and the chicken pot pie, and non-pasty options like the greek salad or the garlic oven chips or mashed potatoes.  I like the option of getting one half-baked so you can take it home and enjoy (plus it's cheaper!).  Oh, and the dessert pasties......YUM!  Peanut butter and jelly is our favorite, but we will get the apple caramel if the mood strikes us.  The strawberry pavlova is awesome as well.  I have not had a bad meal here...ever.   

Depending on what day you go and where you sit (indoor vs. outdoor) service can be slow, but it's so worth it for the delicious food you get!"}
{"text":"I have been to 3 different locations, and really loved this place. So much so that a family member sent me 12 pasties as a gift. Today I was eating a Rosemary Chicken pasty that was sent and saw this inside it. I wasn't expecting some sort of plastic wrapping in my food. Not appetizing at all."}
{"text":"Terrific vegan food and great beer-woohoo! Just wish it were bigger so I could sit down and enjoy the food and drink more quickly!"}
{"text":"Okay, I should start by admitting I was a bit skeptical. I mean, I know everyone raves about the things, but they just sound a bit odd. But Jim went and couldn't stop thinking about it. I guess we've been married long enough that if he tells me I'll like something, I believe him.

So we took our youngest and headed over there with the intention of getting two pasties and an order of chips. Abby chose the Royale (cheeseburger). I was flummoxed. I couldn't decide between the Mexican, Rosemary Chicken or Salmon. The server helped me out and I ordered salmon. Everything was amazing. The best thing about it was that this doesn't seem to be one of those places where you order the same thing every time. I can't wait to try a wide variety of pasties.

We sat along the bar by the kitchen and chatted with the chefs, demanding to know what each pasty was as they cut it open and we could see inside. They were charming, full of information and never acted put-upon. The service was also terrific. I'd go back in a heartbeat.

The one caution I'd offer is that everything is served \"as is\" - you can't make any changes if you, say, don't like mushrooms or what-have-you.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to lunch and my order was left out and someone else with us had a duplicate of their order, which was the chicken pot pie. The server was more upset about it than anyone else. She offered me a couple of choices that I could start with and still be able to eat with my family. She brought me a Greek salad, which, was huge and delicious! When my order came out our server said there was no charge for the Greek salad or my lunch and she asked if one of us at the table would please take the extra pasty home,which was also given to us at no charge! 
Bottom line, great food, great prices and fantastic customer service!"}
{"text":"A coworker of mine who was in town from Sacramento and I went here for dinner last night.  I had a vegetable vindaloo pasty (one of the 2 vegan pasties they offered that day).  It was amazing!  The spices had just the right punch.  I love the atmosphere here with the soft lighting and candles...it's a bit like an old pub almost.  They have regular tables and then these long tables with something like a church-style bench on either side.  Fun place with great food!"}
{"text":"Cornish pasty company is a staple of the area and is a fantastic spot for both food and drinks. The pasties that they make in house are fantastic and very fairly priced. The waitstaff and bartenders are always attentive and friendly. The atmosphere at this location is a lot of fun with candles are all around. This specific location is a little bit more romantic feeling than the other location on University."}
{"text":"Jesus blessed holy hot pocket of awesomeness, that is the best way to describe what there Pastys are. These things are amazing. Been coming here for years and have every Pasty at least twice. Always difficult to choose which one im going to go with. I like the new upgrades over the last couple years. Bigger bar area. But it's the food that keeps me coming back. If you have never had a Pasty, this is the place to go. I've never taken anyone there and they not be amazed. Give the hibiscus tea a try also. LOVE that they are now delivering Pastys. Only thing i wish was that they had a breakfast pasty. But that's just me. 
Best advice...GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here for years...if anything the food has gotten better!  My pasty is a work of art!"}
{"text":"So yummy!  I don't think you could go wrong with anything on their menu.  You definitely have to try it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is dark, and drip candles flowing down Jameson bottles, light your table. Lots of hipsters, but mostly just relaxed, chill people. The booths are set up as long tables, so you may end up making new friends, if your party is not 12 or more. The bar is usually packed out, and during the cooler months, expect the patio to be the same. 

I haven't had a pasty I didn't like, yet. The crusts are thick but flaky. My favorite, by far, is the Spicy Cajun Chicken. The sauce really makes it and adds to the heat! The desserts look delicious, but I am perpetually on a diet, so I only tease myself. If I were to choose one to cheat with, it would definitely be the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Looks gooey sweet!

Great selection of beers and a full bar. Go early to avoid crowds."}
{"text":"Group of 7 women.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our pasties.   Every dish was tasty and fully met expectations.  The Boston waiter was excellent."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch again today. The service was spot on and the food was fabulous. I ordered the Carne Avada and I am in LOVE. My mom had the Greek Chicken which was really good too. I sat at the bar and the kitchen staff is very entertaining. See you soon my little pockets of heaven..."}
{"text":"I had heard great things and saw lots of 5 star yelps but I was not impressed. 

The time we were there, there was either a hipster, wanna-be convention in town or there is a community college nearby. Well the people who work here certainly think they are cool. 

It is open until 12Midnight and I would be curious what the crowd is like then. The floor is set up like a dining hall, not a bar (no real mingling space, long German style tables on a tightly packed floor) [might get rowdy in a good way]. The selection on draft beers was mildly impressive but they were out of the German Lager I wanted....but Guinness will do. The food was somewhat pricey and my dish, Veggie Rosemary Chicken, was bland. 

People seemed festive but I think I will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, great atmosphere, great music, and great beer! I love the pilgrim pasty, so good. If you have not been you should definitely go!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.  If i was rich, i would buy this place and move in so i don't have far to go to eat.  I have had most of the menu.  I have NEVER been unhappy with anything, well except they were out 1 time of my favorite beer.  The tandoori wings are bomb.  The Cajun Pasty is amazballs."}
{"text":"I am in love with Cornish Pasty Co. The servers are friendly and the food is yummy.  Yup, that's right.  Yummy.  Everything has that made-from-scratch feel (cause it is).  I like the Greek salad (amazing pesto vinaigrette) and chicken pesto pasty best.  For you non pesto-junkies there's a full menu of delicious pasties to select from.  

FYI: Save room for dessert! Just saying."}
{"text":"O..M..G... 

This place is SO GOOD! And I love the atmosphere...it's just very cool, chilled and laid back. I love the church pew bench seating and the doors as tables. The service staff was great, fast and friendly. The place was so clean and just bright and airy. I would love to come back for their happy hour sometime and try all their imports. Loved all the historical facts in the menu. Just an all around cool place. 

As for the food...delish. My husband and I split The Italian and The Bangers and Mash. First off the crust on both was amazing. What a great flavor, and crispy yet soft at the same time. 

The Italian was pretty good for being in a British place. If you're looking for a Stromboli or calzone, stick with La Famiglia or Old Chicago, but for the most part, it was pretty damn tasty. Loved the roasted tomatoes on it. 

The Bangers and Mash..well I had my half of that second, and I'm so glad I did. I'm still savoring the delicious red wine gravy that you pour over the pasty. And I'm always a mashed potato fan. The sausage had an excellent flavor and the whole thing just went together nicely. Yum...SO GOOD. 

I can't wait to back and try more! 

Oh and a really cool feature...the waitress noticed my husband was on his lunch hour and we were sort of hurried, so she gave us a menu and said next time we come to order ahead and they'd have them ready when we got in. I love that kind of service. 

Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"A dining experience that is well worth the $$ dollar sign ratings for this place. Absolutely everything here is delicious and there's so many different choices"}
{"text":"Second time at one of their restaurants
 The Chicken pot pie and Mexican are great!
The meatball was not good at all. Tasted old, couldnt eat it. 
Service is great.  Vanessa is a gim!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over a year with friends and the service has always been friendly (understandably a bit slower on the food delivery when it gets busy). The food is always top notch and we have yet to get anything here that we don't like...aside from mixed drinks, but there's enough on tap to not worry about that."}
{"text":"Ordered the bangers & mash with pork sausage, mashed potatoes & grilled onions. It was all baked in a  moist flakey crust accompanied by a red wine gravy. All the flavors paired well with each other & very well balanced. At first sight the pastry looked small in size but they cut them in half & one half is a good portion for a big guy like me. I went together with a bunch of colleagues & they all love their orders too. This is a must try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Amazing, the staff was beyond helpful and friendly! I got the Chicken Greek, it was fresh out of the oven and so delectable. Will definitely be back to try other Pasty's!"}
{"text":"Me and my grandpa always come here for the original one. Its super good. We always debate if you should use ketchup or gravy with your food. Everything here is pretty good. 4 stars because it is usually packed but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm still a huge fan of the food, but the last time I went here the service was bad. I was introducing friends to the restaurant, and it was embarrassing. Here are the bad points:
-My friend asked if they had a kids menu. The answer? The server barely looked at her, briskly said no, and quickly walked away. I really don't care if they don't have a kids menu, but I could think of a few nicer responses. 
-Our water glasses were rarely refilled. We're in AZ. It was about 100 that day, and we were sitting outside. 
-The server said they don't split checks. Weird. They've done it other times I've been there. Plus, we were perfectly split into our groups, so why is this difficult? 
-The general attitude of our server was very poor, like we were a bad interruption in his day."}
{"text":"Good service, cool atmosphere, and most importantly, great food! Love this place. My go to is the Pilgrim. It's like thanksgiving dinner in each bite! The serving size is pretty big for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Teenage son and I were in town for some shopping, and we stopped here for lunch.  We LOVED it.  The cool darkness was appreciated after driving around in the hot sun, and the metal menus and decor was cool.  Teenage son (the bottomless pit) had the Oggie and I had the cottage pie.  We split an order of chips, but it turns out they weren't needed.  Teenage son was full after 1/2 of his pasty, and that almost never happens.  Both pasties were delicious and flavorful, and filling without being heavy.  The chips were about the best we've ever had.  The waitress was pleasant, helpful and kept our water glasses filled.  She even sent us off with water cups to go.  

We'll definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I love this place... The salmon ceasar salad,bangers n mash pasty,royale with cheese pasty and the tropical tea have all been perfect and delicious. I will be back again and again. The waitstaff is good... young hipster set but helpful without being hovery. Try the Caramel banan dessert... simple but super rich.. must be shared! its huge."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and it was so good!! The menu was simple and they had a good variety to choose from. Definitely try the Tandoori Wings!! They were cooked just right, with amazing flavor! Also the Greek Chicken Pasty was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Victoria was great! I loved my chicken pot pie pasty and
The egg wrapped in sausage and deep fried was amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! We came in for dinner, right before 7 PM - half of the menu was \"sold out\" - really!? Also, why does almost everything comes with mushrooms!? Annnndddd you can't remove anything out because they are pre-made. Now I'm here with my whole family, with almost no options. Eating a shitty pasty that I didn't want."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, atmosphere, and booze!"}
{"text":"I had their Reuben, and it was juicy, tender, and unique. I will definitely come back for more and possibly try their dessert next time."}
{"text":"Cool place. Very busy, get their early.  Still looking for my favorite pasty. Got the chocolate bread desert, it was GREAT! Will go their again!"}
{"text":"I've tired the Shepard's and cottage pie, bangers and mash, chicken tikka (spicy!), lamb vindaloo (spicy!), and chicken pot pie. Every single one is solid. I need to broaden my horizons and try their other ones- but the ones I have tried are JUST SO GOOD. You can't go wrong here. Everything is delicious and wonderful. Also, their soups are AMAZING and their bread is the BEST. Service is consistently fast and friendly. If you haven't been here, you're missing out. If I lived walking distance I would get so fat eating here. Their food is too good!! Their beer selection is solid as well, and I have yet to be disappointed by their wine. It's a really good thing I don't live too close by. I would be so happy, but I would get gigantic."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was thrilled with the vast amount of vegetarian options. The staff is friendly, the beers are good, the food is delicious and different, and the decor is awesome. If you're looking to go somewhere different and want to try something new, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food was great, as was the atmosphere and beer selection. The reason this place for a mere three stars from me is because in the middle of July, they apparently forgot to turn on the a/c. Yuk."}
{"text":"I'll tell you, this place is one of my guilty pleasures.  It's really, really good.  But I'm torn between loving the food and being embarrassed to be there.  You see, the trendy douche-bag factor is really high.  I mean really high.  It is a testament to just how good the food is that I keep going there to eat.  And the pasties are worth it.  Trust this fat chick, I know good food.  My fave is the Oggie, which is the original classic, filled with deliciousness.  The husband likes the bangers & mash.  They offer a wide variety of pasties on the menu, something for everyone.  Are you in the mood for Thanksgiving dinner, they put it in a pasty and serve it up.  Tikka masala curry? Italian pizza? Vegetarian? They have a pasty for every craving you have.  Even desert.  I want to try a desert pasty sometime, but I'm always too stuffed.  Another option is the ploughman's plate, an appetizer assortment of cheese, fruit, bread and other goodies.  It's a bit expensive, but quality and portion are commensurate with the price.  As I've said before, I don't balk at paying fair market price for quality.  Did I mention the extensive beer list? They've got that too.  Give this place a try.  I guarantee you'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Who has been hiding this place from me. Right in my old old neighborhood. Down the street from my high school. Obviously this place wasn't here when I lived in this area way back in the day. Otherwise I would really have kicked myself.
My girlfriend introduced me to this place and she is the best for bring me here. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere is great. A little dark but it works. The whole place is lit with real candles. They actually come around and replace them when they get low. Very cool.
Great beer selection too. Some I have never even heard of but want to try. I didn't know what to get so the waitress got me a sample of a Scottish ale it was good so I got a pint. I want to come back and try the rest.
We also got the oven baked chips with garlic and jalapeno. Chips = fries people come on get with it. They were awesome. Some of the best fries I have ever had. Although I will say the jalapenos didn't quite make sense. I like jalapenos don't get me wrong but they were just chopped up on top. When you picked up a fry they fell off. If you managed to get a few to stick they would come off when you dipped it in the sauce. You can bypass the sauce and just eat one but they didn't really add anything. If they were baked into to the chips that might be better. Still very good regardless.
Now on to the Pasties. The reason you came here and the name of the place. I have never had a pasty before but from looking at the menu you can put pretty much anything you want inside of one. They have an Italian one, cheesesteak one, Greek one, a few Mexican flavored ones and so on and so on. You name it it was in a pasty. I finally decided on the spicy chicken asagio one with some advice from my girlfriend who has been here before. Sure it takes awhile for the food to come out but they are making it when you order it. By the time you sip on your drinks and munch on those fantastic chips your food comes out so it works out. So good. Flavor was perfect. Everything all crammed in there but all working together. The dipping sauces they give you with it work perfectly. They vary depending on which pasty you order. Don't be shy pick it up with your hand and munch away. No shame in it. That is really how you are supposed to eat them anyway.
I can't wait to come back and try the other great pasties. I have to say I might be addicted. So good and such a great place."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
- Lots of great, tasty pasty choices with the lamb and mint being my favo(u)rite.
- Large portion sizes.
- Nice mix of 80s rock, new wave, and punk tunes.

THE BAD:
- Everything was a bit over salted.
- No actual fried chips (french fries).  The baked chips weren't bad for being baked but don't compare to real chips, and detract from the whole idea of a Cornish place.
- Almost $10 for a pasty seems a bit steep.

THE UGLY:
- No malt vinegar, only balsamic. Epic fail!  Brits would be appalled.
- Out of the first two beers we asked for due to claimed problems with the kegs.  Weak sauce."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Shared the Balsamic Portobello and Vegetarian \"Chicken\" Tikka pastries with my vegetarian English friend - SO delicious!  She said it wasn't too authentic (since pastys are usually just 1 flavor of meat or something haha) but the concept and selection was even better than what she had had in England!

It's basically a giant hand-held [chicken[ pot pie/calzone with yummier crust.  It took a really long time to get the food out - but waiter was really friendly and their English cider was yum and strong!  

They have Wi-Fi but I never could get the correct password...  Also there's only one toilet per restroom which seems weird to me since there's a huge bar inside the restaurant...where do all the drunk bladders go!?

Would definitely go again if I'm ever randomly in Mesa :)"}
{"text":"Not a huge pasty fan. Kind of bland for my taiste however, drink are good but it takes a while. This place is always packed. My gf had her birthday here and it was accomodating but again the waiting smh... I think staff should be upped on busy days. Staffing is important on how busy this place gets. Would I choose to go here? No thanks... If my gf wants to of course but I'd rather order for pick up."}
{"text":"The service could've been better, but the food and timeliness that we got it was great.  Each of my friends got something different and we all had a try of the Tikki Masala Pasty, Rosemary Steak Pasty, and Original Pasty. The Tikki Masala has a bit of spice to it that I was not up for at the moment, but both of the other dishes were very flavorful and so filling! The atmosphere is great too! Such a cool place!"}
{"text":"My aunt was excited to take us here for her birthday. Yup, take us out for HER birthday. She said she want us to try this place because it has authentic British food and if we don't like it, we can go somewhere else... ??? She said theres two location and she always go to the one in Tempe but she yelped and saw that the Mesa location isn't as packed as the one in Tempe. 

Upon arrival, I realized I've eaten here once before. Nothing too crazy but not bad either [: I just remembered that their fries are called 'chips' instead. 

We were lucky and got seated right away for a party of 8. Of course we ordered the chips, some with garlic and some without and each of us got a different pasty to try. There was just so much options I couldnt pick from, so I asked the waitress which ones were her favorite and I settled for the Salmon one. Eh..

Chips with and without garlic were a bit on the salty side.

Salmon pasty- a bit too fishy

Italian pasty - my favorite! If I would have ordered this, maybe I would like this place more.

Cajun chicken - my second favorite, even got one to go for my mom ;]

Chicken alfredo - I felt like the chicken were a bit on the dry side.

Hamburger pasty - Makes great leftover! Microwaved and eaten with A1 steak sauce !

I don't remember the names of the other ones but my sister got a mexicanish flavor and I didnt even bother to try because I dont really like that flavour. 

BUT the thing that made our night was the dessert!!! If you come here, make sure you leave room for some dessert pasty!

Of course we were all full but my aunt gave glowing reviews about the dessert and we decided to try out some. Unfortunately because of the monsoon season in Arizona right now which makes it more humid (is that possible???), there were no strawberry meringes, so we stuck with the apple pasty and the PBJ with banana pasty.

Oh my, the apple was my favorite of the two because of the caramel sauce they filled it with. Heaven in your mouth. The PBJ was not bad either. I just wish they put more banana in it because the bites with the banana were the best. They have actual pieces of peanuts in there also which gave it a nice crunch. 

All in all, I dont mind eating here again."}
{"text":"Vegan pasty this, vegan pasty that! This a crazy vegan friendly place. No need to list all the options, just know you have plenty. Call ahead to confirm vegan pasty selection and availability for the day. Happy eating vegan friends!"}
{"text":"This place is great, too bad it's so far from me.  The restaurant is very english pub like.  With cool bench seating, a big patio, and a big counter to sit down and enjoy your pasty.  They are always playing an eclectic mix of music that I think adds to the charm.  The staff are really nice and check on you to make sure you have enough to drink and are enjoying yourself.  They get extra bonus points for having a huge selection of vegetarian and vegan pasty. Who doesn't want a savory turnover with delicious fillings? I have really enjoyed lunch here the few times I have gone.  I'll be bringing some friends with me next time.  Keep up the good work.

Try:
- Eggplant Parm
- Oggie
- Greek"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I visited you location in November last year. It stayed on my mind while moving from Michigan to Arizona. Awesome food."}
{"text":"Cornish - as in straight from Cornwall, England. Having lived several years in that fine country, my dad actually proclaimed his pasty here the \"Best he'd ever had\". These are genuine English comfort foods with amazing twists on the flavors nestled inside each handmade pastry (You can see them being made from the wrap-around bar by the pool tables). Vegan and Vegetarian options ensure everyone in your crowd can find something delicious to eat. My current favorite item is actually the salmon caesar salad. What kind of glaze is happening on that salmon anyway?? Delicious. My neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!!  Every single item we've tried on the menu has been outstanding - and my friends and I have tried them all.  My favorite meal there is to start with the Tomato Soup (best I've ever had), then the Peppered Steak Pasty (order extra sauce...trust me) and for dessert, the Chocolate Bread & Butter Pudding.  For the love of god, do not skip dessert.  Take half your pasty home (yummy the next day) and eat dessert.  

Awesome, fun staff and the service is always excellent.  Friday nights are packed, so save your visit for a weekday night - or lunch.  

One change I'd make?  Turn the music down.  It is a restaurant, not a night club.  Hard to hear the person you are sitting right next to.

They just opened a new location down the street from my office...more yummy lunches for me!"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment as a treat to a good friend on her birthday and was very pleased.
Loved the atmosphere,food was great and amazing beer selection. 
Very affordable and friendly knowledgeable staff..."}
{"text":"The pasties are good sometimes bland but that's why they give sauce with it. I wish it came with a side."}
{"text":"Rock it!  Great food, huge portions and an enormous outdoor patio.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I had read positive reviews of this unpretentious restaurant for a year before steering their way on a whim around my birthday. I was not disappointed. Great food, drink, and service. I had potato leek soup, bread, curried potatoes, and a lamb mint pastie. I chose a pint of 1664 followed by a Guinness, both fresh on tap. I liked the candles in bottles with heavy wax drippings . . . Except. Except the proprietors chose vodka bottles with the hammer and  sickle. No big deal if you approve of the worst mass murderers in history.  If it is supposed to be daring or chic, try swastika festooned decor; same reality."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. This place really isn't doing anything to convince me that British food isn't all fried or boiled, but man this was delicious. I had the Oggie with the red wine gravy. Great beer selection as well with lots of stuff you don't usually see on tap. 

My mom and I came at an off-time, but I could see this place getting pretty packed and crowded during a normal eating time. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I dont know if its the quality of the food, the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here, but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co. know what the hell they're doing! This place is awesome and if you've never been...get off your ass and check it out!

Growing up in Michigan, the pasty is somewhat of a local food (by way of English immigrants). If you're from northern Michigan, the pasty is nothing new to you. However, the pasties we grew up with are not the pasties they serve here. Dean has taken the idea of the traditional pasty and put a totally high end, almost gourmet twist into the mix. Look for southwestern and Greek flavors as well as traditional English and Italian pasties. The Oggie or O.G. is awesome. Simple, traditional and good. 

The staff is friendly, helpful and colorful! Check out the juke box witch contains mostly, if not all British bands. Just another nice touch.

Ahhh a Pasty and a Pint! Life is good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H. and Robyn N. and I had the chipotle chicken pasty and it was awesome. The garlic fries were good but not like the pasty. the next time I go there I will try a different pasty with a dessert. Dont get me wrong though the fries are good but I will need the room for dessert because they have hot sticky pudding and I was to full to try it. So I am looking forward to returning to this place.The pasties are great!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. We have been here a couple of times now and have not been disappointed. Excellent selection of beer on tap and of course excellent pastys!! We always have the Scotch egg, one of our favorites. Not too much sausage and cooked to perfection. Some places tend to over do it and you end up with a dry ball of \"stuff\". Not here. Love them.
Had the wings on a previous visit and love them as well. I eat a lot of wings and these are quite good. Again, not over cooked like a lot of places, or over sauced. 
As to the pastys we love them. My wife had the pot pie and I had the spicy Asiago chicken. Delightful. Crust was light and flaky and the fillings full of flavor. I really want to try them all.
I don't know about the other locations, hopefully they are as good as this one."}
{"text":"GREAT EXPERIENCE! Our first time here was a couple of weeks ago and it was a unique and delicious dining experience. We sat at the counter and were able to watch them prepare food. The service was great! There are so many pastry choices. I can't wait to go back and try more. They have the best homemade fries I have ever had, and a great beer selection. I can't wait to bring family and friends here!"}
{"text":"All time favorite, been coming since they opened. Its great as it's at the end of our street across Dobson Rd. My favorites are the carne adovado (extra sour cream) has a great spice, taste of Mexico! The pilgrim is great, tastes like thanksgiving, I probably order this the most (extra cranberry sauce), the chicken tiki masala is your taste of India and delicious. Love the royal w cheese when I'm wanting a cheeseburger. What we do most if the time is order it half baked and cook the rest at home, with 4 kids it's not very kid friendly (although they are nice to the kids). The expansion looks great and it's a cool place to hang at. For dessert get the banoffee!! Best hands down"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  They have great beers on tap and excellent food.  What more could you ask for?

On my most recent trip I had the Cajun chicken pasty again but with oven chips.  The oven chips were fabulous with garlic.  The pasty was exploding with flavor.  The crust was flaky and delicious.  The filling was very delicious.  I wish we had something similar back in St. Louis as it would be a great hit.  

Since my last review they have doubled in size.  The new space looks great!  If you have never been here, I highly recommend checking this place out.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! What a surprise! By the name thought we were stopping by a lovely little English shop for tea and pasties with my elderly Mum and her friend.

So good! You gotta go!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I really felt like I was taking a risk going there for lunch.

First off, I heard a lot of negative things: long lunch, slow service, dirty place, smells when you walk in, dingy servers and food preppers.. though I don't recall any \"food sucks\" comments, which is exactly why I took the \"risk\" of having lunch there.

My comments on the so-called negative things others pointed out:
-long lunch/slow service: Yes, this was not a short lunch .. but it was also not a long lunch.  Food took a bit long but we also were expecting 'custom-baked' pasty.  Plus our server was quick enough to bring us drinks and my soup order, etc to hold us over;  Our server guy was outstanding - friendly in a genuine way, prompt, kept checking on us, and had very good customer service skills (I'll get to that later).
-dirty place: Yes, as I mentioned, it needs a good cleaning (those pew cushions were nasty and the wax should be scraped off and menus cleaned up)
-smells: Yes, but we deduced it was the cabbage.
-dingy servers/food preppers: It's an 'alternative' type of staff.. I myself am not that alternative, but I have no issues if my servers look like Cheba Hut or Pita Jungle employees :) As long as they are clean with handling my food (at least, that I notice).  I did note, however one of the food preppers talking on his cell phone while he was handling food.. I thought that was gross (god knows where cell phones hang out and all the dingy dialing we do).

OK, so now to the food:
I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie - both were delicious!  I was super impressed with the breadth of the pasty 'stuffings' and got very excited to see they had over 40 options!  I want to go back and try them all.  The yogurt served with my tikka was perfect.. the chicken was plentiful and well seasoned.  Essentially, their fillings are both inventive, somewhat unique and really entice me to come back.  Plus, I appreciated that their pastys are a good size and that it is not a dough-overwhelmed dish (meaning the crust is perfectly thinly sized and not like a calzone).

Bottome line:
Yes, there is a distinctly strong smell when you walk in ...yes, the pews had dirty cushions on them.. the candle wax was all over the table/menus, the menus had other grime on there.. honestly this place REALLY needs to quit the slacking and clean this place up... BUT, their pastys were yummy and their service was excellent - 2 major players in making me want to come back.

Okay, so now to the note about customer service:
I found a piece of red thick rubber-band (~1\" long) in my soup .. we could only assume, due to it's color and size, it was the ones used to bunch up produce (It was a leek-potato, stilton soup).  Yeah, not excited about that find, but I did appreciate that when I mentioned it to our server, he swiftly took it away (offered me a new one) and immediately apologized and said it was 'on the house'.  THAT is fixing a problem immediately and correctly - kudos for him for a great response and showing good customer service.  I can understand that 'shit happens' sometimes but it's the aftermath of how you treat the customer that found the rubber band in their soup that matters.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else it seems, the Cornish Pasty Company came as a suggestion from a friend, I have been meaning to try it out for a while.

First of all the decor was awesome. The church pews, industrial purse hooks, tile, candle wax candles and large photos of English industrial workers really set the mood. The servers were relaxed, helpful and friendly. The music wasn't what you normally hear in a restaurant, but I LIKED that about it. 

The drink selection is very good I think, lots of neat import beers and they'll do a taster sample if you want one. I love ciders, so I ordered the Strongbow, it was a bit on the warm side, but nothing to be too upset about.

I'm not a foodie by any means, I'm rather bland when it comes to trying new things, so I stuck with a \"safe\" menu item, Chicken Pot Pie. It was pretty good, although I was hoping for more of a cream based sauce, but that's a personal preference thing I think. 

We also ordered the Caramel Apple dessert pastry. That was yummy! But it was odd that they served it with chocolate chip ice cream instead of vanilla as mentioned on the menu, perhaps they were out? 

Anyhow, I would recommend the Cornish Pasty Company to anyone looking for something new, a little different and perhaps an tasty adventure of sorts."}
{"text":"This place always has exceptional food no matter what you order but you must not be in a hurry. It will take quite some time to get your order in and have it prepared. However the atmosphere is always great and they have a great selection of drinks to pass the time. This place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food...great menu, especially for those of us who don't eat pork, beef, or poultry.  We had the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) and the Spicy Asiago Chicken, both using subsitute chicken from the vegetarian section of the menu.  
The waiter, talked us into a side of chips.  We got them delivered (later to be removed from the bill), as we were finishing the pasties (pronounced with a soft a by the way...).  So, the waiter took responsibility after telling us 3 times that it would be \"just a minute.\"
We'll go back, and recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Cornish Pasty, please set aside your computer, get into your car, and drive to one right this very moment. 

It is so unlike anywhere else around, and yet exactly what I wish all restaurants would try to be. 

My first Cornish Pasty visit was to the original Tempe location when it was a long narrow hallway with a bar and 2 tops crammed into it. I remember loving the food and wishing for a bit more comfort. We waited impatiently for the \"new\" location to open at Dobson and Guadalupe and immediately made it our regular place as it was larger and easier to get to. 

Cornish Pasty Co is smart, as they not only expand to additional locations but also grow their existing locations. They've extended their Tempe location significantly since my first visit, and the Mesa location first added a beautiful patio and then a huge addition that expanded the dining room, added a bar, and made the patio even larger. 

Their patio is definitely a great place to dine, with high backed booths that can easily seat 6 and even as many as 8 if you're willing to get cozy. It is a bit quieter than the indoor seating area, which makes it ideal for groups or couples that might want to have an easier time making conversation. I also love that the way it has been built creates ambiance within the patio itself and blocks the view of the parking lot. They have fans and misters, but unfortunately AZ is just too darn hot to allow you to enjoy it during the summer months. 

The indoor seating is extensive and varied, and the décor is awesome! Most/all of the furniture is handmade or reclaimed/repurposed. They are the first place I saw using old doors as tabletops and church pews for benches (these tables are huge and easily seat 8 people, which is nice when you're with a big group) The color scheme is unique - dark woods with a lot of black paint, white walls, melted wax candles, and black and white photos of miners on the walls (pasties were historically used as lunches for miners in Europe) There is a \"drinkin'\" bar on one side of the dining room and a bar top looking into the kitchen on the other side. 

On my most recent visit, they were pretty full and we were given the option of sitting up at the kitchen bar. I hadn't sat up there before and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was! They have an elevated platform running beneath the bar which makes it easy for shorter people (like me) to clamber up unto the barstool without too much difficulty. They also had purse-hooks (all high tables should have these) in the form of carabiners that clip onto your purse strap - awesome!

I will say that sitting up by the kitchen in the middle of summer is a bit warmer than the surrounding seating... I initially worried I was going to regret our seating choice but our lovely server, Stephanie, showed up quickly to take our order and provided giant glasses of ice cold sodas and tea, then kept 'em coming. Stephanie was awesome and provided a few great suggestions (mixing two of the sauces for my husband's Meat and Cheese Pasty, for example) - she was prompt and fun. Sitting up at the counter had the added benefit of being able to watch the magic of the kitchen unfold - their chefs WORK! It was fun to see and they all seemed to be having a pretty good time with one another - I appreciated seeing how the team worked well togdether and the manager was bantery and encouraging to all of the staff.

The food... so good! Seriously have never had anything that isn't good. My go-to pasty is the Porky (although it is embarassing to order... kinda like \"Moon over My Hammy\" at Dennys) - it is closest to the types of pasties I grew up eating in the midwest - Pork, potatoes, onion, red wine gravy - wrapped up in a delicious crust. The portion size is perfect; if you're hungry, it'll fill you up, and if you're not so hungry, you eat one half and take the other to reheat later. Either way you win. I've also enjoyed the Italian, and my husband recently got the Meat and cheese that was amazing with a mix of Chipotle and Barbeque sauces (on our server's recommendation) 

That said, one day a few years ago I went rogue and ordered soup instead of a pasty (WHAT?) Specifically, the Potato, Leek, Stilton Soup. It is incredible, you guys. Perfect, hearty, and warm during the winter but also so good that I order it even though it is 112 degrees outside. It also comes with generous pieces of homemade bread perfect for dipping or slathering with tasty butter. Now I get it every. freaking. time. and I miss out on the pasties because I just can't help it. 

I've also had their Wings (delicious - sweet with a little bit of spice) and their chips (big steak-fries that do not typically come out earlier than the rest of the food) 

We've had desserts before but it has been a really long time. I remember liking the fruit Pavlova as well as the Banoffee tart,"}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Arizona from the bay area and have become somewhat of a food snob.  Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, Piedmont... they all had so many amazing restaurants to offer.  Cornish Pasties could be uprooted and planted smack dab in any one of the aforementioned cities (or any other in Northern California for that matter) and they would blow the competition away.

Since moving home, I've eaten and/or had drinks here about a half a dozen times.  That's about once a week.  They have salads, pasties, and desserts that are to die for!  I love the vegetarian cottage pie with whatever that amazeballs sauce on the side is as well as the banana/whip cream dessert (the name is slipping my mind at the moment).  The first time I visited Pasties, my friend and I split the pasta salad.  It was big enough to share and so delicious!  

Do not visit Cornish Pasties if you are in a rush.  Remember the phrase, \"good things come to those that wait?\"  You will need to keep it in mind here.  They are baking thick ass pastries for cheese and rice's sake.  Calm down and wait for one of the best culinary moments of your life.

DO come here if you'd like to receive attentive and fun service!  Every time we've come in, we've received some of the most laid back yet knowledgeable service the valley has to offer.

Bottom Line... a must try!  Thanks for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"Woke up on Saturday and decided I needed to try something new that I have never had before. So I turned to the fine Yelpers I have come to know and love and found Cornish Pasty with the highest reviews in Mesa. Off I went having no clue what I was in for and never having had \"British\" food. 

I have now found my new favorite obsession!!! We ordered two Pasty to share... the italian and the spicy chicken asagio. Both were my favorite! They were stuffed with lots of ingredients and came with sauces and were very tasty. We also got the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno. I think these are the best \"chips\" I have had anywhere hands down. We wanted more but were stuffed! However, not too stuffed to go for dessert. We shared the banana/carmel/graham cracker crust/whip cream pie. And wanted to lick the plate clean and fought like 2 year olds over the last bite! While it was large enough for two people and probably three people, it was so good that I think next time we will start with dessert!

Love the atmosphere here as well. Really unique and we don't have much around Mesa that really transports you to another place. I can't wait to go back and have found my new obsession!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 3 stars but you will understand why I did when you have read this review. I ordered their meat and cheese pasty and it was pretty good. I have been to England multiple times and have never enjoyed the food, so I was pleasantly surprised when I actually liked this British cuisine here in the states. I also ordered the peanut butter and jelly pasty for desert and it was \"ok\". I thought it was going to be amazing but I was a bit disappointed. Ok now for the interesting part. I'll set the mood. Sunday 8:30pm and starving. We sit ourselves at the bar. There were very few customers in the restaurant so we thought we would enjoy the ambiance at the bar.....WRONG! Our server was very nice and brought me my favorite import! But all the rest of the cooks/servers/staff were just ridiculous. They were having a fun time at work at the expense of the customer. I was trying to have a conversation with my bf and I literally could not hear him because the guys in the kitchen were SO LOUD. They were singing (off key) yelling at each other, horsing around open flames, and just being immature obnoxious boys. I'm not sure how old any of them are but my guess would have been 12. Our quiet evening out was pretty much ruined. I could tell that some of the other servers we uncomfortable with the obnoxious behavior but were unwilling to speak up. I'm not sure if there was a manager on duty, but I guarantee the behavior I witnessed would have not been tolerated. My suggestion to management.... have a manager on staff at all times, or else you will lose customers. The staff you hired is clearly not able to work without supervision. If anyone would like very specific details please email me."}
{"text":"Not as atmospheric as the original location, this is a better spot if you want to introduce the family to the joys of humble English cuisine. 
You cannot go wrong with the original Oggie (I always take a couple of the par-baked to go because I live 2.5 hours from here) but the lamb and mint is great too."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley. Try the tandoori wings, and the roast beef sarny."}
{"text":"You shouldn't leave a restaurant feeling upset and humiliated.  But we did!

Earlier tonight, my son jokingly said that he wanted British food for dinner.  Having heard the stories of our adventures in England and just how bad the food was there, this is a bit of a running joke in our house.  But then I thought of all of the amazing reviews about this place on Yelp, and how we thought it might become a regular haunt for us.

So we hopped in the car with our two kids and headed out.

After parking, we walked up to the restaurant, where 3 people were sitting below the entry door and patio.  We went up to the door and looked around, not quite sure where to go.  There was no staff, and no obvious stand with a hostess, but I saw two empty big booths outside on the patio.  So I left my husband and two kids standing around by the door outside while I went inside.  I was greeted by the side of a bar.  Still no staff or obvious hostessing area.  I walked across the restaurant and saw a couple of empty tables, another empty table outside, and a lot of space up at the bar.  The only staff were standing at the kitchen bar area, and one girl was loading up with plates.  Still no obvious hostess.  I told the girl that we were new and had never been there before, and asked if we just seat ourselves.  She said \"Yeah\".  I said \"Great, we'll sit outside then.  Will somebody know to come serve us?\"  Again--affirmative.

So I went back outside and told my husband we could sit down.  At this point, one of the two booths had been taken and so we seated ourselves at the other.  My husband grabbed menus and we were browsing the menus.  The server came and greeted us, and half way through his greeting he just walked away over by where we entered.  I saw one of the people who'd been sitting by the door pointing over at us.

The server came back and told us that there was a waiting list (the three people by the door were now five).  He apologized, but we knew we were being ejected from our table.  The people at the table next to us were staring, and I was feeling guilty and humiliated that we had apparently stolen someone's table.

Feeling extremely uncomfortable after both the lack of any greeting and having to track down staff AND their lack of communication, plus having other customers' eyes on us and obviously having angered the people waiting, we opted to leave.  I was feeling completely humiliated and ended up being upset for quite a while.

Sooo.. they may have great food, but I really have no desire to go back.  Hopefully they can work on greeting customers and their communication issues.  Obviously it wasn't meant to be a new regular joint for us."}
{"text":"Excellent pasties.  Both the Bangers & Mash and Red Curry Chicken Tikka Masala pasties were very tasty.  Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Came in early on a Monday afternoon. They have a good beer selection. We ordered wings which turned out awesome they had lots of sauce on them and oven chips with garlic and jalapeño. I ordered the pilgrim pasty and it turned out great. All the food tasted wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is unsurpassed regarding great service, impressive draught beer selection, food, music selection...it's so HIP I almost forgot I was in Mesa, AZ.  It's a place you'll want to add to your list to take folks when you want to have fun and eat well too

 http://www.doggiestepsdogtraining.com/"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place.. the ambiance/vibe, the great food, and the service has always been great. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and it came with a side of Raita... delicious with an enjoyable level of heat. Paired it with a Hoegarden 20oz and some good conversation wtih an old friend... don't know that it gets much better than that, to be honest.

Oh and get the Bannoffee Pid dessert... you won't be disappointed!

They've also got a bunch of pub games and a nice patio for when it gets a bit cooler... highly recommended. 

I just moved closer to this location so I'll definitely be back soon... !"}
{"text":"I really wish I had the option for a 4.5 rating. The Cornish Pasty, Co. has been a date-spot as well as a casual hangout of mine for years now. The best thing about the Pasty (pronounced \"Pass-Tee\") is not only the amazingly simple food, but the elegant atmosphere. Where else can you dine under candlelight without feeling like a chump? The lighting is dim and beautiful, the surroundings simple yet quaint. You can get the full story behind what a Pasty is inside every menu, and I recommend reading about it! Interesting stuff! The prices are very consistent throughout the menu, typically being around $9 per dish, which is very acceptable considering the density and beauty of the food. 

The staff is typically friendly, with the occasional \"I'm having a bad day\" server. It can be hard to tell who is a server, as they wear simple street clothes, but I believe this adds to the welcoming feel that the owner, Dean, has established. Apparently renovations are to be coming soon, with the restaurant expanding to almost double the current size. I'm anxious to see how this will affect the overall mood of the place, but also excited for change. 

There are no TV's here, so don't expect to go watch a game. You do however have a nice range of beer and wine choices, with a limited liquor selection. I was told that the bar will expand with the addition. 

Date? Go! Hangout with friends? Go! Take mom out to dinner? Go! I can't think of any circumstance that this place doesn't cater to. (oh yeah, and they also actually cater to parties as well, which I believe can be requested through their website http://www.cornishpastyco.com/menu/index.html along with a full menu.

Give it a shot, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE THE FOOD. So giving this place three stars breaks my heart. I've been to this and the Tempe location each a few times. I do prefer this location because it feels more spacious.

I dropped in for lunch between meetings and sat at the bar facing the open kitchen. And then I waited. Somewhere around 12-15 minutes passed. I almost got up and walked out, but the guy in the kitchen manning the oven noticed I was still sitting without a beverage and asked whether I'd been helped yet. He offered to get me something to drink and took my food order. 

The restaurant was not too busy, and there were a few servers wandering around. Around the time my food was ready, one of the servers sat at the far side of the bar to eat lunch. I finished my pasty and had to go to the cash register to pay. I probably shouldn't have tipped, but I used to be a server, thus feel massive guilt for not doing so. 

Moral of the story, I'll probably just order to go next time and eat in my car. I hate when good restaurants are held back by poor service."}
{"text":"I have been here before and like the food but today the food was good, service ok, BUT seriously, do I need/have to listen to heavy metal music during my lunch?  I asked our waiter if they could change the music, tbey did, a softer version of heavy metal... I look around me and most of the diners are 30+ so I don't think my request was unreasonable. I will probably not return here for a meal, and stick to the Scottsadale location."}
{"text":"Went last night with a couple of buddies. We sat at the bar nearest the lounge and had a great time just hanging out. Average noisy bar with above average eats. We were throwing odd drink requests at the bar keep and we received exceptional drinks and service. I believe her name was CJ, ( because that's what's on the receipt.) Interior is dimly lit, black drapes over the windows. There are a couple of decent pool tables. Lounge has large fluffy leather couches. Then there is a large dinning area where you could conceivably have a party of twenty or Thirty people. There is a wrap around porch with outdoor seating as well. Don't know if you want to do that is it just faces the parking lot and street."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Went on a Saturday afternoon and got lucky because it wasn't busy so we got a great table in the sunshine (a welcome escape from the Chicago winter).  The food was great and I had to stop myself from eating off my boyfriend's plate.  I got the Pilgrim since I love thanksgiving dinner and it was so delicious.  My boyfriend got the Tiki Masala (sp?) which I liked even though Indian food isn't normally my thing.  Definitely going back there every time I'm in town now."}
{"text":"This is our watering hole in Mesa.  They are good because:  a.) wide beer selection and they serve copious amounts if you so choose; b.) they have pasties AND good salads which is a rare find in Mesa; c.) they place just as copious amounts of Iron Maiden and have a free jukebox for that matter; and d.) consistent, friendly wait staff.  

Any given night you will see an odd combination of young and aged East Valley hipsters; parental types and the working happy hour crowd.  They all get along and there is always a fair amount of seating available.  At night they light candles which gives some unique ambiance that can't really be found in Az."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the original Cornish Pasty location in Tempe, but when you're in this part of Mesa, this is a pretty good place to drop in for some decent grub and an ice cold beer. The Cornish Pasty Company take their glorified hot pockets to a new plateau, offering deliciously flakey and filling pasties at reasonable rates. The roasted new potatoes are my favorite accompaniment and they've got a good beer list, too. Tons of free parking, late-ish hours, and decent service."}
{"text":"Cute place.  Good food.  Wish it wasn't ruled by hipsters. I had the shepherds pie with minted lamb.  It was really good.  My fiancé loves the bangers and mash.  I hate the waxed wine bottles on the tables.  Looks completely disgusting.  They need to replace those sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! The peppered-steak is my most favorite! I've had their cheesy broccoli and caulflower side as well, SO GOOD! 

HIGHLY recommend every location!"}
{"text":"the food is great! i had the cajun chicken and it was delish, chicken ham bacon and cheese with chipotle sauce. service was friendly and fast. atmosphere was fun and friendly. I need to come here more often"}
{"text":"I had to try this place out because of the reviews. It has a very trendy vibe and it feels like you are in a pub in England. The pasty was pretty good, but that wine sauce is amazing.. I dipped my fries in that shiz. ;) The fries were great too. They had jalapenos on top that added some great heat. Overall a pretty good find. I shall be back."}
{"text":"Best place for options and quality.

I love the tomato soup, no spoon needed, just dip the bread!

Chicken Tika masala is so amazing.  I can't do spice but this is my one guilty pleasure.  Try with the yogurt sauce.

Chicken pot pie - amazing!

A must have."}
{"text":"Incredible!  Staff was amazing, craft beers excellent, Pasty was perfection!  Light crust, perfectly brown and crunch with Thanksgiving dinner in the inside and cranberries and gravy on the outside!  How could I miss!  That being said my husband and I will split one next time to enjoy either the soups or the Bannanoffee dessert!   We sat at the counter overlooking the food magician at work and they were tithe best seats in the house! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Wear whatever you want. sit with whoever you want. Chat, have fun... and quit worrying about life.

Can't wait to take a date here for the candlelight dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Very trendy spot with delish food catering to all foodies, including an amazing vegetarian/vegan menu. Dark lit and really nice for a date or just a gathering with friends or family. One of my favorite dinner spots in town."}
{"text":"I have been here three times so far.  The pasties have been hit and miss for us.  We tried one of the rosemary pasties and didn't really enjoy it but last time we had the pilgrim and my wife and I both thought it was great.  

The pasties are smallish compared with portions at most restaurants and a little on the expensive side at 8 to 10 dollars each.  The house salad comes with a great and unique dressing that is almost like a pesto.  The oven chips are some of the best French fries I've had.  The roasted potatoes were on the dry side.  The mushy peas are good but I'm not sure what to compare them with.

The place is small and a little awkward with much of the seating being long benches.  The staff is good but a little on the brusque side.  Last time we were in the waiter told us he had something else take care of and asked if we minded waiting.  He was trying to get another table out that needed to get back to work.  Once we had his attention he was very attentive that left me feeling like we were bothering him at the same time.  

Neither my wife nor I really care for the red wine gravy.  It tastes a little muddy to us.  The potato leek soup is excellent with a strong flavor of stilton cheese and a nice slice of bread.  They also have a great beer selection.

I'm sure we will go back again but Cornish Pasty is not on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Good: The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's laid back and the music selection on rotation is pretty decent.

Bad: The music is way too loud, and you can't hold a conversation without shouting. The staff are kind of disinterested and borderline rude. Prices are a bit high for essentially getting a gourmet Hot Pocket; and wasn't worth coming back for in my opinion.

Other Thoughts: I can't help but hate hearing, \"Cornish Pasty Co.\" or \"Pasty\" when my co-workers refer to this place. To me it comes off very \"hipstery\" and campy."}
{"text":"I went to the Cornish Pasty Company for the first time today on recommendation from a friend who loves the restaurant.  

I ordered the \"Mexican\" which was absolutely delicious.  The spices, steak, potatoes, cheese were all perfectly balanced.  The pasty came with a side of salsa and sour cream, but the pasty was just perfect as is.  No salsa or sour cream needed.  

My husband ordered the pesto chicken.  It was pretty good.  I sampled his item and he ate part of mine.  His was pretty good, but we both agreed that the Mexican was the best.  Like with the Mexican, the pasty came with marinara sauce.  I tried it, but it overwhelmed the wonderful flavor of the chicken and pesto.  Plus, the marinara sauce and the salsa both tasted like they came out of a jar, so to put them on a pasty seemed not right at all.  

We also ordered the garlic oven chips (fries)--first mistake!  I LOVE garlic and add it in just about everything I eat.  The fries were just too overwhelming with salt and garlic.  We could not eat them.  We took them home to our teenagers, who eat anything, and they agreed that they were too salty and had too much garlic.  I am quite certain, based on my friend's review, that my fries/chips were accidentally dosed with extra garlic.  She claims they were the best, but mine were not edible.  

After trying the fries, I did not like the mashed potatoes either which tasted like they had too much garlic.  They probably didn't, but it was hard to get the garlic flavor out of my mouth.  I sampled the potatoes within 5 minutes of them arriving, and they were just warm.  The cheese on top had already hardened.  I think that definitely took away from the potatoes.  Like with the fries, we brought the potatoes home, and the teens ate them no problem and claimed that they did not have too much garlic.  

As for us adults, we will definitely order a pasty or two again.  I will probably try the garlic chips again just because my friend can't be wrong.... and maybe those potatoes too.  Hopefully they will come out with melted, gooey cheese next time."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. It's one of my favorite guilty pleasures. They have great draft beer choices. Everything I come I can't help but get the same thing, the cottage pie. It's just that damn good."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with a group of friends.  We were promptly greeted and the service was good.  I liked the food \"OK\" but these pastys are not made fresh while you wait - so no substitutions of ingredients are allowed.  Also, you don't get one or two sides included with your pasty, so you will end up spending a good deal of money if you want to sample some of the excellent side dishes.  The mushroom and walnut soup was excellent, as was the fresh bread."}
{"text":"I first discovered Cornish Pasty at the Tempe location in 2006.  The food has always been delicious, so I was thrilled when they opened a location closer to home.  The food is still good, but there are two issues with this location that really need to be addressed.  First, as other reviewers have noted, there is a really bad odor inside the restaurant.  It almost smells like bad feet.  I don't know if its a particular food that is making that bad smell or what, but because of it, we always opt to eat outside.  When you enter a restaurant you should be greeted with a cornucopia of deliciousness -not a weird stench that makes you want to run.

Secondly, the customer service.  This is consistently - inconsistent.  Sometimes its ok, and then other times its just plain terrible.  The other night we had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our food and we didn't see our waitress for over an hour--that's right-AN HOUR--no drink refills, nada.  In fact we almost just left.  I don't care how busy you are, that is unacceptable.  If the customer service was excellent, I could overlook the 5 earrings in the nose-20 tats-freak show waiters they have serving the customers. (ok, so they ARE friendly for the most part)  But bad service, coupled with hippie freaky waiters is starting to wear thin.  I really want to give this place 5 stars because their food is wonderful, but until they get their customer service up to par and get rid of that smell. this place is never going to be in my top 5."}
{"text":"Always a favorite. Definitely bookmark this place if you can't make it or the line is too long to wait. Just about every pasty is DELISH and my favorite would definitely have to be a cottage pie (not to be confused with Shepard's pie!!)"}
{"text":"Update:  my concern was addressed by management, so an issue I had with a particular employee appears to be resolved.  Overall, this place has great food and service and l plan to be back.  
--------------------
I hate to give this place 2 stars but...
My last experience deserves zero stars; overall I've had a good experience here (previously).    Let me preface by saying normally I get excellent service here.
----
We arrived and waited over 10 mins to be acknowledged.   Our server was a short haired blonde (our ticket says Kitten?).   She advised she was very busy.  After 15 mins of being seated we finally received water.  She took and served our drink order before telling us nearly 2/3 of the menu wasn't avail because of St Paddies day.  At this point I have a 20oz beer in front of me so obviously we aren't going to leave.  She should've led with that.  
--
The food was good but couldn't order our favorites because of the pasty shortage.  Do not get me wrong; this poor rating is based on solely the service, not the food shortage.  My wife and I both ran out of waters and waited 15 mins before getting a refill from a bar back.  I ran out of beer and had to wait 10 mins before flagging down someone to order another.  With such a huge markup on alcohol, I've never had the experience of having to ask for another beer at a restaurant.   
--
Anyway, observed another table very annoyed by being abandoned by same server, overall very poor service.  Saw a lot of goofing off from my server after she says she's slammed.  Will I be back?   Sure, because of prior positive  experiences.   However, if she walks up to our table, I will leave promptly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is phenomenal. The service is incredible. I would recommend this place to everyone. The dessert menu is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"They have quality control issues.... It doesn't matter which location. Either the vegetables (potatoes) are still raw ( chicken pot pie) or the pasty itself tasted like a whole jar of pepper was dumped on it (Oggie). I haven't bothered to go back since they served me one with raw potatoes."}
{"text":"We ordered the meatball pasty and Sheppard's pie pasty and both were amazing! We also had a glass of wine and whiskey cocktail which were both great. We sat outside on the patio while enjoying the sunset and great service. I would recommend this place. Please check out twoarrowsonecompass.com."}
{"text":"Had the Tempe CPC on my radar for a while, but this is a bit closer so I hit it for lunch.

Love the pasty! Had the Bangers & Mash, but there is a nice list of tasty options that could keep me coming back for a long time. Also a good selection of draft beer. I went with the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, which went great with the pasty.

Another good sign to me was that few of the customers looked anything alike. An older couple, a few Harley riders, some guys in suits, a few punk-looking gents... all there for the good grub. Looking forward to a return trip."}
{"text":"This was our visit and we thouroughly enjoyed our meal.  What a perfect meal for one of the few cold nights we have here in Mesa/Phoenix. We had yummy dough filled with yummy stuff like pastrami, corned beef and saurkraut baked it is a warm golden brown.  What a deliscious take on a Reuben.  We also had a more traditional pasty with steak, potatos, and rutabagas.  Very good in that whole comfort food kind of way.

The only negative I would give is that the space is small and the noise level is high, but then so is a pub in the middle of London."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had previously been to the store in Scottsdale.  Service there was much better. 4 stars with a more attentive server."}
{"text":"So I hate giving places low stars, I have eaten it Cornish Pastry on Mill and had a great experience. The place is so unique and absolutely delicious so when my parents were in town I decided to take them to the Cornish Pastry on Guadalupe. 
I bragged about how unique and delicious this place is. When we got there we were probably seated and greeted by our waitress who is very nice. However when it came time to order we all decided on different pastries so we could share and my parents could get an experience of this place. 
When we went to place our order though the waitress kindly informed us that they were \"out of\" some of their most delicious pastries ( they were out of the pilgrim they were out of the roast dinner and the steak and pepper) we decided on other pastries, the Italian the chicken pot pie and the Cajun chicken. (Which were all great!).
My complaint here is that it would have been nice when we were seated to have our waitress inform us of what they were out of right away instead of us getting amped up only to find out they were out of the favorites that I wanted them to try 
All in all it was and okay experience drinks were delivered fast our waitress was kind I was just disappointed with not being told what was available to us to order I would have really liked them to try some of the best pastries there. O well I guess if I go back to the Guadalupe location I will have to call to make sure they have the pastries I want in stock before I go. Kind of a weird thing to do."}
{"text":"Three stars only because our meal took about an hour and 45 minutes from beginning to end.  Our server explained it was because of an extremely large party and only one person being able to work the oven.  

We had ordered pea soup and asked for it before the pasties came out.  Our server stopped by to check on drinks (we were each on our second and no soup in sight yet) and said our pasties should be out soon.  We realized she'd totally forgotten about our soup so we flagged her down and asked about it.

She was very nice and apologetic and didn't charge us for the soup, which showed about about 10 minutes later...with our pasties.  

Now about the food.  The long-awaited pea soup was well flavored and slightly chunky, with a dollop of cream on top.  Very yummy and delicious when scooped up with the bread and butter served with it.

I had the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty.  The menu said spicy and boy, do they mean it!  I ended up having to scrape a lot of the sauce off the pieces of lamb and potato in order to be able to eat it.  The flavor was great but I couldn't take the heat.  My boyfriend ended up finishing it for me.

My boyfriend wanted the Bangers and Mash Pasty but they were out.  So he had the Rosemary Steak Pasty instead.  It was very good as well.  With the steak, red potatoes, roasted red peppers and brie, it was a hit.  I didn't care for the mustard cream sauce it came with (yes, I stole a couple of bites).  

We debated dessert and decided to go for it.  Another wait ensued but it was worth it.  I had the peanut butter and jelly pasty.  Heaven!  With peanut butter, raspberry jelly and banana baked inside, then raspberry sauce drizzled over the top.  Served with whipped cream (the real stuff--not too sweet).  Excellent!

The bf had a sticky toffee pudding that is named after Shirley Temple.  He loved it.  I had a single small bite, knowing that sticky toffee pudding isn't something I enjoy.  This dessert didn't change my mind.  So I can't recommend it but based on my bf's reaction, it must have been good if you are into that sort of thing.

I'll pick another night and try the place again, for certain.  Learned my lesson that a busy Saturday night is not the best."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time after a family member highly recommended it. Kent was our server and he was awesome! We sat at the bar and the service was quick (which is surprising for a Saturday night) and the food was AMAZING. I felt a little sad as I was coming to the end of eating my Pasty and could've easily ordered another one for myself. Also, I highly recommend the Cornish Meatballs . So A+++ to Cornish Pasty and our server Kent!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food is delicious, the vibe is the perfect combination of hip and comfortable, and the wait staff were cool and made great recommendations. We had the Bangers & Mash and the Carne Adovada Patsy's--so good! You have to save room for dessert; the Sticky Toffee Pudding is the best I've ever had.  I'm so glad we found this place and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So without a single notion of what a Pasty actually was, I joined my usual \"Find unique and interesting places to eat\" group of friends to try this place out.  And boy am I glad I did.

We took a seat at the bar that overlooked the kitchen and I started off with a 20oz glass of one of my favorite wheat beers; Hoegaarden.  

As we sat there watching one of the employees make a batch of Pasties, my friends and I chatted casually with himself and a few other employees about the place and what was good to eat and such.

Being adventurous I decided to try out one of the many veggie menu items and went with the Chicken Basil and Pesto Pasty.  It featured vegetarian chicken and I was curious as to how it would stack up against the real thing.

It was served quite prettily shortly after we ordered and I dug in.  Delicious!  The veggie chicken obviously wasn't a dead ringer for the real deal, but I felt it worked quite flawlessly with the rest of the contents of the dish.

After that we decided on different desserts and I chose the chocolate rum bread pudding.  It was different than any bread pudding I've ever had for starters because it was chocolate.  Next it had a crunchy outer shell that contained the gooey goodness inside.  I was informed that they were sadly out of the vanilla drizzle that normally accompanies it as well, so that would have also made it unique had they not been out.

It's also worth noting that the employees were an absolute blast to interact with as they were playing quirky and fun songs off their iPod and were just being outgoing and fun in general.  It was mentioned though that the manager was not there at the time and that usually had the place had more patrons (there were maybe 2 other couples in the place) in it they would have had to conform to more \"professional\" standards.  

Overall it's a shame I live so far from the place because I could easily see myself becoming a regular.  Prices after pasty, dessert and 2 20oz beers and tip was just around 27 if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Arizona. I got the traditional Oggie and it was bomb. I would love to get this for lunch again."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been living next to this place for a few months and I've been missing out.  Its mostly English fare, sometimes with a twist.  I'm a pasty fan and was scoffing about how the crust would be all wrong and the shepherds pie would be made with beef, etc, but I had to eat my words (I wasn't wearing a hat).  Everything was perfect and the sauce was fantastic!  One of our orders got messed up a bit but we got some freebies on the house that made up for it.  Lots of good draft beer, and even a tasty draft cider I hadn't tried before.  The staff was great, helpful and friendly without being too clingy, and my glass never went empty.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Cornish Pasty Co. last night.  The atmosphere is low lit and very charming.  We opted for a seat at the counter adjacent to the open kitchen because we like the action and the exchange.  

The place is a little bit hippie/hipster,with friendly, very casual service.  Our server was effective and checked on us often without being too intrusive. 

We started with the Scotch Eggs, which were authentic and delicious  

We ordered a Greek salad and Chicken Greek pasty.  Both were good, but Pasty was much superior.  

They must be doing something very right as we understand a third location may soon be opening in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good. It's been too long since we have been here and it has grown but still has the same feel and great food. You must get your butt in here and ask for Hailey she is the best."}
{"text":"darkish lighting, church pews (first time i actually didnt mind sitting in a church pew), tables made of doors with glass over them, and good music. this place does a great job of setting a comfy and relaxing atmosphere right from the get go. be aware that seating is first come first serve so if you want one of the roomy booths outside, you'll have to go during the weekday or get there early on a Friday night and stake your claim. they fill up rather fast.

service was great. everyone was extremely friendly and our waitress was totally attentive. she was really patient as we picked through the menu and tried to decide what tastiness to eat. oh and did i mention that rather decent selection of beers and a cider or two? yeah, that. soooo delicious. i did see only one local beer on tap (Kiltlifter) but it didnt disturb me too much since i saw quite a few delicious Belgian and German beers. don't get me wrong, i'm all for local but i can be swayed by supreme tastiness. 

i had the meat and cheese pasty, our friend had the philly cheese steak, and the boyfriend had the vindaloo. surprisingly the vindaloo did not suck. i dug the peas and the moist chicken. my meat and cheese was awesome. i mean c'mon, its meat and cheese. the sausage had a great sage-y taste to it and the cheese was uber melty. the philly cheese steak tasted EXACTLY like a delicious cheese steak from philly. 

all in all, this might become my new haunt. i saw that they had great brunch specials and lots of mimosas/beer. how could i NOT come back?"}
{"text":"First time here and already a fan. Pastys are delicious and served piping hot. Great selection of beer and a nice atmosphere to boot with darts and pool table."}
{"text":"We have visited this location at least three times. All three times, the food was delicious and the beer was cold. Our last visit was on a weekend night, and it took a bit longer than I would have liked to place our drink order. However, once the server came over, the service was good.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The ambience of the restaurant is very hip and has the British flare. The food was outstanding! I especially recommend saving room for dessert and have the sticky toffee pudding!"}
{"text":"Love this place one of  my favorite places to eat in the phoenix valley. The atmosphere is warm and friendly.The food is amazing. I love the bench style tables and of coarse the candles in th wine bottle for lighting. The staff is wonderful and very friendly.Must check this place outtt!"}
{"text":"I'm British and we love our cornish pasties. 

The Cornish Pasty Company is a great spot to hit if you're craving a cornish pasty. We tried several appetizers from the scotch egg to the british fries. All were yummy and tastey. The cornish pasties were good and flavorful.

This place lost two stars because of the unbelievably horrid service we received. Our waitress forgot several items and at the end of our meal, after ordering a dessert, she brought us our tab instead. When I questioned where our bread pudding was, she told me she didn't receive an order for a bread pudding, when I clearly ordered one. No apology or anything. It was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome atmosphere. Killer staff. Went in on a weekday around 5ish and was seated promptly and a waitress came right away. Was hoping to get a better happy hour special than I did, but that wasn't the reason I was there. Ordered the lamb shepards pie pasty and was blown away. The little red wine gravy was mind blowing as well. I'll definitely be heading back here more often."}
{"text":"Pasty (pronounced pass-tee)= Super fancy hot pocket. Where is Jim Gaffigan to scarf these down next to me? We came in with hopeful eyes and hungry stomachs and weren't disappointed. At 5 PM on a Friday, the lot was crazy full but restaurant wasn't too bad. We were seated immediately at a ginormous glass encased door and church pew table. I felt like I needed to genuflect and do the sign of the cross. Unique, though, as was the hodge podge lighting in the gaming area and the heavy tin menus. Service was friendly, helpful and prompt with the exception of water refills. 

There are so many dang choices that it was hard to narrow down. I despise onions, which most of the pasties seemed to have. The server said that there is no way to omit items unless you call 24 hours in advance and make a request, as they pre-make the pasties each day. Makes sense! With so many options, I tried to talk hubby into splitting two kinds, since they cut the generous sized pasties in half. No dice. There are two kinds of food people...those who feel food envy if they don't share(me) and those who will bite your hand if you even glance at their plate (husband). As long as I have enough fingers to pick up a fork, it is worth the risk at a place like this with so many options! 

We ordered draft beers with happy hour special, oven fries, carne adovada pasty and a spicy BBQ chicken pasty. Hubby wanted the pilgrim, but they were out for the day. He then thought about the royale (like a Big Mac pasty), but the server told him it was not as good as the BBQ one he was considering. The carne adovada meat was so dang tender. I wish that the cheese had more of a presence, if it was even on there? Both pasties had a SW flare and the BBQ was perfectly spicy and shredded chicken tender. We both liked but not loved our choices. We both liked the dough the best. 

The oven fries were \"meh,\" with an over abundance of burnt crisps. I appreciate that they cut these in-house but they were rubbery and burnt and made us wish we had tried the mashed potatoes or the broccoli bake. I would say we would try those next time, but we aren't in a huge rush to come back. The pasties were a unique concept and the ambiance cool which bumps up a star more than we typically would give this place."}
{"text":"Food is extremely SALTY.  The chef's taste buds are probably shot and he/she adds way too much salt to EVERYTHING!  I'm never going there again.  Not balanced in the flavors whatsoever."}
{"text":"I've never been to Scotland but I was told that this place or yet type of food is sort of Scottish. So let's see.

Yummie food!! Been here a few times with the hubbie, friends for happy hour and birthday. 

There are 2 locations of this place in the valley and my favorite one is the one in Guadalupe Rd. As you walk in, it seems like you went back in 1800. Place is very warm with black and white paint as their primary colors. There are long tables with long white candles with melted wax still attached on the side that makes it very old yet beautiful. They use church pews as part of the long tables making the furniture very unique. Service is good and fast. They will take time to explain to you if you're first timers. Menu has a fair amount of selection according to their signature to the most popular pasties, they even have a full page of selection for vegans! Pasties are like calzone in a way or empanada in some countries, where you have meat stuffed inside a flour based dough. And they can out whatever kind of flavor they wanna put it! My favorites are the pesto chicken and chicken alfredo pasties! I also love, love, love the oven baked chips which are basically potatoes cut in wedges, baked to perfection and sprinkled with garlic or some jalapenos for those who are looking for some kick..You will not go wrong with these chips! My hubbie loves their Guinness which he says is very different from other restaurants, which I would say is true coz he has tried all kinds of this from all different places. They also have a good amount of beers that originated from Europe. 
Pricing is fair enough for the big servings they give. I usually come home with half of my pasty so that's really big serving! =)

I recommend this place if you're looking for something new and fresh without shelling out too much $$.."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Never been disappointed! I bring people who visit here and even went for Valentine's Day! Very dark inside - hard to walk around/see. Outdoor seating was nice and dog friendly! Very filling and great for rehearing if necessary!"}
{"text":"This place has great iced tea and every thing I have tried on the menu has been great.  Top notch food and service."}
{"text":"Like the food. Service SUCKED!! 2nd time in the place. Took my wife here after church on Sunday. Walked in. No greeter, no sign to sit yourself, no nothing. Um..ok. So...what do we do? You need to have someone at the front door at all times...Or at least a sign that says seat yourself.

Sat at the table for 10 minutes. No acknowledgement. No menus. Just a Jamison candle bottle that we played with. Had to ask some random person sweeping if she had menus. Really? Another 10 minutes, what would you like for a drink? Are you our waitress? I don't know if your another sweeper or somebody else playing a joke on us. Acknowledge your table!! How difficult is that? Training of the employees has got to be number one and sadly its the food number one. Bummer.

Maybe it was just a Sunday afternoon kind of thing, but our waitress could care less. First time in here? Thanks for coming back! No questions, no nothing. At least ask my wife...

I really like the food but it does nothing for me when you can't get simple service right. We will not be back. We've had friends that have been there in the last two-3 months and say the same thing. Food is great. Service is horrible. It's not just me saying this. 

Fix some things and care a little bit more about your diners...I hope you make it to the 5 year mark. I'm willing to try again but it's got to be better on the 3rd time otherwise your a waste of time.

Two starts cause the food is actually good. -2 cause of the 19 year old waitresses with their junk hanging out of their bras."}
{"text":"2010 Best Place for Holiday Food and Ambiance!   I look forward to taking my family here (Mesa location) and having the wonderful food and drink.  Everyone with Scotch-Irish heritage should try this place.  It's food like my little Seanmhair used to make!"}
{"text":"I have been to both locations dozens of time and haven't a single bad thing to say. Awesome, affordable dishes; cold, delicious beer, and the service is amazing - one time I got the Caesar salad instead of the Tikka salad I ordered, but I didn't care because it was incredible! I feel bad it took me this long to give a review, because it is WELL deserved."}
{"text":"Awesome. Had the Shepards Pie Pasty. Service was slow they were busy. Waitress not that attentive but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Literally waited over an hour for our food. Server comes over and tells that our ticket \"was lost as they were changing the receipt paper\" 45 minutes go by I ask her for the check and to wrap it up to-go. I'm giving this two stars instead of one because they didn't end up charging us for anything. Ruined our night out- unfortunately. I probably won't try this again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and ordered a different pasty each time. The food is really good and the chocolate bread pudding is amazing. Give it a try and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is awesome. My wife had the pilgrim and I had the royal with cheese. Food came out quick, hot, and super flavorful. CJ was our waitress, she was quick with the food, refills and everything else. Would have been a 5 star for me but I bit down on something really hard that made my jaw pop really bad and hurt like all hell. CJ was right their when it happened and asked if I wanted her to take the good back and to bring me something else. I declined because my jaw hurt to bad to eat. At the end she brought me the check and took off the royal with cheese. Thanks CJ, me and my wife will return for our next date."}
{"text":"Great food, great  drinks, great ambiance! Not a 5 star for me due to service, but that is a training opportunity. It is a unique place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Scotch Egg and Guinness Pasty. The food was tasty and the cost was commensurate with the quality. The restaurant environment was comfortable."}
{"text":"I just love these restaurants. Great food and atmosphere . Service can be a bit lacking but that's kinda the vibe here-laid back.
Just had another pasty tonight-oh so good: bangers and mash"}
{"text":"Lucky Mesa. You have a Cornish Pasty Company! 

Today, we visisted the Mesa location, and it's quite different than the Tempe locale. Quite nice, in fact. There are two large patio's and this location (Mesa) is huge! 

My hubby, the Brit, ordered \"Scotch Eggs\" which is a hard-boiled egg, wrapped in sausage, and quickly deep-fried. It's served with a mustard sauce, and a little salad on the side. My hubby was in Heaven. 

We both ordered a cup of soup and a pasty. I had the tomato and it was delish. My hubby's gave me dish-envy: Leek, potato and Stilton cheese...OMG! Try it! 

I had my normal \"Porky\" Pasty, and my hubby had the \"Lamb and Mint\" pasty. Both were served with that yummy gravy on the side, and both were fabulous!! 

I can't say enough about these restaurants. They are both consistently wonderful food, play awesome music, and are an overall PERFECT experience!"}
{"text":"I had great service tonight from a gentleman named Dandy I believe. Great customer service."}
{"text":"This place can't seem to decide if it's Tilted Kilt or TGI Friday's ....... 

Basically the food here is great, everything else is not.  a \"pasty\", apparently, is a shepherd's pie (or any other one of the 40 variations on a meat pie), which definitely is tasty.  Each pie I'd say is worth about $6 - $7, average price is 9.50, so a bit overpriced.  Scantily dressed, grumpy waitresses, references to beer and beer mugs everywhere, and extremely loud music that makes it hard to hear or be heard.  

Basically, it's the perfect place to go if you're still in that teeny-bopper 20'ish stage, and mostly for an all-male crowd.  I wouldn't wander in here with kids, even though I did see one couple braving it with a 3 year old; they looked visibly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"after our first horrible experience, i had vowed never to go back.  i'm so glad i gave it another chance!  this time we went when it was busy, and sat at the bar.  the bartender/server was so helpful and attentive, completely knew how to treat customers.  the tomato soup was incredible and i have since recommended CPC to many of my friends.
thanks dean!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! I eat at Cornish Pasty at least once a month because the food is that good and the atmosphere is ago much fun. Everything on the menu is yummy, but the Reuben pasty is the best on the menu. Truly delish."}
{"text":"Love this place BUT because I love it so much  I have to write this review of my favorite desert in Phoenix. 

I have been here numerous times and spent hundreds over time. However, for the love of their food I don't understand why they can't be consistent on their Banoffi pie. It's always, I mean always, different. We take food out 99% of the time and it's always a hit or miss. Sometimes the bananas are black, sometimes they are soggy, sometimes the crust is thin as paper, sometimes there is so much crust you feel you are eating sand, sometimes the caramel sauce is invisible and sometimes there is so little there that you just want to cry. I crave their Banoffi on a daily basis but absolutely hate when I drive 30 min for it and when I get home is a disappointment. PLEASEEEEE I mean PLEASE get your portions down on your banoffis!"}
{"text":"Still lovin the Pasty. Thought it would be worth noting that I brought my British husband here four, yes FOUR, times when he was in town. One of those times we had four more Brits in tow and they all loved it. \"It\" includes the food, the atmosphere, the beer selection, the giant booth outside that accommodated 8 of us and the great service we recieved. This restaurant manages to be the trifecta of perfect, as it's good for friends, good for low key dates and good for parents too."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always good but tonight I stopped in for drinks and dessert.  So I had the chocholate bread pudding. . Omg so freaking good and the bar tender Chad was great."}
{"text":"I really don't know how you can give this place less then 5 stars. 

The service is awesome

The atmosphere is awesome 

The food is awesome

The variety they have for meat eaters and vegetarians is nice. Part of my family and friends are veg heads the others are carnivores so this place is a good place to go if you have a diverse crowd of people wanting to eat out. They have great beer and drinks too so that's something everyone can have."}
{"text":"This isn't an entirely fair review because I only had dessert. The apple caramel pasty was quite tasty.  My companions greatly enjoyed their meals as well.   Husband was disappointed at the lack of \"authentic\" pasties (read: organs) but I was grateful to have avoided the awkward situation of asking him to take his meal across the street and eat it on the sidewalk. 

Cute place, good service.  My only issue was that it was rather loud and difficult to hear each other.."}
{"text":"Just left this establishment with a not so good second experience. We had our kids with us so we decided to sit on the patio. I have a 8,7 and 1 year old. We put in our order for food at 5:50 received appetizers at 6 which was respectable, but it went down hill from there. Our food came out at 6:40. I asked the waitress what happened and she said \"they take a long time to cook.\" This is not my first time at this restraunt just my second time at this location. In Phoenix it takes about 10 to 1w minutes when they are jam pack on a Saturday. So I guess they take longer at this location. Being a server I know that she probably forgot to put in my order... I wish she just would of been straight up with me. Anyway, hopefully next time is better loved the food just received terrible service. 2 stars is based off service the food was great."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times over the past year. The food choices are varied. You won't have trouble finding something for everyone. Although the pastry seems  pre-made and frozen, heated on the spot, it is generally tasty. Prices are quite reasonable. Main concern our past two visits has been the poor service. Our last two visits we were seated just outside the restroom against a wall in a dark area, but candlelit. Our server apparently either forgot about us or had to many tables to serve as we waited 15 minutes the first time and on our last visit decided to leave after 15 minutes. Too bad as we had liked this local eatery."}
{"text":"The pasty's are great, but that take a while to cook. Nice assortment of import beer. Can get busy at evening time."}
{"text":"OMG WOW. This place is just amazing. If you have never been, you are missing out. Went there with family and everything we ordered, from soups to pasties were flavorful and aesthetically pleasing. The selection of beer on tap is also impressive. 5 stars well deserved."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've had to go orders and eaten in, and both times I was amazed at the professionalism and courtesy of the staff. 

The food is great! I've only had the pasty and the banana dessert, but I imagine the other food is on par. I had the bangers and mash, shepherds pie, and the pilgrim. All of them are amazing and delicious. If you are on a diet, don't come here! The food is hearty and filling. 

There are vegetarian options and the online menu says there are two vegan options, but I am not sure about that as they use a TON of butter, but I don't see them lying about it as they are a great place."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! This was our first time here today after having countless people tell us we NEEDED to try it.  We sat at the bar this afternoon and were really the only ones there but our bartender totally rocked, he gave us tons of recommendations for drinks, pasties and desert. You could see he was clearly busy making drinks for the whole bar but he paid tons of attention to us and made sure everything was taken care of. I wish I remembered his name but none the less, awesome. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo Pasty...nothing what I expected but it was definitely more than what I expected, it was so delicious! We also got an order of the garlic chips....wow is all I can say about those. We obviously had to try the deserts our bartender recommended the bread and butter pudding....holy crap....die and go to heaven good. 

We will clearly be back again, and hopefully have the same bartender we had this afternoon. The atmosphere is great, the food is amazing, and the service was awesome! I will be telling friends about this place for a while. 

Chive On!"}
{"text":"My niece is weary of my yelp adventures. This place has redeemed me. The decor was fun and functional. Easy atmosphere, good food , a young friendly staff. I took my niece at least 10 minutes to decide on the chicken pesto pasty. I had the veggie Mexican. 
The pasty is a meal, we left without having to discuss eco friendly to go containers. I always bring it up, my niece always mocks me. My eco activism isn't always consistent. We had I light flavored beer the waitress recommended. OK she loved the pesto chicken, I enjoyed the Mexican... We both are looking forward to your next visit. For me repeat visits are a true testament to a rave review. Peace!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! This place came highly recommend from a few friends.. but it truly makes me wonder what they were thinking raving about this place. The concept is good, I was excited... but it was such a let down. I wish I remembered the names of the items I ordered, but the left little to remember. I ordered take out, but live across the street so I doubt that had much to do with my experience. Food was bland, and when it did have flavor it felt like someone just stuffed a pastry with leftovers and some seasoning and puts price on it. Nothing I ordered I enjoyed, waste of money."}
{"text":"So I went for my first time and WOW!!!  I was nervous that it was going to be crowded and the service would be slow...not at all!!  Our waitress was very attentive and the food was out quickly!  I had the pasta salad as an appetizer and it was to die for!  For my pasty I had the carne adovada...amazing!!!  I cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"WOW. A First time to see everything you can think of in puffed pastry. But done to the perfection of an upscale restaurant. Make sure and get there early as there usually us a wait. And some of the specials and most popular might be unavailable towards the end of the night.
Awesome!!!! Need a place like this in Canada."}
{"text":"Who knew British food could be tasty? Creative, original, delicious, all in a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"After my first visit last week, an addict was born.  At that time I had the Bangers and Mash.  OTH delicious!!!

Second visit (today), I tried the recommended Cajun Chicken.  OTFH delicious!!!!

And I got to wash it all down with a few oversize pints of Boddingtons on tap!!  Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talking about.  Who the hell has Boddingtons on tap anymore???  These guys do and they do it right!!!


Add the following competent, friendly and oh so lovely servers and life is good at the CPC:

Christina
Casey
Shannon
Jess

My compliments to Dean for putting together such a wonderful, comfortable, delicious dining experience.  Perhaps a Gilbert location might be in the works soon??  I can think of a place in California that would be a good fit fo shizzle.


My new pasty faves:

Cajun Chicken
Bangers n Mash

Shannon recommended:
Carne adobado.
Meat n cheese with secret side.  I'll probably forget the side at my next visit, so hopefully she's there to assist.  Fingers crossed!!

Good times in the still fucking hot in October Sonoran Desert!!!"}
{"text":"Good after bar food... Good before bar food.. I am in LOVE with the Lamb Vindaloo pie.

Now I don't have much experience with \"pastys\" in England..( or anywhere else:) but BOTH the locations here serve as good as yer gonna get in the PHX area. 

Cool atmosphere to experience..Learn about what a pasty is..and drink from the copious beer selection. (beer snob)

Gotta love the service too.. attentive attractive ..Prolly one of the places to be for World Cup Football fans out there!"}
{"text":"Cornish pasty is awesome.  Just tried it for the first time yesterday as we found ourselves in the east Valley.  It was amazing and they have a great vegetarian menu.  The atmosphere, service, food, and price were all outstanding!  The only downside is that they don't have a location out in peoria/glendale yet."}
{"text":"My second visit here. Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala here. It was good and unlike last time the potatoes were cooked perfectly. I sat near the kitchen and I can tell you that the kitchen staff does a good job keeping everything around them clean. I will visit them again."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is so fun /and/ good at their jobs. My waiter, Matt, was a blast & cool about special requests. Got a chance to meet the manager, Justin, to tell him how great I thought everything was. Just cool people. And the food- uhh! Amazing! Oven chips & Greek Salad (with amazing lemon pesto dressing) and PB&J pasty with ice cream- under $15! If you haven't been here- get here. There whole menu is amazing & even vegetarian-friendly."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks back and the food is great. Ambiance a lil on the darker rustic side, and music is pretty loud, so not the best family setting with kids. Long wooden tables and benches accommodate large groups and nice to have outside seating. Menu provides options from meat lovers to vegetarians, to sweet and spicy. Plan for about 15-20 for your food to arrive. Scene here is a mix of hipster and local residents on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"After a long hike, my group of 6 was starving and I decided that we should check out the Cornish Pasty Co, in Mesa. We ordered a variety of pasties: the Royale w/ cheese, Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Alfredo and the Reuben.

Now, you may wonder...what the HELL is a pasty? First of all, it's pronounced 'pass-tee', which is a meat pie. Not to be mistaken for 'pace-tee', used to describes a person's pale complexion or those nipplage stickers burlesques dancers use. 

It's the British version of a Spanish empanada. And, IT IS HUGE!! I like huge....food... ;o)

I ended up ordering the Shepherd's Pie. The flaky shell crust hides the meat and potatoes, on the inside.  The meat was well seasoned, super yummy and blended well, with the mashed potatoes. I was craving for more, after my first bite. Actually, it was so good, I can still imagine the taste of the pasty, in my mouth. Hello, drool!

A single pasty will cost you about $8. It's enough to fill up a single adult. We didn't get sides, this time around.  But, we will next time.  And, oh yes, there WILL be a next time!!

The church pews are a nice touch.  The service super friendly and helpful.  I got no complaints and I will come here, again. Oh, why don't we have one like this in San Diego?!? Why? Why? WHY?!?

Until the next time Cornish Pasty Company..... *le sigh*"}
{"text":"I love this place, so read this review with a skeptical mindset. This place looks odd when you first come in, but the atmosphere and staff are awesome. They've added a pool table and darts(both free) for entertainment and some casual eating and talking areas, which I think is  great for a bar. In terms of food, I can't say enough good things about this place. I've had everything on the menu except the vindaloo and veggie pasty, and that's because I can never bring myself to try something new when there are so many rock solid winners on the menu. I recommend in order of most favorite to still pretty damn awesome; The Ruben, the breakfast pasty, and then the royal with cheese, but like I said there are soo many others that are good. If you order the soup, you get copious amounts of delicious white bread which is good, but not so much if you're watching your figure. The salads are on point, with great dressing choices. My personal favorite is the Greek salad. The plowmans plate is a great appetizer to split for a table or it could be it's own meal and for you cheese lovers out there it's a solid pick. Beer and drink selection is pretty good as well. I'm not much of adventurous beer drinker but their light beers and lager selection has always been really good and varied."}
{"text":"Yummers!  This is my sister and I third time visiting the Cornish Pasty Company.  We are making this restaurant our signature eatery after her doctor appt. Today we had the \"Roast Beef Sarnie and  the Roast Dinner pasty\".  So Good!  Taking a half baked \"The Pilgrim\" home.  Our server was \"McMullen\". COME On In you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is fairly good, I just wish there were more choices instead of almost everything in a pasty.  I wish there was more protein in the dishes (they are very carb heavy).

There is not a lot of the meat in the pasties, it is about 25% meat with the rest potatoes/onions and then the crust on top of that.  

They seem to run out of things quickly, they didn't have coffee/tea one evening.  Often something is missing off the plate (they run out and just don't say anything?).  

The liver pate is good if you like pate but no red onion marmalade was included.

The wine gravy doesn't have that much flavor to it - very close to typical brown gravy taste.

Leek soup actually tastes mostly like a flour potato soup, no real flavor and thick with flour, though when a bite if leek is found it tastes good. Just not what I expected at all.

The Homemade Coleslaw was a nice surprise, it is a red cabbage warm with sweetness from apple vinegar.  They say Cornish Style but no description which means for most people they expect something close to typical coleslaw and get surprised (maybe pleasantly or unpleasantly depending on your sense of adventure).

Deserts are probably the best items, though the Banoffee Pie and Sticky Toffee Pudding were very sweet.  The chocolate pudding was not sweet at all and the flavor was very nice.  They serve a very small amount of fresh cream with some of the desserts (left off of one, maybe ran out that day) plus ice cream, it would be nicer to have more cream instead of non-premium vanilla ice cream.

They seem thrown if you ask for a change to the dish (e.g. could I have some milk for the black tea - isn't that typical British food and this is a British restaurant?, or if you don't want the bread with the soup - huge pieces of fairly nice but standard white fluffy bread).  They do the changes it is just they have a strong reaction to you asking as if nobody had ever asked for a change before.

Service is good overall, some servers seem to stand at the table and have long conversations with customers (the first time I thought he was a friend and had some free time so stood there for 10 minutes chatting about all kinds of topics, but I have seen each visit at tables close by, different servers each time).

This is a very casual restaurant, tables are stained and varnished picnic style tables with benches.  They are all larger so often you are sharing the table with others at the other end.  Whiskey bottles are used for candle stick holders.  It can get louder though it was not real loud and there was music in the background at least one visit (it was hard to tell if it was a performer somewhere not visible or CDs playing)."}
{"text":"Great food. Something almost anyone would like. Way cooler decor than I expected and good drinks. A must-do for everyone."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is...wow. It's almost indescribable. It's really that good. First of all, any pub that has Hoegaarden on draft is automatically a winner in my book. When you add that plus a great happy hour, life is good. If you just want to get your drink on after a long day at the office, Cornish is hard to beat. If you want to drink AND eat (two of the best things a person can do) you will have an evening to remember. I'm vegetarian and this place has a ton of options for me. The Veggie Oggie and The Greek are my favorites--make sure you get a side of HP if they have it. You won't regret it. As long as this place is open, my husband and I will be frequent visitors."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been there multiple times and the food is always fabulous  I grew up in NZ, so pasties were part of my life... These live up to the real thing, are unique and delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Edited my review because our issue was handled with the waitress, at least the company staff handled the review. Still didn't have a good experience BUT! They got back to us about it and that says a lot about this place. We'll most definitely be back and give it another try. I'll just be back in the fall when it's not so hot :)"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars for the food but have been here twice and both times it has taken forever (about an hour) to get food. The food is amazing but don't come in hungry;-)"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat out and we frequently choose it to celebrate, catch up with friends and enjoy time with our boys.
Everyone we have worked with has been amazing and the management consistently earns my loyalty by being willing to find ways to accommodate my food allergy (I always call as far ahead as possible).
We all love the food, playing darts/pool and my partner and I love the beer selection.
We even celebrated my son's birthday there this year and our waitress was incredible and ensured that everyone in our very large group had drinks and food in timely manner and she managed the constant movement of people from table to table  with grace and patience.
I cannot thank them enough for being so awesome."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, try the refreshing Margot Tannenbaum with cooling rosemary and gin. The scotch eggs are truly life changing. The leek and potato soup is great but too rich if you plan to eat anything more than a salad with it. We had lamb vindaloo, lamb and mint, and the oggie pasties, all excellent. The Guinness stew padty was deemed OK but dull. I think this place is great. Would return."}
{"text":"My fiance finally dragged me here after years if talking about how good it was.  The good was really good.  I wish their dinners came with a side of veggies instead if having to order something extra.

My only complaint was the water misters outdoors.  Barely 90 degrees and they were running.  Normally I'm ok with that but everything was soaked.  The chair padding, the table, then my food..  they finally turned them off and then they dripped, and dripped and dripped some more.. all over my dress clothes and my head.  I left looking like I ran through a sprinkler.  

Food is worth it, if you sit inside."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always great service & great food. Brendon is taking care of us tonight. very personable. had the Oggie delicious. The variety of imports on tap are awesome."}
{"text":"Friendly service, excellent food.

I didn't know what a pasty was until I came here.  The food is filling and actually very flavourful.

The first time I came here, I got a Bangers and Mash.  Second time, I got the Oggie.  I recommend skipping the beans if you're used to the typical Boston style baked beans.  

Fries and mushy peas are a good thing to start with.  Finish off with the Apple Pasty.

Very vegetarian friendly.

I recommend going early as this place can get very crowded."}
{"text":"Heavenly delicious food! Definitely come hungry because you will leave extremelyyyyy stuffed. It is one of those Im-so-full-but-I-can't-stop-eating-this-food type experiences! They have a huge selection of pasty's on their menu so it feels like you need an hour to decide which to choose! I hfinally decided on the Chicken Alfredo - YUMMM!!! We also tried the apple pie pasty type dessert ~ also sooo heavenly even if you're stuffed from the dinner portion :)

Great place to go for a date night out or with friends! Small place but has a relaxing and unique atmosphere. Servers/ Bartenders are great!

A must-try!! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite south Tempe haunts of late!  It has a relaxed feel, and a far more spacious dining area than the other Tempe location.  The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight!  Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ.  Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.  They serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.  I love the Pasty and I love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious!  If you haven't had a pasty yet, you should!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh the glorified Hot Pocket, I always a good experience here. Service was kind of slow, we waited about 10 minutes for our check to be picked up. The food is consistently good, my go to is always the Lovely Bit of Salmon. Beer selection is good and there's daily drink specials."}
{"text":"Being English, I'm always skeptical when people advertise 'authentic British food' as it never comes close to expectations. I'm happy to say Cornish Pasty is as good as it gets. How they keep their prices so low astounds me as the quality of the food is second to none. I turned vegan 4 years ago and they have an extensive vegetarian menu with 2 vegan pasties on offer daily (usually... they've let me down a couple of times but I just switch to vegetarin for the meal - don't judge). 

Alcohol is great too with Strongbow on tap and specials always running. I bring my parents here when they visit too and they love it - they're from Cornwall, which should tell you everything you need to know. 

My only complaint is that it's been flooded with hipsters, which is not my scene. I'm a 34\" waist and I can't get into skinny jeans."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere,  Love the food !  The garlic french fries are to die for !  My favorite drink... The rotten apple...  It is a mug of hard cider with a shot of jagermeister turned upside down inside.  I know I know it sounds strange but it is yummo!"}
{"text":"Simply put, Cornish Pasty is AMAZING. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and I could not have asked for a more perfect experience.  The restaurant was dark, with long dark wood booths and candles dripping wax down the empty Jameson bottles. The music was great and the tattooed and pierced staff made me feel right at home.  The table was actually a door with a piece of glass covering it, which was an excellent touch to the atmosphere.  And now, on to the food!

I took my best friend who eats like I do and together we ordered: 
Shepard's pie pasty 
Chicken tikka masala pasty
Lovely bit of salmon pasty
Peppered steak pasty
Mushy peas
Oven chips

The best part is that everything (maybe not the peas) was perfect and distinctly flavored; no dish tasted like any other dish on the table.  I would recommend the chicken tikka masala pasty and the peppered steak pasty if I had to pick two from our table.  After boxing up the leftovers to bring home we ordered dessert; we picked the Strawberry Pavlova and the Apple Carmel pasty. Both were also amazing and with a shared glass of Chardonnay our meal came to a very satisfying end.  I am sad that I had waited so long to visit the Cornish Pasty Co. But it will definitely be a favorite on my list from now on."}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved the food, very creative and very reasonably priced. FYI, I recommend the chicken/portobello pasty. I wanted to try one of the dessert ones, but I was stuffed after lunch. The guys working behind the counter were very nice (and cute) and the decorating and atmosphere was pleasant and clean. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the service excellent. I will be eating here again soon. I had the Cajun chicken and my wife had chicken pot pie. Both were just amazing. Andy was the best server. Fast efficient and made excellent suggestions."}
{"text":"I was at the same party as Dani C. Though they were called in advance AND the party person was there 30 minutes early, they wouldn't seat anyone until most of the group arrived. We had to take one table and hover around waiting for another. Then we waited so long for service one family had to leave. 90 minutes after I arrived someone finally took my dinner order.

I've been here before and pastys just aren't my thing. Haven't found one I liked so I tried their chicken caesar salad instead. It was a large serving but mediocre. 

The only thing I like about this place is the Strongbow on tap. Many of my friends love it so I'll end up going back but it's not someplace I'd chose on my own."}
{"text":"Was brought some food for my birthday and had never eaten there before. We had the Royale with cheese, shepherd's pie, chicken pot pie, bangers and mash. We have the oven crispy with jalapenos, the meal was so good and I plan to seat inside next time."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad trip here. They have a great selection of beer, and everything on the menu is amazing. If you're not familiar with Cornish pasties, they're basically homemade hot pockets. The gobbler is my favorite, but treat these things like Pokemon and try them all! :)"}
{"text":"Super delicious we love coming to this place. Tons of vegetarian options that are packed full of flavor. The only downside is tonight I ordered the Balle Mare and the first round was great. The second round was definitely a mojito, it had basil swimming in it, I told our waitress and she looked at me like I was nuts. There's no basil listed in the drink ingredients on the menu. I didn't freak out but found it odd that two different bartenders would have that drastic of a take on one specialty drink. Either way we'll be back. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Always delicious. The mexican with oven chips with garlic to start. Great meal every time."}
{"text":"This is so great, I don't have to have Tony's Pasties FedExed from Michigan anymore! 
Thanks Cornish Pasty, gosh you're nice!
AND vegetarian/vegan!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater, so this place doesn't have a lot to offer me (due to the way these are made, you can't special order anything). That being said what I did order was quite tasty, and I can see why this place is a favorite. Where things really shine is the dessert. I had the apple cinnamon pasty and wow! They hand make everything in house, including their caramel, which was absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"It is really difficult to try things other than our favorites, but last night we had the Cornish meatballs app ($7.75), the Guinness Stew pasty ($10), and the Chicken Greek pasty ($9.75).  None of which we had ever had before.  Those meatballs are fantastic.  What a rich flavor.  I'm going to try to duplicate it.  They are like Swedish meatballs on steroids.  Highly recommend those.  The meatballs are bacon-wrapped.  What else do you need to know?

The Guinness stew pasty was stuffed full of everything you'd expect to find in a stew and had a rich, beefy flavor.  That one is comfort food for sure.  My husband had the Chicken Greek pasty and we enjoyed the flavors in that one as well, especially the kalamata olives.  Those always add something great.  

I also tried the Founders special beer they had on tap, without asking too many details because I like their brews.  It was the Breakfast Stout and it's a good strong one, priced at $9.  It paired very well with the Guinness pasty.

He had his usual, the Rogue Hazelnut brown, and then we tried the Leffe Blonde Ale.  Someday I'm going to go to Belgium to meet the monks who make such great beer.  What a gig that must be.  That one was very different from what we had been drinking, but exceptional all the same.  Now I have an excuse to go to the liquor store and look for some to have at home.  All in we spent about $50.  Mica took great care of us at the bar.  Always look forward to Cornish Pasty Co."}
{"text":"What a great unique place! Great atmosphere! It's as authentic as it gets! After living in Ireland and traveling around Europe this has a divine find. English food is good..don't believe me try this place! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the service is OK at best."}
{"text":"hmmmm. idk. is it a gourmet hot pocket? 

i had the bangers and mash. i probably would have liked it a lot more had it not been hot pocket style. the gravy was great. there wasn't a lot of sausage and i love the grilled onions

we also split the pb&j and that was alright. i liked the rasberry jam. but idk, the whole wrapping everything in a dough sorta turned me off. not sure if i will go back."}
{"text":"As someone who does not eat nonkosher meat, Cornish pasty has a ton of vegetarian selections and a salmon selection.  Their pasties are so perfectly cooked,  so flaky, have no grease, and always taste fresh.  I always order the vegetarian traditional pasty (forgot what its called) that has fake ground meat, cheddar cheese, mashed potatoes, and peas.  It is great..  Such good flavors all mixed together in that perfect dough.  Also, it costs less than 10$!

The negatives are that a pasty is not quite enough to fill me up for dinner, and they do not come with anything.  The soups are pretty good though, especially the walnut one.  I am not a fan of any of their sides that I have tried such as the oven baked chips or beans.  You are better off ordering 2 pasties and taking the leftovers home rather than ordering a pasty and a side."}
{"text":"Rosemary chicken was scrumptious! The  mustard cream sauce was a great complement. One pasty will definitely fill you up. Then share some fries and you're golden! They have a variety of pasties and I want to try more! It is almost like a calzone but better...gourmet hot pocket!

Oven chips, or awesome fries are fantastic with jalapeno. YUMMMM. 

I brought it all to-go, but I'd like to eat in because the ambiance seems chill and pretty rad."}
{"text":"I hate to use the term \"hipster\" but that is all I can think about when referring to Cornish Pasty.  The ambiance is one of a kind.  My all time favorite.  I feel like a completely different person when I'm sitting in side.  It has somewhat of a publike feel, with long wooden benches as seating inside - great way to meet strangers, a long bar area, and a huge patio section.

I'd have to say, if you're trying this place out for the first time, go for dinner! The ambiance is quite different and has a dark mysterious factor that I really enjoy.  There aren't really any lights other than the kitchen.  To add to the mysterious effect, each table is lit with a long white candle placed on an old empty wine shaped bottle.

The restaurant comes with a full bar, as well a huge specialty beer menu.  They even have decently priced Irish car bombs. 
The service is amazing, as all the staff is very friendly and down to earth.  But don't expect fast service- the food there is made to order, which is a great time to explore and cultivate yourself with a new flavor of beer. 

If you're a Pasty virgin, it's like a really fancy hot pocket.  Someone first described to to me like a calzone, which I think lessened my first experience, because I had completely different expectations.  However, it didn't fully ruin my experience because I still loved it.

 Cornish Pasty has a HUGE menu selection for pasties.! With over 40 different styles, there isn't something that won't strike your fancy.  They have their Signature, Premium, and Vegetarian Pasties.  You're bound to struggle trying to decide what best suits you at that moment.

It's been a while since my first couple of visits to Cornish Pasty so I don't remember what I tried.  But the last time around I ordered the Peppered Steak; Sirloin steak, sauteed portabella mushrooms, leeks, roasted zucchini, and Stilton cheese- with a side of peppercorn brandy cream sauce.
I have to say, their sauces are to die for.  Nothing I can compare it to.

I've read a lot about their desserts, but I have yet to try it. Every time I venture out to this spot, I'm full by the time I'm done with half my pasty.
But I'm determined to try their Apple Caramel Pasty next time.  I hear it's all the rage."}
{"text":"Really good meat pies here I enjoyed this place. The beer here is really cheap! I got 20 ounces of Guinness for five dollars. Food wise I had the porkies. The filling was delicious and the crust was nice and crispy. I would definitely go here again. Service was also very nice."}
{"text":"So this place is SO F'n good that when I went it was TOO BUSY!  My service was not good but after talking to management, I discovered they were down on staff for this reason or that.  Our bill was reducted by 50% for the inconvenience!  I can't say enough about the customer service!  Stellar!  The food, well that speaks for itself.
Even though my experience wasn't the best the 1st time around, they made it right and I WILL BE BACK!  I give this joint 2 thumbs high up in the air!!"}
{"text":"This place is in our regular restaurant rotation and I have yet to find something I don't like here! 
The Peppered Steak pasty is my favorite but I also LOVE the Chicken Greek, Carne Adovada and Pesto Chicken. If your not in the mood for a pasty, even their salads are spot on. Don't leave without having the Banoffee Pie or PB&J pasty. Your taste buds will explode!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. However, the service left some to be desired. Our drinks were empty for 3/4 of our meal and only when we asked for them to be filled, was it done."}
{"text":"I drank the 34oz pitcher of Hoegarden by myself. Like a boss. The only challenge was actually LIFTING the 34oz pitcher.... which was a struggle.

I liked Cornish Pasty Co because its simple: pastys, beer and a couple of sides. No worries if you're vegetarian or pescatarian or whatever the hell you're in to these days (seriously people!)  they have every kind of pasty you want, and all delicious.

I got the sheppard's pie with the traditional fillings (mash potatoes, gound beef, peas and carrots) and gravy dipping sauce.  

Mmmmmmm, the delicious taste of an English heart attack.

The pasty was decent in size (filling enough for a whole meal for sure), came piping hot and had great flavor. The gravy dipping sauce was the best and they should probably put waaaaay more of it on your plate than the small cup you get with your pasty. Add some side orders of their chips (garlic and jalapeno please) and you've got yourself a manly meal. 

For those into decor: this place has it. Very simple style, candle-lit and long tables, almost picnic-style. Easy, simple, down to earth. I don't need more than that.

5 stars all around. Did I mention that I finished my 34oz pitcher of Hoegarden? Like a Boss? Really, I did."}
{"text":"We preferred the more traditional meat and cheese pasty  to the chicken tiki pasty. Both are good but the mustard sauce and gravy that come with the meat n cheese are an absolutely the perfect compliment to the cheesy, flaky pasty.  Tried and true comfort food combinations.  Love the flavors and the red wine gravy is indeed very tasty.

My husband is a big eater.  He recommends getting one or two sides if your hungry and want to fill up ( I was fine with just a pasty)."}
{"text":"SO love this place. I used to visit their location in Tempe from time to time, but now I'm a bit south of there and decided to try another location. And you know what? Still just as fantastic."}
{"text":"Great little place, great food too. Between the tattoo and piercing-ridden staff and the interesting decor, this place reminds me of 'back home'. It really looks like a spot I would have enjoyed going to in the Park Ave. area of Rochester, NY. The place has some communal seating (complete with vintage church pews as benches) and also an outdoor area for people who can't get enough of the heat (or like to smoke, I suppose).

The menu is vast - I was amazed at all the different pasty options I had. I do wish they had the traditional without rutabega, but I settled on one with beef, cheddar and potatoes instead. It was moist and flavorful and the crust was perfect. I know what a \"real\" pasty is and although these are slightly different than what I'm used to, they are definitely worth it.

One thing to note - thought not surprising - their beer selection is not run of the mill. I asked for a Bud Light and the server looked at me like I was from outer space. After she helpfully pointed out the options on their beer menu (with offerings from mostly European breweries) I had the opportunity to try something new, and I was happy for it."}
{"text":"I just moved here from SD and this is the first place Ive found with the slightest hint of authenticity or originality.

The servers are tastefully rude in a way that is amusing and contributes to the dark atmosphere. Everything inside is dark, old, and antiquely, which together with the black and white gothic portraits an candlestick lighting makes you feel like you're in an alfred hitchcock movie.

The food is outstanding. I had some kind of mexican food pasty and every bite was delicious. If you've never been here and are a fan of anything alternative or outside of the box, I highly recommend you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I dream about the red wine gravy.  I love that there are so many options...but I always go with the original pasty.  The meatball appetizer is INSANELY delicious.  I wish there was a pasty filled with it!!!"}
{"text":"Hot vegan chicken pasty with 32 oz Guinness and Smithwicks aka Blacksmith.   The chicken is made of portobello mushrooms that are excellent.   

With 50s and 60s music playing in the background made the evening out excellent.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were staying at a local hotel and looking for a place where we could dine outside on the patio with our Golden Retriever.  A friend who lives nearby told us about Cornish Pasty. We had no idea what a pasty was but looking at the menu online and it looked interesting. We were not disappointed. Both of our pasties were superb. We will be back in AZ next week and plan on dining here again. Wish they had these in Southern California."}
{"text":"Really fantastic English pub fare and a great beer list. I'm always looking for some good craft or international beers, and this place did the trick. Bartender was knowledgeable and service was quick. The tandoori chicken wings were the bomb.com, as was the baked cheesy broccoli cauliflower, and just about everything we had. Looking for some decent British pub fare, and good dranks? Look no more. Also- they use the Ballast Point bloody Mary Mix- big props for that!"}
{"text":"I tried the bangers and mash pasty, it came with gravy and tasted very tasty! I also had the sticky toffee bread pudding which was amazing, my favorite!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! If your in Tempe and are looking for some good food you need to go here. They never disappoint with their service or food! It's a cute little place with a large menu with options for everyone. They sell basically high class calzones each with their own unique dipping sauce. The only complaint I have is the restaurant is very dark. It's hard to see since there is very little lighting. Other than that 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here and was not disappointed. They hand make their pasties fresh. I ordered the original Oggie and took hall home. It came with a delightful red wine sauce and my server gave me a fresh container to take with my leftovers. Servers all worked as a team whether it was refilling drinks or bringing out food. 

My friend ordered the potato and leek soup which came with two large slices of homemade white bread. Very tasty. 

I would definitely come back and try more items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Oh Cornish Pasty Company... your acoustics aren't great and your tables do need a bit of cleaning but your food is so delicious I see and hear nothing else. The bangers and mash pasty coupled with a side of mushy pea is quite possibly the best thing I've ever had. Top it off with great service and a beautiful atmosphere and I'm in love. I have heard that they are opening a location in Vegas and implore anyone from management reading to open a Tucson location!"}
{"text":"A+ as always! $3.00 Irish car bombs... Can't beat that, plus the awesome food! Been going here for years!"}
{"text":"Went with my family expecting great things based on comments from friends. The place was dark and loud with extremely slow service. The food was carb-loaded and dry. I am at an utter loss as to why this place seems to have an almost cult-like following. I did like my beer, and I see beer routinely mentioned in these favorable reviews (insert glowing \"I love you, man\" restaurant review here). Really thinking I ought to give this place a second try if for no other reason than I trust my friends' opinions and might have just had a random bad experience."}
{"text":"I have a friend who might as well live here, so when he suggested that we meet him I was curious to see why. As it turns out, it might be because of their alcohol options as opposed to their food options. 

The soup options looked tasty, so I went for one while we waited for our friend to show. I ordered the leek soup. The soup itself was nearly a revalation, but I was not a fan of the bread. I love bread, so this was a little sad for me. The soup was creamy, had just the right amount of cheese, and somehow managed to not be overly leeky. Five stars on soup.

There was an impressive amount of beer options, according to my husband.

I ordered The Pilgrim. The dough was delicious, as was the turkey. I could have done without the large slices of onion and par-cooked yams (which didn't taste very \"Thanksgiving\" to me anyway). When I caught a bit of stuffing it made me very happy. I didn't like the gravy, but didn't need it anyway as the pasty was not dry. There was also a side of cranberry relish. I ate it all and took an additional cup home for my left overs (the soup was filling).

The second half of my pasty came home and spent the night in our fridge. It was far better having rested there for the evening. I was impressed with how much more I liked the pasty on day 2.  Four stars on pasty alone.

Seating indoors was strange, not suited for a couple having a dinner date, but ok for drinks. Seems as if though the bench-seating and dark atmosphere would be cool for pre-game drinking, perhaps with a large group of friends. It was slow when we were there, which I understand may be uncommon."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. My wife and best friend are as well. My favorite pasty so far is the peppered steak and I love me some four peaks oatmeal stout. Friendly service and a fun atmosphere make this a great place to feed my face and get my buzz on. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"What a FANTASTIC find!  My first trip to Ireland was earlier this year, and I've been craving pasties ever since.  After a random Google search, I found this place..followed by a quick lookup of reviews on Yelp.  Let me tell you, the excellent reviews on Yelp are spot on!

Today was my first visit.  I ordered 2 pasties for pickup during my lunch hour, as I figured I'd eat half of each one and save the rest for dinner(IF it was any good).  I got the Cheese Steak(10 out of 10) and the Shepherd's Pie(8 out of 10).  After a 15 minute drive back to work, they were still piping hot!  And the taste absolutely blew me away.  The Cheese Steak was PHENOMENAL....it will be hard not to order that the next few times I go, but eventually I'd like to try the many other creations they have.

I've heard their Happy Hour is fantastic, so I intend on rounding up some friends to check that out sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Food is crazy good, here. Authentic, and also some with a twist. 

Fantastic place to take friends for fun! Pricepoint is wonderful, and the atmosphere is casual. Staff is very friendly. Love  you guys!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  This place is great!  I take every visitor we have to Cornish Pasty.  I have been here almost 10 times now and I am still finding new favorites on the menu.  All the Pasty's are awesome.  Even the pasta salad is great.  Great place!"}
{"text":"It's really frustrating that I've never actually been able to try the pasties I want because they're always sold out. You shouldn't be sold out of half your menu at 5:30pm. This is poor management."}
{"text":"Back for 3rd time. 3rd time is charm. Had the peppered steak pasty. The crust was golden brown, flaky and light. When dipped in sauce, it was delicious. The vegetables were fresh tasting. The steak hard to find, was enjoyable. This Pasty also benefited from extra bleu cheese added. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"By far my new favorite go to. The vibe is great, the service was great. Don't think you would regret anything off the menu. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've about given up finding anything outstanding in this area. Why is everything so highly rated but yet not really that good? My pasty was dry and had so much pepper I could not taste any of the ingredients."}
{"text":"I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And don't forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you can't beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome meals! I've never tried before this kind of food and it's delicious. I went with my family (4 people), each one asked a different dish and everyone was really satisfied. Great service, fair prices and awesome food... !! And don't forget the desserts!!!!"}
{"text":"When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends. 

Besides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub. The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding. 

One of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB). It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth. Granted the beer back then was warmer. LOL

As we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here. We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals. Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken. There was a lot of laughing. Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company. What a great atmosphere!

We started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling. Both hit the spot nicely. 

For dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50). I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!

Both, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.  In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette. But not here. Surprising they were only $9.00 each. Incredible. 

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00). Both were also delicious. 

Each of the above items were very filling. We couldn't finish them, or the desserts. So we had four \"to go\" boxes for later. I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.  Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities. 

We'll be back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There must be something special to this place when a surgeon after seeing him tells you to go have something wonderful and be bad before I have surgery. This is my first time here and it's early so it's not crowded yet but it smells wonderful inside the diner room. I was seated right away and the waitress came and went over the menu with me she had a good knowledge of the menu which is nice. I have had English food in the pubs in London and all over England so we'll see how this meets English standards.  OMG my lunch was so good!!!!!!!.my pastry melted in my mouth.  It was filled to the brim with steak potatoes  and mushrooms.   Will i be back? yes,yes,yes"}
{"text":"This is the first stop in Arizona and what a surprise. I tried the Greek pasty which was delicious with tzatziki sauce on the side. Great beer selection. Sit outside and enjoy the weather!"}
{"text":"Very good for a great price AND a variety of vegetarian selections! I was excited, my BF took me here for my b-day and we were not disappointed. I could only eat half of my pasty and so we skipped desert. Beers were reasonably priced too. 
We will be back but I am afraid my kids would be scared \"everything is touching\" eeekkk!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with my girlfriend! Staff was very friendly especially the cook Kyle. We had a great time talking with him and watching him cook as we ate. Food was amazing and beer selection was awesome! 10/10 we will be back"}
{"text":"Food is great. Ambiance is awesome. Lot to do if you're waiting for your food. They have a pool table,  dart board. Good collection of beers if you just want to seat and drink. A lot of options for vegetarians as well. Veggie chicken tikka is my fav."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited this long to write a review. I have been to the Cornish a dozen times and love it more with each experience. You can go for just a beer, car bomb, or their tasty pasty. A a cold Rogue and switch it up between the Greek (w/chicken) or the Carne Adovada. 

Trust me once you have it you will always crave it. I went to Germany for 7 months and all my friends would tell me I just had or about to have a pasty. Well this is the one place I missed from home. 

Thanks for having multiple locations! Maybe one is Scottsdale is to come?!! 

PS their staff rocks!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Cornish pastys. I have to admit we were both dubious enough that we briefly considered going elsewhere when we found out we couldn't customize our orders because the pastys are premade and partially cooked as it takes an hour to cook one from start to finish. 

The ambiance was cool with a flavor of Britain - long communal tables, dark wood interior and bars to belly up to. Definitely doesn't feel like you're in Arizona anymore! We had instantly been transported to a pub in England.  

The quality of food was extremely high. I won't tell you everything we ordered because we will sound like gluttons, but I will say we took home leftovers from every dish because the the portions are ample. 

My husband had the oggie and I had the Mexican. Both were very good but my husband said he would order mine next time. The prices were very reasonable! We were shocked at how low our bill was and how many leftovers we had. 


All in all, worth the visit. We look forward to bringing friends and family back to enjoy this unique and flavorful spot!"}
{"text":"My hiking friend and I stopped here after a weekend hiking in the white mountains. The pasty menu is very extensive, so it took some time in choosing which one to get. 

I finally decided on the peppered steak. The server asked me if i was OK with Stilton cheese (similar to blue), and I assured her that was fine. The pasty was very tasty, with numerous slices of tender steak, caramelized onions, portobello mushrooms and zucchini. The aforementioned cheese was just the right amount. I also looked the side of brandy  peppercorn cream sauce. 

The service was a bit slow, but other than that, it was a great find. I'll definitely add this to my list of places to eat when I'm ever back in the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"Great, different, fun place to go.  Church pew seating inside..sometime share with other people (no problem) or outside seating.  If you like something different, give it a try!  Great dinner and unusual beers to choose from.  I had Chicken Greek and it was terrific.  Others had Shepherd's Pie, Pilgrim, Steak and potatoes and everyone liked theirs. Kind of loud which we enjoyed, but if looking for nice quiet place, this is not it.  All tables had candles melted into liquor bottles.  Fun and good!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty has a very strong English pub atmosphere, accentuated by its industrial stools and wooden benches.  The best way to describe a pasty is a gourmet hot pocket.   The fillings come in all types from traditional lamb and mint to the southwestern influence of chiptole chicken.  I had the lamb and mint pasty, comprised of chunky pieces of lamb, carrots, and potatoes, with the aroma of fresh mint.  This is their specialty.  Another one I tried was their Shepard's pie.  This is a traditional Shepard's pie incased in a flaky crust.  The filling is minced lamb meat with herbs and spices mixed with mashed potatoes.  Each individual ingredient didn't seem all that special, but mixed together, it created a masterpiece in my mouth.  The flavors blended well together.  I also ordered their \"chips\" (french fries for us Americans).  They cut baked potato wedges which are great for the health-conscience people.  It's seasoned with sautéed garlic and parmesan cheese.  The seasoning wasn't too stron.g  It gave the potato a subtle garlic flavor unlike some other restaurant which over-season their fries. 
 
Come to this bloody good restaurant to experience a casual British pub without the price of a plane ticket."}
{"text":"We went to Cornish Pasty for the first time last Friday with two other couples from our neighborhood.  My husband and I had the Oggie.  We both liked it.  The meat inside was very tender and moist.  We also had a Greek side salad and tried the Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert with ice cream.  All the food if very good.  
The atmosphere however was distressing.  It was so dark that we had to use a flash light to read the menus. Luckily one of the men in our group had a small flash light in his pocket.  (He has dined here before.)  It was very noisy with loud music and talking so that we could barely carry on a conversation.  Is there ever a quieter time here?  I think next time we'll just do take out.
The place was crowded with 30 somethings so they must not mind the dark and noise."}
{"text":"Delicious. We had the vegetarian Oggie, chicken pesto pasty, cottage pie pasty, and broccoli cauliflower bake.  The pasty crust is well done, no undercooked spots, flaky but not greasy. The filings were generous. We ordered take out and waited at the bar. The bartenders were great, they kept a lookout for our order,  gave good info on the many beers they carry. The Papago brewing Orange Blossom ale is great. And they have a lot of good things on draft. Overall a great take out experience; food was still warm when we got home. Good job Dobson location!"}
{"text":"I love the food - lots of different varieties! Atmosphere is nice and laid back. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place was great!!  First off let me say there are so many choices of Pasties on the menu it is hard to decide.  I went in torn between the Greek and the Cottage Pie.  I went with the cottage Pie and an order of their chips.  The cottage pie was fantasic!!  The wine gravy was out of this world.  As for the chips, YUM!  The waitress was a sweetheart.  The music was just the volume.  Lot's beers to choose from if your a drinker.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My fiancee grew up eating pasties in England that his grandmother made and he hadn't had anything like it  in many years, so we decided to try Cornish Pasty Co.  Nice, quaint atmosphere, roomy seating, great beer selection.  When our food arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was, especially the gravy.  More importantly, my fiancee was over the moon at how the crust tasted \"just like Nan's\" .  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Chandler location: Gave me so much indigestion I thought I was going to die. It took 60 minutes to receive my order. 

Phoenix location: took 80 minutes to receive any of the items our table ordered. Large chicken bone stabbed my cousin right under the tongue. Gnarly puncture wound. Meal was comped, still would never go back."}
{"text":"Awesome British food:Yes 
Relaxed atmosphere: Yup
Hot waiter: Oh, Yeah"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Our host Hannah was also real lovely, thumbs up to her!!! We will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"Yum!  Yum!  Yum!

I went with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded.  She got some Thanksgiving Turkey pasty with stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce on the side.  She said it was wonderful.  As a vegetarian there was a whole page of choices!!  I went with the Mock Rosemary Chicken one the waitress recommended.  I really liked it... mock chicken, brie cheese, mushrooms, potatoes, roasted red peppers and a sweet mustard sauce on the side.

It was so filling that I couldn't even finish it.  Which is a bit of a bummer because I wanted one of the delish sounding desserts so bad.  I must make a special trip some night soon just for dessert.

The atmosphere was trendy, fun and friendly.  The service was GREAT.  The food was cheap and as good as it gets.

What took me so long to finally try this place?  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"we are obsessed with this place, and come here once a week, usually late weekend night. The food is delicious, and their beer selection is awesome.

We usually start out with the tandoori wings[ spicy, but to me everything lately is], with a badass dipping sauce, then we go for the pasties.My favorite are the salmon one and the rosemary chicken and brie.

My guy usually goes for the traditional guiness stew or bangers and mash.

yum.yum.yum.

Very casual place, can get very loud on weekends."}
{"text":"Dare I say it... This might be my favorite pasty location yet! I came here with my date the other night and I loved the ambiance of the inside. I ordered be leek soup with bread and it was divine. They also have beer specials each night, on Thursday it was dollar off bottles and cans! Their patio a decent size but the inside is where it's at! 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I kept seeing this place on Yelp and had to try it, I will say I loved the pasty I had (Turkey & cranberry).

Overall I was very happy with my meal with the exception that there were no sides offered with it.  Fries, chips, cole slaw, something!

Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here.  The food and drinks are always delicious, and have yet to disappoint.  The service is a bit slow but super friendly and super accommodating.  Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm not big on trying new things. I try new things but I'm always afraid I won't like it. I guess you can say I am an adventure but in denial!  Hehe. Ok so my boyfriend loves loves to try anything.  First time I cam here I got a ceaser ckn salad and it was awesome I will say. Second time we came here his sister was in town with her boyfriend from Massachusetts visiting. Beer is awesome so I hear from my boyfriend and his sis and her boyfriend. I like wheat beers so I'm picky. But I won't say the beer isn't good just because I am a selective person. Ok so we all got pastes I got a salmon asparagus one and I can't remember what everyone else got but I will def say there was no complaints coming from anyone! I am normally good at not over stuffing myself but this was to good to pass up! Haha. Service was great! Was sat immediately maybe a min for them to get our drinks which was great! No complaints here. Dont eat to much you come here or your missing out on the pastes!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at the Cornish Pasty company. Actually, I always leave happily full and slightly buzzed. 

The Cornish Pasty company is definitely a hipster place. Very dark inside the with wax candles and techno music. Lots of beards and man buns found here but the staff is always warm and very friendly. 

The food is decent but heavy. A Cornish Pasty is basically a large pastry filled with meats and cheeses usually accompanied by a cold, refreshing beer. Reminds me a lot of my European study abroad. Sometimes, during the Arizona summers, I feel like the food is overwhelmingly heavy.

I actually like the beers and ciders better than the actual food. They always have something different in tap every time I come. I like it. 

I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent server!  He won us over, especially with the Boston accent.  We split a Shepherd's Pie and Mexican pasty - both were out of this world!  Cleaned our plates and finished it off with the server's recommendation of sticky toffee pudding with 1+ shot of Jameson poured on top!  Way better than a Thanksgiving dinner!"}
{"text":"This is an experience worth going. I had  the veggie cottage pie, my husband had the chicken pot pie pasty. The crust is very flaky and holds up to the filling. We were all happy with our meat/veggie pies and drinks. I had a drink called Ghost something or other and it tasted like a big White Russian. Very tasty food and drink."}
{"text":"A go to place for a filling, warm and delicious meal! When you think pasty you might just think of the traditional meat and potatoes, but this spot offers SO much more. Being a non meat eater I enjoy their long list of vegetarian pasty options. I have pretty much tried them all and there is not one that I do not like. 

If I had to give my favorites they would be: Veggie Spicy Asiago, Veggie Rosemary & Veggie Pesto. All equally delicious! 

The restaurant itself definitely has a hipster vibe- dark, wine bottles with candle wax dripping down the side, old church pews as table benches. They also have a large outdoor patio. 

Don't have time for a sit down meal? Call in your order to go. They will either cook them hot and ready to eat or half bake them and you can pop them in your oven at home to eat when you are ready. 

For take out, dine in or a late night bite and a beer this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Their vegan vindaloo pasty is amazing.  Every day that have two vegan options... great atmosphere, food, and service."}
{"text":"I visited Cornish Pasty 2-3 weeks ago. It was my second time eating at this location. The food is always fantastic, but the service was particularly spot-on, too. Our waitress (wish I could remember her name) was great about checking in and always making sure our water glasses were full without being intrusive. It was honestly some of the best restaurant service I've ever had. I had the chicken pesto pasty, and my husband had the royale with cheese pasty. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food completely outdone by the most disturbingly disgusting interior ever!  I've always eaten outside before, and had I never done inside, this would have been a five-star review.  However, the last time I went,  it was so hot out that we decided to eat inside.  I sat at the bar area where you could see the kitchen.  The floor appears to have NEVER been cleaned, there was garbage everywhere, and I watched employees scraping food leftovers, crumbs, etc. onto the floor and leaving it there.  I also observed an employee with bare hands reach into a bucket that was setting on a cart and toss a handful of some kind of meat from the bucket onto a salad.  The bucket was not refrigerated and had sat there for who knows how long.  I was so appalled that not only did we not order any food, we actually left our alcohol behind.  The glass ware was dirty, the silverware was filthy, and the place was just an outright mess.  I have to give 2 stars at least because I know the food tastes really good, but I'd never be able to eat here again after seeing these conditions.  The owner should be seriously ashamed."}
{"text":"I stopped in earlier this month with a friend. We went on a Tuesday night, and almost completely had the place to ourselves. That was OK  as we were able to chat without yelling @ each other, and were able to chat a little bit with Heidi. Great gal...very friendly service. I ordered the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty), mushy peas (mainly after gauging my friend's expression of comfort to see them on the menu...childhood memories no doubt), and chips (potato wedges). I wasn't overwhelmed by the food. However, is English food ever overwhelming?. The pasty was a little dry and the wine gravy takes some getting used to. Although the beef was lean, it wasn't too tender. I can't say I'd recommend on the food, but the Strongbow Cider and the Hoegaarden were both pretty good. Also stuck around to play some Cricket @ the dartboard, which probably wouldn't have normally been available. I think it seems like a good place to have some drinks with friends, and soak up a good crowd atmosphere on a busier night."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house and has an excellent beer selection and the food is amazing. The ambience is also pretty good it's low-lit and Candlelight."}
{"text":"One of my places I take friends and family. Never disappointed went with 6 other ppl to drink play pool and hang out . only my wife and I were hungry. I ordered the meat and cheese she had the pasta salad , our friends were not hungry i'll say again so I went ahead and ordered oven chips and garlic roasted potatoes and had them put in front of them . My pasty was so moist and so scrumptious I was blown away . Wife had help from our friends finishing hers. As for the oven chips and potatoes they disappeared. Top notch service from Eric the bartender whom was swamped but managed to keep our drinks full our friends happy and me very content as I count on this place when entertaining friends. I'm just sorry I can only give you guys 5 stars. Thx again love Tim and Peggy"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend. Great atmosphere and amazing food.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My 1st experience here.  Unfortunately, I had the breakfast pasty and didn't particularly enjoy the way the flavours mixed.  I would certainly give the place one more chance and try a different pasty.  Other than my disappointing menu choice, the service was average, the ambience was cool and unique.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Love love love!

Haven't had a pasty I didn't like from this place!

Pros:
-Great/friendly staff
-Lots of good options to explore on the menu (including vegetarian options)
-Nice variety of beers and decent  happy hour specials
-Fun/down-to-earth feel

Cons:
-You essentially seat yourself, which can get tricky if you're going with a large group. The staff is usually accommodating, though, and will try to find space to fit your entire party.
-I don't believe you can really \"customize\" your pasty (i.e. switching the type of meats)

My favorite is the Royale with Cheese. Get it with the both homemade BBQ sauce AND the thousand island sauce. It's basically a cheeseburger in pasty form and it's oh so good. Another favorite is the Pilgrim--sweet potatoes, chicken/turkey, and you HAVE to get it with the side of cranberry sauce. Delicious."}
{"text":"I've been making and eating pasty all my life. The majority of my family comes from Cornwall. The pasties we make are nowhere near as good as the ones they make. Do yourself a favor and get one as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good quality food, and a decent selection of beers. We went there for lunch, and were not disappointed. The layout of the restaurant is unique, the pasties are a pretty filling and tasty, and the service was prompt and efficient. Oh, and the mushroom spinach soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yelpers seem to love it. Place was packed on Friday night. Service was good. 

I had Bangers snd Mash pasty. My wife had pepper steak pasty. Red wine sauce was tasty.  Both were good. 

My problem is that the food and service was good. Not great. Good enough to take leftovers home, but not good enough to return. Average, at best."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not sure what else to say, if you haven't been, you should go."}
{"text":"Good laid back vibe with people flying around hitting timers and taking food out of ovens.  Those pastys are good, and the variety is amazing.  Dog Fish Head on tap is a plus as well.  To quote the infamous Governor of California \" I will be back.\""}
{"text":"The temperature of my meatballs and pasty were questionable, I ate them despite being cold and like warm. I told the server, she said that is out of the norm. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Everything is good here, great place to stop by for lunch or dinner. So many different pasties. Would love to try them all!

Great beer selection, too.

It is permanently in our rotation of restaurants to eat at when in Phoenix area for annual spring training trip. 

See you next year!"}
{"text":"This place definitely live up to the reputation. These pasties are so on point and are reasonably priced. There is a good selection of beer and great atmosphere. Be prepared to share a table with another group but don't worry about it being awkward. I will be back soon for more, the shepherds pie won me over."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I read about this place - it was something I never thought I'd find. Backstory - when I was a teenager and would hang out weekends in Harvard Square my favorite place to eat was Warburtons - anyone remember it? It all connected with the Susan Howatch novels (Penmarric) I was reading at the time - anyway I digress. Suffice it to say that the whole pasty concept was intriguing and this place was terrific. It closed down years ago but I kept hoping I'd find something similar ... someday.

To present day, newly come to the area. We finally made it to the Mesa location. I was glad there wasn't a wait, but walking in was a strange experience. It was dark, loud with no one at the entrance to seat us. Figured it wasn't that kind of place. The decor was a definite turnoff for me - cold, weird seating that felt like a black and white railroad car. I hate to be nit-picky but the first thing I saw when I sat down was a spider going up the wall next to me.

Ok, enough on atmosphere. The food ... huge menu that's a lot of fun to look at with lots of choices. I had the Greek salad and Greek chicken pasty. The salad was great - enough for 2. MH had the Mexican, which was actually quite spicy, and he's very used to spice. Overall our opinion on the pasties was ... ok. Quite filling - we only had half each. However, we thought they'd be a bit bigger to justify the cost, or a dollar or two cheaper since they don't come with anything else.  The dough was sturdy, well formed for holding the fillings but it was definitely hard.

Re: the service - it was good - she was friendly ... but it was hard to find anyone when we wanted anything, especially when we wanted to pay and leave.

I hesitated writing this since everyone seems to love it so much, but this was my experience ... not bad, but not somewhere I want to spend my precious restaurant dollars for a so-so experience. The atmosphere was kind of off-putting. Given everything, I don't think we'll be back. And I had such hopes! Sorry Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"You've got to give this place a try!  The ambiance is great.  Eclectic flair, and most of the employees have piercings and tattoos.  Their pasties are soooo good.  You should know that when you order, the ingredients cannot be subbed out.  They come as they are written.  Everybody we bring here loves this place too.  Their beer selection is great, offering local brews from around Arizona.  Prices are reasonable.  Was surprised this past weekend that they had the turkey and stuffing pasty and I was thrilled to order it.  Each time I come, they are out of that one.  It was delicious!!  Wife had the eggplant parm pasty and nobody took home leftovers on this night!"}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from this place and it's in a strip mall I visited frequently, but I never went. I assumed it was a mom and pop place with consistently good food (it outlasted many other businesses in the complex), but maybe a little boring. My sister suggested we go there for a family dinner and I was so surprised when I walked in! Finally, a reason to check that little box for \"hipster\" ambience on Yelp! 

Every server who walked by greeted me and told me I could just take a seat, but unfortunately there was not a big enough table for my group, so we started the list, which just grew and grew as more people tried to get in for their pasties! They have great patio tables outside and long community tables and bar seats inside in their newly expanded space. 

It was a little dark and loud once we finally sat - not good for an overly tired infant we had in tow or my dad who has a hard time hearing in loud settings. As I mentioned, all the servers were great, except for some reason, ours. She was very rushed and unfriendly unfortunately. But, despite that, I really liked the place! 

They have a whole page for vegetarian pasties, but once I actually look, I wasn't too impressed that they rely heavily on Quorn (fake meat), but there were a few choices of just veggies and I could get the balsamic mushroom pasty and be happy every time! However, my mom got the same, but with chicken and thought the balsamic taste was a little strong. They ran out of their chips, so we had their coleslaw, which was good. 

I definitely plan on going back, maybe trying their Tempe location for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a different Cornish Pasty location and had a much better experience with my food.  Otherwise, my review would have been 2 stars.  I ordered the Rosemary Chicken pasty and was pretty disappointed with the taste and quality of the item.  I would avoid it.  The chicken was low grade and the unappealing slimy texture of the items inside the pasty made it appear to be not fresh, like a glorified hot-pocket.  I did not like the choice in flavor of the cheese with the rosemary, and it was all rather bland.  My dinner party ordered the Pavlova desert, and it wasn't something I would order.  They all love that desert, but I found it very unappealing.  Lots of sugarless bland whipped cream, some fruit, and the meringue texture was just weird to me, but I have no idea if that's how the Pavlova is traditionally made.  Considering my first experience at a different location being good, I would try something else on the menu and avoid the Rosemary Chicken and Pavlova.  I personally wouldn't be quick to pick this place for dinner.  Our service was fine."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and catch up with friends. Awesome drink selection, including craft beers on tap. Shoot pool, listen to live music on Friday nights. The ambiance is chill with dim lighting, and it doesn't get overcrowded.

Tandoori wings and the Scotch eggs are tasty. The pasties here are amazing. I never knew I liked pasties until coming here and trying several different creations. I usually share one pasty with a friend, but if you're really hungry, get one all to yourself, but save room for the delicious beer! 

Great service, all the bartenders and servers I've come across are friendly. I love coming here for the comfortable, vintage vibe. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"A nice dog friendly place and the service was excellent. Both my husband and I had the Shepherds Pie Pastries. The crust was perfect, you bit into it and it was flaky and crunchy. It stayed together well. The sauce was creamy and complimented the pasties. It was filling and so good. I wish they had offered a mini sample platter so we could have tried more."}
{"text":"Great place for meat pies that are not common at most restaurants. The atmosphere is attracting the mid twenty year olds, with the music they play, so maybe if you're older eat on the patio. Lots of choices, even for vegetarians. The prices are a bit high for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty used to be our go to and a place we would tell everyone about. A place to go with friends and bring co-workers, and tell family about... And I do think this place is unique with a cool atmosphere and generally speaking the food is okay. And though usually the service is slow, forgetful, and lets be honest- sub par... we had a pretty good waitress today.  However, once she left her shift-- we were not checked up on or given coffee or water refills... for only... hmmm... 7 hours. My husband and I were catching up with a friend we hadnt been able to get together with in awhile...  and having great conversation... and the place was VERY empty today, on a Saturday.The outside was desolate, and there were at least four plus empty tables inside and a mostly empty bar on our way out. Not a good sign for business on a Saturday night. We kept waiting for someone to come over and offer us more water... we wanted to get some drinks, dinner, and dessert since we were there so long-- but NO ONE came to our table in all of that time. And no, I am not chasing down a waiter at a resteraunt to get service! One guy (the owner?) came to our table and lit the candle but did not offer any drinks or food seeing our glasses and to go boxes empty... he walked by us multiple times! Then the service folks decided to start looking our way and whispering... ( instead of trying to get a higher tab, funny) and a large group came in and was glaring at us (though there were many empty tables and couches in our vicinity). So we decided to leave- I mean it is hotter than hell in there, you can not feel the air conditioning!! This is Arizona come on people! No water!! I am so over this place. We literally sat there with money to spend and no service! We were testing them after awhile, waiting to see if someone would come over. We gave them every chance. I guess we will spend our money elsewhere. And I definitley will not be referring this place to anyone anymore as the food has also been going downhill for awhile. We got the pilgrim which was luke warm and mushy... and just not very flavorful. And the meat and cheese was crumbly and tasted like mince meat instead of sausage. Enough is enough."}
{"text":"I love this place- we are a vegan-vegetarian family and I can't believe I haven't heard of this until this year!  We come from Michigan originally where pasties were as common as lakes and these are AWESOME."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed that I haven't left a review for this place yet. I've eaten here for a good while and I've never been disappointed with the food. Well, there was this one time, but it was because it was sold out. I'm okay with that, it tells me it was really popular that night. Anyway...

The prices are good, the teas are good, and it's just fun to sit in the pews while watching the candles melt. Every friend I've brought here has had a good time with an equally good meal. I'm a sucker for the royale with cheese and a side of thousand island.

You know what, look at the average review score. I really think that's the most telling part of this place. Really. Go. Eat. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. The variety of different pastys are awesome!  Chicken tiki masala is definitely #1. The music gets a little weird but the atmosphere and awesome and the beer selection rocks. Not only that but they do have some of their pasty's in vegetarian form - so when you aren't feelin' meat you still get an freakin' awesome tasting pasty."}
{"text":"The only choice is the Oggie. The other options are for Emmits.
The Oggie has all of the right ingredients, and tastes great. Unfortunately, the meat and veg in the Pasty are mixed together and not layered, and the crimp is not traditional. They are also about half the size that they should be. Maybe a Saltash thing. Also, if you offer real tea, you need serve the right way, with milk, and options of honey or cream.

With all of the constructive comments said, the Pasty was great, the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"It is really surprising to me how so many reviewers can miss such an important point about this restaurant: It is absolutely not worth the money! I give this place 2 stars for it's good ambience and service. 

I ordered a Portobello Chicken Pastry and it was small. Taste was about okay and I ended up paying $12 before tip. I really think that they should have included a side or two with this."}
{"text":"The food at this place is so amazing!   I can't wait to go back.  I had the salmon pasty and it was a real joy to the mouth.  There were 6 in our party and all of us were very happy with our food.  My pasty was so large I could only eat half, YEAH I get to have the other half tomorrow for lunch"}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Company has quickly become a favorite of mine, and their location on Alma School and Baseline is a great option for devouring one of their baked gems.

The restaurant has a large interior and exterior seating area, although it can quickly become packed. A full bar is available with lots of English and American drink options including local beers.

Pasties are essentially large and far superior Hot Pockets filled with any number of options. My fellow diners chose the Carne Adovada with a spicy filling. I opted for the Peppered Steak with tender beef combined with Stilton cheese and vegetables in a pepper gravy. The combination was extremely delicious.

We shared a dessert similar to the southern banana pudding which was just OK. Service was slow on an otherwise slow night, but the food was worth it. This is a great option for groups with a wide variety of unique options or anyone wanting something different."}
{"text":"I have visited Cornish Pasty too many times to count: some visits before the expansion as well as after the expansion.  Each visit is consistently delicious as my first visit.  Cornish Pasty is definitely a favorite place for me, and I even have family and friends who are vegetarians and vegans who love it just as much!  The Place actually has more than just a couple selections for vegetarian options; they also have at least four different vegan pasty options.

I don't think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I can't exactly pinpoint an item for you to try, since I have loved everything I've tried... I will tell you, though, that I have tasted AT LEAST one item in each section: pasties, sides, soups, and salads, minus the dessert section, and everything is ALWAYS satisfactory!  If you need an recommendation for soup, the \"Mushroom, Walnut, and Spinach Soup\" will leave you feeling warm and good all inside.  I always end up feeling fully satisfied from one half of my pasty along with one side that is shared between me and my boyfriend, so I never have enough room for dessert.  It has been so hard to go in there and order only dessert, especially when their pasties calls my name!  However, I do keep hearing that all of their desserts are very good--I WILL try them some day!

Along with the food, I am impressed with the staff/service - my boyfriend and I always get exceptional service. Our waiters always go out of their way to make us feel like we matter!  I also dig the ambiance/seating arrangement.  Some of their seating is interesting, as they are equipped with church pews--it's a pretty cool touch.  With its pews and European atmosphere, I feel like I'm not in AZ anymore.  Now, if you find yourself going to Cornish Pasty more frequently, try to sit at the counter near the open kitchen at least once - it's fascinating to watch the cooks diligently and precisely make the food; a lot of love goes into the food and I think it shows in its delectable taste!

Just try it already! I hope you enjoy your experience here as I always do!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant/bar in town. The pasties are AMAZING and the beer choices are awesome, not mention decently priced (though together you should expect to spend about $40 for two people). The Chandler location is the only place I've ever found with Franziskaner Hefeweissen on tap!"}
{"text":"Tasty options no matter who you are or what you crave! This is not just standard English fare. The geniuses have conjured up Indian, Mediterranean, Mexican and American favorites that are all delicious. If you are vegetarian you won't be disappointed. 

Vegans call ahead because the selection changes almost daily and while they try to keep some on hand (special vegan dough prep /vegan cheese / alternative recipes), I have found this location to sometimes run out of the vegan pasties. 

If they happen have the vegan spicy BBQ you should absolutely get it. This location does it best! Cornish Pasty please keep this one on the veg menu permanently!"}
{"text":"The food was overall outstanding! We were visiting relatives in Phoenix and love to use Yelp to find local eats and this place did not disappoint! As a family traveling with 2 kids (16 and 12) we were nervous that it appeared to be a dark bar, however it was just fine. The foods were very rich and tasty. And the chicken wings were outstanding!! The food came out a bit slow, but we had a large party of 7. We will definitely add this to our list of favorites for when we visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"The family and I wanted to try this eatery out. Mistake was, going on a Friday night at 5:30. Seating was good, as we're the Hostess and Server. Food for we two adults was wonderful. Both kids, 13 & 11, didn't care for their order, a Chicken Pot Pie, and The Pilgrim. We planned to box these up and made lunch the next day of them both.
Ambiance of this place was noisy, the seating uncomfortable and dark, the music was blasting too loud to where my GF asked twice to lower the volume. 
By the time we were about finished our meals, a group of \"Bohemians\" showed up, occupying the area next to the bar, directly behind out seats. Apparently, these unwashed college aged idiots, smelling of Cigar smoke, from the Cancer Emporium, ie, Cigar store, next door to this restaurant, and body odor, came in loudly talking, swearing, wearing their damn hats to the side, like so many SubUrban Gang Banga, wannabes, ordering shots of some quantity, generally ruining our evening out. Their unpleasant stench, literally gagged the 4 of us, and the unfortunate family that shared our Pew. Pew, what an appropriate term for that time! These morons, finally moved away, thankfully, as I was about to land a size 13 boot, upon someone's ass. I guess, if I was 20-30, and chasing hairy under armed and legged young women, this is the place to be!
I'll go back there for the lunch time, never again for dinner. 
Overall, the place is painfully in need of a make-over, in caliber of decor, and clientele.
Too bad, as the food was exceptional."}
{"text":"I ordered a balsamic portobello pasty with the chocolate bread pudding, and I loved the pasty. They give the option of leaving half of it uncooked so you could heat the other half later and enjoy a fresh pasty later on, although I opted to devour the entire pasty at once. 

While the pasty was delicious, I found their bread pudding's brandy sauce to be far too overwhelming. The dessert ended up tasting more like an alcohol sponge with select unsaturated spots than it did like actual bread pudding."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been magically transported back to Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood every time I step into this restaurant (which I won't explain any further, if you've been both places you know exactly what I mean). I love that they've taken something as traditional as pasties and made it so gourmet yet accessible. There is a pasty for everyone, from a Thanksgiving dinner, to Mexican, to Indian. My two favorites are the Cottage Pie and Lamb Vindaloo (two completely different but equally delicious choices). They are super filling so take your second half home and enjoy one of their delicious desserts. I recommend the strawberries pavlova or the chocolate bread and butter pudding. Also, beer, big beers."}
{"text":"It's believed that the pasty was invented for miners. They were a way to get a full, nourishing meal that miners could transport easily and eat without cutlery.

I'm not sure that's what Cornish Pasty Co had in mind when they opened up. Sure, the place is dark, like a mine. And a lot of the waiters have crazy beards, similar to what the old miners sported. That's where the similarities stop, though. This place is H.I.P. Was mining hip? Probably not.

They have a hundred thousand beers to choose from. And every single pasty I've tried is SO SO SO good. The dessert takes the cake (but it isn't cake). PB&J Pasty, with ice cream on the side! Ooey Gooey peanut butter, jelly and bananas.

The only reason CPC doesn't get the full five stars is the service. It's usually awesome. Every now and then, though, you'll get someone who is too cool for school. That'll ruin it! I still highly recommend this place, though. Amazing food, awesome atmosphere and mostly good service."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.
Everything on the menu is excellent. The imitation ground beef is even good. While eating my girlfriend's vegetarian shepherd's pie, I didn't even realize it was imitation until it was already gone.

Great service, awesome atmosphere and decor. Very reasonably priced. Great happy hour.

Also, I just can't seem to get enough of the Strongbow Cider that they have on draft. If you haven't been to Cornish Pasty yet, you need to get off of Yelp and drive there immediately."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome, I haven't tried a pasty I haven't liked yet.  Service is always friendly, and it's always happening at this awesome local restaurant.  Try the Royale with Cheese, simply awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I almost felt underdressed walking into the Mesa location of one of my very favorite eateries. Being used the to hot, crowded, loud Tempe location, hubski and I showed up in our jeans and ratty we-were-thinking-about-going-to-bed-but-decided-to-go-Cornish-style-instead shirts.

In this location, the owners had a little- ok a lot- more space to be creative. The seats are church pews. There are candles in wine bottles. I won't ruin everything for you, but just look closely at the tables.

Although the space is larger, the decor helps to maintain the cozy comfortable quality we love about Cornish-Tempe.

I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken- veggie style. Hubski got the veggie tikka masala. They were both delicious, as always. We went back with a friend a couple of nights later and ordered the caramel apple pasty and the banoffee pie. They were out of bananas so they substituted strawberries. It was tasty, but bananas really belong to that confection. The apple caramel pasty was PMS-licious!

We love this place and we'll be back soon... maybe tonight!

Oh- and a shoutout to Lindsay B.- no trans fats in sight!"}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times now, and it just gets better. I vow to try a new pastry every time, and every time it is delicious! I love the vegan options as well. Everyone I bring to this little speakeasy loves it. The ambiance is what really sets it apart from other places. It's a hip, cool environment that really makes you feel like you stepped into Ireland. It is great for date night, or happy hour with friends. 
Every server we have ever had has been very nice as well."}
{"text":"Have visited this location several times and have never been disappointed. The place has a very cool hip vibe about it as well as having excellent food and a great selection of beer. Wife always gets the carne adovada which is so good and favorable.!i have had the pilgrim the Reuben, bangers and mash meat and cheese just to name a few and all are wonderful. Fries are killer as well as the soups. All in all a great place for lunch or dinner.?"}
{"text":"Second visit. Just as good as the first time. This place does not disappoint. Suggest everyone put this place in their rotation.  Fair prices, and they dont skimp...on quality or portions. Just as it should be."}
{"text":"Nice place and pretty fast service. The pasties are pretty good - not even close to \"Butte (Montana) pasties\", which have a lot more meat, but not bad either. They are reasonably like the authentic Irish pasties, but growing up in western Montana, I was spoiled. Would return - not often but from time to time."}
{"text":"Love the desserts here the most, especially the apple caramel pasty."}
{"text":"Oh yea, Turkey singer in July in the form of a Pasty! To die for.. Cranberries, sweet potatoes, Turkey and gravy."}
{"text":"Great flavor and good portion size. Very filling.!Meatball pasty was a good choice for younger kid."}
{"text":"For ages, the only location for the Cornish  Pasty Co. that I went to was the location in Tempe, which I also gave 5 Stars.  I give 5 Stars to any golden standard that I can always come back to or if it's one of those places that I'll take a friend to who's never been.

Somehow, this location in Mesa is better.  The Tempe location still deserves my full 5 Star-rating, but this one surpasses it.  It deserves maybe a 5 GOLD Stars or something like that.

My friend Chris came in from out of town and had a hotel room in Mesa.  I reserved a Zipcar, picked him up and this where we ate.  Everything was perfect.  I love the outdoor seating, I love the indoor seating, I love the decor and the food doesn't fuck around.  The taste doesn't tip-toe and pussyfoot around while you chew on it, it loads the flavor into a shotgun shells and fires it into you mouth and laughs at you when you're taken back by how delicious everything is.

I love taking friends to places like this because you get to see their over-the-top reaction to it as well.  It's like when you watch one of your favorite movies with a friend who's never seen it and you get to keep saying, \"Oh, this is the best part.\"  With the Cornish Pasty, it's the same thing, so many elements are the best part.

I want to be baked into a pasty and I want to eat my way out of one, but I don't want to drown in gravy or something."}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD and ordinarily the service is good. My last experience wasn't the greatest. Our server seemed incredibly put out to be servicing our table (a table of 12 women) and while I understand large parties can be tough, the way she approached us set the tone for the rest of the night. Brash and rude, snappy and annoyed. 4 stars because the food is amazing and I'm hoping my next visit will be better"}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Lots of options. Beer selection was okay but you're going here for the grub mostly! I've been back several times!"}
{"text":"The quality of food here is consistently amazing!
3rd trip here and 3rd different pasty. 
Enjoyed the Portabello-Chicken Pasty w/ a salad and finished every bite (okay, I split it with a friend, their servings are plentiful!)  Perfectly cooked and flavorful; it's served with a side of marinara that I could have eaten alone with a spoon! Everything's good here. If your a soup lover you MUST try the mushroom soup.  My salad was fresh and their house dressing is this amazing creamy basil goodness.

The staff is very friendly and do a good job at paying attention to the little details. 

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the music is a little loud for this small of a space.  During lunch I think it could be turned down, save the loud music for happy hour."}
{"text":"We love Cornish Pasty. The atmosphere is awesome and every time we go it is delicious."}
{"text":"Had a vegan friend coming in to town, called in, and apparently they offer 2 vegan options every day. She loved it. My friend and I out of respect, ordered vegetarian dishes. With the quorn chicken, I couldn't tell the difference. Awesome food. Great service. Giant beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Seriously. We go here several times a month. BUT, we went in tonight (a Thursday), and they were relatively steady...normal business for a Thurs. We sat at the bar, where we always do, and had a bartender that we have had many, many times before. I sat down while my husband went to the bathroom, and was there for several minutes before anyone greeted me (the bar wasn't full). Two more people came and sat next to me and they were immediately greeted and presented with drinks and menus.  I found this to be incredibly off-putting, regardless of how much of a regular we are. Still waiting on a greeting, my husband came back and sat down. The bartender (female, 1 of 2) approached me and very curtly asked IF I wanted a drink. ?? Yes?? It took several more minutes to get the drinks, and even longer to get menus. Once the menus were there, it was like someone pushed fast forward. At this point, both bartenders were asking us for our orders about every 2 minutes. My husband finally asked, politely, to give us some time, we were in no hurry and enjoying our drinks. This continued anyway, so finally we hastily decided on dinner. The female bartender continued to be short with us, did not smile one time, and never actually came to where we were sitting to speak to us. She was constantly doing something else, yelling across the bar. She tried several times to remove our plates while we were still eating. It seemed like the 2nd bartender (male) was a trainee. I kept telling my husband that she was making me uncomfortable because she was rushing us (she asked us 3-4 times in a span of 5 minutes if we were ready for our bill, or if we were going to have another drink). Additionally, she asked us, \"2 checks?\"
 This is ironic because we came to this location after our wedding for dinner just months ago. We have also been here hundreds of times and never asked for split checks (we are not hard to forget, I have bright red hair and my husband has an impressive beard). We ended up paying in cash and decided to leave without finishing. As we were leaving, my husband offered her some constructive criticism. She was extremely defensive and blamed everything on the 2nd bartender, with whom we had very little contact. She offered no apology or acknowledgement of her behavior, she just said \"Okay\" and walked away. We told her we would be back, but basically that we expect better service than this (honestly, this was the worst I have ever been treated by a server). I was so disappointed, uncomfortable, and put off. I worked in the restaurant industry for over ten years. I understand having bad days, being busy, in the weeds, wanting to leave before 2 AM. But it is dangerous to treat a customer as such when they spend quite a bit of time and money at your restaurant. Other customers can see that, too. I sincerely hope we don't experience this again, because we really do love CP!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I haven't had a pasty I didn't just love. At our last visit we split 3 between the 3 of us, Cottage Pie, Chicken Pot Pie and Carne Adovada. So yummy and I'm sure the left overs will be just as delicious."}
{"text":"i had peppered steak , it was amazing ,I love the fry chocolate dessert as well . definitely will go back !"}
{"text":"British food? In Mesa? Doing successfully in one of the most cursed plaza's in Mesa history? Yes, yes and yes, apparently...

I've always wanted to try a pasty...glad I was finally able to. On walking in, you realize the place is so British, that there's actually a bit of culture shock. The big long tables and benches may have you questioning whether or not you should sit down at one of these tables with an already seated party, and the answer is YES, you should! Thats how its done on the other side of the pond, and thats how its done at the Cornish Pasty Co.

They have a pretty good beer selection. My party of 3 split a large greek salad, and we could have used another one or two mouths to help us out. The dressing it comes with is a lemon pesto salad dressing, which was delicious. A word of caution, however: A little goes a long way. Its pretty thick, potent stuff. But it really does go well with the red onion, olives and feta in the salad.

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, and later I was also able to try the Chicken Pesto pasty. Both were very very good, but I liked the Tikka Masala a little better. It seemed like it was a very popular choice there as well. I would say on both pasties, the side dressings left a little to be desired. The tikka masala comes with their version of raita, a traditional indian yogurt dressing, but their flavor (while not tasting bad) did seem kinda off for some reason. The pesto chicken came with marinara, and again it seemed a little off.

The clientele here is a pretty mixed bag. The servers are the tatt'd up, facial piercings type, which Im not sure exactly why that is, but I dont mind it. Im not judging anyone, but there seemed to be a lot of lesbians in the place too. I have not a clue why either would be the case, but It didnt bother me--just struck me as odd. The place at 5:30 was PACKED. You come any later and you WILL NOT get a seat.

One last thing that I would like to mention is that for the vegetarians out there, this place is extremely veg-friendly. Practically an entire page of their menu is dedicated to pasties with quorn fake meat products, which although I didnt try, Im sure would be fantastic.

I will definitely be back soon, though maybe next time Ill try lunch and see if its maybe a little less crowded."}
{"text":"Great Food? Check. Quality Service? Check. Fun environnent? Check. Good beers on tap? Check. Food I crave? Double check.

That about sums up all you need to know about cornish but if you need to know more just think of the best hot pocket you ever had, multiple the quality by a million and you have a pasty. I have tried numerous items from here ranging from the homemade sausage salad (too big for a single sitting so leftovers=winning) to the lovely bit 'o salmon to the strawberry pavlova dessert and it is all great. 

My biggest problem coming to this place is the near pannick attack get from having to choose from too many great options. I'd tell you what my favorite pasty was but that would imply that one is better than the others which simply isn't true. Plus they have something for pretty much everybody, the only thing is if you are super picky pastys are cooked to order but not made to order so ingredients can't be swapped. Even then anybody I have ever come with has been able to find something."}
{"text":"It had been 18 months since I went here last and my friend wanted to go somewhere for lunch that was not the \"same-old, same-old\" burgers, subs, Asian, Italian, or deli stuff for lunch. \"How about Cornish Pasties?\" My friend was baffled. I explained that these are a turnover type pastry outside stuffed full of all kinds of savory meats, cheese, veggies, or dessert fillings and then crimped and baked. They are common in the UK. I also told her this would not be a quick service since they wait until you order your pasty to bake it (comes to the table fresh and piping hot).

Parking is close to the door. The staff is awesome and was attentive the entire time we were there. There are booths, tables and chairs, indoor seating and outdoor seating. The interior has the look and feel of a British pub. 

The pasties are in the $8-9.50 range. My friend had the Pilgrim (Roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing. Served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce) and a soda. I had the BG Tips British Tea and the Spicy Asiago Chicken pasty (Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes with a side of sour cream & salsa). Totally delicious!

I really wanted to try the desserts, but the serving sizes are so large there was no way either of us could eat another bite. Someday I will have to stop by and have the BG Tips British tea and sample one of the desserts."}
{"text":"FOOD:
     Cheese steak pasty ($9.50):  Good amount for the price and good overall, as the pasty was flaky. However the steak was a bit chewy.  I didn't care for the red wine gravy as I'm not a fan of bitter.

     Oven chips ($3.75):  I wish the fries were crispy.  The garlic flavor was good though.

OVERALL:  If I am ever in the city again, I'd consider coming back for other pasties but not the oven chips."}
{"text":"AMAZING. One of our favorite places to go. They recently remodeled and made the place bigger. They have some of the best soups I have ever had, and their pasties are incredible. I have tried many of them, and have yet to be disappointed. Great atmosphere, and delicious food. We will continue to come here as long as we live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's simple math, folks...excellent service and excellent food= a major hit! The waitress made me feel at home by giving me a sample of a beer to try as well as their mushroom soup. My buddy that I had not seen in a very long time suggested this place to meet. I was more than pleasantly surprised. I loved the decor just as much as everything else! The selection of pasties was extensive. I cannot wait to take my boyfriend as well as all my friends here. Thank you for an exciting experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! I liked the dim atmosphere, candle lit tables, dart board/ pool table, dark pub feel. The food was unique and they had a decent variety of pasties. Service is was fair. We'll be back. 

Food: 7/10
Atmosphere: 10/10
Price: 7/10
Service: 5/10"}
{"text":"This place has an absolute abundance of atmosphere and the food's pretty good too. I had both the shepherd's pie pasty and the Italian the two times I came here and I could just not get enough of the chocolate bread pudding it is out of this world good. This is the kind of place you consider just sticking around at and ordering another plate it's got such a great vibe. Would highly recommend to anyone with a group of young adults who are trying to relax, have some conversation, and don't mind having some great pocket pies to go with it."}
{"text":"Great representation of an English Pub.  Food and service were quite good.  I highly recommend the broccoli/cauliflower baked dish; I could've made a mean of that alone."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty always makes me a happy girl. They have great beer, yummy food, and the staff is the best! The menu has a ton of choices for meat eaters as well as vegetarians and everything is made in house. The patio offers additional seating and the iPad is always playing memorable music."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend. The food was really good, I have no complaints there - I'd highly recommend grabbing a bite. But I think next time I'd get it to go.

First, it was SO HOT in the restaurant. I didn't want to sit outside because of the heat... Maybe they didn't want to turn the air on yet? Regardless, those little fans they have don't do very much. I was literally sweating. My other complaint on the ambiance was how incredibly dark the restaurant is. Combining heat and darkness is miserable. How I stayed awake throughout the meal is beyond me.

I'll be coming back for sure but it will NOT be during the evening and probably not in the summer."}
{"text":"Finally knocked this one off the list.  I now understand why the average life span of a 15th Century Cornish miner was like 30 years... these Pasties pack a wallop.  Not the best meal but very hearty."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. We actually had gone out earlier that evening. As we drove past the area, we both kind of thought the same thing and I turned into the parking lot. As we walked up to the establishment, the patio was about half full so that is of course a great sign. We walked in and the place was definately hopping. The bar was about two thirds full and the tables were all taken as well. Again, a good sign that people like to come here :)

So we took the two seats up at the bar closest to the entrance just in case we need to make a quick get away if we do not like it...just kidding. I like the fact that the crowd of people that come here are varied. It is nice to have a place that every different type of person can go an ejoy a drink or two with company they keep. After ordering a few drinks we looked over their menu. I thought I died and went to fat heaven. So many things sounded delicious...especially their desserts. After a quick and conjoined consensus, we decided to order the 'chips' and then split the chicken pot pie pasty.

Before we were fed, I noticed a few pretty great things about this place. They actually use wax candles instead of the crappy oil burning ones most places do now a days. On top of that, they were placed inside old Jameson and vodka bottles! (See picture) Just adding the the already dimly lit casual bar feel of this place. there are a few pictures and things hung around the high walls for a effect but the thing to really notice is the benches they use for the long tables in the front center of the restaurant. (See picture) They are old church pews! Ha! There are very few things that impress me with astonishment and this is one of them. Whoever thought of this was a very smart man/woman.

Okay, so back to the food... when it came out I could just tell by looking at is it would be good. (See pictures) The 'chips' also known as french fries around these parts :) were probably some of the best I have ever tasted in my entire life. I am almost positive they rank within the top 3 for sure. They were freshly cut, seasoned and fried to the ideal consistancy. They were soft where they should be and crispy around the edges like fried should be as well. I really appreciate when cooks take that extra step into paying attention to culinary detail.

Then moving on to the pot pie pasty (say that 5 times fast). It was absolutely delicious! You could tell all the vegetables were fresh. The filling was not too heavy (saucy) which I truly appreciate as I was already feeling guilty about the amount of food I was about to partake in. My only suggestion was it needed a hint of salt and black pepper for more flavor but I think maybe they do this on purpose for those that are sensitive to overly spiced foods. Either way, I really do like the authenticity and quality of this place. Really? Only $9 for these enormous pasties? Fantastic! We will definately be back. Next time I think I might just have to indulge in the bread pudding as that is one of my favorite guilty pleasures in life. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love that it's the most English type restaurant out there butI think it's pricey for the portions you get."}
{"text":"Scottish Eggs. Sausage salad. Pilgrim with turkey. The first 2 sounded a little odd the first time I read it, but glad we tried them - Soooo good.
I could eat this combo everyday. Their sausage is DELICIOUS!! Some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Oh man! I have a favorite fast food restaurant in Nebraska called Runza... every time I go there, I have to eat as many as possible. Needless to say, I had my first Cornish Pasty and holy moly, it's seriously a glorified Runza! So amazingly delicious! It's kind of like a calzone only not pizza styled. I had a shepherd's pie in mine and totally worth every calorie! :D"}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer selecting. Scottish eggs were great and Greek pastry wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Italian pasty is incredible but the Mexican premium pasty with the slow roasted pork is one of the beat things I have ever eaten! Do yourself a favor and eat here! The prices are very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably Tasty

My friends and I went to the Cornish Pastry Company for a bite to eat, and  all I can say is; the food was unbelievably tasty. Everyone cleaned their plates and wished there was  more.

Each person in our party ordered a different flavor, and each bite  was better than the next.  Lets face it, what's not to like?  Take flavorful meat, cheese, unique vegetable combinations, wrap it up in a flakey pastry, then bake it until hot inside and crispy outside.  Serve it up with a side dipping sauce, it doesn't get much better. While your waiting  for your delicious entrée, take advantage of the great beer selection the Cornish Pastry Company has to offer.  Sip on a ice cold draft from a great selection while your delicious entrée is baking.
  
The Cornish Pastry Company has a great atmosphere, very casual and comfortable.  Wish my phone wqs working because I would have taken pictures. I would  definitely go back to the Cornish Pastry Company again and again."}
{"text":"i'm so happy i found this place.

when i heard the word pasty, it didn't exactly coincide with great food in my mind.  but that forever has changed,  the pilgrim was amazing.  hands down, best thing i've eaten in a while.  turkey, stuffing & roasted veggies with a side of cranberry sauce & red wine gravy.  like thanksgiving dinner in a little bundle of joy. 

dessert was delicious as well.  apple & caramel pasty with vanilla ice cream.  the pasty was fluffy and buttery and glorious and all of the things you want when you are feeling like a fat kid.  

nice beer selection.  i chose a trusty Guinness but i wish i had been brave & perused the beer menu a bit more. next time.

can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Hot Pockets!  Every time I come here, I obsess about which pasty to pick.  Much later, I remember that it doesn't matter.  There are no big, bold flavors to be had... I'm here for the concept.  The flaky, firm dough that houses the chosen filling is the star of the show.  Second billing is the pub ambience, from the large wooden tables to the metal plates.  Third is the large beer list.  All of the above comes for a great value.  $6.50 cent glasses of wine.  $3 Guinness on Wednesdays.  And the $3 Irish Car Bomb is legitimately the best drink deal in Arizona."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here many times, never disappointed.  If you are a picky eater and often get items off of a meal choice you may not be thrilled since they prepare the pastys well beforehand. However, they have a TON of different pastys so everyone should be able to find something."}
{"text":"Your receipt will say it all. \"$3 Car bomb..F*YEAH\".. I dont even like carbombs but I tend to do atleast one EVERYTIME I go there. Also Wednesdays is $3 Guinness day.. not gonna be able to beat that anywhere.
The food is so yummy, but if you are in a hurry, this may not be the place for you.
And the owner, gooood lord! I have the biggest crush, the things I would let that man do to me."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time with my 74 yr old father for dinner. He had been there before. It was extremely busy, so we waited at the bar for our table. The RUDE bald bartender was such a tool. He was annoyed that I told him its my first time there and asked him what was good on the menu. His rude response was that the one time he told someone what was good on the menu, they sent it back, so he doesn't do that anymore, and then literally walked away! I wanted to throw up when I saw and heard him rushing to flirt with some girls right next to us within ear shot. So unprofessional! What a complete douchebag!! 
I got my food 50 min later and the bartender just made the experience worse! I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOW CLASS PLACE WHO CANT EVEN HIRE A PROFESSIONAL BARTENDER! THIS PLACE IS A JOKE AND THERE FOOD IS BLAND AND NOT WORTH THE WAIT!"}
{"text":"Nice wooden, yet modern interior, with candles. Staff and guests come with a pleasant grungy edge. A whole page with veggie pasty, and even one vegan option. Vegan pasty? Yes! I stuck with a veggie option (rosemary 'chicken', good) to not rock the boat too much. Maybe vegan next time, it's intriguing."}
{"text":"So...I'm a pasty fanatic. My mother is from Liverpool England and I grew up eating homemade pasty's all the time (and still do whenever I find out she's making them...I mean let's be honest, mom's homemade pasty's will NEVER be beat in my book). I know my way around a pasty, let's put it that way.

All that said, this place is great! Diverse selection of both traditional and unique fillings, real short-crust pastry, great sides and an amazing atmosphere. Never come here and left unhappy."}
{"text":"Good service, fun atmosphere, cool ambience food was yummy, food was reasonable drinks were reasonable I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Went there for girls night food was amazing drinks were good service was awful. Spent the first 20 minutes waiting for a waitress to show up just to take our drink order, the next 15 minutes were spent waiting for drinks. Finally waitress returned to take order and told us half of what we ordered was no longer available. After the waitress took our order she returned to tell us one more thing was no longer available, seems they had run out of just about everything. She did bring us free bread to soften the blow of being out of one other thing. Although the waitress was nice enough they just didn't seem to have enough service for such a busy night. I would definitely try it again because the food was spectacular but the service really needs to be worked on."}
{"text":"This place is great for a small group...It's small, dark & moody.  The food is delicious!  

At first I was grossed out by the name...couldn't imagine what type of food would be served.  FYI-a pasty is like an empanada, but they put all types of different stuffings in theirs.

DH & I shared a greek salad (delicious!) and I ordered a spicy chicken pasty & DH ordered a chicken alfredo pasty.  We LOVED our food.  

Only negative is that they didn't have a full bar...so I just ordered a glass of wine. 

Would totally go back!  This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Food and experience was ok. I would probably pass on the appetizers and stick to the popular basics here."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good and original. HOWEVER the incredibly horrible service was impossible to overlook. We came in and sat at the bar for a good, 10 minutes until I finally asked the cook behind the bar if he could take our order. He said yeah sure, wrote it down and put it somewhere. About 30 minutes later I decide to check, walk over and ask the waitress if she can check on our food. She asks the cook, he said he never got anything. The cook says well I gave the other cook the order. So we wait another 20 minutes for our forgotten food. After eating, plates sit empty, still no waitress, so I walk over to one and tell her we need our bill. This was so utterly disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Haven't had a bad pasty. Sometimes they do run out of certain types, so if your heart is set on one you might want to call first. Also, they do gift certificates!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if my wife and I ordered the wrong things, but we were underwhelmed.  The atmosphere of the place was nice, but the food itself didn't really do it for me."}
{"text":"This place is ok at best. The first time we came we waited at the front for about 5 minutes with no hello or anything from anyone in the restaurant. Several of them did look at us a few times but that was it. Also, this place is pretty small so seating fills up quickly. Not kid friendly in any way. The pasties are good but if there is a bit more flavor I would probably want to go there more often."}
{"text":"Place is dark and strangely laid out, with a weird raised and railed off island area, flanked by long bench style banquet booths. Menu seemed to have a large variety, but there are no substitutions and almost every item has cheese on it. Always makes me weary, as cheese is used to hide overly salty food and bland tastes. Had been here many months ago and was underwhelmed,  but was coaxed into giving it another shot by a coworker. I had the salmon pasty, and let me say it was actually very good! Fish came out perfectly cooked, moist and tender. Portion seems to look small but fills you up very fast! I also had the coleslaw because I felt like I wanted something cool to balance. It was very tasty, and homemade, but overpriced for the portion. Overall they managed to redeem themselves. Great place to go drinking with the boys or girls and get some heavy food to offset the beer. A solid 4 stars but to those rating 5 star... I'm just not seeing it, other yelpers. What did I miss? Service was adequate but nothing special. The novelty of a pasty is not worth that extra star."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said about Cornish? Start with an order of oven fries, grab a delectable pasty and finish off with some banoffee. The food and drinks are always phenomenal. The same can't really be said about the service. I wouldn't recommend getting take out here. I certainly don't anymore. Only dine-in because at least then the mistakes can be fixed. Thus saving you a trip back when you realize you are missing parts of your order or if you happen to received the wrong pasty. It is about 50-50 from my experience on them getting orders right. While the service is often lacking, the food, atmosphere and good times tend to make up for it."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and am I glad I did! Firstly, it definitely has a pub vibe. Love all of the long door tables and pew seating. Love the fact that you can belly up to the kitchen bar and converse with the cooks. Love the Portland hipster feel. My daughter and I split a Chicken Tikka Marsala pasty and it was delicious. I didn't care for the yogurt sauce as it was strangely sweet. I'm not a fan of tahini sauce, the alternative, in general. That's ok though because the pasty can stand just nicely on its own. And lastly, love the beer selection!! I did wish there'd been some tvs to watch college football but I have to appreciate a space where people can come to have conversations and great food and not be distracted. I am looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company, \"It's a place that makes Hot Pockets\" says James. Hummmmm....that is just gross I say.  I realize the Nestle Company has sold billions of these nasty things since the 70's, but I don't want to go to a restaurant and eat Hot Pockets.  After reading the incredible reviews about this place I could not resist.
 
Not much to the outside of the place and seriously I would not have given the place a chance if I was driving by.  Inside is comfortable and inviting.  We were asked to seat ourselves and the server was over to take our drink orders almost immediately.  They have a good selection of mostly beers but the real focus here is the food.  35 or so combinations of pastry filled pies which makes deciding a bit difficult.  If you go you may want to check out the menu online beforehand or be prepared to browse the menu for awhile.  Our choice was the steak & cheese and one filled with sausage.  Both were incredible.  On the side, we had a choice of red wine gravy or mustard cream.  I asked our server which one she recommended and she said she would bring both.  Wow...funny I had not thought of that, but glad she did as both sauces were delicious. With a valley full of so-so restaurants it is always refreshing to find a truly good place to eat."}
{"text":"This will sound easier than it will be to execute when you dive into your pasty.  Save room for dessert.  The chocolate bread pudding!  Holy @$#t!"}
{"text":"I come here alot and their foods are extraordinary. The atmosphere is nice too. Be sure to order their lemonade, it was squeesh fresh when we went there. Really good serving size too. Iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone.:)"}
{"text":"Overpriced specialty food.  

Also very crowded.


Service is slow.

Would not recommend at any time."}
{"text":"Love the Cornish Pasties here and the fact that they do so much from scratch. The appetizers, salads and deserts are awesome as well. I always get the Italian pasty and the sticky toffee pudding. Love it."}
{"text":"this place.. It's so low key and the beer and food is . If u want a cool place to chill, definitely come here."}
{"text":"The best pastys I've ever had and my wife agrees. We are accustomed to traditional pasty with crust, potato, steak, and some onion but not much flavor so you have to add ketchup. We tried the Mexican and the chicken pot pie pastys. Both filling and very tasty and flavorful. If we didn't live in Chicago we would frequent this place. Only down side is it's a little pricy for lunch and no kids menu but overall great experience. Big portions... we had two pastys split and enough food for everyone."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say this Establishment is a little too dark; it has a bar feel.. Hard to read the very expansive menu, but found the food to be fabulously tastes and right out of oven. Pricey for lunch but worth the price for a true pasty. Coming back just not an every week place."}
{"text":"Good food... awful service..... i have been here a million times and never had decent service, just a variance of bad to atrocious. Concept is awesome, food delicious, wish they would just hire a worthy service staff."}
{"text":"Christina is a great server, very positive energy! Loved the vegan portobella pasty. Get atmosphere and music. Definitely a good place!
."}
{"text":"Very very good. Unique and a treat! Vegetarian selections are broad but there is definitely something for everyone. Get out of your box and go!"}
{"text":"We HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this awesome place!  We both had the Chicken Greek Pasty...delicious! A very unique place to eat at. Cannot wait to go back to try something else on their menu. Try to go here!"}
{"text":"As a native Arizonan with English heritage, I had never even heard of this place. I recently moved my office down the street and tried Cornish with a co-worker for the first time last week. I was pleasantly surprised! It was a little bit of a wait for the food to cook, but, so worth it. I tried the Pilgrim and, dang! It was so delicious!"}
{"text":"ROTD: Part Deux.

O-M-G, That's right, OMG.

(For us who aren't 13, it means: OH MY GOD)

So the fiance and I are in town visiting her parents when lunch strikes and she asks \"What do you want?\"

Instantly my stance hunches over and my palms start rubbing together like Mr. Burns, \"You're Hungry? Eggggseeeelllleennntt\" I say. 

One swipe, one touch, and a few taps later we're following the old iPhone to Cornish Pasty's Mesa location, with me, at this point, bouncing up and down in the car like a child whose forgotten to take their riddlin for the day. 

\"What's a Pasty?\" She says...

\"Oh-ho-ho\" I respond with a Santa Like cheer \"Just wait\"

As we arrive the strip mall decor looks familiar, except instead of thinking this is an old timers pub, one may mistake it for a dry cleaners. 

Inside sits an area that has to be at least twice as big as the Tempe location, complete with pews to sip on your suds and nosh away at your nostalgic nourishment. 

Also Like the Tempe location, if you sit at the bar you'll see chefs hand making new pasties and the pride they put into each one. 

So 17 dollars, 2 Pasties, 2 drinks and a happy fiancee later I can confidently say \"SCREW YOU RECESSION!!\" because she was so impressed, she even bought :) 

Eat your heart out ,er...A Pasty, Alan Greenspan."}
{"text":"If you're going to call yourself the Cornish pasty company, you should know how to make a Cornish pasty. 

I decided to surprise my European girlfriend and take her to this place. Never having had a Cornish pasty I thought it might be fun. We both placed our orders and the words that came out of her mouth (edited for radio) I don't know what this is but its not a Cornish pasty. 

In short, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Guinnness pasty is wonderful!!!!  There are many choices but I've preferred the pure flavored ones with meat and taters."}
{"text":"Yes, I have to admit this place is pretty good at what they are doing!  

I had the Chicken Greek at $9.50, which is: Chicken breast, spinach, fresh mozzarella, feta, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, artichokes and roasted garlic and tzatziki on the side, yum.  I like to add Sriracha to this particular pasty and they have it on hand!

Their Pasties are cooked to perfection, piping hot and gooey in the middle with a nice and crispy outer crust.

I also really enjoy the decor of this place, it is totally funky and eclectic.  Check out the photos of the interior. 

It has been awhile since I have been to Cornish and writing this review makes me think I will have  it again today for lunch!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review because Andy, the general manager, contacted me about the situation. I am happy this situation has been acknowledged and it seems that they are truly concerned about the cleanliness of their restaurant. Like I said in my previous review, the food here is good and the atmosphere is nice. Based on the concern I have received about the matter, the taste of the food and atmosphere, I am updating my review. Accidents happen, but this was has been taken care of. I look forward to having a new and improved experience the next time I go here (: thank you."}
{"text":"Novel meal idea, I've had a few different meals here and all have been pretty good. Great selection of beers and really cool decorating job with old church pews."}
{"text":"This place is rad! Some friends of ours took us here and I had no clue this type of food existed here in AZ. It was my first time having a Pasty and I got the Philly cheese steak pasty and it was awesome.  We had the peanut butter, banana and jelly pasty for dessert and it blew my mind. How this place has not opened more locations than a few I will never know. I can't wait to go back ."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch, dinner, drinks, whatever. I recently took my partner here for her birthday dinner, and we were both pleasantly surprised. We went around 7pm on a Sunday and it was pretty busy, so we ended up sitting at a high-top outside. Our server was attentive, but not pushy, and refilled our drinks without having being asked. For starters I got the cream of potato, leek and stilton soup. Be forewarned, if you're not used to the stronger cheese you may not like this soup! personally, I loved it. It had a bite and was served with crusty bread and butter. We shared the Oggie and the Lamb Vindaloo pasties, and both were fantastic. The Lamb Vindaloo has a great kick, and actually made my nose run. Both the lamb and the beef in the pasties were tender, and the red wine gravy that came with the Oggie was great! For dessert we got the Shirley Temple Pudding. If you've never had it before, be aware that it doesn't have the consistency of pudding like you're used to. It's almost like chocolate malt-o-meal, but doesn't really taste like it. It's chocolatey, sticky, warm and amazing! the creme anglaise adds an interesting texture to it. 

If there's only a few people in your party, you may end up sharing a table/booth with strangers, that could be the only downside. Some people love that kind of atmosphere, some people aren't keen on sharing space with people they don't know. 

The price was right. Sunday is happy hour all day, but we didn't drink. But for 3 of us, 2 soup appetizers, 3 sodas, 3 pasties and a dessert it came up to just over $40. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wide variety of good pasties, but the service could use some work."}
{"text":"We used Cornish Pasty Co for our wedding catering this last Saturday. They were so easy to work with and so responsive to all of our questions. We received a lot of compliments from the guests at our wedding on the food being the best food they have had at a wedding. Lauren printed menus and put them on all the tables and also made suggestions for which pasties to purchase for our guests. We served the Cajun, Shepard's Pie, Oggie, and Veggie Oggie for dinner and for the cocktail hour there were tandoori wings and Scottish eggs. If I were to do it again, I'd order more Cajun pasties because those went fast. They were also accommodating to make food for the vegan guests at our wedding. Lauren made sure to also feed me and my husband first before feeding the guests and personally delivered our food."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since my original review, and am happy to say the food has been consistently really good!

I still think it's too noisy inside and lament the lack of handicap parking, but won't let that deter me from coming and enjoying the fare.

Now that the EU has decided \"Cornish\" Pastys can only be made *in* Cornwall I'm wondering if this place will have to change its name. :-0"}
{"text":"Real let down.  We love the Scottsdale location, but this place was a waste.  Our bartender was nice, the other staff seemed more involved in their own world.  Floor was dirty, beer was lukewarm.  We ordered two sides. More jalapeños than fries on the oven chips. The brocolli cauliflower bake was awful (water at bottom of bowl, and layer of rubbery cheese melted on top). Maybe get some tips on food and service from the Scottsdale location. As we got the check, the bartender was really nice and saw that we weren't happy.  Anyhow, we were going to pay because we were hungry, but she took off the broccoli."}
{"text":"Everything you eat there is great, beer selection is good, this one is way bigger and less bougie than the Tempe one. More of an open feel than a locals only crowd. The Banoffie is an excellent choice for dessert."}
{"text":"I went with Lamb and Mint...  I can't really explain or relate it to anything per say but it was gooooood.  The dipping sauce (gravy) it came with was really good.
At first glance it didn't look like it'd fill me up but I was surprised... the meat and stuff is packed pretty dense so it works.  The bread is really tasty and crusty but not too dry.

The beers were like $6 a pop and for two of us it was $30 before tip...

I'll go back... was pretty good... lots of other pasties to try on the menu"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Mesa!  Cool atmosphere, great music, and super nice wait staff!  Oh, those pasties!  So delicious!  My goal is to try every single one!  Only complaint...they never have the 34 oz. mugs in stock!"}
{"text":"Very hipster-y. Definitely do not feel cool enough to be there. Cornish Pasty company was not too bad, but I had my expectations set a little too high I think. It is great that they have a whole menu of vegetarian pasties, and vegan options too.

I got the Veggie Oggie, and it wasn't the best, but I ate it all so clearly I didn't hate it! It was just a little dry, but the ketchup helps with that. Also the fatty in me would have preferred a bigger portion. I would try something different if I were to go again though. 

I also think this place is overpriced and don't like that you cant you cant alter the items on the menu, but I understand why!"}
{"text":"Amamzing service. Amazing food. The Cubano Pasty was delicious. Our server Matt was great. Fun personality and very attentive. We will be coming back. And we will purposely sit in Matt's section."}
{"text":"Place is awesome with a nice selection of beer. The food is awesome with a lot of variety of pasties. Cant go wrong with any of them but cajun is my fav. The curry potatoes and all of their desserts are awesome. Id say the only negatives for this place is the noise level for older people and the seating. You might have to share a pew with someone. Other than that everything is awesome"}
{"text":"For lunch I had the Porky - it had roasted apples inside which added sweet detail.

They have Boddingtons on tap - that's my bff's favorite beer so I ordered one and sent him a pic for jealousy purposes.  It's a good beer, a little thicker than I'd prefer but being too thick is never a bad thing.  

Service was friendly but slow."}
{"text":"I've had this twice - once my friend, the penguin, brought some over - and then Saturday night we actually dined there.  The pasty itself tasted much better eating there - probably because it didn't have time to get soggy.  But the side dish, the broccoli and cauliflower smothered in bread crumbs and cheese is LEGIT.  Very unique concept, and the crowd is very hipster / bohemian - which always makes for good people watching.  I'll be back fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"Brilliant!  I had the traditional Shepard's pie and fantastic red-wine gravy which did not disappoint, and also stuffed myself with a shared Greek salad, oven chips w/garlic and jalapeno, and a rich, chocolatey, brandy-fied bread pudding that was just amazeballs!  I am surprised I still fit into my jeans right now; I highly recommend stretchy pants.

Service was pretty slow as everyone seemed to be thrown off by the 26 ladies from the Red Hat Society that filled 80% of the seats.  The server explained they all come in once a month, so you may want to skip that day if you have a time limit.   

There are so many pasties I want to try, I can't imagine NOT coming back.  Oh, and they have Boddington's on tap!"}
{"text":"Consistent food, fun vibe, great addition to the neighborhood! I've eaten here
A few times (dinner mostly) and have never had a bad experience. Wide variety of seating/ambiance options and a knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious.  I get a different pasty every time I go here and I have yet to be disappointed.  They always seem to be busy and their wait staff is always running around trying to make sure everyone is taken care of.  

They also just redid their patio seating which is really nice and much easier to eat on with the big picnic tables. 

The only bummer about this place is you can't make substations on a lot of the pasties because the fillings are pre mixed.  So make sure you get one that  you like everything in!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Amazing food, beverages and atmosphere. If you're you know you're going to be hungry soon go there  early so you can order and by the time the foods ready you'll be ready to eat. Wait is about 20-30min for them to make to your meal. But totally worth the wait"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty saved our Mothers Day! After having to leave a restaurant (where we had made reservations) after waiting 2 hours for our table; we headed off to Cornish Pasty in Mesa. We were seated immediately and waited on quickly and efficiently by Matt. He was so friendly to all of us. Especially my sister (who has special needs). I was so grateful for his cheerfulness; it turned our day around! The food was served quickly and was delicious as well. We have decided that this will be our first choice next Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"First time I tried these pasty things. haha. They were ok. These are the items that people back in the last century ate. Like miners and poor people I think... There was a story about in the menu. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary but I'll go back to try other items just to make sure I'm not missing anything. If I had to think about it... pasties are giant hot pockets that cost $10. Well, this is more of a time period food so I guess there's that additional cost to make it to represent it accurately. Although I don't think they had Mexican pasties back in the day. lololol.

It was kind of dark in there but I guess that's the mood they were going for. The entire place was mostly candle lit. Servers were nice. I say... good to go try it out at least once."}
{"text":"What? Where has this orgasm of flavor been my whole life. I feel robbed that my ex-buddies as of five minutes ago. Never took me here.   It's a beer and wine only place but prices are awesome. I may speak to my friends again after I'm done eating and become more intoxicated.  Usually does the trick with making me more friendly. As of now I'm hating on them for not introducing me to this sooner.
Seriously the pasties. Which are like calzones are creative and delicious. Too many decisions. Oh and the British chips are fantastic too."}
{"text":"Me likey what I saw. :) Didn't actually ate there, but hey, ambiance is cool, they have Jameson bottles as candlelight.  Music is awesome. Server who assisted me has become an instant favorite. Cool dude that actually paid attention. Greeted us with a smile that looked sincere (which I rarely see nowadays), A plus for you my friend!.  Loc P. and I stopped by for desserts and we had the Banoffee and Strawberry Palova. Both fairly priced and had beautiful presentation, even in To Go! So, this note will be a review in progress because I am definitely coming back to try their pasties. Cos I saw some orders coming out while waiting and it looked and smelled so delicious. Another review will be up later, for some of the entrees that I will try, cos I have a feeling I'm gonna come back very very soon. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant's menu isn't huge, but it is packed with delicious food. I have never left unsatisfied or felt like I didn't get my money's worth. The customer service is also top-of-the-line. This place gets BUSY (be prepared!), and regardless of whether or not there is a line out of the door, the fine staff of this establishment never lose a beat. (Even the people waiting to be seated are patiently and happily waiting for their turn for one of their amazing dishes!) I am a repeat customer, and this is the first place I think of when I'm looking for some good British food. :)"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that every time I have people from out of town, I'll take them there and I know they will love it. The ambiance is really nice, it reminds me of Austin's unique restaurants. Food is excellent, service is consistent and their Mushroom, walnut and spinach soup is to die for. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that need to be experienced first hand.  The atmosphere, food, drink and service are some of the best here in the Phoenix area.  I've only been to  the one here in Mesa, but hear the one in Tempe is equally amazing (just more compact).

Do yourself a favor though.  Wait to sit outside.  It can get kinda hot inside.  Otherwise, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Met my family here for my birthday dinner. Really good food. Great beer selection & our server Brittany was awesome. It was worth the 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"Loved the food it was so good and they have a great selection of beer. Also love that it closes late and I can sit down and enjoy the great food and great service. All made fresh and you can see them making the Pastys."}
{"text":"I LOVE cornish pasty!! The ambience is really neat but the place itself is a little small. Everytime I go, I try a new pasty and every one I have tried, I have liked. Good selection of beers (import and domestic). I personally like sitting up at the bar because staff is really friendly and chatty (if you want them to be).

If you're looking for a new place to try that's casual, this place is great!"}
{"text":"After one visit, I think I'm sold. The moment you walk in the door, you're instantly welcomed into a very warm and inviting atmosphere. From the dark interior, to the long wooden benches and sectioned off seating, to the outdoor seating and full bar and delicious, unique, hearty food, the Cornish Pasty Company is beckoning me back for a drink with friends. They've got a good selection of draft beers, and an even larger selection of pasties from traditional options, to even vegetarian pasties. The staff were friendly and we got our food and drinks promptly so no problems on that front. 

I ordered the Oggie and my girlfriend got the Cottage Pie. Both came out fresh and hot with their red wine sauce on the side. The Oggie has highlights of sliced potatoes and chunks of tender steak. The Cottage Pie, the alternative to the Shepherd's Pie, had a good serving of mashed potatoes, peas, and well seasoned ground beef. While the red wine sauce was very good, the flavor palette fit the Oggie better as the steak had a nice roasted flavor, whereas the Cottage Pie was able to stand alone by itself.

I would definitely recommend giving them a try with some friends. If you're anything like me, your food adventures have probably not lead you to home-cooked British food. As such, this was a breath of fresh air from the hoards of mediocre ethnic foods I've had to sift through to find the gems. That being said, their pasties are perfect for hearty drinking food, and they've certainly got a good enough selection to cover the latter. If I were to provide critique, I'd have liked some board games or possibly even Jenga to make the atmosphere even more conducive for a chill drinking night with friends. Hopefully, this wouldn't ruin the comfy and warm mood the Cornish Pasty Company has going for itself, as blaring TVs and obnoxious loud music certainly would. Although they only get a 4/5 for now, the loss of 1 star is merely because I'm a reserved critic. I definitely see myself coming back, and if my experience is as good as this time, they will easily earn that 5/5 no problem. 

Short Version:
Warm, comfy, good beer selection, hearty food, vegetarian options, fair prices, a must eat!"}
{"text":"Their soup was delicious! We came with the dog and were very comfortable and warm seating outside with our pet. They brought him a bowl of water, too. The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad experience here or a meal I did not like. My absolute favorite pasty is the \"lovely bit of salmon.\" I have tried some other ones, which were all very good. Meatball appetizer, pate and curry potatoes are also fantastic. Great beer selection and friendly cozy atmosphere. Also, very affordable with large portions. Its about $10 for a pasty and I always end up taking half home."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! My girlfriend and I recently ordered take out from them and it was very good. She had the Italian and I ordered the Spicy Pork. I really dug mine but she compared it to a overpriced hot pocket. The garlic potatoes we ordered were ok but needed something more. I'll go there again but will have to convince her to try something different."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to, with amazing food to match. When you walk in, everything is dim and dark, but still welcoming. All of the tables have candles sitting in liquor bottles, lighting your meal. It is a great atmosphere for eating dinner or even just having a beer.

The Pasty selection is diverse and long, making you just want to come back repeatedly to try different things. I had the Chipotle Chicken Pasty, which was over-the-top excellent! Highly recommended. There are many different ethnic food types stuffed into any Pasty, so whether you're in the mood for traditional British ingredients or if you're a fan of Greek food, they have a Pasty for you.

Service was great, attentive but not annoying. The waiter had great suggestions for a main course and even dessert. The PB&J dessert pasty is large enough to share, and can come with ice cream. It's something that sounds weird at first, but tastes like it goes perfectly together. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. Good craft beer, casual younger tolerant atmosphere, and great food. I recommend the Lovely Bit O Salmon or the Chicken Tikka Marsala that I had tonight, you can go wrong whatever tickles your fancy. Other favorites of ours are the Oven Chips and Banofee Pie! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always have good results here.  Place is usually busy but they do a great job of attending to you.  Unigue food items but very delicious.  We get here every chance we get."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food and even better atmosphere. Not the quickest service by any means, but always nice and pleasant. Seriously, the food is great. I'm not big on veggies, but out of the 4 or 5 pasties I've had (most with veggies), it's still beyond delicious. I wish they made pasties to order, but I understand the quantity they make. This particular location is one of my wife and my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Great if you like college hipster chicks hosting and serving who have terrible attitudes.

Great if you like over-paying for a small meat pie with no side...they're good but not that good...

Great if you like to order simple drinks that bartenders seem to not know how to make.

I'm giving two stars because the cranky waitress who got mad when my other guest finally showed up and realized we still weren't being serviced at our table outside.... I literally walked by the host and walked all around inside, not realizing where the host stand was, so I got a table and sat myself for about 15 mins.

I've been a server so I get rotating stations and stuff, and I get that self seaters are a pain, but when it happens, just deal with it... punishing your tippers isn't the way to go about it....

Her only saving grace is she finally noticed my other guest hadn't touched her cocktail because it wasn't to her liking and she was nice enough to take it over (after they ordered 2 sod"}
{"text":"Good, very good. Gravy is yum. Seats are a tad uncomfortable and I felt bad because there was only 2 servers but for the most part, pretty delicious."}
{"text":"New favorite craving! We ordered the Bangers and Mash and the Shepards Pie. Bangers and Mash was the best imo!! Fast service,  friendly knowledgeable servers. Super cool place."}
{"text":"Nothing far from fabulous. Good service. Variety of options (a lot of vegetarian and vegan options too), and plenty of different meat options- lamb, beef, chicken, fish. There were various Indian twists like the masala curry. Pastry was fresh and you can tell they just made it because the bakery and kitchen were in view, freshly baked out of the oven. I had the Guinness Stew and a Blood Orange Gose from AZ Wilderness and was completely satisfied with my food and drink! Even some leftover for light snack later. I'll have to come back and try more of their other dishes! Such a change from the typical tacos of Arizona"}
{"text":"Same goodies as the Tempe location but much bigger space. This location is rather nice with lots of seating and an ambient feel. I really enjoyed my pasty but I know my parents weren't as impressed. I had the veggie rosemary chicken, yes Quorn veggie chicken is the best thing ever. The pasty had veggie chicken, roasted red peppers, roasted red potatoes and some brie; it was fantastic. We also had some pea soup, baked broccoli & cauliflower, and some oven chips. The broccoli was delicious (I have an aversion to cauliflower) and the chips were good too; remember chips=fries, crisps=potato chips. Both my parents were disappointed with their dips, the chicken pot pie came with some red wine gravy instead of chicken gravy and the chicken alfredo came with ice cold marinara, they were out of alfredo sauce. Bottled beer was a little pricey. I still love me some Cornish Pasty."}
{"text":"Hubby and me drove from Phoenix to try something new. The food was  incredible, it was well worth the drive and the fact that you can order half baked pasties to take home, only made me a bigger fan. Our waiter was very attentive.  This is our new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here once a month since my return. The first time was in June...I met up with a fellow gamer (geek alert...yes, I do play an MMORPG and no, it's not WoW) who lives around the corner from me. I didn't eat a pasty, bad me! Instead, I had their chicken caesar salad. Good lord I'd died and gone to heaven with a dish like that...not too much dressing, tons of leafy lettuce and chicken that was cooked just right!

We loved the idea of the pews. I liked it because it reminded me of being back in Scotland. :D

Service rocked it! Friendly and kick ass, prompt! They are making me fall in love with them.

A month later, I take hubby there...I order the same thing...and am massively disappointed. The lettuce is wilted, chicken is the best part of the salad and sadly, there is so much dressing I was distraught.

Again, service rocked it...but hubby was most impressed with the happy hour prices of the beers and the size...and the selection. He wasn't happy with is pasty which was ok by my standards.

Today I had a craving for a pasty. Hopped over there and had their chicken tikka. It was aight. Nothing to make me do cartwheels or dance on the tables. Ok, if I danced on the tables, I'd really be embarrassed because my ass would break it. I'm sure of it.

Anyway, I'll give this place another whirl next month and see how it goes. Maybe it might be good.

So far they're consistently inconsistent in the food, but their service is top notch."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?!  

The Cornish Pasty Co. is incredible.  

I am from So Cal and it has become my tradition that I visit it twice every time I am in Phoenix - when I first arrive and then again when I am on my way to the airport.

The pastys are so good the boyfriend and I have devised a way for me to transport the partially cooked pasties by plane to Southern California so I will have extra stock when I get home :-)

The is hands down my favorite place I have ever eaten at.  EVER.  That says a lot."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Great beer selection  and pasties are delicious. Staff seems a little absent minded but more or less friendly. Community seating is fun and inviting. Italian pasty kinda just taste like pizza but Cajun pasty, bangers and mash, jalapeño curry, Cornish meatballs all highly recommended. They also carry Bourbon County Stout (a beer not found in stores except during Black Friday)"}
{"text":"Dean and Heidi are fantastic restauranteurs. Dean has well honed palate for flavor combinations and is never satisfied with the status-quo. 

He has elevated the humble pasty (comfort food for coal miners) into collection of international meals enclosed in pastry. I have eaten 90% of the pasty menu and every single pasty was well crafted and bursting with flavor. My favorites are: Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka, Lovely Bit 'O Salmon, and Bangers+Mash. Always ask for double sauce!

There is a fine line-up of beer on tap, including hard to find ones like Dogfishhead 90 Min IPA. I usually do Guinness or a Black+Tan, all poured properly.

It's fun to watch staff make the pasties. They are a tattooed, funky bunch -- you will never find a more gracious group or more dedicated to getting the product right, though.

I enjoy the Mesa location with family, but prefer the grittier \"coal mine-like\" atmosphere of the original Tempe location if I'm alone or with the guys."}
{"text":"Yelp helped us again!! This restaurant was great. great beer great staff.Great Quiet outdoor seating hard to locate its technically on the cross street  A pasty  is basically individual pies filled with meats and vegetables that are cooked together. I cant waint for the Las Vegaslocation to open!!! Definately great value staff everything I highly recommend!!Great wholesome meal!!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Finding this place was a fluke. Wasn't looking for this particular food, but wanted lunch in the area. We enjoyed fabulous Scotch eggs and some Guinness and then swapped half Roast Dinner pasty filled with house made roast beef, carrot, Brussels sprouts, and potato with M's meat and cheese that was filled with 2 types of sausages. I have to go back and try the chicken pot pie pasty and some of those desserts!! 
Service was fantastic and the food was hot and delicious!  I left with a food baby!"}
{"text":"Always best bottled beer selections and draft selections! The pasty's well their another animal. I've tried a few different pasty's but their always delicious!!! Also try the chips with garlic and jalapeño! (their basically baked French fries!)Every location is consistent with service and quality of food!"}
{"text":"This place was so unique and delicious.  Really really enjoyed the pilgrim.  It was like thanksgiving in a pastry.  Service was wonderful and plenty of beers to choose from.  Lovely."}
{"text":"Food is great service is great. Sat at the bar and watched the kitchen staff. But if you go and you buy a pie aka pasty with any beef inside order the horseradish cream sauce to go with it!!!! Cottage pie is a 5 without it and a 9 with it!!  
Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"When my son and his boyfriend caught wind that I went to Cornish Pasty without them, they insisted we go stat! So off we went!

I wasn't really hungry, but at this point I was in the mood for dessert and had already been tipped off that Cornish Pasty had some great tasting desserts.

Somehow I was persuaded into getting some garlic roasted fries, and I have to say, those fries were delsih! Glad the boys were there to share though, they made a perfect side to any pasty!

I was thrilled to see they had Banoffee Pie, so I knew I had to order it! It had a crisp graham cracker crust, nice creamy caramel, whipped cream topped with fresh banana slices, this right here is comfort dessert! Keep it simple and sweet! LOVED IT, want more!"}
{"text":"I gave it four stars because the apple dessert Pasty was not very good. However, I did enjoy the rest of the food."}
{"text":"Aside from being one of the Valley's most scientifically significant People Zoos, especially relating to the study of hipsters and their culture and customs,  this establishment also produces damn good food."}
{"text":"Countless pasties later and I'm back for an update.

The patio had some issues so the owners (who are awesome) tore out the glass top long tables outside and added huge (seats 6+) booths with flower pots on top with cushion seats and backs.

They've added more \"dessert\" pasties, plus more side dishes and salads.

Sunday's now feature breakfast pasties, a bloody mary bar and mimosas.

They are doing a lot more with this location than with the original Tempe shop, which I assume is because of the added space. Whatever the reason, they are doing it right.

If you want to get the expanded Cornish Pasty Co experience, take a few extra minutes and hit the Mesa location. It WILL be worth your time."}
{"text":"Good food and a great beer selection.  Tried this place while in town and I thought it was a nice departure from the other options in town.  I had the Guinness stew pasty and it was delicious.  The filling was very flavorful and the pastry was properly cooked.  Also tried the meatballs with the mustard dipping sauce, which was also very good.  There is also a large beer menu, which was well appointed. Great place to try."}
{"text":"Okay I went here on recommendation from some Yelpers and I have to admit a personal flaw...I add letters into words and flip things around when I'm reading sometimes, so this whole time I'm thinking Cornish Pasty is a Pastry (notice the 'r') joint...

I know, I know, \"didn't I read the reviews??\" Yes, of course I read the reviews; but I'm like the ship Titanic...once I get an idea in my head it's really hard to 'turn the ship around' as it were...

Once I got over the initial shock that this was, in fact not a pastry place, but a pasty place; I was pleasantly surprised! This place is great! Our server was friendly, talkative and attentive. The music was a little loud, but for the setting, I think it was at an appropriate level.

I got the Philly Steak pasty and savored the flavors of the meat and man, that pasty crust was dang good too!! Yummy! Even though I had some personal problems in the beginning, it turned out to be a FABULOUS experience and I would recommend it to other Yelpers looking for some good eats."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and had wonderful portions, though I did find myself wishing they balanced out the savory flavors of my Roast Dinner Pasty with a bit more sweet, either with more carrot in it or adding tomatoes, its was not the food that kept me from giving a full 5 or ever 4 stars.

What is preventing the 5 stars is the lighting and the wait staff. The lighting was so poor that my mother was unable to see where she was walking, caught the edge of platform for some couch seating and went tumbling forward, smacking face first into the hostess stand behind us. The hostess/ waitress was walking towards us and came up to our table with menus right after we righted my mother up but our neighbors and us where still asking if she was ok just dropped menus on the table and walked away without a word. So either the lighting is so bad the staff can't see if a patron trips and falls and hurts themselves 10-15 feet away, or they just don't care.

I'd still eat there again just next time i'm going to be that person wiping out the flashlight to walk to the table without and regard to the other patrons, for my safety and my families safety."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time my brother and best friend have been ranting about!
All in all the atmosphere was soothing low lighting, hip music, and good beers! Now for the Pasty I personally had to try the ever so popular Bangers and Mash and yeah
that pasty is a solid sell! I tried a vegetarian Pasty my sister in law had and that too
was quite delicious. Various craft beers to enjoy with your meal and wines as well. 
Recommend this place for any occasion. Overall the service was helpful and informative. Food was hot and tasty. Beer was cold and yummy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like the Tempe location better but this one is good too!  The church pews do kick ass.

Favorite pasties:  Vegetarian balsamic mushroom with mozzerella, spinach, and a side of marinara.  Peppered steak, the blue cheese in it makes it!  And for dessert the pb&j with banana!

GREAT BEERS!"}
{"text":"Went there today with my coworkers.  We've been to the Tempe location before but thought we might get in and out a little faster at this location.  Our server Tony had a trainee with him and both of them were very charming.  When our food was coming out, Tony explained that there had been some confusion in the back and that my friend's Rosemary Chicken would be delayed but in the meantime would we all love to munch on a portabello mushroom with red sauce, cheese, etc, and they were insanely apologetic and said in addition to the substitute pasty, her original would be free of charge.  The manager came over to apologize as well and they were so nice we almost felt bad them THEM.  The food was fantastic just as it has been every other time I've eaten here or at their other location.  This time the charming \"Tony\"  turned the mistake into a great positive as we got to try a new pasty and got to see some awesome customer service (and training of customer service).  The way they handled it was top notch..we wouldn't have even expected TWO freebies, much less ONE since we really didn't have to wait that long to receive the correct order.  Really can't recommend this place enough, and haven't had a pasty I didn't like."}
{"text":"Imagine this... a delicious, flaky pie crust that's been stuffed with delicious stew like middles.  Yum... making you hungry?  It should be!  This is the kinda cuisine that the Cornish Pasty Company serves up.  And they do it well.  Really well.  So well in fact that I've told my friends in California about this place and we try, in vain, to find something similar in the Bay area.  ((sigh))  Please CPC, come to Sunnyvale, California!

Aside from the tasty food and reasonable prices, this is a joint with unique music and appeal.  It's a cool place for a date though maybe a lil loud for a meeting of any kind.  They have an outdoor patio and inside seating... and a well stocked bar!

I'd definitely recommend Cornish Pasty House to friends and in fact, will have to visit again really, really soon.

See ya there!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Cool atmosphere too.  Eat an early lunch cause if you don't, there will be no dinner after this place.  You can also ask for half backed to take home and heat up..."}
{"text":"*Edit* You can see my previous post below, but I have decided to edit it.  As a fellow business owner, I feel that a prompt and appropriate response should be rewarded.  The manager's response seems completely reasonable to me and therefore I will not only change my rating but I will also be back.  I believe that the issue is being addressed and otherwise this place is great.  Thanks for responding, and hopefully this edit is a help in doing my part... although I know you guys will do just fine with or without my business as your food is delicious, I still appreciate it.  Thanks *end of edit*

So I would normally give this place 5 stars because I love the food here and the ambiance is very cool... HOWEVER, 2 of the last 3 times I have gone I have seen cockroaches there...

The first time I was sitting at the bar and there was a cockroach on their walk in fridge.  Then a couple months later I was sitting at a table in the stage area they have right when you walk in, and roach came scurrying across the railing next to our table.

I'm sorry, but no matter how good the food is, that's disgusting.  I wrote it off as an anomaly the first time, but twice?  Sorry but I have to let people know..."}
{"text":"This is a really wonderful place! I loved the clever table set up, it felt authentic and fun. The wait staff was very knowledgable, and gave us some great recommendations. The only drawback was the wait time. I guess good food takes a while to bake.

I had the meat and cheese pasty, and it was amazing. Gooey, cheesey, and lots of yummy porky meat. That red wine gravy was tops. 

Will definitely go again, and will bring friends back."}
{"text":"IRISH CAR BOMBS= $3?! WHATTTT!!

Cornish pasty= Meh.
I tried half of my friends(spicy Asiago) okay, Rosemary Chicken- Worse.  The rosemary tasted strange to me just lacking some other flavors. Maybe some other spices??  I LOVE rosemary and I did NOT enjoy this nearly as much as I expected.
Next time i will stick to the desserts those looked appetizing!! Oh how I wish I would have went with my first gut feeling.  So mad at myself for that!!

Oh yelp you disappointed me so... I was expecting sooooo much from this place and I was severely let down by my choice.

I will give you another shot when someone pulls my leg again.

Someday..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great setting with $3 Irish car bombs and money pasties. The service is great with not much wait time, if any. Great beers on tap. They recently expanded the size of this location and they now have a pool table.

Also, check out the awesome and also creepy picture when you walk in to the right and tell me those don't look like zombie like humans."}
{"text":"Have to say, I love coming here but the hostess kind of threw our mood off with her lack of hospitality. We will be back but can't say that it will be very soon."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  Love this restaurant.  We sat on the side patio instead of inside.  The waiters were very attentive.  Promptly took our order, and the food came out quickly.  The food arrived Delicious, and HOT.  Just a warning... let it cool a little bit.  :)   I definitely recommend everyone try this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place always seems busy, and the boyfriend has had it a few times, so we gave it a whirl. Its quite dark in here, and it seemed quite warm to me, so I was a little distracted. The food was good. You have to want that pasty though, because that's almost your only choice! The filling choices are plentiful and I'm sure anyone can find a combo that sounds appealing. They have great drink specials too if you're looking for a deal on drinks! I'd go again!"}
{"text":"Good food. Filling, comforting, warm. I love going in the wintertime or getting some take out when it rains. The pasties are warm and delicious. Everyone loves the bangers and mash, but forgets about the delicious soups and the awesome pasta salad. Even the vegan pasties are killer."}
{"text":"So my buddy and I have been here twice so far. We've tried the Pilgrim, Rosemary Chicken, Full English Breakfast, and the Chicken Tikka. We both loved the Pilgram best. It's delicious. My friend liked the Chicken Tikka, but it was a little too out there for me. The Rosemary Chicken is good, but not great. And the English Breakfast doesn't work that well in a pasty. The family style/community tables aren't my fave, but tonight we got our own small table and that was better. They do tend to run out of popular pasties, so it's best to get there before 6.   Don't love the punk music, but at least the volume is low enough that it's not too bad. The servers are super nice and helpful. The ambiance is pretty good, dim with candle lighting, which is nice. So a great place to have dinner. The pasties run about $10-$11, which seems fair. Oh, and my friend enjoys their giant Guinness as well. And that about covers it.

Update: On our third visit, we tried the bangers and mash. Hands down our new favorite!"}
{"text":"First time I came here I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know what a pasty was. I was pleasantly surprised. Pretty genius idea to put savory foods in a puff pastry. I had the salmon pasty. OMG! It was the best one I have tried. My other friends got the cheese steak and the pesto chicken. They were definitely not as good as the salmon. The salmon had this nice texture of being cooked perfectly well. Not too over cooked and not undercooked. The sauce that bathed this salmon was creamy, but unexpectedly, not too heavy. The only downside is, it is pretty dark there so I had a hard time seeing the menu and my food, but I guess that's part of the atmosphere. I definitely will go back here and definitely recommend this place if you have never eaten here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places to eat!  I try to take a new person there every time I go so I can spread the Cornish Pasty love.  I haven't tried a pasty that I don't like with the exception of the tikka masala.  I love tikka masala otherwise, but in a pasty it just didn't taste right.  I also don't like that since all pasty's are premade you can't substitute or take out any ingredients you might not like.   That being said, this place is amazing and you have to check it out."}
{"text":"I was a little leary after reading about the customer service. Wow, yes it's busy and the staff is squeezing through small passages since the tables and chairs take up a lot of room, but I have no complaints. The food was AMAZING, the drinks were strong, and the service was fine (aka busy!) HINT: Go early or you will be waiting for a table. I would love to see them move into a bigger place, like maybe next to Postino's in downtown Gilbert! Hint, hint!"}
{"text":"The worst drinks and food I've ever had in my life I would only tell my worst enemies to come to this location I couldn't take more then two bites of the disgusting food and the Moscow mule that I drank tasted like they went into the bathroom and scooped some piss water out of the urinal"}
{"text":"This was like a party in my mouth.  My mom used to make a traditional meat and potato pasty that we ate with ketchup but I had no clue these could be so versatile. The roasted garlic oven fries \"chips\" were amazing perfectly cooked. I had the meat and cheese and my friend had the cajun chicken so we split it and each got half of each kind. ..server made us and I was soooo glad he did! ! I loved them both equally. . The red wine gravy is AWESOME and the home made thousand island is the perfect tang. I was less impressed with the banoofee dessert thing we tried but we will be back for pasty again"}
{"text":"If you have not discovered this little jewel in the desert, you must stop everything and go grab a pasty and a cold beer.

I have been a frequent visitor of this establishment since its very humble beginnings in Tempe where they were so tiny and you had to wait for a chance open spot at the bar. They have since expanded the original location in Tempe and opened two more locations in Mesa and Scottsdale. 

I tend to frequent the Mesa location due to its location and convenience for me. There is a bigger hipster college crowd in Tempe, and a great place to be as well.

My mainstay is a cup of tomato soup, which is unlike any around. I have been disappointed with many restaurants tomato soup, but this one never disappoints. It comes with a couple slices of bread and real butter. 

I then order any number of pasty's, and I must say I have never met a one I didn't like. The Rosemary Chicken is always a great bet, they also offer many pasty's as vegetarian options, and have a vegan pasty of the day, just ask.

The beer selection is the bomb, and you can't beat $3.00 Irish Car Bombs all day everyday.

A great place to bring your out of townies and family, as well as make it a weekly stop for yourself."}
{"text":"I love the look on my moms face when we go to eat Patsys. We are Welch and she gets so excited to experience a piece of our family history. The Patsys are always amazing and the staff is great. We recently took my 95 year old Grandma here for dinner and she loved it. The audience is so fun too!"}
{"text":"What a great place!   Food made to order and so many pasties to choose from.   I had the Shepard pie and would order again.   Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Wowww, just wowww....so good! Never knew mushrooms could melt! I ordered the portobello chicken. I could literally taste each if the flavors, chicken, basil,bell peppers roasted, mushroom marinated and mozzarella The  distinct  flavours meld into something extremely delicate at the same time very refined, like some sort of a concoction of deliciousness. And it is extremely filling too. It was like having multiple orgasms inside my mouth, the best pasty ever! Granted I was hungry after tennis, and I am not some rich connoisseur of taste, but I can see good food when it meets my mouth, and this place is just pure gorgeousness. A must visit and your mouth will thank you for it!!"}
{"text":"Cool place and vibe the food and beer selection was great they were stuffed with pretty much anything you could think of. Great for a group or two people. Had the steak and potatoes pasty very good and shared the Greek salad huge and tasty drinks are strong and beers are large."}
{"text":"1. Oven chips with garlic and jalepenos.
2. Any of the soups
3. Any of the Pasties
4. BANOFEE PIE!!

BOOM. done.

PS. My favorite soup is the Mushroom, Walnut, Spinach; my favorite pasty is the Royale with Cheese with thousand island dressing. Yes it's pretty much a bacon cheeseburger with fries but the pasty crust just makes it oh so much better. I also give the $3 car bombs a thumbs up."}
{"text":"First time here, our whole group loved it. Friendly service. Each of us ordered a different pasty. Delish garlic chips (fries) as an app. Lots of beers on tap...they know how to double pour a Guinness. Worth a try for sure, we will return."}
{"text":"It's weird, I always have the most difficult time choosing a pasty because they always sound so amazing.  Well this time,  it was different, it was like I opened the menu with my eyes closed and dropped my finger to the item at random...The Royale with Cheese!

From top to bottom I loved it all.  The medium cooked hamburger, grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, a cheddar swiss blend and French fries all wrapped up in a golden pastry with 1000 island for dipping.  I even requested a second side of 1000 island because it was a match made in heaven.  I don't throw that phrase around that easily so when I say it.....believe me, I mean it.  

The atmosphere always puts me in a mood...you know that mood you get into when you don't care about anything...especially time.  And that's a good thing because you are in for typically a 20 minute wait while your pasty.  That's why I always order  their large Hoegaarden...it definitely adds to that mood.  

I can't decide which locations I like...but so far...if I am in an outdoors mood I go to the Tempe location and if I am in the mood for indoors I go to Mesa.  Both have great music playing in the background...sometimes Zeppelin, or Iron Maiden, or Judas Priest...that sort of music.  Their seating consists of either large picnic type tables, great for large groups or belly up to the bar to eat and drink and be entertained.  If you like to people watch..I recommend eating at the bar where you can watch the magic. 

Overall the experience is nothing short of fantastic every single time so please...never change.  But who am I to tell you what to do and what not to do.  I look forward to my next trip and the new Spicy Barbecue Chicken Pasty.  It sounds amazing."}
{"text":"If you read my review for the other location in Tempe, you know how I feel about this place. 

I have a love-love relationship with Cornish; there will never be any hate. Never once have I been disappointed in the food and I can honestly say I've tasted 3/4 of the pasties on the menu. 

Do I have an addiction? I think it's safe (and probably best) to say \"yes\". 

Their new appetizers that were just released this summer all sound quite delicious, however, I have only tried the Jalepeno Cheese Dip with Pastry Curls and I was impressed. 

Usually have awesome service here. Of course, considering the fact that my boyfriend, my roommates, and I were here at least once every couple of weeks, we were bound to have one bad experience as far as service goes. 

I will not hold that against you, my beloved Cornish Pasty Co. All of the wonderful experiences make up for that one not so great one."}
{"text":"For a first experience I would say this was a total bummer. Waiting for the food to be served was quite a painful process. Kids we're getting impatient , I was getting impatient and my wife was growing disappointed. This is the place out of all the options in the East valley that she picked to have dinner on Mother's Day. Wait time was horrible. 
The food was good, hot and freshly made. 
Waiting for the check was easy, that was served very quickly!!! Waiting again for our server to grab my card and pay the bill became another disappointment. My wife finally grabbed the bill and card and went up to another server and request they run our card. We paid and left. 
I was never t expecting to be compensated and was not by our server. The server that process ed our payment gave us a discount. 
Not a great first impression. I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  Be sure to ask for Jessica M for
 your server... We've nicknamed her 'happy' because she has a terrific positive and happy attitude... And does a great job too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. This place is awesome for food, friends, and drinks. Their pasty is wonderful. I wish I knew about this place a lot sooner so I could have eaten their more often. I always order their cheese burger pasty and its just amazing. Everything about it is delicious. I can't find one wrong thing about this place at all. Their drinks are awesome and at a good price as well. The environment is pretty darn cool. It's definitely an Irish pub so if its super packed (Friday-Saturday night) be prepared to be sitting by someone, but that's how we made some wonderful friends as well that night. Definitely will be going there again and again until I probably die."}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here for years finally went and so bummed I never came earlier I LOVE it so many items to love. The pilgrim is like thanksgiving came early the red pepper black bean, chicken and jalapeño soup was so good I got some to go for the next day. The British chips (fries) were so good especially in the red wine gravy that comes with the pasty! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Legit and authentic. 

I think I've tried them all (the pasties) and there were only 2 I didn't care for. My go to traditional pasty is the bangers and mash and when I feel like a little spice in my life I go with the Carne Adovada. If you really want to mix it up, try the chicken greek or the salmon.

Their soups are amazing. It took me awhile before I ever ordered soup at this place and now I never don't get at least a cup, even when its 110 degrees outside. The red pepper/chicken is where I started but now I can't get away from the cream of leak. I wasn't even sure what leaks were before I tried it and now I can't get enough. It has a certain addictive quality.

I also like the added apps and sides. 

Love the bar. Service is good but has a strong hipster presence. 

If you can handle tattoos and piercings along with great food and a nice beer selection this is must to check out."}
{"text":"Not exactly like the pasties I had over in Cornwall, but pretty damn close. Favorite is the savory pork with apple and red wine reduction sauce. Fan-freakin-tastic!"}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM!! Cornish Pasty is an awesome place!!! Most of the seating is large community tables and there is a very warm, welcoming vibe to the whole place!! They have a great selection of beers and the food was AMAZING!!! Very authentic and so delicious!! 

This will definitely become a MUST GO place for me anytime I visit AZ!!!"}
{"text":"I have given this place my fair share of try's. I have to say it has greatly improved to a great place to dine! At first, it wasn't all that great. After the expansion and added menu items or whatever it was they changed (i.e. portion sizes), they are phenomenal. I have tried about 4 different pasties and they have all exceeded my expectations!

The service is great for a leisure hipster type place. You can be comfortable here if you're a Harley type, trendy type, business type or any blend of any type. Despite it's purposefully rustic décor, it's quite welcoming and warm. Servers are friendly and welcoming as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is great.  One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, all their locations are awesome.  Tons of beer options, amazing specials on car bombs.  Food is stellar...my favorite pasties are the Pilgrim, Guinness Stew, Rosemary Chicken, and Cajun Chicken...but I've never had a bad one.  Seriously amazing....so so good."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!!  My mouth salivates every time I think of their food.  

A great place for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  They have a wonderful variety of beer and wine to choose from.  AWESOME atmosphere!

TWO THUMBS UP!!!!"}
{"text":"I still love this place.  Got addicted by going to the one by ASU.  The expanded dining area at this one is really nice.  As always $3 car bombs, ginormous beers with a good selection, and pasties is a winning combination.  Recently had the Reuben.  It was super good.  And then there is my old Lamb Vindaloo and Bangers & Mashed favorites.  I actually like too many to usually even stray from the few that I've had an loved."}
{"text":"i had wanted to try cornish pasty for months and finally went there. i REALLY wanted to like and i did but truly wasn't all that impressed. i had the\"oggie\"- it was good but nothing spectacular. my boyfriend got the veggie greek- one of the dipping sides seemed to be pure tahini, which was SO not tasty. the place was packed fora wednesday night at 8:30 and seemed to be more of a wanna be irish pub/dive bar. i could have gotten a free car bomb with a foursquare check in, but even that didn't make me give it an extra star. i'll go to the original and check it out, but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"The people here are very polite and welcoming. The chicken tikki masala pasty is really fantastic! The rosemary chicken and the chicken pot pie pasties are divine and that red wine gravy is to die for. I also just only paid 3 bucks for pint of Guinness!"}
{"text":"I'm sure there are those who would not enjoy the food, service, or atmosphere at the Cornish Pasty Company. They would be wrong. Don't hang around those kind of people. Life is too short. We started with the chicken liver pate and Scotch egg. Both quite excellent. I really liked the honey mustard that came with the egg but my wife requested something else and tried the tsiki sauce. Killer. Btw, these folks aren't pouring stuff out of a bottle or bucket or microwaving your dinner. This is real food prepared by real chefs who know what their doing and it shows. I hadn't had a pate in a long time so it kind of got to be 'new' again for me. First bite. Interesting. And every mouthful became more interesting and delightful. I refrained from liking the bowl because of some sense of shame if seen.We split an 'Oggie' for our pasty experience. This is I think their most popular pasty and it was very good dipped in the house-made red wine gravy. Steak, rutabaga, potatoes, and onion. There's probably fifteen or so other pasties to choose from. Note there is a difference between a pasty (short a) and pasty (long a). In some places, pasties (long a) are required. We ordered dessert based on hearing a 'wow' from a nearby table and looking just in time to see a spoon moving from mouth back to dessert. Choc cake, topping and ice cream. Yes.

Top staff. Jenny, our waitress, if she's in, ask for her. Blouse and jewelry to match her tats. And any young woman with a 'Dad' tat hits this Grandpa's sweet spot. Randy, the manager, cruises the place and seems to genunely care about your dining experience. The staff seems to like working t

One last word that maybe best describes this place. I ordered a Speckled Hen Ale. Unusual to even see on the menu. English ale. I had to try it. #1 - it was an ale of a quality I would love to drink it on a regular basis. #2 - it was served at the proper temperature so that one could fully enjoy its quality. Not that American fetish ice-cold thing that allows a nation to drink swill and not know it. Yep. Beer snob here. Sue me. But not too bad. I drink Grain Belt whenever I have a chance."}
{"text":"Love the location on Guadalupe, the other one on University wasn't as great as far as the atmosphere. The food is amazing. Everyone, even if you HATE peas, have to try the \"mushy peas\"! They are beyond wonderful. Love the look and feel of this location. The people are friendly. This is a darkly lit environment, gives you a feel for an old pub in England or Ireland."}
{"text":"Try the broccoli and cauliflower bake. .. to die for!"}
{"text":"The service was nice and the food was quality. I might have just ordered the wrong thing since everyone I know hypes this place up a lot more than I think it deserves. I got the Italian and it wasn't anything exceptional. The pastry itself was amazing and their ranch is unique and really good."}
{"text":"I have eaten at both locations and enjoyed them.
The tempe location is crazy small and 1/2 the experience is watching everyone move in a small spot.
The mesa location is much larger and we sat at the bar and watched a well orchestrated staff put out fresh wholesome ingredients.

Be sure to try the oven baked chips ( fries) but be sure you can handle the chopped garlic if chosen.....it is strong !!!!
I've had the Royale with cheese pasty and it is a filling , well seasoned and savory experience! 
My girlfriend had the italian which she enjoyed.

The only complaint i have and one i have seen here before is the music. Really makes no sense with the atmosphere. I love 80s & 90 's music but it just doesnt seem to work here.l"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! I was referred by a friend in Tucson.  I had the take out for my family.  It  was interesting place when I went inside.  Not sure I would want to eat in there but I got the food home and it was unbelievably great ! The kids loved it :) Im a fan and plan on doing this again asap"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for people not from AZ cause

1) you can only find in AZ
2) glorified hotpocket
3) really cool hipster place to eat.

I must have given the dobson and tempe location at least a couple hundred bucks. I will visit when I come back to AZ."}
{"text":"Been here many times. I always come back. Good beer, good pasties, good sticky date pudding"}
{"text":"I wish we had this place back home! I'm now hooked on pasties! The hubs and I ordered the shepherd's pie and I got the chicken massala. It's a little on the expensive side and the portions aren't very big. We actually ordered a third shepherd's pie cause we were still hungry and it was so good! lol. The strongbow cider was also very delicious. We'll be going back here again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"My first visit and it was Lunch rush on a Friday. The wait was long but the food was hot and fresh. I ate the original and the steak was juicy, the potatoes soft yet firm and onions. What I really liked is the thin dough. I was expecting a bunch bread but it was nice the baked outer crust. Also tried the hummus and pita chips. That was so good, worth it!
I will be back, but not on lunch rush:)"}
{"text":"Returned to Cornish Pasty this weekend. Wonderful service, food was DELICIOUS yet again. We had a Wells Banana Bread Beer and a Ballast Point Grapefruit IPA, they were wonderful. 

I had the Pepper Steak the first time, I can't recall on the second but both were outstanding. My girlfriend had the Pilgrim the first time and the Chicken Pot Pie the second time. They were to die for.

I highly recommend the Chocolate Butter Cake with ice cream, or the The Banoffe for dessert."}
{"text":"this place lacks atmosphere, but what it lacks there it makes up in spades when it comes to their pasties. I have never had such a good one before. Even if it's a drive to get there, you should go out of your way."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this restaurant to me, so I went. It was fantastic! The food is great, and different! The atmosphere is also wonderful. It is close to my house so we'll be going often!"}
{"text":"I had never had a pasty.I had heard of them but had zero expectations. My wife was less than enthused when I suggested we try it.

They had a Scottish Egg on the menu and I had heard of them and decided to try it. It was delicious!

We ordered a roast beef pasty and my wife ordered a chicken pot pie.

They were both delicious! We are now pasty converts! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun relaxed place to eat!! I always sit at the bar because I totally enjoy watching them prepare everything. Maybe my review won't be the best for most people checking this place out...but I have never actually had a pasty but have been here half a dozen times. So for those who are too scared of the pastys or don't see something they like or just want to check out something else on their menu...I must say, try the artichoke, bowtie pasta salad!! Its amazing! The dressing is great, as well as the spinach, pasta and feta! I have tried to replicate this at home..no success. So if you aren't the pasty type, try the salad!!"}
{"text":"Four years later and it's really improved. I didn't even think I'd been to this one before until I saw my 2011 review. I really like the decor and the servers were friendly. Also, there wasn't a heat problem like I wrote about before (though it's a much cooler time of year). Good location, though the Scottsdale location is now my favourite with its amazing patio."}
{"text":"My first question... what the heck is a pasty??? A group of 8 of us sat outside on a Friday evening... the waitress was awesome, keeping up with our beers and everything :) I went with the safe choice, I think it was called \"the Italian\", but it was filled with marinara sauce and meat (maybe sausage and/or peperoni). It was very tasty- reminded me of a stromboli with a thinner, flakier crust. Next time I'll try something more adventurous, I swear :) I did have a bite of the bf's \"lamb and mint sauce\" pasty and that was very good too (I'm not a total food wuss... really, I'm not). 

Hoping to get back there again soon to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Man alive, what a pleasant surprise of a new place for us. 

The food was excellent. Two people could easily share one dinner pastie. 

The Carne Adovada was hands down the very best we are, although the Spicy BBQ turkey was excellent as well!

We had no off-switch when there. We had their house chips with garlic and this hot chocolate toffee dessert dish that delighted my tastebuds.  

Super friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch with my husband, our baby girl and my brother-in-law. So good!!! I had the Greek Pastie, my husband had the Shepherd's Pie Pastie and the bro had the Pilgrim Pastie. All delicious, service was great, good beers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! It was my first visit but certainly not my last. I'm now a pasty fan (Carne Adovado & Italian). Luckily we arrived at 5:30pm as this place was packed by 6:30pm on a Tuesday! Several at our table had dessert and it too looked spectacular! Great variety of tap beer, up to 32oz., and our server was very attentive. Overall, exceptional experience!"}
{"text":"pasty/past/
Noun: A folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables aka AMAZINGNESS! Yes, amazingness is a word. A friend and I had decided to check this place out, and absolutely fell in love. I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty: Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies and mexican stewed tomatoes, with a side of sour cream and salsa. If you want to add a lil more heat you can request some sriracha. They have a great selection of wine (I'm partial to their Malbec) and beers and their happy hour is killer. 

The ambiance alone is pretty sweet as well. We sat at the bar, which is purely lit with candles. The tables are set with black church pews with candlight and dim lighting throughout. If it's a nice evening they have plenty of outdoor seating as well. Everyone that works there was soo chill and laid back. Made for a great evening ! 

Just hope next time I have enough room to try their dessert!"}
{"text":"Delicious pasties!  OMG! You have so many choices it is hard to decide. My favorites are the Oggie and the Royale with Cheese, but you cannot go wrong with any of their other pasties... BTW, they are pronounced \"past-ee.\"  Don't forget to order dessert! I like the Shirley Temple Pudding or the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding.  Although I am still open to try the other ones, especially their version of the Banoffee Pie (you can't go wrong with bananans, toffee, and cream).  Expect the inside of the place to be loud.  Although we have been there at odd times and it is pretty quiet.  The outside is pretty comfortable, even during summer or in the cold of winter (they have misting systems all over, and powerful, yet comfortable, heaters).  Their service is superb!  The servers friendly and fast.  Oh! Did I mention you can take unbaked pasties to go?!  Seriously!  Give this place a try.  You won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places!  Absolutely everything is delicious. Start with the potato leek soup - only a cup because you will be completely stuffed when you also get your beer and pasty but you must try it. AMAZING beer selection. I've had the tikka masala, the vindalo, the Cajun chicken , the porky, the bangers and mash, the salmon... The list goes on but not a single disappointing selection. If you have not tried this place,  GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Hearty - Unique - Friendly

Switch your evening routine of drive thru options or typical restaurant go-tos and have a sit down meal in a casual and warm setting. We arrived Wednesday evening at 10 PM and were pleasantly surprised with a low-lit, cozy environment. Service was attentive and hospitable. My boyfriend had the Pilgrim while I enjoyed the Lovely Bit a Salmon. It was decadent and filling - the perfect meal for a late dinner. The soft crunch of their made to order Signature Pastys is a necessity that can easily become addicting - don't short yourself with ordering anything else on the menu before you try one! Nothing as signature or authentic as a meal here.

I rated them just short of 5 stars because their Chocolate Bread Pudding tasted more of brandy than chocolate but if that's your booze of choice I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Oh Cornish Pasty Co, I wish I could eat you every day.  The more traditional pasties are great, as well as the Royale with cheese and the Chicken Tikka Masala one."}
{"text":"The main reason to miss a star is that the one that we ordered (the mint-lamb) was a bit dry to my taste and no mint to taste at all. For desert we had the apple one and that was much better. I'd like to try a different one some other time and compare :).

Good environment, and for groups, friendly staff who would explain you what they are cooking!!"}
{"text":"What a treat. 
It's like having your favorite meal wrapped in a croissant and baked: totally reminds me of a childhood meal, hot pockets. 
I had the chicken pot pie; sometimes a consistent temperature is challenging.  
The broccoli and cauliflower w/cheese was also good."}
{"text":"Recently went to the Tempe location and they now serve sides as well. Yippee!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! I finally got to try a Pasty! I've tried to go to the Tempe spot a few times, but it was either almost closing, so kitchen was closed, or lunch, too busy. But this weekend the 101 to our house was closed, so had to take a detour down Dobson, passed CPC, and yelped (do I get a prize for working that in?) at my husband to turn the car around! I've been trying to try this place for years, I pleaded. 

Boddingtons on tap makes me happy, the Pasty I chose was the asiago chicken with roasted green chili, double happy. Hubby had lamb with a mint sauce, he ate the entire thing, amazing, then had a big fat nap when we got home.

The interior is diner-like they do have much more seating than the Tempe spot (church pews with tables) and a patio at this location. I wouldn't mind coming back for a patio-beer day. Oh and the waitress did mention they might start doing brunch on Sundays soon, including mimosas and bloody marys."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever tried here has been delicious.  The atmosphere is always so calming and casual.  I love the decor and how they turned doors into tables with pews as seats.  Sometimes it does take a while to get recognized by a waiter or waitress, but that may also be because it is always so busy in there.  The one draft I wish they had is kiltlifter--- since it is a local favorite, they may see more people ordering it if it were on draft instead of in the bottle."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been to the Tempe location just once and just realized that there's a location in Mesa! This location is much easier to find ( they have a pretty big sign out front) compared to the Tempe location which is more of a hidden gem. The food was amazing and prices are so reasonable. The owners have done a really good job with making sure they deliver consistent product between the two locations. I definitely recommend Cornish Pasty for a unique dining experience with great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Delicious. Food comes lava hot. Mushy peas and scotch eggs were awesome. Kinda dark but I get the esthetic. Staff were fabulous and took the time to explain everything. Recommendations were on point. Price was reasonable too. Going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.  I love the ambience both indoors and outdoors.  Beer is cheap and the pasties are fantastic.  If I ever have friends from out of town visit, odds are I am taking them to Cornish Pasty as it's a fun, casual restaurant that isn't too expensive, has a variety of fillings to satisfy anyone's palate, and you can hold a conversation despite it being pretty packed at times.

My number one pasty is the Pilgrim and I am known by my friends to swear by it.  I have never, ever been disappointed by the Pilgrim as it blends sweetness and savoriness wonderfully.  Other ones to fall back on are the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Royale with Cheese.  I also love the chips/french fries as an appetizer.  

Sitting at the bar is also fun as you can watch the chefs make the pasties and they are nice people!

Only cons are: small bathrooms, pasties always seem to take longer than I can bear to be ready to eat, and I am in a pit of despair when they sell out of the Pilgrim!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience. We usually play a couple of pool games and spent at least an hour or two having dinner. Would have given a 5 but the amount of potatoes they are adding in the pasties made me give a 4 rating. 
Love the tandoori and jalapeño chicken bean soup. These are a must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"We usually go to the Tempe location. This time, I think we just went on an off day at this location. We usually enjoy the Potato Leek soup, but it was way too salty so it was hard to get through it. We also ordered the Rosemary Pasty, and it just tasted off. Our waitress was very nice however and accommodating. Maybe we'll take a break before coming back and trying something else."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co. Is a delicious adventure across the pond without leaving Phoenix. Tonight my sister and I had another great meal here. The service was only so so but the pasties are so good that I will give them a pass on service at least for now. We were originally seated in an area of the patio outside which we were told by the hostess, used to be a smoking area but they had recently turned it into a non smoking area. We really wanted to sit outside on this beautiful evening so we put up with the lingering smoky aroma and ash trays that were sitting on the table next to us. After we had ordered drinks, the table behind us proceeded to light up a cig. We were not to fond of this since we were told by the hostess that this was now a non smoking area. We decided to move tables since we observed that another nearby table, outside of the \"smoking\" area. We did inform our waitress of the move before we officially made it. I know that this is not necessarily the best thing to do in a restaurant setting because of the set up of waiter/ess per table or area but since we were mislead into believing that we were seated in a non smoking area, we felt it necessary to move.

Anyhow, our waitress did not seem to fond of the fact that we had moved and she rudely made the comment to us that and I quote \"THAT IS THE SMOKING AREA\" well I am sorry miss lady! We were told it was non smoking!! I would rather not be around cigarette smoke during my delicious pasty meal. I ended up ordering some Cornish coleslaw to start which was fantastic. It does have a fair amount of raw red onions in it, so be aware if you are ordering it on a date or a lunch break. It is more of savory coleslaw rather than sweet with hints of horseradish. I ordered the bangers and mash pasty. It was absolutely delicious! They do make their own sage sausage in house and it is oh so good! Mashed potatoes and sausage with a sage sausage gravy, YUM!! My sister had the chicken pot pie pasty and was equally impressed.

Overall the food is delicious. I have had many a pasty in England and these area equally as good if not better to some that I have had in around various cities in England. The service is hit or miss. I will be back for more because I love the food!"}
{"text":"a great British pub. Highly recommend the Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tiki Masala. Both are wonderfully tasty. Great selection of craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me. Met a family member here for dinner during a recent visit.  I could tell by the look on his face he was the unique decor made him suspicious of the place but I assured him the food was outstanding.  After having dinner my guest stated we had to make CPC a regular stop during visits. 

I love this place and only wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I'm feeling bad about giving this place just an \"A-OK\" because of the many positive reviews.
I can't personally say I'm a huge fan of this place, so I can't give it four stars, but I will say that I will be visiting this place again.
The beer selection is really great and the mugs are worth a smile.
The atmosphere is \"young and hip\" and reminds me of a Scottish Pub I visited in the past.  The staff is truly nice and trying to be helpful.  Though we went at a weird time because our server changed in the middle.
The food though wasn't what I hyped it up to be, perhaps I set the bar too high.  The soup though was totally weird.  My sister and I ordered two soup; one was way too salty and the other was truly bland.  The Pasty itself wasn't bad.  I've never had a pasty and it tasted very well, Pasty.  The taste won't blow you away or cause you to over-eat, but it is fun to eat, and the non traditional pasties are worth trying.  The other thing we ordered was a lemonade.  That was pretty good.

Over all, the atmosphere was pretty good, but judging on food, it was a little better than okay and kind of interesting.  Oh, almost forgot, the food is truly very very filling.
We had:
Cottage Pie Pasty
Lemonade
Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty
Leek Soup

I went with my mother recently and she totally digs the food, and I found it more memorable than the first time, but the food still didn't blow me away, still, I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick bite with friends on the way to the airport. I split a Shepherds Pie with a friend and we both devoured every bite. The beer was great too! We were seated in chairs that reminded me of church pews. The ambiance was casual and relaxed. I would definitely come back to try out more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Gah, so tasty. Bummed they were out of the bangers and mash pasty, but my second choice was damn tasty -- the table ordered Royale with Cheese, Pilgrim, Peppered Steak, and the Portobello Chicken, and everyone was more than satisfied. $9 average for the entrees was well worth it. 

Also, the chocolate chip cake was amazing. Dense after the meal, no doubt. But if you're sticking around to chat, you can definitely find room ;)

Solid beer selection, too."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect and was totally blown away! Great beer selection, and the food was fantastic. It was like a movie that you don't expect to be that great but becomes your favorite. I am looking for opportunities to get back to the East side of town so we can eat here again. (Come hungry, the portions are also large)."}
{"text":"Love THE CAJUN with an order of chips with garlic and jalapenos.  

We've had the Royale, Rueben, Acovada and the Greek.  All good but I go back to the K JUN.

The Lentil soup is amazing too.  Wouldn't have tried it but saw someone here I knew and they recommended it.

The Banofee desert is awesome but have them heat it up or get it to go and nuke it for 30 seconds and it changes your life.  Without being heated it's still very good but heated it goes to another level."}
{"text":"Definitely the best food in Mesa! Original, delicious, and more choices than you could ever imagine... Pasty's is consistently satisfying! I can't recommend one specific dish because I've had 'em all and have a difficult time choosing one specific item. Just make sure you order a few side dishes because they really bring your meal together. And the chefs will make any item as spicy as you prefer! By far the best place to eat in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh ingredients you watch them make your food in front of you. Tender flaky crust, a must try in Mesa."}
{"text":"Man I felt like I was over in England...or Ireland...or wherever this type of food is served. It was great food, service was great and the ambiance was spot on. Can't wait to go back. It's been a minute so i forgot what I had but I can tell you that bread is amazing.  The scotch eggs dude...perfect."}
{"text":"There are so few places worth the hype.. Cornish Pasty.. THE EXCEPTION.  The Pilgram is the Third Thursday of November in one bite.. Truly unique, and one of the most take you to a place, and time bites.. The decor, music, and the staff, really make this place work, The prices are right in line, and they have a real kick ass beer selection, I have read about spotty service, and I could see that being the case, but man... the food.. Probably the best meal under 10 bucks in the Copa.. Thanks CP!"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio during dinner service. Server was very nice but her menu knowledge was seriously lacking. They didn't seem to give her the training she needs to be successful. We ordered two pasties after relaxing with our beers. It was relatively busy per usual on a Friday night, so the food took a little longer but we weren't stressed at all. Another server ran our food over (no issue there!) Unfortunately she only had my pasty and at that point in time let us know that the kitchen made the wrong one and asked if we wanted to try the one they made instead. (Not trying to be a pain and also being hungry we obliged.) Also knowing my girlfriend is some what picky I figured it wouldn't work out. Any-who she didn't like it so we ended up sharing mine, taking her original correct order Togo after having another beer. I like the atmosphere and food but FOH training needs to be stepped up. Communication is important and I'm guessing our order was either rang in incorrectly or the wrong food went out to the wrong table. Never saw a manager, the servers bought one of the pasties(had it comped later by the manager) Just packing service overall."}
{"text":"Wow, I was definitely impressed by this restaurant. I don't normally like pasties or pies that aren't sweet. And the English aren't exactly famous for their cuisine. But Cornish Pasty Co pulls it off so well. They've got your straight up traditional pasties with meat and potatoes, but they've also got some Italian or Mexican fusion pasties. 

Today, I got the Bangers and Mash - I thought I'd start out with something more traditional-sounding. Alex A. got the Chicken Alfredo. I liked mine better than his. The pasty crust was so moist and flaky - not at all hard and dry like what I usually get from pasties. My favorite part was the red wine gravy. It was AMAZING and totally pulled the entire pasty together. Alex's Chicken Alfredo, on the other hand, came with a marinara sauce, which I thought was too sweet/tomato-y. We also got a side of garlic/jalapeno chips, which actually means fries in British. They're super fresh and comes with the potato peels still on them. 

The restaurant itself was also really nice. It does have that British pub feel. I thought the service was a little slow, but that's only because we were in a rush. I also thought that the food was a little pricey for how much we got, but the taste definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"I'll tell you what, my wife and I visit this Pasty on our special date nights at least twice a month. We could have special date night anywhere we like but we choose the Mesa Cornish Pasty, why? Is it the food, yeah it's delicious. Is it the atmosphere? That's nice too, but the main reason we visit is tabletouchin' Nessie, she's a lovely energetic lady that just brings a positive energy I'd swear it makes the food tastes better; goshdarnit if I don't leave here lovin' my wife even more. Thank you Nessie for being the hot dogginest best table toucher this side of the ol' Mississip'."}
{"text":"Came here the other night and it was very crowded. We were able to find a seat outside after the hostess told us it would be a 45-minute wait to get our food once we ordered. Ended up being an hour and 15 minutes from once we ordered.. Not really sure who our waiter was, we had several different people who were coming by. 

Food was great - my wife and I both loved our pasties and they were very filling. Curious to try the part-baked ones that you can take home and finish cooking. 

Service was subpar, partly because of how crowded it was the night we came, but I'd definitely come back and enjoy some tasty pasties."}
{"text":"I have been to Cornish Pasty twice in the past few weeks. The first time, I actually got a salad so I didn't get to try their famous pasties, however last night we came here with my family and spent more than 4 hours drinking, playing pool, darts, and of course eating! This time I got to try one of their pasty, I got the Chicken Tikka Massala and it was delicious. The puff pastry is very good, and everything tastes homemade! 
Our server (I do not recall his name, he had blond hair though) was very patient with us, especially when it was time to pay! 
Oh and did I mention that they have one of my favorite beer from Belgium  at only $5? LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Stupid good!! Everything is made from scratch and fresh daily, including they're amazing soups!! Seriously the cream of leak soup is to die for and you can't go wrong with any Pasty... they're all amazing!! Why are you still reading this... GO ALREADY!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday lunch with my husband.  Talk about some great pasty's!  I recommend trying The Oggie, The Shepherd's Pie, or the Bangers and Mash.  All three were delicious!  They even have an option to take some home with you...all you have to do is pop them in the oven for a little while.  I hope to go back soon...keep up the good work Cornish Pasty Company!"}
{"text":"So happy we decided to try this! It was delicious and the staff was super nice. I got the bangers and mash pasty. The ultimate comfort food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like coming here. Mushroom walnut spinach soup is fantastic but not consistent. Some days it's pureed (and it's the best) and others it's brothy and chunky (not great...). Kyron was our server tonight and he was awesome - gave us extra thick sliced of bread which made us very happy!"}
{"text":"So if you would like a great restaurant experience with food that makes your taste buds sing.....this is the place!!!   This was our first time and Eric was the bartender, we sat at the bar, he was great in explaining everything and made the experience that much better...BUT then the food came and OH MY GOSH!!!  it was AMAZING!!!!  I ordered the Roast Dinner and my husband ordered the Bangers and Mash, we shared the meatballs...everything was so good and the portions were large..we cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I live in Tucson and I absolutely love this restaurant!  I try and eat here every time we are in the city.  The food is AMAZING and the service is impeccable!!  They have a nice selection of wines and beers and everything is reasonably priced.  The pasties are so great and are huge and the desserts are excellent as well.  If you want a casual place that is simply great - you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Always good food at cornish pasty. 

I've been to their smaller shop over next to ASU.

This one definitely is a lot more of a refined atmosphere. I actually prefer the smaller one because it was very \"divey\".

If you want to have a more classy place to go to come to this location.

All in all if you haven't been to cornish pasty, or had one before definitely have to try at least once.

the one with lamb is the best.. (unless you don't like lamb, then i dont think you will agree with me)"}
{"text":"I have literally been wanted to go to Cornish Pasty Co for 4 years - but we rarely travel to the SE side of AZ since we are in the very NW valley. Since we are moving to Gilbert we've been traveling down there to look at houses and finally we were able to eat at this establish meant

OMG was it super super good! My husband and I shared to Pasties: Meat and Cheese and the Chicken Pesto. 

There are no words for these delicious treats except yum yum yum! Not to mention we had a great server and many delightful dipping sauces (btw their thousand island was better than any i've ever had!)

We also had the Shirley Temple dessert - very tasty and a nice end to the meal

I'm sure we will be frequent visitors to this great place :)"}
{"text":"Every location we've been to has been great - food, service, ambience. We only order the daily vegan pasty options and we love how the staff doesn't even blink (either because people order them frequently or the staff is well trained, or both). We also recommend the oven potatoes with garlic!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company has been on our bookmark list for many years now. And thanks to multiple locations, we were finally able to give them a try.

Honestly, despite being raised by an incredibly British mother, I've never been a big fan of British cuisine. Chocolate? Yes. Food itself? Not really. But what's cool about Cornish is that, if you're not into the traditional meat/potato combinations, there's multiple alternatives available. Whatever you like, you're bound to find something that will work for you.

The restaurant itself definitely has a British pub feel to it, with its heavy wood and overall dark and dingy feeling. I was half expecting to see a fistfight breakout between two blokes arguing over their favorite football teams - and I don't mean the NFL.

We started with the scotch egg, which was far superior in quality to what I've had in the past. I opted for the Italian Pasty, which doesn't appear to be a common choice based on Yelp pictures. It consists of various meats and mozzarella, so I guess you could say it's somewhat similar to a heavily packed calzone. My girlfriend chose The Pilgrim, which includes turkey, onions, potatoes and stuffing. It's served with a side of cranberry sauce and some surprisingly high-quality gravy. Both pasties were excellent, using great-tasting ingredients that were wrapped in a fluffy and fresh shortcrust. In the end, we were both very impressed!

For dessert, despite all the online recommendations for the banoffee pie, we decided to go with the chocolate bread and butter pudding. This was excellent, having a nice, crispy outershell, while managing to be incredibly moist on the inside. The brandy flavoring was subtle enough to where it wasn't overpowering. It far exceeds many other desserts at its price point.

So, why not a perfect five stars? 

It's simple. We were uncomfortable the whole time. Like another reviewer mentioned, the place is incredibly hot, to the point where you end up feeling all gross and sweaty. Another review I saw revealed that their AC was out on one side the building, but they were continuing to seat people as if nothing was wrong. Yeah, perhaps a warning would be nice. No one wants to eat their pasties in a freaking sauna!

If you read the Yelp reviews, you'll see that most complaints stem from the shoddy service. Servers can be very slow and scattered about. No one really checked on us, so if we needed something, we usually had to struggle to get someone's attention. But they're clearly very successful, so I don't see them having the desire to improve in this area anytime soon. 

Overall, food wise, we were quite pleased with the offerings here and will definitely be returning in the future to try some of the other pasties available."}
{"text":"Like.  A lot.
The pasty selection is practically endless.
Oh man, I grew up eating this stuff in MI.  Went so long between having them so when we did it was a huge treat. 
But their variety wasn't something I had even heard about in MI.  Here they create the traditional and turn it up a few notches with some of their own creations.
And here they have a sauce on the side too.  It'a actually a gravy, with noticeable herbs and probably red wine too.  Its tasty stuff, but I think it actually takes away from the wonderful flavor of the pastie itself.

I really like the atmosphere here at this particular location. Granted I'm eating at the bar every time I've dined here so I'm not sure how I feel about the whole picnic table sort of seating which seems kind of communal. I really like the fact that you could come as a group and be together, as close as you want or as far apart as needed and still occupy just one table.  

It just seems kind of rustic in here with architectural elements that appear to have been repurposed.
It is dark, but not quite the envronment for an intimate dinner date.
Something about low lighting and dark wood makes it appealing.
Oh, and I can't forget to mention, they have expanded.  Like double inside from one of the last times we dined here.
And the patio area did likewise.  
This place must get crankin'
Two thumbs up for \"well behaved canines\" being allowed on the patio.  
Y'all know what that means, right?  
And kuddos to the two young ladies who had their well mannered dogs with them today.  

Beer selection is good.  I have always been able to get a draught that appeals to my palate.  
And I am NOT talking Budweiser, Miller or Coors.  I don't even know if they have those options available.

I encourage you to come during the slow part of the day, sit at the bar where you can watch the food prep.
You'll be entertained and educated about their pastie creations, and it might spark your interest to try something different next time."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. So many choices for beer, so many choices for food. Even the vegetarians will be happy. Always busy, so you know the food is fresh. Great place for a group gathering, call ahead to reserve  a section."}
{"text":"Food here is always great. Nobody else in Arizona has a menu like theirs. It is an opportunity to enjoy a real Cornish pasty. You will feel like you are in a real British pub."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite local places.  The food is always amazing and the cheap car bombs always make it a fun time.  Both the Tempe and Mesa locations have their own unique charm and the staff is always great!"}
{"text":"I came to this place while I was around town. And at first I really liked the atmosphere and the staff but I sat there for over 30 minutes and nobody served us. Even when I walk up to them and ask for our orders to be taken. Nobody came up to us and ask. We did not even get a glass of water overall. I have been a Foodie for a long time and had not been disrespected at a restaurant even when it was horrible food, it was not like they were busy or anything. I was terribly disappointed and I would never go back there again even when I am in town."}
{"text":"Last night, I enjoyed a wonderful meal and had a wonderful experience with one of the best waitresses I've ever had. (Devin) did an amazing job, had a wonderful smile and great attitude. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a pasty and I am glad that I first had them here, based on the recommendation of a friend who favors this place. 

This place was jam-packed on a Monday evening! Their pasty menu is really extensive!! We were having a hard time trying to make a selection from among the wide range of premium & signature pasties. We finally decided to settle on the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty(for the Indian flavour) and the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty. 

For appetizers, we had the tandoori chicken wings - these were super oily, so much so that the waitress even gave us extra napkins to wipe off the excess oil.. eww! But I would give this appetizer a slight plus point for the spicy masalas coating the wings, that made it tasty. I just wish they had done a better job of marinating the chicken wings in the proper fashion before cooking them the right way(which's baking & grilling them and not deep frying!!)

The accompanying yoghurt mint sauce was what really caught our attention more than the chicken wings itself. Its super duper delicious!! The waitress who served us was very helpful in explaining the different sauces served here and she even brought us different samplers to try out during the main course.

The lamb vindaloo pasty was awesome, true to it's taste. If you are a lamb fan, you should definitely give this pasty a try. The chicken pot pie pasty was passable with a mixed blend of potatoes, vegetables and chopped chicken. It went well with the yoghurt-mint sauce and the tahini sauce.

Finally, it was desert time and once again we were at a loss to pick one among the various tempting choices on the list. The waitress once again poured in with her help, describing the best and the okayish desserts. If you are a toffee fan, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is the most delicious on the list.  They had also run out of the Chocolate bread & butter pudding that day since everyone seemed to be ordering it. 

We finally decided to give the Banoffie Pie a try. Beware!, the dessert is too much for just two people. We were full by the time we finished off half of the pie. The pie's crust was difficult to break and had a hidden layer of caramel cream within, which complimented well with the whipped cream. Aah, the whipped cream.. is well, not the lighter version, but a heavy thick cream that tastes almost like homemade butter. You can only have so much of that heavy cream. I wouldn't have it again.

I would give this place 4 stars for the food, 3.5 stars for the service. 3 stars for the ambience(they had good candle lighting all over, but if you prefer someplace quiet, then you should skip this place)."}
{"text":"Abridged:
Meat. Cheese. Potatoes. In bread. Oh and Banoffee pie.

Unabridged:
This is my favorite Pasty location. First off, there is tons of space. Tons. The decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel. And there aren't a million ASU students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch. 

Vegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet. 

All the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing. 

One thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.

So, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust. I am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker, but this isn't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar. This looks like texas toast. For serious. Then add some homemade caramel, homemade whipped cream and bananas. This only adds up to a win."}
{"text":"My best friend chose Cornish Pasty Company for her birthday dinner.  The food was really good. I had the Lamb Vindaloo. It was a bit too spicy and I could have used some more of the sauce. I also had a nice hazelnut brown ale with it. The service left something to be desired. We did get refills of water and tea, but we had a hard time getting our server's attention when we needed something. There were long gaps between seating us, taking our order, refilling our drinks, taking our beer order, bringing us our beer, and getting our check. I tried to get help several times as we were eating, but couldn't seem to get anyone over to our table. There was also music playing pretty loudly, making it hard to have a conversation. I'd definitely order food to go, but not sure I'd dine in again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food is absolutely incredible. It's a unique idea for the area and it's executed well. The atmosphere is very pub like, and I think could make an excellent casual date spot or a great place to meet up with friends. 

So, why only 3 stars? The service. When I go out and I pay money for food and drinks, I'm paying a huge premium to be served. Unfortunately, this restaurant is lacking in that department. 

We came for lunch and it was our first time there. We were told to sit anywhere, which was kind of awkward because they have a ton of long tables and we didn't want to annoy anyone by sitting at the other end of one that was occupied. If we had been seated there by a hostess, it would have been less awkward. We found a spot at an unoccupied table and were greeted quickly by our waiter. We ordered, which included 3 pasties, a side, and a salad, but were then told that they were out of lettuce. That was a huge let down. When the food came out we noticed we were missing the side dish we ordered, but by the time we were checked on, we were already more than halfway done, so it was pointless to ask for it when it obviously hadn't been put through to begin with. Our drinks went unfilled and there was way too much time between check ins, so we couldn't even ask for refills.

Admittedly, these issues weren't egregious by any means, but it greatly decreased satisfaction in our lunch experience. I know they are probably going for a laid back pub like experience, but they need to get better wait staff that can offer that experience but still be on top of things. It was slow at lunch, so I hate to imagine how awful it would have been during a dinner rush. I miiight try this place again because the food IS delicious, and if that experience is better then I will update this review."}
{"text":"In a land of endless Chipotle and Red Lobster locations the Cornish Pasty Co is a true GEM! I stopped here while traveling for work from the Pacific NW and then it was well worth the hype (and the wait!)  I ordered the Greek Veggie Pasty and Curried potatoes my meal was sheer perfection!"}
{"text":"So my cousin Dillon knows the history of this food but all I know it's tasty as hell and filling . So my cousin got the tomato soup for starters , huge like you can make a meal out of it. We both got the Mexican which is streak , onion and just a mess of flavors in this package of bread . 26.00 bucks for drink , 2 full entres and soup , great deal. The place is cool with a mix of couches and tables and a pool table and darts yep it's bar to folk. I liked it slot and you will like your Joe dirt waiters lol"}
{"text":"I'm glad I joined Yelp today. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have seen mention of this place, and we wouldn't have had a delicious dinner tonight - or maybe we would have, but these people wouldn't have cooked it.

I enjoyed my meal here, as did my husband. I had their asiago chicken pasty, while he had the Mexican, with no sides. Even so, the meal was filling and flavorful. The atmosphere is fun, and not quite what I expected, with church pews and an industrial sort of feel. Our server was attentive. The only downside was that it seemed a little loud - not the music but the chatter of other people seemed to overwhelm the place. 

I'd like to go back and try their desserts sometime.

It was a little difficult to find this place - it's tucked away in a corner in the plaza right on the corner of Guadalupe and Dobson. We went right past it at first."}
{"text":"I need to update my review of this place badly.  I LOVE Cornish Pasty Company!  My only complaint is that there isn't one in Tucson yet.  YET!  A girl can dream.... but for right now I have to be happy that my husband will bring me one every time he goes to Phoenix to see his family, that I get them anytime I am in Phoenix, and that on my way to and from Pine, I can have a pasty.

I still love the decor, and the vibe this place gives off.  Punk rock music, candles in liquor bottles, large, wooden tables that sometimes need to be shared with other groups.

The service CAN be a little slow at times, but I attribute this to the fact that they have to bake your pasty when you order it, which is not the quickest thing ever.  I know exactly how long it takes, because when my husband brings them home, he asks to get them raw so we can bake them in our own oven.

They have vegetarian and even vegan pastys on top of their delicious meat-filled variety.  I have gotten a tremendous variety of pastys and I have yet to have one that i didn't care for.  I usually go for something vegetarian, but I DID have the Sheppard's Pie one last time and it was amazing.  

Cornish Pasty also has a large beer selection along with some ciders which is just delightful.  The servers know what beer I may want and always have helpful suggestions.

I am a big, big fan of Cornish Pasty Company.  It's always fresh and delicious, decent service, fun atmosphere and all at a good price."}
{"text":"What the heck is a Pasty??? Upon a friends recommendation, we gave Cornish Pasty a try. The food was amazing, the staff was efficient, friendly and attentive without being annoying and the desserts.... WOW. I usually don't have room for deserts, don't make this mistake, save room. The Shirley Temple pudding is not from this world. I am now a Pasty fan and will return for more culinary abuse. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the size of the dinning area. Although they have ample room on their patio, the seating inside is very limited. Most restaurants have enough seats so that as people finish, tables become available regularly. Here, there are 4 tables, so your wait time, if you want to eat inside, can be long. If you go before 5:30, you should be fine, if you go after 6, especially with 4 or more, prepare to wait. I myself will just go at 5:30, eat and be happy."}
{"text":"You must come here! Good beer list and an INCREDIBLE menu. Every time I've been I am torn on what to order. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I had never been here, but kept hearing amazing things about it... So I went the other night with my friends... I was the last minute invite cause they thought I was already out, but I was told they hadn't been seated yet. I literally left right when he called me got there 5 min later and they had been seated. I think the waited 15 min for a table for 6 on a friday night, not bad at all
OK onto the food, I had the greek chicken flavor, and it was so tasty!! It came with taziyki sauce on the side that was so heavenly i wanted to lick the container it was in. My room mate had the spicy asiago chicken and he let me have a bite, and yummy! I must say though the flavors in the greek chicken one were seriously amazing, artichoke hearts... sun dried tomatoes just so good. 
I will be going back hopefully sometime soon. In the meantime  I  want a vat of the sauce to swim in at home"}
{"text":"Lunch trip. The place was mostly empty, I imagine it's a bit more happening during the evening. They have a full bar with plenty of drink options, great brews on tap. Never having a pasty before, I went with the safe choice and selected the cottage pie (shepard's pie with ground beef instead of minced lamb). They bake to order, so the freshness is off the scale here. In fact, sip on your drinks a bit longer as the food is piping hot when it arrives. Our server was extremely nice and helpful with the menu items. 

I thought the pastry was excellent- flaky, fresh, baked just right. The interior was bland. I had to add several shakes of salt and pepper to get a little more flavor from it. Also, the red wine gravy that came on the side was not for me. It just had a peculiar taste, although the server said it was very popular. The prices were good, around $10 for any pasty and a couple bucks for a soda.

I'd like to visit CPC again during the evening and take advantage of the large outdoor patio. I'd bet the right pasty pairs really well with a cold pint of IPA or Guinness. I would try something a little more adverturous next time around, but definitely want to come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The price may seem high until you get down to eating the servings. I am a big guy and can easily put away a lot of food but I even have trouble finding room for this. The pasties are not a meal you can leave in a company fridge for long because someone will seal it. It is that good. Everyone I have ever taken to eat there has said at first the food can be a little rich for their taste but by time we leave they all tell me that they have found their new favorite eatery, that is saying something since a lot of the people I have brought over are from New York or Europe. On a further note there is a wide selection for almost anyone vegetarian included, the tea drinker, or even the ones of us that would like a little beer with our meal. Best of all $3 Irish Car Bombs for the win! I recommend this place to anyone, take your time meet the staff (most of them are heavily tattooed and/or pierced but they are great people kind and friendly and not just because they are paid to be)."}
{"text":"when i ordered an Oggie with ketchup, the waitress said, \"ah, you're from Michigan then.\"  why yes, yes i am.

these pasties are good.  i would take one from up north over these any day, but not by much.  they also have a bunch of other kinds of pasties (not really pasties, more like pasty-inspired foods) for the more adventurous.  it's the Oggie for me though."}
{"text":"We were meeting some friends here for dinner. After arriving early we decided to grab a few drinks at the bar and wait. The bartender was friendly enough and well informed about all the beer selections. We also eyed the pool table and decided we will come back one night just to play a few games. About 15 minutes later our friends arrived and we had a seat. Everything was went smooth until our server decided to start talking politics. Ugh. He mentioned how Trump's favorite drink was the Moscow Mule and went on a semi-rant about how awful Republicans voters are. This indeed offended at least 2 people in my group who are indeed Republicans. It was a bit of a bummer that our night had to become awkward and ruined because this waiter assumes everyone thinks just like him. If we do return to Cornish Pasty again, it will be to another location so we don't encounter this guy. Too bad because the beers were large and cold and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Arizona staple! As az natives we ALWAYS make it a point to stop by for a pasty and maybe 10 half baked to take home to Cali! Staff always friendly; especially Kristina. Looking forward to our next phx visit"}
{"text":"The one located in Tempe is always less packed but same as awesome as the Scottsdale location. Ask for seasonal beer list (great beer). My boyfriend, cousins, and sisters love it here. The top choices always tend to be the carne adovada and Italian pasty but the chicken pot pie is also great. 

The environment of a speakeasy inside and outside is very calm and easy too. Great place to go with coworkers, family, friends, etc."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them more stars.  I eat here every chance I get and have never been disappointed.  The service is always great and everyone is SO friendly.  And the portions are huge.

I have only tried about half of the items on the menu because it is huge.  Everything I have tried was great.  I have eaten Cornish pasties in England many times and these are as good as any I ate there.

I see everyone raves about the red wine sauce but I don't care for it.  It is not needed and only detracts from the flavor of the pasty.  I was impressed that they had HP sauce, which I love, but it too does not work with pasties."}
{"text":"Prologue:
My fiancee and I were discussing where to go for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date and she said she was in the mood for some protein.

I looked through some places in our area, which I had recently bookmarked based on reviews from my fellow Elites. I recommended this restaurant and it turned out to be just what she had in mind.


The Plot:
We started by sharing the Blinkin Heng salad, which was followed by a Shepherd's Pie Signature Pasty and a Lovely Bit a Salmon Premium Pasty, and finished with a Sticky Toffee Pudding.

This was the first time for both of us to try this type of cuisine and it was a welcome learning experience.


The Scene:
The Blinkin Heng included a pleasing assortment of roasted turkey, greens, fruit, nuts, cheese, bacon (which we requested to have on the side), and hard boiled egg with just the right amount of white balsamic dressing.
They kindly split the order into two portions, which was plenty for each of us, and we also appreciated the care that went into to the presentation.

Judging by how flaky and perfect the pasty crusts were, my impression is that they were freshly baked just prior to serving. The contents were also nice and warm when they arrived at our table. My conclusion was that one advantage of preparing pies in a manner similar to a turnover, rather than using a pie tin, meant they could be baked more quickly like a calzone.

The Shepherd's Pie pasty was made with ground lamb along with mashed potato and the usual pot pie veggies and was served with a side of red wine gravy. There was just the right amount of mashed potato surrounding the other ingredients, the lamb was seasoned perfectly for me, and the veggies were firm yet tender. This pasty reminded me of Scaciatta, which is an Italian meat pie that is sometimes made with lamb and something I enjoyed many times when growing up in New England. Consequently, this turned out to be a genuine comfort food experience for me.

The Lovely Bit a Salmon pasty was stuffed with plenty of marinated salmon, a white wine and cream dill sauce, sautéed asparagus, garlic roasted tomato, spinach, and red potato. This pasty reminded me of the type of traditional salmon pie you might find in a northern European country such as Lithuania and it was comparable in quality to the Shepherd's Pie pasty in every regard. My fiancee was completely satisfied with this dish, as any fellow salmon lover most certainly would be.

My fiancee and I place a great deal of importance on the experience of finishing a meal with a delicious, satisfying, and memorable dessert.
The Sticky Toffee Pudding we ordered definitely fit the bill. There was plenty of of cake to share, it was warm and moist when it arrived on our table, and the texture and consistency was was like a cross between a brownie and molten chocolate cake, which paired very well with the vanilla ice cream, of course.


The Rest of the Story:
The decor was exactly what you would expect at a restaurant with the word Cornish in its name.
My fiancee especially liked the wine bottle candle holders on each table.

We were seated right away on a Saturday evening and the staff were courteous and friendly.


Epilogue:
The overall quality of the food easily deserves 3 stars. At first we were a bit hesitant to award a 4th star due to the tab for dinner being a little pricey. However, considering the fact that everything was very good along with the relative uniqueness of this type of cuisine we decided that it was worth it.

{"text":"OK, so this was the absolute bomb!

Came in from out of state and met a friend here. Twas a late lunch, and crowds had died down, so the outdoor seating was conducive to just hangin' out and chillin' for a chat. 

Ordered a stout beer (can't remember the name/brand), and it was GOOOOOD. Accompanied that with the following -

Carne Adovada $11.00
Simmered pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar. With a side of sour cream and salsa.

...and I thought it was super smooth and super good. Really well-balanced in flavor and texture. 

Life is great!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not too impressed. Ordered the asiago chicken pasty and garlic oven fries - they were nothing to write home about. This place is also not very kid friendly, in my opinion. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"For those who are not familiar with this british speciality, a cornish pasty is a sandwich baked into a pie-like crust.  It's a lot of like a hot pocket, except it's good.  And this restaurant serves up an amazing cornish pasty.  It also doesn't hurt that Cornish Pasty Company has an authentic british pub ambiance.

I had the Oggie, which is a pretty traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes and onion.  Give it a minute before taking your first bite.  Trust me when I say it comes to the table piping hot.  For just $8.50, it's a pretty good little meal.  Need more?  There are some good sides and salads for about $2 to $5.  The beer selection (tap and draft) is awesome.  I did not partake in dessert, but what I saw at other tables looked amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, but you have to have a designated amount of time blocked off to eat here."}
{"text":"I came out for a friend's birthday in December.  I had never been or heard of this place before.  So, I go and find a small place with a patio and a bar.  :-)

Pasty kind of reminded me of a really large hot pocket type deal.  I didn't eat anything while I was there, but the place sure did smell amazing.

We drank though.  Irish car bombs!  I'm not a fan of them, but the birthday girl sure is!

I don't think I'd drive back to Mesa just to go here, but if you live in Mesa and are looking for something different...you might like it."}
{"text":"yes I am a fan- and this is yummy. 

Creative assortment of dough pockets filled with yummy.

Recommend for groups or even a cheap date."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company
1941 W. Guadalupe Road
Mesa, Arizona

We arrived on a Friday night at 6:00 as a party of 14. Probably not the most fair thing to do since I knew I was going to review the restaurant, yet it didn't phase them in the least. While they take no reservations, they treated us courteously, and seated us after a short wait.

This is not the quietest place to eat at, as a lot of it has to do with the bar, which is very conducive to friendly chit chat, but overlooking that, it's quite a charming place. There is seating outside, as well as in church pews inside, which makes for a cozy atmosphere as well as the possibility of having new conversations with people you have never met - something that Americans are not used to, but is very common in the rest of the world.

Everyone ordered soft drinks except for myself. I ordered a Strongbow to see if it was what I remembered from the U.K., and it was no different at all. A true hard cider with good flavor of apples.

For my main course, I ordered the Oggie, a mixture of steak, potato, onion and rutabaga, served in a pastry crust with a small cruet of red wine gravy. ($8.00) . I was instantly transported back to the U.K. with my first bite. It had great depth of flavor, and the red wine sauce was absolute dynamite. An excellent dish! I also ordered a side of Mushy Peas ($2.75) and a side of Baked Beans ($2.50). The peas had nice flavor and were exactly as served in England, but I didn't care for the Baked Beans. There seemed to be an odd flavor associated with them that was off putting and which everyone agreed was not very tasty. 

Other members of our party ordered the Italian, the Porky (pronounced as orgasmic), the Shepherds Pie, the Reuben (good corned beef), the Chicken Greek (said to be very tasty), and the Lamb Vindaloo (usually very spicy, but apparently toned down here for American palates). Two of our party ordered the Pilgrim, which is roasted turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and red wine gravy. One pronounced it terrific, while the other didn't care for it.

The menu also includes a nice assortment of vegetarian dishes as well.

Most people didn't have room for dessert, but a few did, with almost everyone sharing. One of the desserts was Banoffee Pie - a graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, whipped cream and fresh bananas. It was interesting to note that the whipped cream was unsweetened. When mixed with the other ingredients, it picked up it's sweetness from them and tended to tone down the overall sweetness of the dish - a wonderful idea of what would otherwise have been an overly sweet dessert.


The other dessert that was ordered was the Apple Caramel Pasty - a kind of apple turnover pie crammed full of apples and cinnamon and covered with a homemade caramel sauce and served with a large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. Nothing could have been better, especially since the caramel wasn't too sweet.

Considering how crowded the place was, service was not too bad, and certainly could have been a lot worse.

Perhaps the only fault I could find was with the ladies room. The paper bin was full to the top, and the rolls of paper were scattered around instead of being in holders. I have been in nicer restrooms in other restaurants.

Overall, this was a wonderful eating experience, with several authentic dishes on the menu as well as some creative ones. I recommend it highly and give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Oh my Gaaawwwd. Kicking myself for not trying the Cornish Pasty Company sooner! This is a Mesa (or Tempe) \"Must-Try\"! 

My Dude and I have been here twice now. Reasonably priced delicious food, a wide variety of brews and attentive service all make it a great experience here. 

There's a hipster vibe going on, but that's not a bad thing. We like to joke that this place could pass for one of the pubs out of Harry Potter.

It's dark inside, with empty liquor and wine bottles being used as candles. Another great touch to the great ambiance. 

The first time we went, we got a table up front. 

Picky Eater Advisory: It should be noted that the Pasties are cooked to order, but you can't add or subtract ingredients. 

Also, be prepared to wait a while. Good food takes time! Just grab a beer and enjoy your company. 

Tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the traditional Oggie pasties. Both were absolutely delicious! Tender lamb, and the spices used weren't too overbearing, but I was sweating buckets. Which my Mexican thought was hilarious. Damn you, Dude. 

Love that they can wrap the other half of your pasty in foil to take home instead of boxes. 

We also tried the oven chips with jalapeño and garlic. Cooked to perfection, but not overcooked. Don't feel like the jalapeños contributed much and probably wouldn't add them again.

The last time we were here, it was crazy busy, so we sat at the Pasty Bar (not to be mistaken for the actual bar)! Change it up sometime, it was cool to watch the pasties being made. 

We got the Bangers and Mash and the Cheeseburger Royale pasties this time. Again, both great. 

Our waitress forgot to put in our order for oven chips, and was awesome enough to comp it from the check. 

Downside to the Bar? You can come across groups of people telling you to \"move over\" so they can fit their group together. Rude and annoying if you just got your Pasties, but this time not a huge deal as we were about to get our check and leave.

There's so many Pasties to choose from, which makes things overwhelming when it comes time to order. 

Look forward to working my way through their Pasty offerings and bringing my family and friends here for brews, good food and good times!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!! Found this place on yelp & it looked like a place my whole family would enjoy.  It was a lot busier than we anticipated, but the hostess was very nice & it wasn't too long before we were seated.  Our waitress was pleasant & efficient. 
Our pasties were so good!  I had the spicy chicken with black beans, asiago cheese, corn & tomatoes.  My husband had meat & cheese, and my kids had the Royale, chicken pot pie & the Pilgrim.  Each one was perfectly done. 
We ordered two desserts, and to be honest, we didn't love either one.  The chocolate bread pudding was too strong of a brandy flavor for me, and the other one - some graham cracker Carmel banana thing - was too heavy on the whipped cream with not enough Carmel.  But the beer list was good & the atmosphere was fun, so I'm giving a 5 star anyhow. Now we just need one of these places in San Diego!"}
{"text":"A fancy hot pocket made with fresh ingredients in a wide selection of choices. They don't do custom orders, your pasty comes as is. I've tried a bulk of them, but the cajun chicken continues to be my fav, it's just spicy enough. Sunday is all day happy hour and the beer selection is pretty nice too. I only wish they had a hostess, almost every time I go there, I've been sat at a table that had more people coming so my group wouldn't fit."}
{"text":"OMG! OMG! OMG!!!
I'm a Brit living in California, and my boyfriends son lives in Tempe (ASU graduate....SUN DEVILS!!!!) and we came out for a visit this weekend.
I was bored at work a couple days ago, so Yelped \"British bars in Tempe, AZ\" and this place popped up. After reading the reviews, and telling my boyfriend I wanted to try this place out, the 4 of us (boyfriend, his son and son's girlfriend) went for dinner tonight.

The place was packed - always a good sign. We got seated straight away, though. Our server was attentive but not obtrusive, and got us started on our drinks while we perused the menu.

Please note above - I'm English, a genuine Brit! I was very impressed with the menu. I haven't seen a scotch egg in years! They serve scotch eggs!!! And mushy peas!!! 
I opted for the chicken tikka masala pasty, as I love curry. Holy crap, batman, that thing was HUGE!! WE also ordered a side of their oven chips, which are like proper English chips (fries, for the uneducated) and a side of gravy.

They have a huge selection of pasties, and the prices are totally within reason. I will definitely be coming back to this place when we come out next month for ASU vs Washington State.

SUN DEVILS!!
(P.S., the game was terrible, we got slammed)"}
{"text":"Well I've been going to the location in Tempe for years and have nothing bad to say about Cornish Pasty. Their food is second to none and I always bring out of town visitors to Tempe and they love it. 

Well first time making it to the Mesa location. Really nice building, I see they still have the long bench settings but the overall restaurant appeared bigger and more open. Still same great food. My personal favorite is the Meat and Cheese and I usually try to take a bite or two from my wife who usual orders the pilgrim or Italian. All are great!!!

Good service as well, I forget our server name, but she was very nice and food came put prompt and was very attentive to our party. 

Overall a good addition to the Cornish Pasty restaurants. I can't wait till I get a chance to checkout the scottsdale location next so I can complete my Cornish Pasty visits."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I have not had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Wow the food is amazing! It has his selection of vegetarian and vegan meals. I got the mock chicken Asiago spicy one and my partner has the bbq one. We both loved it. Even their fries are delicious. The atmosphere in here are very inviting and cozy. I sediment highly recommend you to give this place a try! I certainty will take our friends here."}
{"text":"I've never had a British style pasty but this place offers a unique twist on it aside from the traditional ones. Make sure you come hungry and have an empty stomach, these pasties will satisfy your hunger.

I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken which was an Awesome flaky, buttery pastry type crust stuffed with chicken, asiago cheese, black beans, hatch chiles, roasted corn, and tomatoes. The crust was thin, flaky, and buttery that seemed to defy how it could itself together with all those fillings. I appreciate that it wasn't doughy like other types of stuffed pastries, strombollis, calzones, etc. and it seemed to strike the balance between the crust and the fillings.

Although it may be typical for a pasty be aware of any of the ones that have potatoes as part of the filling. I tried their version of the chicken pot pie and my taste buds only remembered the heaviness of starch and more starch with the crust and roasted potatoes and the chicken seemed to be lost in all that. 

I was kind of bummed they ran out of oven fries. I was looking forward to that.

Overall, a very unique and delicious experience."}
{"text":"My friend just bought a house dangerously close to this place. I've been 3 times in the last 2 weeks, and I live 25 miles away. I love this friend, but her proximity to magical pasties may be contributing to my frequent visits. I've sat at the bar, at a church pew table inside, and at a booth outside under the misters (during the short-lived reprieve from this heat). The bar is cool, you can watch the kitchen staff weigh out the pasty ingredients and craft those life-changing vessels of goodness. And get second, third, and fourth carbombs rather quickly. Which, by the by, are $3. All. The. Time. I've sampled many a pasty, as I've usually been with a group. Have to say the Carne Adovada has by far been my favorite, with the Royale with Cheese coming in at a close second. Mmmmm Thousand Island dressing, hello! The decor is pretty awesome, understated. Definitely, definitely, definitely do the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch here today. Tried the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty with mint yogurt and loved it. For dessert had the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was unbelievably tasty : ) I liked the cozy atmosphere, the great beer selection and even the music : )  The staff are super friendly and helpful. Looking forward to the Scottsdale location which I hope opens soon!!!"}
{"text":"Best advice - eat before you come here. We waited over an hour for our food on a night that was not at all busy. Our waitress disappeared after taking our order, and we never saw her again. After a while, another waitress asked us if we'd ordered, and I said that we had, a long time ago. She checked and said it would be out soon, but didn't apologize for the long wait.

We both got bangers & mash, which apparently come pre-made, so we were perplexed as to why we had to wait so long for it. And because they come pre-made, it is not possible to just get the bangers and mash separately (without the glutinous pasty shell). So I had to dig the contents out, finding that there was precious little contents compared to the pasty. What was there was good, complemented by the red wine gravy that other reviewers have raved about.

The salad and chips (steak fries) were very tasty, and the lemonade was very lemony. The ambiance was nice, with the pub lit by candles dripping over wine bottles, and new age cello music seeping out of the house speakers.

Will I come back? Perhaps, if I'm not that hungry and can wait an hour for the food to arrive, and if I want to make a meal out of gluten-free side dishes. I came here with a craving for bangers & mash, and will keep looking. There *have* to be good ones on this side of the pond."}
{"text":"How can you not like Cornish Pasty's? This place is amazing. Every location is amazing. All the food is amazing.

AMAZING

More seriously, I do go to their locations all the time. The one I end up at the most is the Dobson/Guadalupe location. I love the decor. Church pews are great seats. The place is always packed with a pretty friendly crowd. The jukebox has some really excellent music. The food of course is nomalicious. I highly recommend all their hand crafted soups. I've never had a pasty I didn't like. Of course, also save room for some dessert. The caramel pasty and the pavlova are both killer. The pavlova was so good I went home and learned how to make them so I could have them even when I didn't feel like putting on pants. Sadly, sometimes the desire to not put on pants even outweighs the desire to eat at a place this amazing."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is awesome.
Food is amazing! 
Came here for lunch with my husband and we sat outside because there were a lot of business people inside and a bit dark and my son needed to do homework.
We sat outside and it was great.  Our server was awesome-professional, fast, and he really knew the menu, beers were delish, waters got refilled before we even finished, and the food???!!!! Out of this world. 

Only reason giving 4 stars is that they were out of 3 of the ones that we wanted.
But what we got was still really good! 
Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My dinner was absolutely fantastic! I had the shepherds pie pasty which was extremely delicious. It was nice and hot coming out and smelled amazing. The environment is a little dark...but it is a bar so I guess that is what you'll get ha. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"very good pasties my grandmother made these too and they have that grama taste and the desserts everytime ive been here its been great"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place!   The reviews.  My co-workers and my kids rave about this place.  I really wanted to like it.  Atmosphere is great. Huge assortment.  We got our food and first bite was ok.  It was luke warm.  Mind you the place was not busy early evening before  dinner with a long wait for the food to come. THe second bite was not as warm.  The third bite was cold.  Not just cold but soggy mush cold. Some food can be eaten cold.  Pizza, Fried Chicked.  This just flat out turns you off and ruins your taste buds.  The staff after 10 minutes of trying to get them away from staring at their cell phones and the group conversation at the bar.  They blankly look at you and say,  \"do you want us to heat it up?\"  We were turned off. Its like reheating leftovers.  THey sent a couple home with us and we paid for our beer.  Been to several pasty places. I love them! They keep them in the oven with a much smaller choice range. So when you get they are baked throught out, hot and feel like a meat pie should taste.  Its all about quality control"}
{"text":"Went on a recommendation from a local (we are from (Iowa - the Cyclone State).  All I can say is \"Fabulous\"!  We had chicken pot pie, a chicken Pesto, and a salad.  All great and the atmosphere is so inviting too.  I'd guess this place is very busy at most times.  If they ever want I expand, I'd recommend Iowa - they would kill it here $$$$$$$!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, awesome music, great beer selection, and awesome overall setting and staff.  You can't go wrong here!  Happy hour, dinner, lunch, anytime and anything on the menu is sooo good!  Very original music on the jukebox you won't hear anywhere else.  I love this place!  The cajun chicken pasty and the pasta salad (among many others) are favs!  Vegetarian options are plentiful :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer. Food is made fresh! I had the lamb vindaloo pasty. Also ordered garlic jalapeno chips. My daughter had mashed potatoes, she loved those too! Wonderful, cozy feel in the place too. Love the candles in the liquor bottles."}
{"text":"All the food was great. We had a large table of 8 people. Nobody had anything they didn't like. There were a few issues though.

- They were out of 4 different things we tried to order (mainly appetizers)
- They brought out the leek soup and said \"the bread crumbs are still cooking, but we will bring you a second complimentary cup of soup to make up for it\" Well they didn't bring out the 2nd cup, we had to ask for it. The 2nd cup didn't even have the bread crumbs, AND we got charged for the second cup.
- For being a large group, they accommodated pretty well, but their social skills could be turned up a notch. We were obviously there for a birthday (lots of gifts and bows)...wouldn't most servers say \"Is it someone's birthday?\"

Music was pretty loud too, definitely wasn't expecting that. Overall, pretty good though. Very filling pasties."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a whim one night. I loved the atmosphere, gave you an european romantic feeling. The bartender was friendly amd her drink were beautifully made. I left a little wobbly but it was def a great nighy out with my love. As far as the food goes it was delicious."}
{"text":"Walking in from Sunny AZ into a dimly lit pub.  A rather large Pub.

Great ambiance and atmosphere with friendly service and almost a nostalgia of the past.

The pies have a heavy skin with a nice crust.  The fillings are rich and bold in flavor.

Scotched Egg was perfectly cooked and flavored with a great crust.

Perfectly chilled Guinness to bring it all together.

Seems like there was only 1 friendly server for about 10 tables.  This did slow things down a bit but overall happy here and will be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Food is good service is so, so or bad.  Normally I get the chicken tika masala and it is yummy but i tried the steak and rosemary. It was really unappetizing.  I ate about 2 bites and that was to much.  I asked the person I was with to try it and they agreed. Both times I've tried eating at the restaurant the servers are less then stellar. If you do try here stick with the to go."}
{"text":"yes, it is 5 star blow your knickers off good. In fact, read Brian S.'s review because he lays it all out as to why this is such a heavenly spot. All I will add - lamb and mint pasty with a kroenenberg beer...Tuck in!"}
{"text":"Superb.  I have not met a pasty I didn't like here.  Oggie, veggie oggie, lamb vindaloo, carne adovada, etc., and the list goes on, and will continue to grow as I eat my way through the menu.  This is a great place for vegetarians as well since they use Quorn and faux ground beef.  My veggie oggie was almost indistinguishable in taste from a regular oggie.  Dessert is also excellent.  I've had the apple caramel pasty and it was the perfect way to end our meal.

This is a must-eat-at restaurant.  Plus, with enough happy hour car bombs ($2 after 10 PM, and from 3-5 PM), you can giggle inwardly (or outwardly) at the thought of eating something called \"pasty\" (yes, even though it really is pronounced Pass-teee)."}
{"text":"I can't even think of one bad thing to say about this place. Everyone is really friendly. Major hipster vibe. The service was fast and they fill you up with amazing bread while you wait. (You can buy a loaf to take home) The food is absolutely on point. There are many options and every one of them looks delicious. The desserts are amazing. Not really feeling the church pew seating but its easy to overlook when everything else is perfect."}
{"text":"Cornish is great for anyone who loves bread and beer. They have a great staff who always remembers you, they aren't trying to sell you things you don't need. The staff recommends wonderful Items you can sit at the bar or table. The staff is always laughing and talking with eachother but still completely on task and happy to see you. I like this location very much."}
{"text":"My friends and I really enjoy coming to Cornish Pasty Co. We've only been to the location on Dobson. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. The spirit there is so friendly and helpful. If you don't know what to order the waiter/waitresses always do an excellent job with recommendations. The food is always delicious and super filling!"}
{"text":"Told us to take any table. We did. No one came. I like their food that I've gotten from other locations. We sat waiting for a bit while multiple servers passed us, looked at us and no one addressed us or served us. We left."}
{"text":"Food is great here and the atmosphere is pretty good. Portions are pretty decent, I think we all had some left over. 

Only gripes are that the benches we sat in we're terribly uncomfortable and the place was so loud we could hardly talk. Otherwise it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Service/food/ambiance = 3.5

On my first dinner here, I had a vegan pasty. The filling was good, but the pastry was dry and overdone. The plus? It's a large portion; if nothing else, I left with a full stomach. On my second dining experience, I wanted a lighter meal. I ordered the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup, with a Greek salad (no feta). The soup was flavorful, creamy, and well made. It came with sturdy bread that was perfect for soaking up the deliciousness. The salad came with a pesto dressing that was also tasty; as expected, the salad ingredients themselves were ordinary. Pieces of both meals I had here were well done, but they were still lacking in flavor and attention. Those with me ordered the vegan Mexican pasty. They both really enjoyed it. 

They have a decent drink selection so definitely look that over. I ordered the Union Jack. Refreshingly light with a bit of tang, hint of sweetness, and a hefty ABV. 

The servers bleed the hipster laissez faire attitude. Take from that what you will. Lastly, bathroom could be cleaner."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with our good friends who are English.  They told us how authentic it is and told us about the history of the food.  Really cool stuff!  When we showed up it was great food and the history of the food was throughout the whole restaurant.  Lots of old pictures of tin miners.  We loved the hearty food and the great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Delicious and much healthier than most \"bar food\".  Lamb Vindaloo was really excellent, tender and actually spicy and authentically curry.  I liked that the crust wasn't super heavy, but a thin shell.  The yogurt dip was good, too.  My husband said his potato soup was also quite delicious.  We both enjoyed the banoffee pie, although the crust was overbaked and too hard, but I just scooped up everything else and left the crust alone.  Hibiscus tea was good and refreshing.

Customer service was friendly but spotty.  My waitress was okay, but some of the others were mostly talking to people and not working, leaving the others to pick up the slack."}
{"text":"Solid food and beer.  Basically everything is stuffed and baked inside a pastry.  Like super beef wellingtons!  We had the Indian one, the southwest one, the steak one, and a veggie one.  The veggie was a little heavy on the cheese, but the others were just right.  Sauces were acceptable but not spectacular.  Overall, solid."}
{"text":"Was really good the first time we came however the second time fell way short of expectations!!cool atmosphere food was okay really good the first time not sure if They had different cooks or what!!"}
{"text":"When I'm really craving meat and want to splurge I go here. It's that unhealthy meat and potatoes comfort food without the guilt of eating an animal, I can only speak to their vegan vegetarian options. Their pub fries are so tasty with jalapeños and garlic and they are oven baked and better than fried. Oh and their deserts are so good you may cry tears of joy. I don't eat out much but when I do and get to pick I happily pick this lovely spot with a fantastic beer selection and nice vibe/ atmosphere. Service leaves something to be desired but quality of food is what I care about."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Have tried the Lamb & Mint, Lamb Vindaloo, and Chicken Tikka Masala pasties. All were delicious and filling. For desert, the Shirley Temple Pudding is a must!

Love the concept of an open kitchen and the eclectic  decor; it's a nice cross between a modern and tavern-like feel. 

It's always crowded during dinner, but usually not too long of a wait.

Side note: they always play great music."}
{"text":"Love grabbing a big, cold glass of crisp cider (Strongbow on tap) with any kind of hot, crusty pasty I'm in the mood for: traditional hearty, zesty Indian, spicy Mexican, healthy! A little pricey, but quality ingredients! Excellent patio. Fantastic for monsoon watching and easily accessible from canal bike path."}
{"text":"Order the chicken tikka masala pasty with jalapeño/garlic fries and a side of the spicy pepper soup :)"}
{"text":"Notice to restaurant staff: If you screw up and order, just quickly do something to make up for it.

Cornish Pasty prepared a cheesesteak pasty when we asked for a Mediterranean chicken. You know what the server did? She noticed the order was wrong and pre-emptively had the cook make a Mediterranean, then delivered the cheesesteak to our table, free of charge. 

That kept everyone in a good mood so we could enjoy our other pasties and buy a few more Kilt Lifters. Everyone wins.

Note: The lamb vindaloo pasty is very spicy, so be prepared. My girlfriend adored the Lovely Bit A Salmon pasty. And don't skip the garlic fries."}
{"text":"Service ok...  ovens broke, watched people walk out. We already had our orders in so we were stuck.
Food was ok. All the ceiling fans were not working. VERY uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite restaurants, and the ambiance is great, whether it's for a quiet lunch or Happy Hour on Friday with the place crowded. The food is always outstanding, and the staff is so chill and laid back.

Try the Chicken Pesto pasty, and the Cinnamon Apple Pasty for dessert. nom nom!"}
{"text":"I was invited here for dinner with a couple of gal pals. I really liked the set up here. We opted to sit at the bar and watch them make their magic and interact with the staff whom are all super friendly. They have a wide variety of \"pasties\" and fit almost any tastebud craving. I opted to try their soup and garlic- jalapeño chips, the soup was rather bland and the chips were cold. My friends really liked their pasties, so I can't comment on them, maybe next time if I return I'll try one and see how they fair."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review this place after our visit. Wasn't sure what to expect when I took my husband and my mom here as none of us had ever had a pasty before. I think my fear was based more on the hipster/ college pub atmosphere than facing the unknown. Everything we tried was superb. I got the Oggie which was delicious and filling. We ordered the smushed peas which I thought were delectable. I tried whichever pasties my mom and husband ordered which I can't recall but they were all very good. I definitely intend to return."}
{"text":"My mini late night w/ my hubby. Was the best experience that we had there. Our server Jesse was the the best server that we had for the many times we came. Food is delish.  Tonight we had something different, the salmon salad. Normally I'm not a fan of salad, but I think next time i gotta have it again. I always come for the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup every time. It's a gotta have for me and so is the  car bombs, but tonight I'm addicted to the body bomb. It's lighter in taste. It's perfect!  It's not as rich as the orig. car bomb. Thanks Jesse for the recommendation."}
{"text":"As much as I love CPC, I can't bump it up to 5-stars. I went with a fair group of friends Monday night and expected it to be busy and came to terms that we'd probably have to sit on the patio. Suprisingly, all of the booths on the patio were available because they were SOAKED by the misters. So we ended up having to wait about 20-minutes outside by the available booths because they were unusable :( But the experience inside was stellar as usual."}
{"text":"The menu needs to have a lunch portion size as well as just a plain Lunch menu.  Food is awesome but a bit speedy for lunch here.  It's food is awesome and beer is worth the stop for dining in and dinner mostly.  Can get a little busy on a Friday, Saturday evening so plan ahead."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment last night and was so overly impressed by the food, staff,  and atmosphere.   I highly recommend and can hardly wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not sure why i am giving them a review.  looks like they have plenty of support.  i have had the cajun, and steak and cheese pasty.  both were excellent.  little crowded sometimes.  patience is need here.  it take time to make each pasty, they aren't premade and frozen, so expect to be there a minimum for an hour for luch.  the servers are very nice and polite.  nice to eat something different for a change.  but i will be going back more i am sure."}
{"text":"We've been to the Tempe CPC a lot and just love the huge variety and the friendly staff. We were so excited that a new one opened in Mesa, which is a bit closer to our house. I haven't eaten there yet, but picked up \"to go\" twice. Everyone is so friendly and nice. Each time I've had to wait beyond the 20 minutes I was told, but each time my order is spot-on, hot and tasty. Now with the new bar in we're looking forward to coming in for a pint and a pasty."}
{"text":"All of the pastys have eggs except their 2 vegan choices, and only one of those doesn't have soy.  Wish any pasty could be made eggless.  

We got the vegan regular pasty and it was tasty but could have used a wider variety of veggies.  Not enough of the sauce was included in the to-go container though.

Cool bar, friendly staff, decent beers, great patio."}
{"text":"We finally made it back here to give them another try.  Service was...eh...but they were seriously packed, so it's understandable. We took our two rueben pasties to go and damn did they hit the spot! They were fantastic! We'll definitely keep going back! Also, I'm not sure how long ago this happened but they expanded. The restaurant is twice the size now. Which is great because now we can try eating there instead of bringing it home."}
{"text":"What a cool place to hang out and enjoy some great beer and great food!"}
{"text":"Will be BACK FOR MORE! Love the low light atmosphere, beer selection and of course the pasty! We had scotch eggs as an appetizer and then Shepards pie, and eggplant pastys."}
{"text":"I might not be an elite Yelp reviewer or a self proclaimed food aficionado. Buuuut this place is the bomb.com

I'm sorry if someone had a bad experience here but I literally couldnt care less. When I read a salty review regarding this place, all I think is \"whatevs Salty McSalterson. This place is bomb regardless\"

I've eaten here so many times... And I've stuffed my face each time with the most delicious pasty in the world. 

Food 10/10"}
{"text":"They have vegan menu"}
{"text":"I normally stick to the basics. But I've been here enough to explore the menu. Pasty's are always delectable. But experiencing the drinks are a must. I've relied entirely on the experience of my bartenders to walk me through the selection. Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars because A. the atmosphere rocks.  B. the food is great and unique.  C. they have a fantastic beer selection.  And the one and only missing piece that, in my opinion is the MOST IMPORTANT component would be the severs.  My part of 4 was sat on one of the long tables right in the front with a really cool drip candle in a Jamesen bottle in front of us.  The host was totally cool.  I really liked his vibe and he seemed to be generally concerned for getting everyone sat and happy.  But then our server came.  We told her we've never been here before and have no idea what a pasty was.  I was expecting a  whole discription of what they were, what to expect, and good recommendations, but we didn't get any of that.  Instead she just started pointing to different ones on the list and didn't really help with our decision making.  We thought that the baked chips would come out as an appetizer and wanted to ask her when they would be out but she literally didn't come back to our table for 40 minutes.  She just dropped off our beer and water, took our order, and then just forgot about us until we asked the gentleman who was switching out our candle to get her for us.  At that point, she just brought our food and didn't come ask us what we wanted after the guy asked her to come talk to us.  Like I said, the food was so good...when it finally came.  But our waitress was just so sub-par, that I won't go back to that location.  I will go to the Tempe one next time and see how that one pans out."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, the service is great and atmosphere is fun. If you are looking for a nice place to hang out, listen to some music, unwind and have amazing food and drink; then this is the spot for you. Favorite pasty is the salmon & asparagus and the scotch eggs are definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Um yea, the Royale with Cheese. First, I love a restaurant with a sense of humor. Second, this pasty is delicious. Third, the portions are out of this world! I had to take half home because it was such great comfort food. I love the vibes. My boyfriend calls it a hipster place but he loves the food too so he doesn't complain. The beer and wine selection was great. I love that there were so many varieties and they were different than what you might generally see. My boyfriend really liked one of German beers (can't spell it through sorry!)"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on salads, carry-out. I eat salads. Lots of salads. Lots of really dull, average, sad salads. Thanks to the countless reviews for both locations, it seemed quite clear that this was the place to go to get some.. exciting salads. EXCITEMENT is what's packed into the salads here! I had the Chicken Tikka salad, which is two hefty, hot chicken breasts and the standard fair of lettuce, onions, etc.. Fresh! Crispy! Tasty! The folks both had the Sausage Salads which were even more incredible.. they pack like.. a pound of really tasty homemade sage sausage, with a really incredible creamy mustard dressing, all under $9 each! What a score!!! I can't wait to go back to Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I think that every city should have a pasty joint!  I love the stylish yet simple decor that isn't trying too hard and the friendly and welcoming vibe you get from the minute you walk through the door.

I was skeptical that this place would have much selection since after all, they were only selling pasties, but their menu features so many different kinds (I wanted to try them all!) and they even have great salads as well.  I settled on starting with a Greek salad and a peppered steak pasty, both which exceeded my expectations.  They also have a great selection of beer and wine if you look for something to quench your thirst."}
{"text":"I've been trying to come up with words for a while to describe this place and it's food, but I always end up erasing and starting over. Why? Because this place is so good. Every pasty I've had has always come out hot with a brown flaky crust on the outside and perfectly melded and flavors and ingredients on the inside. My favorite in particular is definitely the bangers and mash; the sausage is packed with great flavors and the mash is always creamy and thick. It's never over seasoned and the red wine gravy compliments it really well. The selection of beers is pretty wide and anyone who likes beer at all can find something they'll love. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the menus and every time they've suggested something it has been wonderful. The only department they're lacking in is deserts; they're a bit of a let down and much too heavy to compliment the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Love this location! The candle lit bench seating is perfect for a close intimate dinner. The chicken pot pie and chicken tikka masala are my go pasties. The staff is super friendly and always willing to give out little tips like best time to come or help you figure out the best pasty for the night!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place but had 15 people meeting me their and the bartender all tatted up would rather chase off 16 people and be nice to her 3 friends I was so for this place the owner acted like he really wanted business in azcentral  she took money then put oranges on glasses she needs to go to filabertos lol never again the were out of my mexican one anyway no more"}
{"text":"Love the $3 car bombs on happy hour :)"}
{"text":"Oh. Em. Gheeeee! I have yet to encounter a Pasty I didn't like! Huge selection for carnivores and herbavores alike! Great beer and wine selection. Full bar. And their pomegranate green iced tea is to die for! Favorite meat selection so far is the Peppered Steak with Stilton cheese and veggie is the Tikka Masala, yum! It's purposefully not well lit and a bit cavernous, reminding you of the mines the guys who ate these every day worked in. There's a great story about the history of the Pasty (not pay-STEE, PA-stee) on the menu. Read it, it's really cool. Seating is on upcycled church pews and the tables were the doors. Communal style seating! Stop by and bring friends! You'll be the superheroe of the year!"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Phoenix, and I try a different pasty each time. Never disappointed. Very chill ambiance. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Dude.  

Went back to CPC.  

Ordered taken quickly, got me some hibiscus tea (wtf pink drink?  it's awesome).   

HOWEVER, there was a mixup with my order.  




Break it down:


SAME day of the week, SAME server as last time, DIFFERENT location in restaurant (outside table with squishy seats) NEW, BIGGER issue than last time.... but... was it really?     

And of course you're asking, why a FIVER now?  



Lemmie 'splain:


Even though things went sideways, our waitress did not falter under the pressure of said 'eff up.  She didn't avoid the issue or ignore my table and  she brought me a SECOND pasty for FREE along with my original (but slightly late) order.  Her course correction was done in record time (10 minutes or less), pretty amazing considering Pasty's take somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 mintues to cook (I could be wrong with my timing here)   

Conclusion:

Ku-fucking-dos CPC.  Open mouth, insert foot via my original critique. I'm now CPC'S BFL (bitch for life).

{"text":"Food is great, but service is horrible.  The servers are rude and it took a 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 for our food. I really liked this place when it first opened.  We live in the area and had hoped for this to be a regular place for us to come to eat, drink and meet friends. I hope the management fixes the problem with the service.  If you are going to try this place, I suggest you sit at the bar for better service."}
{"text":"Been twice and enjoyed it both times. I love the cottage pasty. The second time I insisted on getting dessert :-P We got the sticky toffee pudding...YUM!!! I just saw a picture of the banoffee here and I will be getting that next. I make something similar so I can't wait to try this one. My only complaint is the music was WAY too loud last time we were there. It really made the visit unpleasant."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix a handful of times a year, and typically visit chain restaurants. But, I've decided to make an honest attempt at supporting local businesses, so... thanks to Yelp, found Cornish Pasty Co! It's always kind of hard relying solely on Yelp reviews - typically, when I decide to go with a Yelp recommendation, I've heard someone mention it in conversation or I've read an article about it. 

I am happy to report that the rating for this place is spot on! I ordered the tikka masala pasty, and my husband ordered the reuben. Husband said it's the reuben he's ever had (though, I disagree) and my pasty was so delicious, I continued to eat it despite being overfull. Husband was very pleased with the beer he selected as well.

Told my MIL about it & hope she tries it out soon, as she typically sticks with restaurants that she is familiar with. Looking forward to going back over the holidays!"}
{"text":"Wow...Amazing yummy food, fantastic service, cool vibe, awesome decor...this place is pretty legit. I sampled some of everyone's and all of it was damn good. The potato and leak soup is great (which is what I got because yeah...I don't know I'm lame) my sister had the bangers mash which was so deliciously English! The only thing more English was the cottage pie (doesn't that just sound British?) my brother had the carne adovada (sp?) which was good but the table agreed that the super English ones is where it's at so that's my recommendation. AND you must end with the banoffee. That...I mean no words. So great...I mean if I decide that I didn't care if I were morbidly obese I would probably eat one everyday for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Love this place, get the bread as an appetizer and you will not regret it. Nice place for some good filling amazing food. Its a unique menu, you can't sub things but other than that the menu is really large so there is absolutely something for everyone and the staff is always cool and welcoming."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is a bit laid back but for beer and pretty good sized pasties with a variety of choices it's a great place to take company when you want to take them to something more local and different."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time. I saw so many of my friends checking in, looked at the reviews and photos and thought the food looked pretty good. Big disappointment! This place was not very appealing to me at all. I had the bangers and mash. This is what most people talked about in their reviews so I had to try. You can't go wrong with sausage, mashed potatoes, onions, and gravy all wrapped tight in a crispy pastry right? Wrong...I was expecting something way better. It was gooey and mushy and it just didn't have the taste I was expecting. My husband had the Cajun chicken and he wasn't too pleased either. He ate all of his but he never likes wasting food so that's why his was gone before I could even finish my first half. He really liked the sauce that came on the side so I think that was the only plus for him. The only reason I face this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because the pastry was still pretty good. It was nice and crispy and fresh. I wonder if the will just sell me the pastry, that is the only reason I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the servers with attitude, love the atmosphere, hate the community seating that paired me against some stranger with no concept of boundaries.  Some night after a few drinks, I'm gonna give that stranger a taste of my elbow in her ribs for once.  No one comes between me and my lamb pasty."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I discovered this place months ago and we both fell in love with it immediately! The atmosphere is unique which is nice because it helps get you away from the every day franchise restaurant feel. The food is absolutely incredible and their choice of beer is exceptional as well. I highly recommend trying the Pilgrim, Cajun Chicken, and the Chicken Pot Pie. These three Pasty's are definitely my top three favorites. Both the quality of food and service easily makes this place one my of favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was pretty excited because I had heard such great things. We walked in and we're sat right away, but as we were being seated we noticed how hot it was in the restaurant. It only got warmer as time went out and later we found out their AC was broken on one side of the building and they were still seating people in the side with no AC! 

Then our server came over and didn't even greet us or tell us her name. She was very unfriendly and rude. She didn't pay attention to us at all and we ended up having to ask other servers walking by for things we needed. We also had a child with us and when we asked if they could make her a grilled cheese, they told us they wouldn't be able to make that for her and didn't offer us any options and we're just plain rude about it. Not a kid friendly place!!

We ordered fries to start, we had heard they were delicious, and they were very very disappointing. The fries weren't cooked all the way and very soggy. Then we asked for ranch and they brought us blue cheese. Finally our food arrived and that was the only decent part of this outing. The food was good but everything else was horrible. After we ate our pasties, our salads came out...very late and we no longer wanted them but still we're charged. 

Then to finish off the night, our server brought us our check and as we handed it back to her she said, \"oh, I forgot to add your Diet Coke, let me do that.\" So she took our bill with our card and added the $2.50 soda. She was extremely rude. 

Overall, the food is good, but the service is horrible and the place itself was so hot that we left sweating and very unhappy. As we left we ran into the manager who was made aware of some of the issues we had and he didn't seem to care...we will not return to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD. Great atmosphere. We ordered Pastys to go for later!!! Great service!
This is a must for anyone that wants to enjoy the best of the best."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been to the other location, but not to this one since it opened.  I finally came for dinner, and am glad that I did.  Serice was great, friendly as always.  I had the Shepards Pie Pasty and it was delicious!  Very filling, and its a nice sized portion, so you walk away full.

I will be back, and always enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"Best food best beer best bearded men in fake glasses."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite spots after several years. I have tried probably about 4 different pasties and each are amazing, I stick with the same rotation! The green chili chicken is probably my favorite. The banaffe pie (pie crust, unsweetened caramel, bananas, and whip cream) is amazing. I am not one that always have to have dessert but here, I can't leave without it. Unique atmosphere with single and community tables. Good service, reasonable beers with a good selection. If you haven't tried it yet, you should! This is a great place and good, unique food!"}
{"text":"Went here shortly after opening on a Tuesday afternoon.

To be honest, I was a little reserved about dining somewhere that only served one type of food, however, you have to think that if a place serves one thing, they should be able to do it well, right? Well, The Cornish Pasty Company does it well.

The pastys were light and flaky, the fillings abundant and tasty. The food, as simple as it was, was done well and I'd definitely do it again. The atmosphere definitely chimes in to the british pub feel and the church pews totally add to the ambiance of the restaurant as a whole.

My only issue was that the prices did seem just a tad high for what you receive. The pastys do not come with any kind of side dish aside from a dipping sauce that's paired with each individual offering. With each pasty averaging about $9-10, it's a bit much."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to the real deal. The best pasties I've ever had were in London - they were cheap, fast, there were plenty of choices, and mindblowingly tasty. This place, on the other hand, is not nearly so cheap, and not nearly so fast... but there are plenty of choices, and they are all mindblowingly tasty. Maybe not *quite* as tasty as the ones I had at a place in London, but close, and this requires a significantly shorter trip. I make it a point to stop here whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If I ever leave Arizona, this will be at the top of my list of local places I will miss dearly. Whenever I've had a long, crappy day (or week, or month, or...), I usually find myself craving my go-to comfort food. This, my friends, is Cornish Pasty.

I wasn't always a believer. When I first heard about CP last year, I thought it sounded kinda weird. \"I don't think I'll like it,\" I told my Cult of Pasty friends. You can't accurately describe the glory that is a pasty to someone who has never experienced it. (As another reviewer noted, \"glorified hot pocket\" doesn't sound too appealing.) But if you haven't tried it yet, at least do it once, just so you don't have to wonder anymore. Seriously, just go.

I have never tried a pasty I didn't like. Ever. Thing is, I'm an extremely picky eater, and I dislike a lot of veggies (taste, texture, whatever, they weird me out). Yet this place can make me eat spinach, artichokes, tomatoes, onions, and potatoes like they're my favorite foods. Somehow, they magically combine a bunch of ingredients that sound like they may or may not go well together into one amazingly delicious, harmonious pocket of baked goodness. It's always perfect. I was especially hesitant to try the salmon pasty, but you know what? It's one of my favorites. Magic, I tell you.

But great food comes with a price. There's a good chance there will be a little wait here. There's also a good chance the service will be spotty, which is why I knocked off one star. On several occasions, our server has been extremely scarce, or food has come out at different times (as in, one pasty comes out and 15 minutes later, the other is out... doesn't make for a great dining experience with your partner). Mostly, we just have to wait to get anything we ask for, so bring your patience with you just in case.

My least favorite thing, though, is the door leading to the patio. That freaking door! On my last visit, it drove me CRAZY because every 15 seconds, someone would come in or out, and it would SLAM so audibly that I couldn't ignore it. I think it's just the door itself, but couldn't they like... make an effort to close it quietly, if they can't get it fixed? It was so distracting that I was having a hard time hearing conversations or enjoying my meal. There's no way I'm the only one bothered by this. Management, please fix ASAP.

But here's a great thing: when you're not in the mood to deal with being squished into a little bench with some strangers or searching for your waiter to get the water refill you needed 10 minutes ago, you can always call in your order, pick it up, and bake it at home - then sit down with your favorite beer or wine and enjoy your meal in privacy. Tastes just as delicious, I promise. Give it a try."}
{"text":"It is food. The food is good. The food is served in dough much like a hot pocket...... but a hot pocket it is not. It is a not pocket. A fresh not pocket with meat and cheese. Also they have beer, oh the beer, IPA's galore and all the man buns.... from the wall to the floor. Refrigerator."}
{"text":"I really loved the food. I recommend the chicken tikka pasty, so tasty. I was not fan of their lighting however did give it publike feel. I'm glad I tried it out."}
{"text":"Been in for lunch a few times and was so good, have since got take out from them. These are excellent pasties and worth trying all the different variations, although I was reluctant at first as a Cornish pasty is a pasty (as in their Oggie) and I'm a bit of a traditionalist. 

Service has been excellent for all visits. Yes, the pasties do take a while but they cook them fresh. Definitely one of my favorite eating places even if we do have to travel 20 odd miles to get there."}
{"text":"If you don't know what a pasty is then you need to eat here!! Every filling they have for these little hand pies is amazing! They even offer vegetarian and vegan options. Anything from traditional British to American to Indian, they have any flavor profile you could want! I recommend sitting by the kitchen so you can watch the masters craft these works of culinary art"}
{"text":"This is a very unique place to grab lunch or dinner. The pasties are completely delicious  and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is also pretty cool - they play great music! If you have people visit from out of town, I highly recommend you bring them here. This is one of my favorite places in the valley."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food and the atmosphere, but the vegan pasty options are terrible. I am so sick and tired of broccoli vindaloo and the vegan portobello. We would eat here more frequently if there was a change of pace every once in a while. Expand your options PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than finishing a long work day with some Cornish happy hour! Great craft beer selection and my fav pasty the portobello chicken! Best \"chill\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Are you not a fan of English food? 
This place is the game changer for me. The perfect English comfort food. A huge variety of pastys and side dishes to please anyone. The ones I've tasted were well made, cooked and plated to my liking. A pasty and one of the many well selected beers they have on tap was a great meal. But wait! Start your meal with a Scottish egg  as your appetizer, there perfect. 
The food and sauces seemed to be mostly made in house, the red wine gravy is delicious, as is there thousand island. 
Outside patio setting at there Mesa location on late summer evenings are pleasant and relaxing. They have a smart staff of helpful folk to answer your questions and fill you in on any tap changes as they manage to get it all done with a smile. 
Last word... sweet."}
{"text":"I wanted to post an updated review since this location added some square footage! I love the atmosphere here. When we went the candles that used to be there were replaced with electric candles, which was a bummer.

The other new item is the addition of a seating area! I love this new addition. It includes pool and darts. It turns the whole spot into more of a pub you could hang out and have a beer at, rather than just a dinner spot.

Food is still excellent. Location can be kind of messy at times. Wait times are not quick, but are reasonable. Customer service is average. I took away a star for the negative points in this paragraph.

P.s you should splurge on the dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The pasties are huge and delicious.  We split one and that was sufficient.  Hoegaarden and Strongbow on tap too.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Stayed in Tempe for several nights on a house hunting trip. One of the nights happened to be NFL conference finals night so I wanted to get take out and watch the games instead of going out. I sent my husband out for the pasties and chicken wings.

He is a pretty conservative eater so he opted for the Oggie (traditional pasty) while I went for the Pilgrim (Thanksgiving style). The pasties were huge and still steaming hot when they arrived at the hotel room. The Pilgrim was served with the red wine gravy (delicious) and cranberry sauce. I thought the crust was as perfect as pasty crust could possibly be. Not too thick and braided along the edge. The filling was so moist and well composed. The meat wasn't dried out and the sweet potatoes really added flavor. My husband said he preferred my pastie to his. 

I was not enamored with the tandoori chicken wings. They were caked in tandoori paste and soggy. I would not recommend these. They were also super spicy.

Since we are moving to the area, we will be coming back to try out the many varieties as well as the pasty dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place! My husband and I live in FAR West Valley so whenever we find ourselves even remotely on this side of town we make the drive to Cornish Pasty. This place is simple. Good quality tasty food. We each try a new pasty everytime we go (been 5 or 6 times now) and we have never not LOVED our pasty. The servers are so friendly. I wish we lived on this side of town because we would be here all the time."}
{"text":"LEEK SOUP is what i like yummmmm"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Share a church pew with another family and grab an Irish car bomb. Can't remember all the pasties I've had, but I know I like the one with curry and fake chicken! Also try the garlic fries, but make sure your woman has some too so you don't sacrifice any kisses. If you're into beans, get the white beans in the tomato sauce, extra spicy; it's great, but I'm going to ask for it without cheese next time.

If you're not a drinker, the lemonade is tasty too!"}
{"text":"So I have to review this place because I adore the food. Sooooo good. They have an awesome beer selection and a completely unique vibe. I love so many of  their pasties, I feel guilty repeating one. Weird, I know. 

I love the $3 Sunday mimosas. I love the pews. I love the greasy Jameson bottles covered in wax. I love the old doors as tables. I love that the wait staff doesn't wear a lame uniform. I love that you can sit at the bar and watch them prepare food. I love their outside patio. 

So much to love.

...all that said, this place has some of the worst service I have ever experienced. The wait staff is neither trained nor professional. They range from indifferent to down right rude. I'd like to say the poor service was a one time thing. Nope. Crappy service here is more dependable than the mail.  I give this place millions of chances because the food is so yummy but I'm nearing the end of my tenure as a customer of the Mesa location of Pasty.

Maybe Tempe will be better to me. I hope so. I think I may have to say goodbye to Mesa."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of amazing vegan options that I really enjoy every time I go, I always take the left overs and eat them the next day and it still tastes amazing, their dessert is really good especially the banoffee pie, try it if you don't know what to get :)"}
{"text":"I was so beyond impressed with this place, it was so amazing, the food was great, great concept, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The food is awesome, we had a variety of pastys. The original oggie was cooked to perfection. The Indian lamb vindaloo was spicy and very good. The cajon chicken and the chicken Alfredo were also good. I wish we were hungry enough to get dessert. The portions are large, splitting with a salad was perfect. Ambiance is also very nice. The service was outstanding. I will definitely go back when I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"I had been contemplating visiting this place to try their pasties when the mood finally struck. It was in the midst of winter rainstorms that were apparently the worst Arizona has seen in the last two decades. That didn't stop this place from being quite busy and packed with patrons.

My own reasoning for braving the weather probably has to do with childhood memories of pasties. I was introduced to these delights while living in Holland. I attended an international school (NATO brat) and the cafeteria food service was managed by the British, so pasties were always available. It also rains quite often in Holland, so my craving for a good pasty may be inextricably linked to rainy weather.

The Cornish Pasty Company did not disappoint. I had the lamb vindaloo pasty and a Pinstripe Red Ale from Colorado. The beer selection here is impressive and seems to be quite a draw, since I got the impression that the crowd here was suitably beer-literate. The vindaloo was quite spicy but delicious and the beer complemented it perfectly. The quality of the pasty was perfect... piping hot filling, flaky crust.

All in all, I was happy to discover a great place nearby to eat and drink. Maybe next time I won't even wait for it to rain."}
{"text":"Went once for company lunch. Was enjoyable and different. Not a style I favor but I will try anything once. Old English atmosphere was kind of fun."}
{"text":"Super good comfort food with a moody laid back atmosphere. Many vegetarian options!! :)"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING tastes amazing, and they have a great beer selection. Definitely get the scotch eggs and oven chips."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to eat some great food, drink beer, and spend time with friends. The food has always been amazing and portions are enough to bring some home. Pretty good prices overall for authentic food. The outside patio is my absolute favorite place in the east valley, it has a low key vibe and beautiful scenery. Definitely recommend going there to impress a first date, laugh with friends, or just stop by for a quick beer."}
{"text":"And now for my 300th review...........

What is a pasty?  It's a lovely piece of pastry filled with yummy stuff.  You can fill a pasty with almost everything.  Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie, Chicken Tikka Masala, meat and cheese or something akin to a Chicken Pot Pie.  It's all delicious!  Sounds like a Hot Pocket you say?  Oh no, no, no, this is much more and infinetly better than an item you find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.  A pasty is fresh, not frozen, and the filling choices are infinetly better than the stardard ham and cheese or pepperoni pizza hot pocket.  

This location is bigger than the Tempe location.  There are several longer tables in the front, several tables on a patio outside, as well as tables along the corridor and, if you choose, there is the bar where you can watch them prepare your food.  The servers are friendly and knowledgable.  It is a causual atmosphere.  I have been here many times and always had great service.  The have many beers on tap but sadly, nothing local.  I would bump it up one more star if they added a couple of local brews.  And they know how to pour a pint of Guiness!  It's a great spot to hang out and have a pint or two and when you get hungry take a look at the 3 page menu.  You will have a hard time choosing so you'll have to come back again and again.....

If you like the English Pub feel, this is the place for you.  This would be my \"local\" if I lived closer but it is close enough to lure me here frequently. And if you've had a long day and would like some take out, you can do that too.  They will do a half bake on a pasty for you then you take it home and bake it for about 20 minutes and viola! dinner!   And even though I was just there yesterday, I am craving another!  Maybe it's because I'm part Welch and Irish.  Thank you Cornish Pasty Company!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't real impressed , the food was okay but some ingredients are really over powering while the meats are quite tasteless.  The pesto and the 1000 island are sooo strong! The garlic jalapeño oven fries are pretty bland, couldn't even taste the garlic and 1/2 the order was burnt to a crisp . The ranch is wonderful. On the plus side , the pasties are big enough to share between two people"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful Service!! The food was amazing and wings were so yummy. I honestly prefer there wings over bww or wingstop. The pilgram is my favorite, if you love thanksgiving food then that's the one to get. Oh yeah and Cornish pasty is a pokemon stop."}
{"text":"A big ole' double handful of bangers and mash with red wine gravy!  That's what was in my pasty!  First time here and I can't wait to go back!  Man was that good!

I am looking forward to working my way through the menu at this place.  I met fellow Yelper Donald S here for lunch and we sat at the bar where we could watch the kitchen.  As I watched the busy bees busily going about making pasties and other delicious looking things I noticed the ingredients sitting around on shelves...nothing prefab.  No bags from Sysco or some other purveyor of pre-made restaurant ingredients.  Nope, just fresh veggies, fresh meats, lots of big cans and bottles of spices and seasonings.  

I am getting hungry right now thinking about the food.  Yum.

Update (I've been there again since I started my review):

Now that I have gone a second time and tried a salmon pasty, the royale pasty (sort of like a bacon cheeseburger) and shared a dessert I can unequivocally state that Cornish Pasty is one of my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix.

Service has been great and my last visit I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and chatted with the folks as they were cooking.  Nice people here!"}
{"text":"The pasty I ordered to go over the phone was extremely salty!!! The worst part I was already home,10 miles away, when I took a bite. I could not eat it, it was such a waste. I really like pasties, I was craving one tonight, made a trip, but this place disappointed me a lot. I will not return despite being their customer for past 3years. Advice for management: hold your chefs accountable."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

I got a soft spot in my heart for this place.  It was this location that was my first Cornish pasty and even with some of the modernized flavors, this place, from the beers to the pasties, reminded me of England.  

My go-to's, the Oggie and the  Bangers and Mash.  Tastes like England.  Especially with a beer along with it.  And beans.  Crust, great.  Filling, great. Gravy, great.  Full stomach for a reasonable price.

I've also had the Royale with cheese, the Shepherd's Pie, and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  All are pretty good.  The chicken tikka masala would be exemplary if they improved their masala just a bit.  But I'd still order all of them again.

Like I said I've had their beans, which are fine.  Also had their walnut soup which is great.  Really rich and filling and delicious.  Finally, had their banoffee.  It is huge and it will destroy you in the best way possible.  It is not delicate and not as refined as the banoffee in England, but it's a tasty sugar bomb."}
{"text":"Yum. Vegan pasties! I had never heard of a pasty before until coming here. 

They have two vegan options daily, which I believe change regularly. I tasted both of them when I was there and couldn't choose a favorite. 

Their beer selection is pretty good and fitting for the meal. This is a great spot to take your non-vegan friends and all have a good compromising meal. :)"}
{"text":"The British aren't really known for their cuisine but man was I impressed! Started with the leek soup, very rich but so good especially when you dip the included bread in it. Then had the portobello chicken pasty and tried some of my friend's cottage pie, both were great. The seating was interesting (church pews!) But got a regular table and looks like they are working on doubling in size! Very cool place"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I only wish I had found them sooner, but I seriously can't get enough. I've been here countless times and even as soon as after placing my order I start thinking about the next time I'm going to come and all the amazing pasty creations I want to have.

Everything from the ambiance to the staff to (especially) the food adds to the experience and makes it wonderful. Where to start? How about the ambiance. It is quite dim here, appropriately like mining caves, and the dripping wax candles are the perfect touch to make you feel like you're part of the English history (read about it on the menu).

The wait staff can be described as trendy, but we've had several occasions where they remember us and every single time they are extremely friendly. The manager is also there often and checks in on tables himself to make sure diners are 100-percent satisfied with their visit. Try sitting in different areas of the restaurant to get views of the line prep area; it's quite memorizing to see them remember which orders are which as each pasty basically looks the same coming out of the oven.

Now, the food! I'll start by saying that the food here is salty, but it is seriously out of this world. The oven chips (french fries) are a hit, and usually ordered with the jalapeno topping. The mushy peas are so simple but so warm and comforting; super fresh peas mashed down to the perfect consistency; they even go great as a dip for a pasty. I almost wish I could order a bowl and have it instead of soup. \"Almost\" because you gotta try the soups!

Every soup order is served with killer slices of fresh-baked and thick-cut bread. Dip the bread in the soup or eat it on its own. Either way don't eat too much because it'll fill you up quick and you want to definitely save room for the main event and probably dessert. The red pepper and black bean soup is nice and spicy, but the cream of leek and potato and the mushroom and walnut soups are favorites too. Order the larger bowl and you'll still be craving every last drop.

There's so much that can be said about the pasty choices here. The pastry dough is perfectly crisp and the pinch on the top or side of the pasty is really one of the best parts; kind of like the crust on a pie or a pizza. My favorite has got to be the Pilgrim, which is basically an entire Thanksgiving dinner in your hand; perfectly balanced with the sweetness from the sweet potatoes, the savory and salty stuffing, and the moist chicken or turkey. However, the list is extensive for the top runners including the Oggie and the salmon. Their sauce sides pair really well with each pasty, but you can swap them out if you've come across a favorite.

After all that if you've got room for dessert, I'd recommend ordering a few for the table and sampling a bit of each for the full experience. The Banoffee Pie, Shirley Temple Pudding, and the caramel apple pasty are incredible but so are the rest.

If you haven't had a pasty before, make this your next \"To Try\" spot. I promise you'll be back for more as the menu is diverse in flavors and there has got to be something for everyone. Even vegetarians can enjoy many of the options since there is a vegetarian pasty section on the menu. It should be noted however that the ingredients in the dishes cannot be altered. Every pasty is premade, \"sealed\", and then cooked off in their oven to order.

Prices are, in my opinion, very fair. They have happy-hour specials on drinks and unique beer selections too. I would even recommend getting take out from here. Your take-out order can be made ready-to-eat or half-baked, meaning you take it home and bake it fresh in your oven."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cornish Pasty for a long time now, inconsistently when I'm usually craving a Shirley temple pudding or just a flaky, meat & cheese filled pasty! I recommend trying the Rosemary chicken or the Greek. There is also an extensive beer list and happy hour is the best time to go. Unique ambience and amazing pub food."}
{"text":"More than anything, I love the ambience here.  The food, in particular the pasties and shepherd's pies are also delicious."}
{"text":"In the mood for something different than Mexican & sushi. Saw the 4.5 Yelp review, not a fan of anything British as a general rule, but what the heck, all the Yelpers can't be wrong, & they served food until MIDNIGHT!  Frankly, I expected it to be \"good, but not my style,\" as I prefer lighter, healthier food for the most part, NOT a \"meat & potatoes person.\"

Went there alone since my family wasn't with me. I was a very \"un-hipster\" 40-ish yr old female alone. As I walked up I noted the loud patio, people having fun/drinking, hmm. Inside: dark but not in a seedy way, real wax dripped down the wine bottles holding the candles. Church pew seating as mentioned. Pretty cool, but the tables looked huge & daunting for this SWF diner. The outside looked too \"party\". 

No one really approached me right away, a few people said hi, but they all looked so casual sans uniform, I couldn't quite tell if they worked there or just walking by?  Didn't know if I should wait to be seated, but there was really no obvious place to wait for such guidance, as the front door leads right into the dining room. After a few awkward seconds I identified that guy as definitely an employee & threw myself at his mercy, \"Hi. I'm new. How does this work?\"  He was great, sit anywhere. Grabbed a seat at the end of the raised bar. As someone else said, a good place to bolt from if things didn't go well. Also had a good view of the dining room, the kitchen prep area & the servers work area. 

Friendly Serena stopped by, I warned her too that I was new. She was great! Since they clearly have a great, well-chosen list of ales & beers & that seems an obvious British accompaniment to pastys, I told her some of the beers I normally liked, such as IPAs, Kiltlifter, Dogfish Head 60 & 90. She lit up & said she's bring a sample of one she thinks I'd like. Love the service already!! I love love love when they bring samples of something so you can truly decide before committing. She NAILED IT - On-tap Green Flash Hop Head Red. Never heard of it, LOVE IT.

Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala pasty since I was in the international mood & Yelpers said it was good. Waited the 15 mins or so. Noticed that the servers have fun, the kitchen is friendly like everyone says, the crowd is diverse.  The music is great, stuff I like, upbeat, some good swing-dancing music, Stray Cats, etc. Only thru Yelp reviews did I learn it's now \"hipster\" music, ha ha. Then arrived the pasty...

SOOOO much better than a typical calzone crust! I love how thin but sort of crisp the crust is! Nothing even close to doughy, it's lightly holding the divine insides. The Chicken was moist and chunky, the tikka masala sauce was spiced but not \"hot,\" really savory flavor.  The side sauce was perfect with it, nice touch that they all have various perfect accompaniment sauces! I asked Serena for a box right away to take the other half home to family. Good thing I did, or I would have stuffed myself with it because it was sooo tasty & been in pain later.

I'm also not really much of a dinner-out dessert person, as they are usually too over the top gooey sweet for me. But the Banoffee Pie with bananas caught my eye. Home-made caramel? In home-made graham crust? What??  Argh, okay....  I can have a few bites & take the rest home.

Serena was again brilliant, telling the kitchen to \"build it\" in the to-go container. Once it arrived, I could see why, truly awesome suggestion, as moving it would have messed it all up. The guy behind the counter asked,  \"Just bananas or also strawberries?\" I deferred to Serena the Expert... \"Plus strawberries.\"   He told me when busy, he doesn't have time to create this masterful work of art that he made, but tonight he was able to do so. It was beautiful, and tasted 10 times better. I couldn't stop. I didn't know why. Finally, another server stopped by and we chatted about it. The secret is: the caramel is sweet, the graham crust is both sweet & salty, & the whipped cream isn't sweetened at all. The balance is WONDERFUL! Scary-wonderful: \"...just one more bite, then I will close the box...\"

Thanks, Cornish Pasty, will be back with many others really soon!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual!! The Shepherds Pie is a favorite for sure. Also recommend the lamb and mint pasty. Big enough to take home leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is definitely one (or two) of a kind. This place has a vibe that nowhere else does in the area. Almost reminiscent of a downtown hangout, this Pastys is pretty hipster, but in a good way. TONS of great beers are always on tap and their pasties are amazing. If you've never had one, its almost like a pizza pocket filled with a deliciousness of your choice. A great place for a night out with the girls, guys, or both.

Overall, head to CP for some good beer and a yummy pasty."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing! The waitress was very helpful when I asked her for a sweet type of beer she gave me some samples and we went with some berry based beer. We got the 32oz and it was huge! Perfect for 2 people who don't drink beer that often :). We ordered the Shepherd's Pie Pasty and the Bangers and Mash Pasty. The crust was to die for! It was simply perfect. I asked the waitress how you would traditionally eat these and it was really nice of her to give us a little history! I enjoyed the history and origin of pasties. For dessert we ordered the Apple Caramel Pasty. Normally we never order dessert because we are too full or when we do we never finish it because it gets too sweet but man I loved this dessert, it was just the right amount of sweetness and the best part is that we were able to get more of that delicious crust. We did go for my best friends birthday and unfortunately they don't do anything for birthdays. Overall however we had an amazing time, it was really relaxing especially after our flight. I would really recommend this place and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So good! First time experience and the food was excellent. Soup was creamy with a hit of spice. The Shepard pie w minced lamb very well done w flaky dough crust sooo good. Plus the gravy wine sauce to top it off excellent! I could drink it, it's so good."}
{"text":"After years of meaning to do it, we finally checked out the Cornish Pasty Company. 

I had the Oggie with a side of mashed potatoes and a Boddingtons. The wife had the Lamb Vindaloo and we shared a cider. We also had a side of chips and our niece had a salad. The food was very good over all, and I would say the Vindaloo was outstanding (I took a few bites off my wife's plate). Please don't order it if you can't stand spiciness though. Too many restaurants nowadays are wimping out on spice because people order something they can't handle and send it back to the kitchen or complain (try finding truly hot buffalo wings these days, for instance). But for spice lovers, it was A-1. 

These things take awhile to bake, so don't go if you're in a big hurry. They had one lady waiting the tables, and as time went by the place got busier and busier. But she kept up with it somehow, and just when I thought she would surely forget something, it would arrive. It was very impressive, actually. The food did arrive a little out of order, again, thanks to the baking time. But it was not a big problem. 

Someone else has mentioned the good music they play on the jukebox and the nice seating they have outside. Add to that a decent beer selection and you have a darn good experience. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a very large group. The waitress did a good job of managing the large group. I had a beer, caesar salad, and the chicken tikka masala pasty. It was a ton of food and I didn't even come close to finishing it all. The pasty was my least favorite part of it. I normally love everything curry and pie-like crusts are usually a favorite. I thought for sure this would be a home run but I just didn't love it. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love Cornish! The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly. Food is delicious and not badly priced. Just be prepared for a little wait to get your order 'cause this place is so good it's usually packed."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I had the Scottish eggs, the mushroom soup and a lamb pasty and it was amazing :) I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"No need to jet set 12 hours to a British pub, we've got one in our own backyard! Where else can you find long white candle sticks that light the room? Eating here is like watching a scene straight outta a Harry Potter movie. 

Okay, let's talk food. A friend and I had the Oggie with a side of red wine gravy. The potatoes, steak, and the red wine gravy combination definitely hit the spot! Another dish we sampled was The Chicken Greek. A savory choice! Out of the two, I'd love to eat the Oggie for breakfast and eat the Chicken Greek for lunch. For desert, we had the Shirley Temple pudding. Coming in a hot and small iron clad pot, the chocolate bread pudding was so mouth-watering delicious! We even had to scrape down the sides of the pot to get every last crumb of the pudding. We opted to get the ice cream on the side which was light, fluffy, and easy to spoon on top of the chocolate. 

Overall, they've got excellent service. I'd recommend co-workers, classmates, or friends to come here during after hours!"}
{"text":"Holy hell was this amazing. When our friend recommended this place he described the food quite accurately. I believe the description went something like this: \"I won't lie to you, it's basically fancy hot pockets. But they're really good, unique, and fresh.\" We took his word and we're glad.
Flavors came through very well in the appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had the Italian pasty... A variety of meats, cheese, and tomatoes with marinara to dip into. When I was finished I was full but still wanted more. A wide variety of beer was also present. 
There were two downfalls in my mind. The first was that the main source of light was a candle at each table. I would have enjoyed seeing our tablemates a bit better as well as my food. The second was the \"no removal of ingredients\" aspect, although I wasn't looking to exclude any of the ingredients from my specific pasty. The pasties are made in large batches and then refrigerated until they are cooked. Items are in large chunks, though, so if I wanted to remove tomatoes on my own I could have (with more light, of course). 
If you're looking for a different type of meal in the area, stop in!"}
{"text":"Best place ever!!! Food is amazing! And the service is just as great. I'm seriously upset I didn't know about this place sooner. 
But the pasties are all delicious!!"}
{"text":"Not as great as it's cracked up to be. My wife and I each got a pasty, they're extremely bland. The staff and building are as hipster as it comes. Definitely not worth the price. I honestly would've been happier going to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place had such a cool atmosphere and the food was amazing, I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My most favorite restaurant! Definitely miss this place since I moved out! Love their pot pies! My husband is a huge fan of their pot pies!! Their bar collection is very good as well! And not to forget the desserts  if your in Phoenix, please definitely visit this place!! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the food itself, once it arrived. It was a Saturday evening, we arrived just before 6pm, got seated rather quickly, outside. Nice day, why not? Table was very uncomfortable, not fun, but, not the end of the world. After my party of 4 was seated, it took 20+ min to get a server to get our orders, after I had to go find the hostess and ask for one. We ordered our food, no substitutions mind you ,as these are all made in advance and sometimes they run out. We ordered and got? our drinks a few min later. 30 min later my Dad's chips were brought to us even though he asked for them with his meal, it was a side after all. Then another 20+ minuets and 3 soda refills later our food finally came out. It was decent, though just past warm, not as hot as I would have liked. We didn't get our food until around 7-715 PM. I won't bother going back again because of the service or lack thereof. We had planned on getting deserts all around but opted not too as 90+ min on the extremely uncomfortable table was more than enough. We were all standing by the end as we waited another 15 min for our bill."}
{"text":"Evel Knievel would eat these pastys. You should too.  Pure genius, good atmosphere, attentive service.  I still study the menu before I go, been coming for a decade, too."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to eat in \"the valley\". I love the Mesa location because it is larger than the other locations and I like the makeover on the patio. Tikka Masala is by far my favorite pasty...in fact I have never had a bad pasty and their beer selection is great! I guess I can't say enough good things..."}
{"text":"Cornish makes my tummy and heart happy!

I stopped in after looking at wedding dresses for a close friend of mine (always a bridesmaid..never a bride. . . ) and this place made me feel less depressed and likely to spend my life alone... because...

The food will make you forget it all! Feed your face and feed your feelings! I had never heard of a pasty before coming here and this is what has been missing from my life.

I don't need a boyfriend any longer . . . I can get a Shepherds pie to keep me safe and warm. Need someone to make you feel loved and wanted? Pssh..forget that...shove your pie hole with a pasty--and then make it a pasty hole! Try the Tikka Masala and then change your last name to Cornish Pasty-Tikka Masala.. no one will question you ...because they know you found what is right in the world.

Feeling a little tied down? Try Reuben.. he's so good and filled with pastrami and can take you to the 1000 Islands. . . he's like an ugly fat man but rich so he's a bit more attractive. But, certainly delicious.

Want to get a little freaky? BANGERS and MASH! It's like a threesome in you mouffff! Do it!!

Go to Cornish Pasty! Seriously!!! Go and find that special pasty..that special something to make your soul feel good again."}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the first time we have sat to eat in the restaurant. Typically we order and pick up. The restaurant was really great. Although they were running slow the waiter never let our drinks go dry which was awesome. We always order signature pasty's and my husband was stoked to try the iron maiden beer. The apple caramel desert was awesome. Maybe some people would give it a 4 because of the wait but I appreciate the effort the waiter took to make our experience great. And the pasty's were hot, burning hot, when they hit the table. If they had been cold, a totally different story."}
{"text":"Delicious food way low key joint all servers are pretty helpful with suggestions. Carne Adovada and the Reuben are my personal favorites."}
{"text":"Not quite the charm of the Tempe location, though a nice place all the same. The staff are a little too \"hip\" for their own good but friendly and talented for the most part. The food is why we came and we did not leave disappointed. Their take on a Cheese Steak and the Royale with Cheese are my faves. The chips (fries) with jalapeños are magical."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and it's been great everytime.
I don't think I have had the same thing twice (with exception to the Banofee (sp?) Pie)
Cornish Pasty is not a place a would come to if I was rushed for time at all as the food takes a while to prepare. Even though we may have to wait a bit longer for food than at other restaurants, every server I've had here has been attentive and friendly and eager to answer questions or make recommendations. I've sat at the bar and I've sat at the tables. The restaurant is always clean, I never stick to the floor or table, the food is good and freshly made, the servers have always been accomodating and the music is fun (and a rather ecclectic mix at that).
It's a place I will come to again and again and always look forward to introducing friends and family to it. My parents love it and have been back twice since I brought them here a month ago."}
{"text":"Went here the other day for the first time.  It was really good, and Im looking forward to going back again and trying other things.  
I had the Meat and Cheese pastie with the Red Wine Gravy.  ummm YUM!  I also had a side of baked beans.  Probably the closest thing I have had to and Australian Meat Pie in years.  I am really looking forward to going back and trying sheppards pie, made with minced LAMB.  You can get to go orders as well."}
{"text":"Awesome Place.  Cozy and hip with church pews for seating!  Come try a Cornish Pasty .  They have many different flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  What's even better, I live walking distance from it.  If you've never had a pasty, do yourself a favor and try one.  These things are huge.  Lots of ingredients wrapped into a pastry shell and baked.  My God!  Drink selection is good here.  Bloody Mary bar on Sundays.  Check it out"}
{"text":"Always fun! Dark but great food and interesting atmosphere. Attentive service."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! My parents and I had the vindaloo wings as an appetizer and I loved them! Probably because I don't like traditional hot wings to begin with but the spices were spot on! Hot as hell (temperature wise) so it was easy to trust they were fresh. We each had a different pasty: salmon, carne adovada and portobello chicken. They were all scrumptious and each had such a unique flavor. The seasoning on everything was perfect and the dough was nice and flaky. I'd say the portions are perfect as well, I would have been content with the first half but it was too good not to eat the whole pie! I also got the sticky toffee pudding. That was the first time I had it and it was pretty damn good too! It came in a mini cast iron pot with ice cream on the side. You could really taste the toffee glaze that was soaked into the pudding. 

The only con I have is the service. Not that I wanted my dad to say anything but he told our waitress it was my birthday and she barely even batted an eye. The service was super slow and our waitress was not very attentive. We were there for over 2 hours and it took a while to just get every single thing we ordered from our drinks, appetizer, entrees and dessert. We waited at least 40 minutes before our entree and another 20 minutes for dessert. She didn't check in often and my glass was empty (I had ordered wine) for 15 minutes before she asked if I wanted another one. We sat at one of the community tables where 2 guys sat on the other end after finishing our appetizer and they had gotten their drinks/entrees at the same rate we were in the middle of eating ours. How did they get their stuff so much sooner than we did when they only had 1 less person in their party? I haven't a clue especially when the restaurant wasn't full. 

Anyway, I would definitely go back for the food. The service has a lot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"The best pasties I have had in a long time and I'm a Brit who grew up eating these every week. The selection is fabulous and never been with anyone who didn't love what they ate. I often go for the Oggie which melts in the mouth with delicious red wine gravy. Great ambience and staff, only downside is when it's busy it does get quite hard to have a conversation inside."}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG! Food was great I got the shepherds pie pasty with a side of gravy it was great. It was worth the drive for pick up from my home in Gilbert. Staff was friendly and the place looked warm and inviting. I will be back again. Theres like at least 5 more things on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"Was here my first visit for my girlfriends birthday one evening and it was yum-o! There was a group of about 10+ of us and we all trickled in a few at a time so we started off at the bar until enough people showed up to be seated at a table. The place was packed but we mananaged to get our drinks and food in a timely manner. 

I've gone here a few times since during the day and it's not quite as packed but still busy. Usually split a pepperoni pasty and have a few drinks. Definitely a great place to chill."}
{"text":"Something so simple done unbelievably well. First time? Try the Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) with steak, potatoes, onion and a side of red wine gravy- DON'T YOU DARE GET KETCHUP INSTEAD! If you want something a little more southwest, the Carne Adovada is RIDICULOUS. They also have a great variety of local beer on tap."}
{"text":"I love this place. I didn't think I would Luke this place as much as the Tempe location... But...Love the food, music, and atmosphere. Today our server was super busy, so the bartender saw this and brought our drinks over. I never mind waiting when people are working hard and this was a pleasant surprise. Loved the candles, door tables... And the plates. .. and really good, very large, beers!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to savor a satisfying meal. Great, relaxing ambiance. Excellent idea of pastries being the center of attention in this restaurant. Shepard's Pie was to die for on this superposing find. Already have recommended this place many times. I will be coming back soon and sampling the rest of the delightful menu."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with pasties, and I have to say, Cornish Pasty Company has made a fan out of me!  We sat in front of the kitchen and had loads of fun watching the guys (and one gal) make the pasties with great dexterity.

My friend and I started the meal with garlic chips that were addicting and so flavorful.  They're not skinny and oily like regular garlic fries.  These chips are large warm wedges infused with garlic flavor.  I highly suggest getting them!  

My friend got the chicken pot pie pasty and really liked it.  I had a bite and found myself in strong agreement.  My lamb and mint pasty was also good, as it was very balanced, but I was a bit disappointed by how dry the lamb was.  The gravy it came with fixed that though.

Finally, we ended the meal with sticky toffee pudding.  It was actually my third choice in desserts because the first two choices had sold out.  But regardless, this dessert was so so soooo very delicious!  It was crunchy on the outside, but soft and gooey on the inside.  The sweetness level was perfect, and the cream sauce brought the dessert to the perfect level of indulgence.

I am definitely going back here.  There are so many pasties that I want to try, and all under $10!"}
{"text":"Went there with my husband last night to celebrate our 15th anniversary.  Had been once or twice and sat at bar.  Had good experiences and enjoyed the variety of vegetarian options.  Food was good last night, but our waitress needed some serious help.
The ordering went well enough, but while we were eating our delicious pasties the waitress started bussing the table behind us.  She knocked over what I think was a pretty good amount of red wine in a glass on the table and then left quickly. My husband's back was to the table and he had felt a splash on his arm. I went and looked behind his chair, saw the spill, and saw a huge splatter of wine across the back of his creme colored shirt.  Wine was also a platter ed on the floor.  
The best I could tell is that our waitress either had very dull eyesight or was hoping we wouldn't notice.  Another employee walked by and saw what happened and I told her it was our waitress.  Waitress came back about 5 minutes later and offered to \"blot\" the wine out w/water......really..like that would work.  She then asked us if we wanted anything else, dessert, if my husband wanted another beer.  She ended up taking off $14.  Said she bought us a round, but $14 didn't even cover our 2 beers much less the cost of my husband's ruined shirt.  
Pretty much ruined our anniversary dinner and she didn't give a true apology.  After reading other reviews it seems like service is an issue at this location.  If we ever go back, I would most likely sit at the bar or counter to hopefully avoid inconsiderate waitresses spilling food or drink."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I've been to a Cornish Pasty Co... I'd mostly been to the Tempe location near ASU when I was working in that area. They have expanded a lot and the menu has many more items than in the \"old days.\" 

While getting your food seems to take a bit longer than I remember, the quality remains high. I have never had anything here that I did not like, but I've also never had the lamb or salmon, so... 

For first timers, I'd say you can't go wrong with the Oggie, Cajun Chicken, or anything on the dessert menu, but you're best served picking something that has a filling combination that sounds good to you. They even have a whole section of vegetarian pasties now!

Can't decide on ONE that you like? The pasties come out cut in half, which makes sharing awfully easy as long as you can get a friend to split with you.

Their beer list probably has something for everyone as well."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. There's candles burning everywhere throughout the restaurant, although it's an open flame so it can be a little dangerous for the little ones or for the clumsy ones. They use church pews for some tables which was pretty unique. 

The service was really slow. They didn't really come and check on us much. 

The food overall was pretty good. We tried a few of the different pasties and a couple were good while a couple were just mediocre. Also wished they were hotter as well.

We also got the sticky toffee puffing as a dessert and that was delicious."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and atmosphere here is awesome! We also had great service. I only wish you guys would open a cen-pho location, i (along with many others) would be all over it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this establishment three times. The Chicken Rosemary, by far, is my favorite. The Chicken Pot Pie is great, too! The beer selection is outstanding. I shall return again...and again....and again."}
{"text":"Tomato soup w homemade bread and butter is 5 stars. Great pasties..especially the ones with red wine gravy. Good service too."}
{"text":"I've been into this location a couple times and while pasties aren't my favorite thing to eat, and they seem to be out of the ones I want, I've always enjoyed the food and service here. There is definitely a good selection of pasties as well as soups, salads and appetizers. Not to mention the alcohol situation is pretty great. Definitely check this place out when you want something different than the normal fare."}
{"text":"This is a go-to spot whenever I have family visiting. The food is unique and always delicious. The portions are just right and all entrees are ~$10. The desserts are a little pricey ($6-8) but are excellent if you want to splurge! Good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! What a great place for date night or a night with the family. Low lighting, large tables or cozy couches, great music, fabulous service and DELICIOUS food!!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get.  All sides are priced separately.  Multiple menu selections were not available.....so many the waiter had to give me a written sheet listing all items that were \"sold out.\"  Hubby ordered chicken tiki masala and it was so spicy he couldn't eat it.  We eat Indian food frequently so know what tiki should taste like.   I ordered the chicken pesto pasty.  It was just \"ok.\" Nothing I would order again.  Maybe the numerous choices on the menu that wee \"not available \" might have been the better choices.  Who knows!"}
{"text":"Love this place, from the ambiance to the walnut soup accompanied by gorgeous bread with soft butter.  My favorite place on the East side!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Cornish Pasty Company for I don't even know how long. Just hadn't gotten to it.

Today we got to the Mesa location and it was killer. Started off great just walking through the door. The decor is killer. They have done some neat things with the bar (tiling, industrial purse hooks - the Mrs. loves those so they stood out to me). The church pews for seating and the glassed over doors for tables are super cool. The melted candle bottles on the table and the black & white photos also help to give it a nice vibe.

Next looked at the menu and they have a great beer selection (mix of on tap & bottles). I did get a bit overwhelmed with the number of pasty choices (which is good). They also have quite a large number of vegetarian pasties which is nice - for the rest of the family. : )

Whittled it down to the chicken tikka, shepherd's pie and royale with cheese. The server recommended the chicken tikka and I went with that. The pasty itself was excellent. Great flavor, little bit of heat, great pastry. As the Mrs. is from Australia, we're big into pastry and things like pasties, meat pies, sausage rolls, etc. I definitely need to get her here soon!

The service was great as well. Everybody was super nice and quite efficient. Food and drink came quickly. 

All in all, a great experience. Quite happy with the entire meal.

With so many pasty choices, I think it's trouble once you break the seal. I foresee many, many visits in our future."}
{"text":"Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends."}
{"text":"When trying to decide where to meet some friends for dinner, Cornish Pasty was suggested and I excitedly agreed. I had read great reviews, so was happy to finally visit for myself.

The food was great- worth a four or even a five star review. There were a few things that really hurt the quality of the experience for me.

The seating at CPC is four sets of church pew seats around tables fashioned from large doors. What was frustrating is that each set of seats were occupied with really small groups of 2-4 people. The waitstaff could have easily asked people to move to one end of the pews or the other, and the length could easily hold two separate sets of diners without encroaching on either party's personal space. Instead, we stood and waited for 15 minutes.

Second, the temperature of the place was hot and muggy. Running some fans or turning up the AC a teeny bit would have made things more comfortable.

The music was really loud, and we had to shout over it to talk across the table. It seemed a little like they were trying to be more of a bar/hipster hangout than a restaurant. 

The service left a bit to be desired, but I don't fault our sweet waitress. She was nice and as attentive as she could be, but admitted she was frazzled as there were only two on shift for the entire restaurant. Since I've only been once I don't know if that's the norm, but I hope not.

One important note- if you are a picky eater, take a look at their menu online and call ahead a few hours early for special orders. You can't make any substitutions as everything is made in advance and half-cooked, then finished cooking when ordered. A bit of a bummer though, because you have to order 2 for special orders.

Something that stood out in a great way was their entire page of vegetarian pasty selections. So awesome! I hadn't had a good shepherd's pie since ditching meat many years ago, so it was great to have a well made veggie version. If and when I return, I'll definitely try some of the other meatless pockets of deliciousness.

Also, the mushy peas were out of this world. Although, this is coming from someone who eats peas right out of the can."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few of my girlfriends.

We also tried different pasties.

The Chicken Pesto was my absolute favorite compared to all the others that we tried. The Chicken Marsala just didn't have much flavor.  

I like the outdoor sitting, cool atmosphere with a trendy dining area."}
{"text":"Really great food here, reasonably priced.

The thing that prevents us from going back to this place is the service and the employees. Hipster Heaven! 

They could truly care less about their customers. Especially the guy waiters. One spilled beer right in the middle of our table AND in our other beers. not even an apology. No offer to clean it. Nothing.

This is the land of the skinny jeans, losers, bone in the nose, tattooed face crowd. So if that's your scene, go. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"This place seems like it is pretty good as far as the preparation of the food goes. My pasty was very salty though, and they told me they didn't have three items that I tried to order. I assume that means the sides and deserts aren't fresh, which is a little foolish considering they were all super simple items to make if you have a restaurant. The staff wasn't particularly welcoming either. I am going to try this place again, because I have heard so many good things about it from reputable people. I will check in some time soon to say how it goes."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a quality price.. They are always friendly and good service.. Also a great date place for at night. Not loud at all and just an overall cool place."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I've never heard of this place before a friend recommended we go for dinner but it sounded right up my alley. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool; if you choose to sit at the bar, you can watch as the pasties are being made. We sat outside since it was a gorgeous night, though. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, as well as really patient as we tried to figure out what to order. We decided to split the shepherd's pie and the chicken tikka masala. Both were absolutely incredible! They have so many options to choose from, including vegetarian and vegan, so there's bound to be something for everyone."}
{"text":"My favorite location is not here but in Tempe, but it seems that I'm always closer to this location so I come here.  This place takes the whole Idea of a British Pie to whole new level. It's unbelievable to me how many different varieties of pies they make here.  If you look at the vegetarian menu alone you will find something like 15-20 different varieties from tikka masala to Mexican, veggie pesto, to even ground beef.  They always also have 2 vegan options which are quite good, the last one was with corn and veggies with a tomato red sauce side.  They also make really healthy salads to go with your pie which are reasonably priced.  There are two huge bar areas to eat at and it's a pretty friendly atmosphere.  The people who work here are very nice and very informative on all the options for beer and wine.  The options of beers on tap are very extensive.  The night I went they had a specialty dark beer that was something like 12% and they told me they were the only restaurant in the world to offer it.  Wished I remembered the name but it was definitely a sipper and lasted the whole meal and beyond.  The only other reason why I like the other location better is you can't really watch them make the pies here.  Part of the fun is watching the crew making these things way into the night.  It just ads to the ambiance but even without that this place is pretty darn fun and it sure never gets tiring to keep coming back."}
{"text":"After years of obtaining my pastys (I choose to spell it this way, the other makes me feel dirty!) at the Cornish Pasty Co's ASU area location, this new location is a welcome addition to Mesa, and far closer to my home! 

First, the restaurant is rather small, but has a large covered patio in case you feel claustrophobic! Inside you'll find large church pews in front of long tables. This is fabulous during busy times, as you'll meet wonderful new people sitting at the other side of your table that you might not have otherwise spoken to!  Menus are on the tables and the candles that sit in empty whiskey bottles are just cool. 

On to the food!

My 11-year old daughter adores the PB&J, of course, but so does my 62-year-old mother! I've not tried it yet, but it smells wonderful! 

Personally, I've tried the following during my many visits: 
-Cheese Steak: Wonderful large chunks of tasty meat with peppers and onions and cheese. The red wine gravy is fantastic with this one, you might need more!
-Ruben: The sauerkraut is made from red cabbage, and the corned beef is perfectly cooked. A fabulous choice!
-Vegetarian Greek: This was my very first pasty, and was absolutely fabulous. Kalamata olives, artichokes, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, 
-Italian: A fabulous concoction served with marinara. Salami makes it tasty, fresh basil leaves put it over the top! 
-Chicken Pot Pie: This is the only one I really didn't like... not because it was bad, but because it was bland. It needed salt... 
-Greek Salad: This salad is rather interesting, and the dressing is not what I expected! But it's good, and full of lots of good veggies!

You should definitely go here, it's a great place to eat, food pie! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Kronenbourg on tap! The pasties are good, the cheese and broccoli plate is even better (and around $4). The treacle pudding is spectacular. Best of all no TVs and good music so you can enjoy your pint or two in peace."}
{"text":"I can only rate this place on the food as I have never actually been here :) I have had there pastys a couple of times now but my husband picks it up on the way home. 

The first one I ever tried was The Oggie, and it was really great!! The second time we had The Royale with Cheese, and WOW!!! Amazing!!

Like I said above I can only judge on the food and it was delish :)"}
{"text":"From the outside, it looks like any other restaurant in a strip mall.  But walk inside, and it's long black tables with benches, molted candle wax covered wine bottles and some pretty tattoo clad, pierced, rocking, and very friendly staff members.

The menu explains the pastry and it's a interesting story.  I grew up with meat and potato's so I was expecting something like my mom's pot roast, but within a pastry shell.  What I didn't expect was that little bit of mint in mine.  I ordered the lamb and mint but didn't expect it to be savory and stand out, but it was good.

I also tried the desert pastries, be ready to wait, they take a while to bake, but it was worth it.  Shirley Temple's pudding, sticky toffee pudding, imported British treacle, and served with creme anglaise.  We enjoyed the food, and we enjoyed the service."}
{"text":"Tell you the truth I was extremely nervous to try a Cornish Pasty, but boy am I glad I did. I have never been to the University location but I can tell you that this one is awesome! It is interesting to learn about where the Pasty originated and that story is told in all of the menus. 

My meal of choice is the Cajan Chicken and a ice cold english hard cider to wash it down."}
{"text":"We have been Cornish customers for years but the latest group dinner we had last night was very different.

In our group of 5 on a Tuesday night, the server was MIA pretty much the whole evening. When they dropped off the appetizers, there was no silverware or napkins for our WINGS. I had to get up and grab them myself from their counter. Everyone noticed the lack of water and beer refills/orders. It was irritating the entire group and just made the experience disappointing. 

We picked up takeout just the week prior and liked how they half baked the pasties. Just being more aware of the change in services from our past experiences..."}
{"text":"Pastry? Pasty? Oh, it's pah-sty aka dough-covered deliciousness. I've noticed the hype on yelp and am really glad I finally hopped on the bandwagon. 

My friend suggested going to the Mesa location because there is more seating than the one in Tempe. It has a cool vibe...  kind of a modern English pub. There are large communal tables, a long bar, and a patio to choose from. With haboob #2 looming in the sky, we decided to share an inside table with 3 cool strangers.  I was with a party of 5 and we all loved our orders. I had the carne adovada - shredded pork with green chilis and great spicy flavors. Loved every bite. We also shared the apple, cinammon, caramel pasty for desert. I loved this too. Maybe more. Maybe not. Both were just so darn good. 

It seems like the perfect place for a meat and potatoes sort of guy, plus I heard there's a great selection of English beers, so I'm planning to take my boyfriend there for dinner asap (twice in one week wouldn't be overkill right?) Vegetarians, they have a long list of pasty options for you too."}
{"text":"Well I know it is a Pasty company and all but why can't I just get normal bangers & mash?  Why do you have to screw it up by wrapping it in bread.  Also, when I order B&M, I expect it to have peas.  That's just the way I am used to it and, when it doesn't have them, it is missing part of the flavor.  That really screwed with my expectations of the order (that also took forever) and is why I didn't give them four stars.

The quality was extremely high and the sausage was amazingly good.  The presentation was nice and the red wine sauce was the perfect compliment.  Totally a good meal for a decent price.  

I would recommend this place for a pasty - just not for British food.  They are a one trick pony but at least they do it well."}
{"text":"Yes Please! Can I eat here everyday??
Stopped in on a Monday night per my boo's suggestion. I was kind of sceptical about the whole idea of a fancy hot pocket but boy was I wrong!
We sat on the outside patio, not the most comfortable seats more like fancy park benches but it was nice out and we had the little one so it worked. First we started out with their \"chips\", English for french fries. We had them with the roasted garlic and they were bomb! 
I had the pepper corn steak pasty. The sauce that was served with it was out of this world and all I wanted to do was dip my fries in it till the end of time! The flavors of the pasty worked well together, definitely need to be a big fan of blue cheese to enjoy it though for it provides a strong flavor. The crust was perfectly cooked and flaky and I can see how it would serve any flavor combination well. My boyfriend had the bangers and mash and I may have even liked his more than mine! The gravy served with his was equally as delicious. 
The vibe of the restaurant was also super chill and laid back, definitely hipsters floating around but hey, they're people too. I will definitely be back to try them all!!! I think the hamburger one may be next on my list..."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is casual and fun, and the selection of beer is awesome.  What I like the most is the price - a man can eat and be full for $10.00 - can't wait to return and try a different pasty!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, it is a little pricey, $9.50 for just the pasties without any sides. However the pasties are a good size and usually fill me up. I suggest the Peppered Steak, it is by far my favorite so far. The service gets kinda slacked as the place fills up. Seems like the servers are more interested in the big parties with a high bar bill. All in all its a decent place, the atmosphere is very chill and a little dark. Definitely has the pub feel."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The pasties are do good - we have been several times and not had a single bad one. The banoffee pie for dessert is not to be missed. I think the prices are reasonable as well. I have only been to the Mesa location which at peak times is packed - which leads to it being insanely loud and the staff super busy. 
Beware - there are no special orders on pasties - they are pre prepped."}
{"text":"Pies are the source of all truth and have the ability to tell the future. These are VERY good pies and the beer selection is TOP notch."}
{"text":"I go here all the time because I have a bunch of friends who work in the kitchen. It's all good stuff.. I have tried most of the pastys. I love the Reuben, the Cajun, and the Royal (all horrible for you) I recommend swapping halves with a friend so you can try 2 types. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"Having grown up in England, I am always a little wary of Cornish Pasties in the US.  In Phoenix on business I saw this place on Yelp and took a leap of faith.  It is the real deal.  I had the Salmon Pasty and it was off the charts good.  The combination of Salmon, asparagus, tomatoes and thinly sliced potatoes was perfect.  They also nailed the crust, which isn't as easy as it seems."}
{"text":"this place was okay, going to give it another chance to really decide. Atmosphere is pretty cool, you feel comfortable soon as you walk in..seat yourself place. After we placed our orders one of the two pastys we ordered had ran out which kinda sucked. checked out the alcohol menu and seemed to have a large variety, and good deals for happy hour as well. food was okay, had the Alfredo pasty and the spicy asiago chicken. Was not anything that knocked my socks off, but it satisfied the hunger. like i said will probably give it another chance and try something else and def give the desert a chance because they look delicious!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good service and good prices.  Great menu with a wide variety of choices to pick from; both food and drinks. Wish the orders came with a side included at no additional charge.

We had the bangers and mash with a great gravy sauce. We also had the pilgrim, it was like a  Thanksgiving explosion in your mouth, so good! The pilgrim came with cranberry sauce and a gravy. 

We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not what I would have ever expected but this place was great. Good food, good service. My only reason for dropping the one star is that it had too much of the dark grungy feel to it. Yes, I know, that's probably what they were shooting for, to make it have the dark pub feel, but that's not my thing. Other than that, highly recommended for the wonderful food."}
{"text":"From the bar, I watched my food being prepared by dudes who look like they're from Seattle. And then served by chicks who look like they're from Seattle. And now I'm enjoying my Cottage Pie Pasty amongst other diners who all look like they're from Seattle. Except the guy over there with no neck wearing the Affliction shirt which is two sizes too small, rocking the Bluetooth earpiece; he's clearly from the Jersey Shore. Or North Scottsdale.

I've been to both Cornish Pasty locations, and I gotta say that they do a great job with the space(s) they occupy. This haunt in Mesa - like the one in Tempe - occupies a strip mall (as do 98.5% of the restaurants in the East Valley), but it sure doesn't feel like it once you're inside. And I dig that.

As for the dough these things come in ... It's, like, equal parts flour, Jesus, and butter! From this point forward, I'm dedicating my life to reverse engineering these mofos and then opening a Cornish Pasty. In Seattle.

Let's just say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Vegan options are on point. Broccoli vindaloo and calzone pasty both fire. Loved them when I ate meat, love them the same after."}
{"text":"The actual pasty was great, the dough they use and how they cook it is delicious. The atmosphere is dark and bleak and I guess going for that old-time English pub feeling.
The servers are all hipsters so if your grandma isn't into seeing tattooed guys with beards and skinny jeans or girls with septum piercings she might not appreciate the experience. Personally, I don't care I was here for the vegan options.

The problem with a pasty is that they are pre-made so you cannot change anything, meaning you cannot add or take any ingredient away. Unfortunately for me I only think it's average because of this. If you're not a Veg then you will probably enjoy it, or if you eat cheese because almost all their vegetarian choices have cheese...and they sound delicious!
I'm probably just pissy because the menu says 2 Vegan options daily and they only had 1."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is great for lunch with friends.

They have a couple of locations locally here in the Phoenix area and are quickly expanding elsewhere too. (I've heard they are opening a location in Las Vegas).  For those who don't know what Pastys are, they are pastries filled with meats and other ingredients and baked.  Sort of like a calzone, but not pizza related.

I usually end up getting the Italian pasty - it's filled with pepperoni, salami, capocollo, ham, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and roasted tomatoes and served with a side of marinara.  They have plenty of other options too like The Porky, Shepperd's Pie, Cajun Chicken, Lovely Bit of Salmon, and The Pilgrim to name a few.

Making changes or substitutions to the pastys won't really pay off for you because the pastys are pre-made that day and, if you need anything removed or added to yours, they will need to make a brand new one and it takes a lot longer to get it baked and out to you.  They will gladly make the substitutions, just be ready to wait for it.

Traditionally, the Cornish Pasty locations have had super small dining rooms, but this location just expanded into the space next door and it's really opened up a lot of additional seating.

We have stopped going to Cornish Pasty with our son because of the amount of time it takes to get the food delivered to the table.  This is not the fault of the restaurant, (the service is usually really good) the pastys just have to bake for awhile and our 18 month old son gets antsy and is done with sitting in the highchair before the food arrives.  It hasn't stopped us from going to Cornish Pasty, we just don't go with him anymore."}
{"text":"A bit of a \"nip\" in the air this morning...and when I think \"nip\", I think \"pasties\" and when I think \"pasties\", well, I just naturally think \"pasty's\" :-)

So there you have it...that's how my mind works...I've said it before and I will say it again...linear thinking is the best thinking:)

I get so lonely working away in my plush private office with nothing to keep me company but a steady stream of information and diversions from across the universe...and my chowchow, DeeDee...sometimes I need to get out of my gilded cage:)

Today was one of those days, and fortunately for me, my cardiologist buddy, Jim, was in a position to prescribe a bangers and mash pasty at CPC, for my continued good heart health :-)

Stat - (Latin for \"with a side of broccoli and cauliflower\"...he says they are chock full of \"beta blocker's\"...I didn't even know I needed my beta blocked!)

We met for lunch with his longtime friend (and my new friend) Gary (who is, among other things, a novelist...I want to see how he works me and CPC into a book:)

I was pretty hungry after spin class this morning and the waitstaff at CPC wasted no time in getting the retox going for me...I think service has improved since I was here last and food remains authentic and excellent!

Neither Jim or Gary had ever been to CPC before, but they both handled their pasty's like pro's and the three of us all joined the CPC - \"CPC\" (\"Clean Plate Club\"...I think there's an award ceremony at the end of the year:)

Jim had an Oggie and Gary tried a Greek Something Pasty and both were fortified against the rigors of the remainder of Friday afternoon (Jim had some sort of \"human heart thingy\" he had to do, and I had to come back to my office and type on my computer...who has the more stressful job...really? :-).

Finally, the people at CPC all continue to be so darn happy and pleasant...I so often see people working at restaurants that look like they hate being there (and probably do) that it's worth noting when everybody from the cooks to the servers all have smiles on their  faces and in their voices.

It's probably from eating all those pasty's...they're approved by all of my cardiologist buddies, so you know they must be good for you:)"}
{"text":"Visiting from Canada and decided to try the Cornish Pasty (my husband is from England and is always on the look out for back home good food ). In the space of three weeks, we have eaten there four times. We have had a different server each time we have gone - and each has provided great service. The food is excellent with a wide variety - in case Bangers & Mash is not to your liking. The desserts are great -Chocolate Bread and Budding Pudding is soooo good. The prices are reasonable.
The address is a little deceiving as it is in the back of the complex - but certainly worth finding"}
{"text":"Um, yeah.  This place RULES.  The Tempe location differs greatly from the Mesa/Chandler location but are equally great.  The Tempe vibe is that of a hole in the wall NY/SF/Chicago joint and sometimes I can actually take a moment and feel like I'm not in drab AZ.  The Chandler location is new, cleaner but mirrors the same decor, menus and furniture that the Tempe spot has. 

For awhile I couldn't get away from the Cajun - this one is my favorite. I've tried the Royale With Cheese and  the Italian.  All of them were good but the cajun, by FAR, rules thus far.

Unfortunately, I have only been to Cornish during my work day, so I haven't been able to wet my whistle with the great beer selection they have.  Plenty of English/Irish style beers to choose from - a decent happy hour too.

The menu also educates you on what a Pasty (PAS-TEE) is. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for awhile now and it is one of my favorite places to eat.

There are usually quite a few people inside sitting on the church pew seats and enjoying their meals off the old doors covered with glass tables.  The place is not fancy, but very different.  Decor is very simple with just black and white as the theme.

The people who work there are mostly college age kids.  They work hard here, dishing out awesome meals.

The food will not disappoint anyone.  The pickiest eater can find something  that will please them.  There are over 20 delicious pasties, many without meat.  Everything is cooked to order, so it takes abit to get your food, but the wait is worth it!

I usually go with my wife.  We like to sit near the bar at the patio doors.  I usually order the Greek pastie with an order of roasted potatoes, which I wash down with a Four Peaks Kilt Lifter beer (my fav!).  When you order the Greek, they give you little containers of tzatziki sauce  and some other sauce (which I am not fond of).

This is an especially awesome place to go to when it is really cold out as they use these huge ovens inside to bake your food, and it is really nice and toasty there.

In the summer, they have two patios to enjoy the fresh air.

So remember if you want a meal that is different, filling and comfortable at a decent price, this is the place to go.

There is another location in Tempe, but I have not been there yet."}
{"text":"The scotch eggs were amazing.  The platter of cheeses, meat etc on the appetizers menu is a perfect meal on its own.  The hubby had the Reuben pasty which he enjoyed.  Daughter 1 is a vegetarian and for the veggie cottage pasty-she thought it was a little dry.  Daughter 2 had the Royale with cheese.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I opted for the chicken pot pie and it was heaven! We topped everything off with the chocolate bread and butter pudding and the bannafee.  The chocolate dessert was...odd.  not my favorite.  The bannafee was to die for.  Seriously.  I'd die for it!! Overall great food, good service."}
{"text":"Love this place! I get the cajun chicken pasty every. single. time.  Full bar and cool church pews to sit in.."}
{"text":"A great variety of Pasties with fillings options for everyone. The only downside is they are prestuffed so what you see is what you get. Once you find the fillings you want you'll get a great, hot pie that's uses high quality ingredients. They also offer a nice variety of sides, my favorite being the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. The dinner salads are also a perfectly good choice for a dinner meal of your not feeling like a pasty. Sitting inside provided for an intimate atmosphere, but may be a little too dark for some, well maybe just me. You'll have to try it at least once if you've never been. All locations provide a similar atmosphere with the same great quality pasties."}
{"text":"The 'seating area' isn't great - my only complaint. They are 'church' pews. It is loaded with hipsters. (Take it for what you will.) - Anything I've ordered was great, the only short coming is that they run out of the 'favorites' quite often."}
{"text":"Don't go here! It is so good! Tried the cottage pie, which is beef compared the mbbaah pie. These are pretty good size pastries.....so watch out skinny peeps. 
While you are eating these....try some Communist vodka....it will make you a Boris in no time.

Great vibe inside....almost hipsterish...."}
{"text":"Walked into the Cornish Pasty around noon for lunch, the place was busy but still plenty of seating.  I've never been here before and had to order The Royale with Cheese because Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie.  I asked if I could of have it minus the mushrooms, they said no because the pasties are all pre-made.  No worries, just a heads up you get what's on the menu.  They had a Chai Cider on special for $3, it was really good!!  My Royale with Cheese was basically a cheese burger and fries wrapped up and baked into a pasty, it was delicious and I didn't even taste the mushrooms lol.  I was actually hesitant on coming here because I'm not one for calzones, and the menu just seemed heavy, but I was taken back on how yummy it was.  I'll be back and bring the wife, they had a ton of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"We visit the Cornish Pasty often and WOW!!!! We always are trying new things and always very satisfied. The staff is very friendly, never judge a book by its cover!!! The apps are great, Pasty's are great, dessert's are great, atmosphere is great, drinks are great!!! A definite must!!!"}
{"text":"It's a fabulous place to have great drinks and eat British Pastries. The oven chips are delicious. the ambience is excellent."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this restaurant! When this initially opened right around the corner from our house, we were so excited that we literally burnt ourselves out on this place! We literally went every chance we got. Now, don't eat here *too* often because the weight gain alone may deter you from what is otherwise a great restaurant. Our service is typically wonderful with some rare exceptions, our food is always delicious, and their beer selection is great for beer lovers like us. The environment is dim and cozy, but there's also an awesome patio if you don't mind smokers, bleh. 5 stars for you, Pasty!"}
{"text":"My son surprised me and took me out to lunch for Valentine's Day! First time ever been here this was his third time this week! Food and service was exceptionally good! I love how they have darts in the pool table that we could play while we waited for our lunch to be served."}
{"text":"Great food that fills you up for under $10: check.
Caramel Apple Pasty that will blow your mind: check
Side dishes big enough to share at reasonable prices: check
Old English pub ambiance with dim lighting: check.

It's no wonder this place is always packed on weekends.  Scottsdale location takes reservations last time I went, Mesa location does not."}
{"text":"After living in the southwest part of England for many years, this is the next best thing, if not improved from the original. 

Venue: I think they hit the mark with the church benches and the door tables. Its usually pretty busy on the weekends and can be hard to get somewhere to sit. They are expanding this location which is pretty rad news. The candelabra is pretty good at setting the random tone. They music is usually the hipster genre but thats ok for me. 

Appetizer: This is by far the best Mushroom Soup I have yet to find in America. Very similar to the mushroom soup you would find in most pubs in souther England. If they could add the fried bread under, it would perfect.

Food: Tried pretty much all the meat pasties. Can't go wrong with the Oggie or a shepherds pie. 

Dessert: Best bonofy pie in town. Other then me mums.

I sugest this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Very eclectic/hipster vibe the minute that you walk through the door and into the almost occult darkness which bathes every inch of the interior; think english church meets gastropub. The menu has been upgraded and is amazing; other than the well rounded english style appetizers, their main menu is based around english pasties, think really hearty hot pockets!!!! In addition to the food, I shouldn't forget to mention that they have an extremely well rounded beer and wine list; I am a beer snob and I am pleasantly surprised at all of my options!!! This is the perfect date night spot due to the fact that the food comes to the table a bit hot; remember when you ate the hot pocket fresh from the microwave?? Yeah, not smart, you will burn your tongue; so one must be cautious and allow the pasty time to cool while sitting in front of you. This would be a good time to discuss the topics of the day, or anything else that might get your mind away from the tasty smell emanating from the plate in front of your nose. Afterwards, the dessert is just as amazing as the main course; and just as unique. Tip: GET THE BANOFFEE PIE, this is as close to crack as dessert will ever get!!! If you have never been to this place, it is because the owner prides himself on the fact that the popularity is based solely on word of mouth!! The place is packed regularly and he doesn't advertise; this is because the food is the real deal."}
{"text":"Our waiter was nice and he actually talked to us. The food was great! I got the portbello mushroom pasty. :)"}
{"text":"I normally never give a one star but my experience here last Friday night has left me not wanting to ever go to this location again. The last 2 times has been horrible.  I brought an out of town friends here. My wife  ordered a pasty because she liked the sauce that it came with, she specifically asked the waitress about the sauce that came with the pasty, and the waitress said it was their most popular sauce.

After the pasty's came to the table, I noticed how small they where compared to their tempe location, for almost $10 I normally can  make two meals out of one pasty. Not at the mesa location though, it was also like this last time I went and I thought it was just a one time thing. I was wrong. 

Back to the sauce, last time they gave her a half a cup of sauce so she had to ask for more, but they were out so had to make more, which they did, but by the time it got to the table the pasty was cold. 

This time, they replaced the sauce with a gravy, and when my wife asked for the other kind they said they were out. They didnt offer to make any more and just gave her a different sauce. I would think if thats the most popular sauce and with over 2 hours left before close they would make some more? Also why didnt the waitress tell her before bringing the food to the table? She would have gotten a different pasty if she knew about the sauce.

Our desert apple pie pasty was cold, with a huge chuck of cold caramel in the middle. 

All around a bad experience and I'll never go to this location ever again. I'll be going to the tempe one, but still hesitant after this visit."}
{"text":"A 32 oz beverage!  Yes!  Stopped by for a birthday party. Everyone's having drinks, great food, and a great time.  Then Hank walked in.  Instantly started yelling about Being Irish and everyone should kiss him.  He was forcing himself on everyone, men and women. At one point he jumped on the bar and fell off.  His behavior is completely unacceptable.   I recommend Cornish Pasty Co,  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"I really like this place when i want something different from the normal food in mesa.
i think its best when its just 2 people together or the most would be 4.
Iv noticed when large groups come it backs up the kitchen so it take a bit for food to get out.
Other then that everything is great about this place."}
{"text":"Cornish Pastry is the bomb!  It seems like a cave when enter it with dark decor, but after a good beer, many to chose, you realize that this is not why you came. The food is amazing. Imagine great food turnovers stuffed in a wonderful flaky pastry. It is the American empanada. All types of food pastries even for vegetarian types. People are great. Just realize that furniture isnt fancy and place isn't well lit- however you will like the food and drink! Prices are great for what you get! You must get the banana dessert!"}
{"text":"Amazing as always! Royal With Cheese is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Definitely recommend that one. It's amazing how many times we've come to this place and they've always remained consistently great."}
{"text":"Every time I go, I get a different type of pasty.  I have yet to be disappointed.  The food is freakin' amazing!  I grew up eating pasties in Wisconsin and the Oggie is just like the ones I used to eat as a kid.  Yay!  Every time someone comes to visit, I take them here and even get the pasties to go because I crave them.  The only thing that needs improvement is the need for a hostess when it gets busy."}
{"text":"The food here is alright, however, the service is not very good. I went on a thursday night and it was pretty busy. I sat outside because that was the only area with open seating. Unfortunately I sat right by some people smoking (not the restaurant's fault, but not pleasant either). It took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and another 45 minutes to get our food. When i finally came, it was good and I like their concept, it just took too long. I was told that the pasties are premade so there can't be any substitutions in them, yet it took so long to make them.. curious. Anyway, I would give them a second chance, but as of now, they were not such a good experience."}
{"text":"Where do we even start? Cornish Pasty is one of our absolute favorite restaurants - ridiculously delicious food, great environment, and nice people. Honestly, all the pasties that we have tried have been great (favorites include chicken tikka masala, spicy asiago chicken, and the shepherd's pie) and the deserts are no exception (bread pudding and apple pasty are heavenly). The pasties are also very convenient to split and share. One piece of advice - it's pronounced pasty not paste-y!"}
{"text":"Such a unique concept that is very fresh and delicious! When I go back to AZ I always try to stop by to grab a signature pastry (the chicken pesto) before I head back home."}
{"text":"So we got here around 7:15pm, we ordered around, it took them around 50 min for them to get our food out. But the food was really good. They were kind of slamed, but we also were sitting outside. So I'm thinking if you sit outside your service will be a little slower. So I would suggest you never sit outside."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the original Tempe location of the CPC so was very happy to hear a while back that they were opening closer to Chandler in Mesa.

We arrived 2 hours after they opened and although some work was clearly still being done the service was as friendly and quick as ever.

The pasties were the same delicious taste of home that i have become addicted to and like the Tempe restaurant they have a great selection of beers.

The CPC is a breath of fresh air in an area full of chain restaurants and so I will be back for more pasties and beer for sure!

P.S This location has great outdoor seating for lazing the day away over a few beers with mates."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was wowed!  But this time not so much.....The service was terrible I mean terrible and it wasn't even busy.  What was even more maddening is that I saw the servers in the bar area chatting and messing around while all of us were waiting.  The entire time we were there we saw our waitress twice once to order and once when we asked for our check from someone else.  I couldn't even get a glass of water. 

While the food is good and the beer is great all surrounded by a great atmosphere the manager needs to make sure his or her staff is working for the customer instead of flirting with the other staff."}
{"text":"If you like excellent food, great beer on tap and all on the cheap- this is it. 

I love this place- I usually go with Lamb Vindaloo so I can get a little spice in my life and one of their amazing beers to wash it down. When that warm pocket of goodness arrives at your table, you know you made the right choice for your meal. You can even take one to go and finish cooking your pasty at home. 

All in all, this is a go to for me and my friends and you won't be disappointed if you work this place into your rotation either!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time with my gf the other day. The bangers & mash one I had was amazing, and her shepherds pie was really good too. The mint in it was a bit much for me, but she liked it. Can't wait to go back and try the others."}
{"text":"The stars say it all. Over a hundred reviews and it has 4.5 stars. You can't go wrong! I prefer this location over tempe, it seems to be less packed at busy times. I love sitting with strangers in the pews! Honestly, I wish i worked here, it has a great vibe! I see this company expanding across the valley!

Food: You can't go wrong! Almost everything comes with its unique sauce to dip in. The desert menu, i feel needs some work. The one with the bananas, yes its good, but anyone could make it at home.

BEST THING ON THE MENU!!! Sounds weird...but the baked broccoli and cauliflower appetizer. Its hot, cheesy...and healthy all at the same time!"}
{"text":"Nice homey atmosphere with couches and games. The food is great. I had the portobello mushroom and my wife had the meatball pasty both excellent.
The drink menu is large and the things we had all satisfied our taste.
Wait staff is thoughtful and service is quick if you realize the Pastys have to bake so it is definitely not fast food"}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the one in Tempe. It's less crowded and less \"cool\". I always sit at the bar, it has the most lighting in the place. The food is always on point. The music is always in good taste. I'd like to say this is one of my favorite restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I have had just about everything on the menu with the exception of their soups and man FANTASTIC.  This is definately one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"This place is really great for date night. The food is delicious the service is always great and I love the dark chill vibe. I've tried a few of the pasty's but my favorite is the Guinness stew I always order the tandoori wings and oven chips for appetizers."}
{"text":"This place is great. Even though my pasty was actually too salty (carne asada), I'm giving them four stars because the concept is refreshingly original on the AZ landscape and the service was great. The menu is not only unique and creative, it's expansive, so I know if I tried an different pasty I'm sure I would love it."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Everything is fresh, everything is really awesome. I go here on a regular. Chicken alfredo pasty with a side of alfredo sauce is amazing. Bannoffee pie is out of this world. Garlic oven chips are a perfect snack, and the tomato soup is to die for! The expansion of the chandler store is great! Always happy, even thiugh the service can get a little rediculous when its busy!"}
{"text":"I ordered on Postmates this evening. I was looking forward to a royal w/cheese and thousand island dressing. My wife ordered a shphards pie. When the food arrived there was no thousand island or gravy. I called after my delivery and was met with a lack luster apology. The concept of being asked to specify sauce on an order not receiving it just screams a lack of attention to detail. I like this place and their food has overall been good, but I'm not sure I can return after such an oversight in their service and a lack of attention to detail for their online customers; and a gross lack of understanding when they ruin a patrons dinner. I was looking forward to stuffing my fat face with gravy and thousand island dressing, but you ruined my experience and expressed that you don't care.

Sincerely,  A Dissatisfied Customer"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum Yum!  Its a fun and unique type of restaurant. The Pastys are great and they have so many different types.  There seriously is one for everyone.  I personally love the Bangers and Mash.  They do take a while to cook.  But that gives you a chance to order the scotch eggs which are very nice!  Dessert order early and enjoy!  Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is just dirty. Everywhere you touch it is sticky and unclean. I went with friends and we were all unimpressed by their pastys. We even got the pb and j dessert because it sounded so good but when we got it it was underwhelming. I will return one more time to try the tomato soup so hopefully it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"love at first bite?   i would say so! 

i had no idea this place would turn my horrible mood into smiles and sunshine,(something only skittles can do) or that the pasties would be something i've been dreaming about for the last few weeks! 

not being able to choose between the zillion and ten differant choices, i decided to wing it at the last minute and got the meat and cheese pasty, while my boyfriend opted with the shepards pie.  i cannot get this thing out of my mind! it was loaded with sausage and cheese and came with the red wine gravy everyones going  on about!  the boyfriend was also very impressed with his and says he cant wait to go back!  we also had the jalapeno chips, which are actually like steak fries. Those are also delicious!   The only negative was that it was sooo packed, we had to wait forever to be seated and get our food.  but hey, with the amazing food they have, its def ok!!!  see you soon CPC! :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was so amazing! Never had a pasty before so we ordered two, the portobello/chicken and the oggie and both were so good. The atmosphere is really cute and the service was great. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beers, especially microbrews and specialty beers.  The selection of pasties is even more impressive.  If you don't know what a pasty is, it is very similar to a calzone, or huge empanadas that is baked.  They filling run the gamut from traditional pasty fillings like \"bangers and mash\", chicken vindaloo, Mediterranean and latino inspired dishes.  They even offer vegetarian versions of most of their meat-based pasties.  We started with cream of leek, potato and Stilton cheese soup, which was creamy and tastey, with just a hint of bitterness from the Stilton cheese.  I had more traditional shepherd's pie with minted lamb, potatoes, carrots and peas.  It came with a gravy that went well with the pasty.  The crust was flaky with a lovely toasting.  My husband ordered the Carne Avodada which was flavorful and spicy and came with sour cream and pico de gallo.  

The ambience is what you would expect in an British pub.  There is a mixture of small tables and long trestle tables with very few booths.  They have candles in wine bottles at the trestle tables, which makes reading the menu a bit difficult for us older folks.  They do have seating outside with misters for hot weather.  The waitress we had was knowledgeable about both the beers and the menu, helping me choose a dark ale and letting me know that the chicken vindaloo was the spiciest dish on their menu.  We have gone here once before with friends and would love to bring our kids here sometime in the future.  As an added bonus for me, there were no TVs that I could see, which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in restaurants.  The only criticism I have is that the music was too loud for my preference, though I did enjoy the selection of music."}
{"text":"OK, decent beer selection, but no local beer on tap?  Whats with that?Place has a nice ambience but can be rather claustrophobic, service is good somtimes, and absolutley terrible on other occasions. Some of the pasties are not as good as they sound and can be quite dry.  Be careful when ordering.  The original classic pasty is always a good bet. Good yet short happy hour & a creative atlternative to the average corner pub. Could be better, could be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pasty stuffed with ground beef, French fries, onions, melted Swiss Cheddar blend, and it was DELICIOUS. They're so big, my friend and I (both of us girls) split one, so it was only $4.50 each. I also got the mushroom spinach soup, which comes with homemade (I think) bread and butter, and the soup was warm, thick, and not too creamy. We finished off with the Shirley Temple for dessert, an amazing toffee, chocolatey bread pudding that comes with a white cream you can stir into it. Restaurant is pretty dark inside, and they play loud Indie music, so I wouldn't go with a client or boss, but with friends, it's great. Just the right volume so you can notice the music, but still have a conversation."}
{"text":"The food was great - hearty, hot and tasty. I had the peppered steak pasty and my dining partner had one of the pasties with the red wine gravy. The \"chips\" were just okay (we had them with garlic and jalapeno, next time we will try just garlic). Our server was friendly and attentive.

Please note that this is the only one of the three locations that is Yelp classified only as \"British\" and not also as \"Pub\". This seemingly minor detail seems to be not so minor after all:
     - Both of the English ales on draft were not available (we wanted English beers with our pasties! Had to settle for a German hefe...)
    - While the restaurant was pretty busy, the bar was practically empty. I have never seen so many grown adults ordering lemonade in my life (welcome to Mesa!)
   - We were really looking forward to playing darts, but unfortunately a family of four (2 adults and 2 small children) was hogging BOTH sets of darts AND the pool table next to the darts

SO, if you are wanting a place to drink lemonade and teach your young children how to hang out in a bar and play billiards & cricket, this location is for you (there were other families lining up for Billiards while we were there). If you are wanting more of a British Pub type scene to go with your British food, I would try one of the other two locations (which we will be doing next time we crave the goodness of a Cornish Pasty)."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I only order the cottage pie or bangers and mash. They have like 100 different types of pasties, but I've come to realize that the more traditional ones are the safer way to go. Plus I'm an Irish girl and I love meat and potatoes.
I prefer this location to the Tempe one. It's much larger and the service is a lot friendlier. Plus the patio is amazing. Also, the Tempe one has been \"expanding\" forever and it feels as tho it will never be done."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience. Wait staff was friendly an efficient and the food was fantastic. Loved the pilgrim. Even brought one home."}
{"text":"Each time I come here is as great as the first. I'm always trying a new item and they have great vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here today... neither of us had eaten here but she had heard good things about it.   

We decided to eat family style and try a salad and a pasty.  Ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad and the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty.

The Chicken Tikka Salad deserves 5 stars.  What a taste treat!  Loved the spicy tikka masala with the crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of red onions.  Nice contrast of hot and cold, spicy and mild.  And the mint yogurt dressing... spectacular.  Wonderful companion to the chicken and provided a \"cool\" contrast to the spiciness of the Tikka.  Kept in theme with the Indian spices with a modern salad dressing twist.  Excellent.  I'd love the have this salad often!  I was rather disappointed in the pasty.  The chicken was rather dry and I found it heavy on the thyme.  Veggies in it were tender and well cooked.  The crust was lovely:   light, flaky and flavorful.  I'd give this pasty a 3.  

Service was good (a bit slow bringing the check at the end), ambiance had a British Isles pub feel.  Good experience over all and I'll be back for the Chicken Tikka Salad and to give a different pasty a try."}
{"text":"I was recently visiting Arizona and my friends recommended to check this place out.  While it's definitely hipster-tastic, the food and the atmosphere are a welcome change from my childhood memories about dining in Arizona.

I've never had a pasty before, and I'm not even sure this is authentic if that's your merit of restaurant judgment.  But I can say that most of the food here didn't disappoint and I went back there a couple of times during my stay.

Both the Royal and the Shepard's Pie pasties were delicious.  The crust was solid but still flakey.  Not overcooked or tasteless.  The sides (curried potatoes and cauliflower casserole thingie) we tried were alright but I wouldn't order them again.  The beer selection is pretty varied and reasonably priced with a good happy hour.  Atmosphere was comfortable.  Patio was well appointed with fans and a corner of smoking hipsters."}
{"text":"Was here for sister's birthday party. On a Friday night. When it's packed because it's a bar and it's Friday night. They don't appreciate a large group on a Friday night, even when you tell them in advance you're coming. Unfortunately at first the service was so slow some of the party-goers had to leave. At my table (we took 3), it went fairly quickly. However the server said he couldn't separate checks, but WE could separate them ourselves at the end and he would ring up as many different cards as needed. So basically he wanted us to do his job. 

On the food side- yum! I had the salmon pasty, and it was really good. Though I was expecting a little more to it for the price, it was still filling. The salads were pretty good size. This is why I give it three stars, the food is really good. I would come back, but maybe for lunch when it's a different atmosphere. Husband said he wouldn't, but he's not into the bar scene and he didn't like the smoking out on the patio. I didn't see anyone smoking, but he said he could smell it."}
{"text":"Two words: I'm addicted. I've been to Cornish pasty about 4 or 5 times now since I've discovered it and to this location about half of those times. Every time I come here I am delighted by the aromas and the menu options are always enticing, however I usually stick with the pilgrim because as I said earlier, I'm addicted. 
The atmosphere is so grunge, dark and even the people working there are not your average joes, which I love. I always get a very interesting waiter and have a consistently good meal. Actually, it's beyond good, it's mouth watering amazing. The pastry always tastes fresh and is baked to perfection, and whatever you order to go inside of it is ALWAYS piping hot! The wine sauce is to die for as well, so don't be suh with it!
And if you're still hungry by the time you're finished with your entree, which is almost impossible I've come to learn, the dessert menu looks incredible and I've had the peanut butter and jelly pasty (not as ordinary as it sounds) and it was a lovely way to end the meal!
I would recommend this place to anyone who loves comfort food, so basically everyone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch on their patio. The weather has been perfect for al fresco dining. I was surprised at how extensive their menu is. It was hard to choose because everything sounded so delicious! I ended up ordering the portobello chicken while my boyfriend ordered the lamb and mint. The portobello chicken's combination of flavors was excellent! It went so well with its side of marinara sauce. Lamb and mint was okay. We both definitely preferred the portobello chicken. The pie itself was yummy. I'd love to come back and try more of their pasties.

Side note: If you didn't know like me, this \"pasty\" is pronounced \"pas-tee\", not \"pey-stee\". They're two totally different meanings and you don't want to get funny looks when you're trying to order."}
{"text":"This is one of my parents' favorite little gems, and I can see why.  The ambiance is great, a good pub feel to it.  Their fresh baked bread is amazing.  They have an amazing selection of pasties, from traditional to inventive.  Not a bad one in the menu.  They have a great selection of vegan/vegetarian pasties.  The only downside is that pasties don't really lend themselves to gluten-free eaters.  Not the best place for anyone with a gluten intolerance/allergy.  Who would want to sit and eat a salad when everyone else is devouring a delicious pasty?  Oh well.  It's almost a perfect place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been coming here over the past year, each time bringing my Colorado friends, and one word sums it all:  YUM!  

The menu is vast and the flavor is always amazing.  Seating is quite limited but that just means this place is widely-loved.  The servers are usually lovely unless it's closing time.  More than once, the lights would suddenly become blinding, the music will be switched to death metal, and the volume would go up to borderline-deafening.  That's never a good way to get customers to leave so that docks off a star."}
{"text":"Parliament wings had great flavor but was surprised at how small they were. The Royale with cheese was tasty and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Was visiting the area on Memorial Day looking to move back to the Valley from Texas. 
I grew up in Michigan and could not believe when we drove by and the sign said \"Cornish Pasty Co\"! 
We had just came from Shakespears English pub (to try the fish and chips), and had to turn around and go back to the Pasty Co. 

My mother and I ordered a to go order of \"Oggies\" the traditional pasty they have in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with steak, rutabaga, onions, and potatoes), we were offered drinks while we waited (we didn't want anything) and went outside to wait. 
Us \"downstaters\" or (Trolls-people who live below the Mackinac bridge in MI.)  go to the U.P. on vacation and its always a treat to get these there. The UP'ers eat them with ketchup, I don't care for that.

Service at the Cornish Pasty Co. was great-everyone was very friendly, awesome atmosphere, varied menu for all tastes. 
My brother then came in with me after a few minutes to see the place and we were again offered drinks while we waited for our order-very friendly service. We heated the pasties up later at the hotel and they were great. 
When I move I will definitely be back, and so will my other family members."}
{"text":"I love all the food here. It's amazing! The service is great and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Thank you. I love this place."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Pasty in Mesa for years, soon after it first opened. We now particularly love to take our out of town guests. It has a casual outdoor patio, perfect for those who are escaping the winter weather and want to make the most of being in Arizona. Plus, pretty much anyone can find something they like, regardless of the kind of food they are craving, since they have such a wide variety of flavors. They also have an excellent selection of beers. 

I decided to finally write this review because we had such a great server - Laurin - on a Sunday evening in March of 2015. She was an absolute sweetheart and gave us just the right amount of attention. We enjoyed a lovely meal, drinks and ambiance as always, and it was made that much better by Laurin's wonderful service."}
{"text":"I love the variety and they make a pretty awesome- and very drool worthy - Shepard's Pie! It's one of my favorite foods that I often find myself craving randomly. My complaint though : tight seating so it always feel over crowded to a point you wonder if fire code is being broken. So I bribe friends (buy their dinner as well) into grabbing me a to-go box because going in person gives me too much anxiety with the amount of people that always seem to be there."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great drinks, and very entertaining staff. 

The mushroom soup is spectacular! The bread served on the side is heavenly.

Try the banoffee pie. Do it! Even if you are full, order one to go!!! You will not regret. 

It can be very entertaining if you sit at the bar where they prepare and cook your dinner.

One of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Came in today about 130 pm and it was not packed but definitely a bit busy. We were told to seat ourselves and found a cute little table and were greeted immediately (I looked for the servers name on the check and it said Super M..lol) She was absolutely wonderful. The little guy wanted only ice cream and she offered chocolate chips for a topping. He loved it as he's pretty picky. I got the traditional steak and potatoes pasty which was delicious. I also tried the leek and stilton cheese soup which was served with fresh bread. Also, very good. Not really anything spectacular but all was very good. We took the banoffee pie to go and loved it as well."}
{"text":"Went to CPC last night for the first time. I really wanna like this place, but left with just kind of an \"eh\" feeling. It has a cool vibe in a gritty kind of way. Almost all the employees are pierced and tatted up. The juke box was continuously playing hard rock. The church pews are a very cool touch.

I like the location, decor, and ample patio seating. Staff seemed friendly enough, although my waitress never came to check on us after bringing our food - a major pet peeve of mine.

Now for the food. Hubby ordered the peppered steak pasty and it was delicious. I got the chicken greek and it was just ok. Needed a little something more, maybe feta cheese or more kalamata olives. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. Hubby was thrilled with the generous beer selection. I just had water with lemon. WARNING: the water tastes terrible! I had to add about 4 lemon wedges in order to make it even palatable.

I think we will try CPC again, just based on the reviews here on Yelp. I feel like maybe we went on an \"off\" night, or maybe I need to try a more traditional pasty. We'll see."}
{"text":"Used to love this place until the last two times where my friend and I went and literally were not even greeted or acknowledged. No menus, no waters, no server. In fact, as I'm writing this we are just coming from walking out of the place after 15 - 20 minutes of sitting there with no server. Very unorganized and slow. The worst part is that the cooks saw us sit there and knew we haven't been helped. It was a Monday night and it wasn't too busy. No excuses. Hope they get their shit together."}
{"text":"A friend told me he was taking me somewhere \"interesting.\" Understatement of the year. The atmosphere was rich, the food was great, the service was friendly and the music was phenomenal. I don't know how they choose their tunes but it was the perfect soundtrack to a unexpectedly pleasant evening. I don't like to use the word \"hip,\" but there's almost no better word to describe the experience. This is a great place to take friends and/or family.

Since the pasty's are cut in half, my friend and I decided to order something different and then split. Seeing as it is November and Thanksgiving is just around the corner, we went with 'The Pilgrim' (roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing), and to see how they handle mainstream, we also got the 'Royale With Cheese' - yes, that is an amazing name. It's essentially 'their cheeseburger.'

I had half of each, two glasses of Kronenbourg 1664, and I must say it was one of the best meals I have had in a restaurant in some time. The service was incredible - friendly, personal, and quick - and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to everyone I know, as tempting as it is to keep such a wonderful location as \"our little secret.\""}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty may be my favorite restaurant of all time. It's great for grabbing a delicious bite with good friends, sitting at a quiet bar after a brutal day at work, and a great spot for a first date. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at our new favorite dinning spot in Mesa... The Cornish Pasty Company.  Not only is the food DELICIOUS,  you also get great service and a friendly place to visit.  I guarantee you will be back as often as possible.  I would highly recommend a visit to enjoy an evening out with friends or family.  And don't forget to ask for Aaron, if he has time ask him to preform some magic.  I can also suggest that for desert, get the chocolate bread pudding with ice creme.  Had a fun time this evening... can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch and late nights with friends. the pasties are all super flavorful and they have a pretty great selection of beverages...not too big or too small. Because they bake the pasties once they are ordered, it does take a little longer than some other lunch options, but it is always worth it!"}
{"text":"I had heard a ton of yelp buzz and really wanted to go but had been put off because of the distance from my house and some poor reviews of the waitstaff.   I am seriously regretting getting put off!  

At first we walked in and I felt sort of out of place, that faded quickly though.  I wish I had gotten the waitress's name because she was AWESOME, everyone was.  We sat near the cooks and it was great.  I checked out the porch seating and was impressed with the heating system they had out there, nice and warm on a very cool (for the valley) night.  The staff that were off for the night were eating and having drinks out on the porch and they were all so friendly!  We didn't have a single case of snobby or feeling ignored.

I got the Shepard's Pie (with the minted lamb).  It was great.  Perfectly made and the red wine sauce was great!  They didn't have any coconut rum so our waitress asked for a different drink order, in the end we decided to do a Long Island Ice Tea and adding pineapple juice since I originally wanted a Surfer on Acid, in short it was so good that I could have had 6 (and ended up on the floor) but been a very happy camper.  We also tried the Mushy Peas and Garlic Fries which were fantastic!

I will be going back ASAP!  I can't wait to take my Foodie Dad there!"}
{"text":"Came in the evening very busy place and loud.  Fun Place with its decor.  Lively people.. Most of the Menu is all about the Pasty... I ordered four, had two gave away the other two - I was all Pasty out by the second one.. Feels like a fancy hot pocket with fresh ingredients.  I ordered the meat & cheese which is nice if your craving something cheesy.  Also had the Sheppard pie which has a nice smooth potatoes flavor with meat.. These are nice for Sharing since they cut them in half and the sauce they have is real nice.. I had the red wine sauce with both.. Good.. Each pasty is under $10, good deal and these good to eat on the go.. I Also ordered the Strawberry Pavola $5, Only came with Strawberries no grapes or kiwi's as it suppose too.. The meringue shell was good, the sauce was sweet but I would go easy on it, the cream was so - so but overall good can be too sweet if you top too much sauce and cream...  Not sure if I would return, even though it was good but not enough for me to be wowed.."}
{"text":"I must say I was skeptical at first. The name didn't exactly draw me in--wasn't sure what a pasty was anyway. And when someone explained it to me, I was like, \"Ew-I don't know about this.\" Well let's say I was very wrong! Pasties are the yummiest things ever. I dream about the Veggie Greek. Their mushroom walnut soup with fresh baked bread on the side is divine. The desserts...OMG, so amazing. Try the Shirley Temple pudding if you're a toffee lover, or the chocolate bread pudding if you're a chocolate lover. I happen to be both! The staff is friendly and takes good care of you. The location in Mesa is definitely bigger with more tables available, but we go to the one in Tempe too because it's closer to work. My only complaint, and perhaps why I didn't go with 5 stars is the way the first come-first serve seating works, especially at Mesa, because there will be a party of 2 taking up one of the huge booths (made with real church pews--how cool is that?) even when there are smaller tables available, and then our party of 4-6 will have to hang around and wait. But it is always worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"This place was good all around. Food, drinks, service all very good. Seat yourself and the wait staff finds their way to you without any prompts. Atmosphere is like a old English pub in a way. Serving sizes are okaaaayyyy but if you like to chow down when going out, double your order. There's a reason this place has good reviews, it's different and good, try it out!"}
{"text":"Best Food Ever. The giant glasses of Strongbow are a plus as well. Love the staff too :) I even had my 25th Birthday party here!"}
{"text":"Usually I take a while to go back and contemplate a few days over an experience at a restaurant, but today's meal was so delicious, I am writing a review right away.  I went to the Cornish Pasty for lunch.  I drove from the Northern part of Mesa, so it was a good 25 minute drive each way for lunch.  I was hoping for the best to drive that far and take a longer lunch.

The menu was very diverse and suited many types of cravings.  They had everything in the pasty from chicken pot pie to chicken tikka massala.  I would like to try one of those one day, but I opted for the portobello vinagrette.  It came with a piping hot side of marinara sauce that had some fresh garlic cut into the sauce.  When I took that first bite, I felt like I was in heaven.  The serving size is very good and I got pretty full from one pasty.  If I had room for more, they had dessert pasties as well, such as a caramel apple.

Well worth the drive, and I will definitely make a visit to the Tempe location closer to home."}
{"text":"I'm so torn! We LOVE the food here and have tried many different things on the menu. I have Cornish mining ancestors, so pasties have a special place in my heart. 

However, the service is never great. It's usually okay, so we just deal with it, but our last trip was awful. Our waiter was extremely inattentive. He never refilled our drinks, could never be found, and our food took over an hour to arrive. Two out of three pasties were only delivered when we flagged down a random waitress to help us out. Then it took another 5-10 minutes for another random waiter to bring our third pasty. Then, of course, we sat around for literally 15 minutes with empty plates in front of us, waiting to pay. 

I wish this place would improve its service. The food is easily five stars, but the overall experience can be a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. Sit at a table, or long top with church pew seats. Jameson bottles with candles. Sounds flaky, but it seems fitting here.
Had lunch, got there early and had great service by a dread locked gent who was friendly.
Can't go wrong with the traditional \"oggie\", beef and potatoes, onion and turnip. Had the Scotch egg app while waiting for our pasties, pretty good.
Lots of choices, interesting apps, I want to go back and try everything."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home!

Great beers, bottled and on tap, and the menu (well at least the dessert menu) is exactly what my grandma cooks for Sunday lunches. 

The chocolate bread and butter pudding is one of the best I've ever had, and I consider myself a connoisseur. It's got brandy in it. Ask for it with creme anglais and ice cream.

\"Get in my belly\""}
{"text":"My husband and I couldn't decide where to go for our 16 year anniversary, and went back and forth for awhile. I mentioned going to the Cornish Pasty Company again, and hubby jumped in the car. We like to sit at the bar because there is just this really chill but fun vibe up there. The tenders always have a suggestion for us, and have no problem letting us taste a sample before ordering a tap beer. He got the Royale which is MY favorite, while I tried the Bit of Salmon. So freaking good! Tons of flavor in both, but I think the Salmon is my new fave. To drink he had the Union Jack IPA in a 32 (I think) ounce, and I had my favorite Not Your Dads Root Beer. We had a great time, and were very satisfied. No it wasn't fancy wining and dining, but it tickled our fancy and we spent our 16th anniversary relaxing and enjoying ourselves. Best of all for my husband was the music. A great assortment of metal for my headbanger, lol. We'll most certainly be back."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue update. I mostly eat at the Tempe location and I think the last couple of times I came to this one with my hubby we sat outside. So when I met up with friends here a couple months ago I was surprised that they had so much more space than they used to. Even though they keep expanding their locations and opening new ones, the food at Cornish Pasty Co has remained consistently good. The four of us ordered four different pasties and asked them to cut them in fourths so we could each try all four. Everyone agreed that they were all delicious. I have been slowly eating my way thru the menu and I have never tasted one that I didn't like. Our service that night was also great and the food came out quickly. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Wow Lamb Vindaloo was so good, but a bit spicy. We will definitely be back for more. Desert was way to sweet for my taste but still good"}
{"text":"Amazing and more amazing. The atmosphere was unique and inviting. Food was incredibly delicious. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company, pronounced \"Pass-tee,\" has two locations. The Mesa, Arizona site is the larger of them. The other location is in Tempe, Arizona, close to Arizona State University and the size of a small hallway. Both offer the same menu, but the wait time for seating is better in Mesa. 

The only negative is that it takes a long time for the food to come, once ordered. However, the wait is worth it.  The food is tasty and priced low and everything is homemade, from the grinding of the various meats to the rolling of the pastry."}
{"text":"This place was great!  I love Pastys but many times they are a little dry. Not these, moist throughout. With these the crust nor the meat was ever tough but just right! Great flavor.  My companions loved the sauce but mine was so good I didn't even try it."}
{"text":"We've tried to like this place so much, but the service here is without a doubt the WORST experience we've ever had. We love the food, but we cannot justify coming to this location even though we live within walking distance.

In the 8 times we've been here we've never been pleased. The first time we came there was a hair in our pasty. They were unapologetic and didn't even offer to comp the meal. They expected us to pay for it when they brought the bill to us. I had to ASK for the pasty with the hair in it to be removed.

Another time we came with a group of about 10. We called ahead and were seated outside. It took us over 30 min to get a waitress out to take our drink orders, an hour to get our food, and then ANOTHER hour to get our bills. A lot of us had children and it made for a frustrating even. Again, they were completely unapologetic and made us feel like we were a hassle for the wait staff.

After so many poor experiences, we resorted to doing take out since we can literally see the building from our backyard (we live that close). We've had them lose our order twice. We've gone to pick it up and they didn't even have record we called in. Still frustrating, but the food is so good we thought we'd give it a shot.

My wife is now pregnant and had a craving for the Cajun pasty (so delicious), so I tried calling  in to place an order so I could pick it up on the way home. I called and the phone was busy, no problem. I tried back 5 minutes later, still busy. Okay, I understand, it's busy sometimes. I called about 5 minutes later and the phone rang... and rang... and rang. I waited with the phone ringing for ANOTHER 5 minutes. No answer. I hung up and called back, and they let it ring again. Luckily, I work kind of close to the location in Tempe. I called them, they answered on the first ring, took my order, and were a delight when I went to pick it up.

If you want to enjoy your food make it a point to go to the location in Tempe, or really any location OTHER than the one here in Mesa.

We've even complained to the management at this location and they don't care whatsoever. Don't bother with this place. Go to Tempe and get a Cajun and a Banoffee for dessert."}
{"text":"Ordered the cup of potato leek soup, cottage pie and chicken pesto pasty.

First up, that was waaaayyyy more than enough food for two people (as it turned out we took most of the cottage pie pasty home).

The soup was real good.  I'd go back just to have that alone.

The cottage pie pasty (I at least took a bite before boxing it up) was also good.

The chicken pesto pasty was...ok.  The chicken, veggies and cheese we good.  The pesto was meh.  Beyond being meh there was way to much of it, which in turn really impacted the flavor of the pasty.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't order this one again.

With the above being said, I still liked the place and will return to try other things."}
{"text":"This is my go-to-place, its for real good.. Alright, they have 32 ounce IPAs and Guiness for like $8/$9. 

 The atmosphere is feels neat: tables are glass encased doors, most the lighting is candles. The music is like a good iheart radio station.

 Two pool tables for free use.

Now, the food. If you're not familiar with their pastys, they're like gordon ramseys take on hot pockets. Get the red wine sauce with it.
Bangers and mash, sheppards pie, cuban chipotle. Try different stuff, tho."}
{"text":"I like the place Set up. The candles are very hipster romantic. 

They just should add more tables for small groups.  

And make the cookers to wear beard net.  I saw two of the cookers with long beards with no net.  

Other than that food is very delicious they have a lot of options to chooses from and they are really good.  

The service is good too."}
{"text":"This location is much larger than the Tempe location, but parking is still a bit of an issue.

We definitely prefer the ambience of the Mesa location to that of the Tempe location.  Perhaps it is because we could actually see everything clearly in the restaurant versus the darkness of the Tempe store.

There is also a nice, large patio that is equipped with heat lamps for the cooler months.  That is a definite plus.

The only reason I am not upping this to 5 stars is we found our food portions to be about 3/4 the size (or less) of the pasties at the Tempe location.  It was strange.  Everyone noticed the difference.  Whereas we had ample leftovers at the Tempe location, none of us had leftovers at the Mesa location.

The size of the food was adequate, it just was not what we expected.  We were still hungry even though we ordered an appetizer.  That is really unlike us!

Still, the food was delicious.  We will definitely be visiting this location again soon.

Also, it should be noted that the waitstaff was extremely friendly and helpful in selecting our pasties.  This is a definite advantage over the waitstaff at the Tempe location that just wanted to rush us into ordering without offering up any suggestions."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for ages now and finally we were in the area so we went.  We drove around the stupid little shopping area forever just trying to find the restaurant until we discovered that the address is slightly misleading.  In case this happens to you, it is facing Dobson and a little bit south of Guadalupe.  

I absolutely loved the decor of the restaurant, very minimalist, lots of black and white with a really eclectic mix of old, new, and industrial furnishings.  I really liked the church pews for the booths.  They could stand to have a better air conditioning system because the fairly open kitchen and the constant opening and closing of the ovens makes it get warm inside pretty quickly.

The food I thought was fantastic.  The menu has a TON of different pasties to choose from, so there is definitely something on the menu for everyone, even vegetarians.  I chose the meat and cheese pasty which was pork sage sausage with a couple different cheeses inside.  When it came out, it looked beautifully golden brown on the outside.  I really really liked the pastry portion.  The inside was equally as good too.  The sausage was really delicious.  It was simple but so full of flavor.  My main gripe about this place is that they don't make the pasties fresh.  I watched the guys in the kitchen pull them out of the refrigerator/freezer.  However, even though this happens, they still taste delicious and fresh.  They probably just make them the morning of, as I can imagine they are quite time consuming to prepare.  Great place!"}
{"text":"We are huge Pasty fans and go to the Guadalupe Road location at least once a month. This past weekend we used them for catering. We picked up 60 assorted Pasties and warmed them up on location for 15 minutes and Voila! just as good as at the restaurant! It was a huge hit at my daughter's rehearsal dinner. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Although I go to both locations frequently, I think I like the atmosphere of this one a little better. I'm in love with everything on the menu; specifically the Garlic Mashed Potatoes and The Mexican pasty. I have yet to find anything I dislike about this place. Service is always good, a decent beer and wine selection, not overly priced, and a unique ambiance. The works!"}
{"text":"I ain't got nothing bad to say about this place except I didn't go sooner. 

My kid and I were looking for a lunch this past June and rolled by this place about a mile from our house. I was curious and headed in. We really weren't sure what to expect but since I've spent some time in the UK, I was intrigued.

The atmosphere is very cool. Industrial type metal tables, with candles burning on the tables and long wooden church pews for people to share tables.

The waitresses (we've been back since) are really cool and completely unique from each other. 

My kid had a PB&J pasty, and I ordered the Cajun Chicken. I loved mine, and hers was so big she couldn't finish it. The next time I got the Rosemary Chicken, which I love almost as much as they Cajun. I am a picky eater but both of these were awesome. 

They do take a little time to cook your food, which means it's fresh. And if you call ahead you can special order (like no onions or whatever). They also deliver within a few miles of their location (including my house and MCC where I work!). 

I hear the desserts rock, too!

I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Any meal you can imagine wrapped up in a flaky, buttery crust!  Every Pasty I have had is delicious.  Great atmosphere, great food and great local beer.  And you can even get half-baked Pastys to take home with you to bake later.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"This place is so unique and has such a cool menu, it has been a go to restaurant since it opened. The best entree I believe is the lamb vindaloo and a side of the mashed potatoes. Love having that with a Chimay at the bar"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. It reminds me of a grown up hot pocket ( but not gross lol). I've had both the vegetarian and meaty pasties and they are awesome! Good fresh made lemonade and iced tea too. If you like meatless I would highly recommend the Veggie Rosemary Chicken pasty with mustard sauce, my favorite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to have family lunches at the Mesa location on weekends.  With 2 toddlers, we are very picky about where we go eat.  At this place the staff is always great to the kids, and the food is always excellent.  I love the booths outside, which provide enough privacy (just in case the kids get a little bit loud) but still let you enjoy the sunlight.  We've been there about 5 times in the last 1.5 months and there's been only one pasty that wasn't excellent, can't recall which one.  I'm not a big fan of the side dishes, I'd recommend passing on them and just having pastys.  And the service is a little bit slow, but I understand how the food is made, so I just go ready to hang out and relax.  If the kids are having a bad day, we pass."}
{"text":"Introduced to pasties on a trip to Bath, England, we were keen to try this multi-cultural adaptation.  We tried to stay close to the British side of things with my husband getting the roast beef pasty, while I opted for the lamb vindaloo.  While the food was OK, I was disappointed that the meats weren't more tender.   The service was outstanding (we were there late on a Saturday afternoon) but the noise level of the Led Zepplin made it hard to talk.  I know this might appeal to the pub crowd, but it was enough to make us not want to return to try other menu items.  Ambience matters."}
