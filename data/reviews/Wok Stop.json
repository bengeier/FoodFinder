{"text":"Ordered delivery from wok stop and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. The general tso chicken was absolutely delicious and I love to fried rice! Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and was very hot. Shanghai noodles were a little bland but everything else was great."}
{"text":"Found hair in 2/4 things I ordered. 

Weird taste in the batter - ordered sweet and sour and General Tso and I didn't enjoy the after taste. 

Delivery was good, food arrived hot. Not ordering again.. better places to order from."}
{"text":"Had delivery from Wok Stop today. Food was delivered hot and in less than 1 hour. Tasted very good and freshly made. Big portions and they included a whole bunch of fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery using uber eat app, food didn't taste good. Ordered fried shrimp and tom yum soup, shrimp was ok but tom yum did not taste like tom yum soup that we eat in other chinese restaurant. Also the sauce was not sufficient for number of shrimps.
Only reason I gave it 2 stars because delivery was quick, before estimated delivery time, and food was hot."}
{"text":"Was here a few week ago with friends for general tso's chicken and fried cheese wonton.  The restaurant was clean and the food was delicious. We stayed so long chatting and enjoying the food, we gonna come back again."}
{"text":"Was working from home today and decided to order delivery. There are not many options on UberEats and I really felt like Chinese. I came across Wok Stop and my initial gut reaction was to move on. After reading some Google and Yelp reviews I decided to take a chance.

I ordered Broccoli with Beef, Yeung Chow Fried Rice and Fried Chicken Wings. In short, it was edible but \"very disappointing\". This wasn't authentic Chinese food and while it looked appetizing the flavours were way off. The chicken wings however were good, so I'll give them that. I'm not really sure what to make of this place. The food wasn't really of the Manchu Wok westernized variety so I can only guess that this is might be authentic-style Chinese done very poorly.

I definitely won't be eating at this place again. If you're looking for good Chinese in Scarborough stick to places like these: Perfect Chinese Restaurant, Congee Queen, Fairview Seafood Chinese Cuisine, Congee King, Dragon Centre restaurants and Foodcourts."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experience ever at this location.  I was in the mood for Chinese food and decided to stop here for a bite to eat. I ordered off the lunch menu chicken wings with chicken fried rice. When my order was ready i ask for barbecue sauce which i had to pay an extra $1.50 for. The guy in the back poured the sauce in a wok then added water to it i then noticed him adding something that looks like salt to it then i asked what it was they said it was sugar. I then proceeded to cancel the order for the barbecue sauce and was refunded.  The food was the worst i ever had."}
{"text":"The food for the price was good. But their was so strange taste to it. I got sick after. Very oily and just stays in your stomach for hours. Had a bad experince. Took long time to deliver. Truly better asian restarants nearby."}
