{"text":"Ordered some chicken Bhoona and curried vegetables for delivery. Pros: delivery time was reasonable, delivery man was polite and friendly, vegetables were fresh, not frozen. Cons: Sauces were not particularly flavorful or at all spicy, despite being listed as moderately spicy and portions were small (for about 20$ before tax, I got approximately 1/2 a chicken breast and less than 2 cups of cooked vegetables, between the 2 dishes).  Meh is exactly right"}
{"text":"Excellent! Cuisine traditionnelle et service courtois. Un restaurant indien à fréquenter régulièrement. 
Ambiance très agréable.

{"text":"We took a lamb tikka massala and vegetables korma. These two dishes are classic indian food... But none of them tasted like usual tikka masala and korma. Both plates were TOO sweet... Like they add TOO much sugar. Tika massala was like a ketchup sauce. Vegetables korma... There were almost not veggies, too much cream and really too much added sugar. It is normal to add in some plate a bit of sugar but we had to ask another plate with less sugar. Even the regular nan was really sweet like a \"brioche\". I think it is just their way to cook but we won't go back there. Service was not bad."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend who had a gift certificate and we figured we'd give it a go. This place used to be called the Salon Rouge, which I believe used to be a French cuisine restaurant?... but that closed down in record time, even for the typical short restaurant life span in Verdun. Next thing you know, the Taj Mahal pops up in it's place. Except they didn't change anything but the sign... so don't let the gaudy Moulin Rouge-style décor throw you off, I swear it's Indian food and not a red light district brothel.

They offer a pretty good selection of appetizers, single dishes and combo meals for 1 or 2 people in both meat and veggie options, all priced very reasonably. Everything I had (veg) was tasty and my friend said the butter chicken was up to par in her books, although just short of mindblowing. My only complaint is the naan bread. They make the slightly sweetened variation of it, which was still good, but I prefer plain naan. However, a redeeming factor and saving grace was their cheese naan... I'm a sucker for fromage.

The staff were super friendly and attentive, like you-can-tell-they-are-a-new-restaurant-keener friendly, and were more than happy to wrap up our leftovers in doggy bags. They also do orders for pick up and take out and you can BYOW. Word of warning... the combos are A LOT of food. With a crispy toasted tortilla-ish thingy and chutney to snack on, an appetizer and then 2 dishes with rice... I didn't even make a dent in mine. So I might recommend just going with a single dish option if you go for dinner. If you order take out for two people a combo for one person will be more than enough food.

The mango smoothie drink. Just do it. In your mouthhole.

Although it still doesn't quite beat Mother India back in Toronto, it was delicious and I'd definitely go back if not just order in. Pretty stoked to have them in my hood."}
{"text":"Le restaurant a une ambiance plus ou moins typique de l'Inde. Le service est affreusement long et aucun des serveurs n'avaient le sourire. Nous avons patienté légèrement plus d'une heure à avoir nos repas et nous avons même dû demander à faire remplir nos verres d'eau. Les saveurs étaient présentes, mais rien de super. Arrivé pour payer, le serveur me chargeait des trucs que je n'avais pas commander et il a refait ma facture à deux reprises. Je ne retournerai pas à ce restaurant pour plusieurs des raisons mentionné ci-haut, mais la principale raison est qu'au coin de Verdun et 3e Avenue, il y a un fabuleux restaurant Indien. C'est un réel restaurant familial et cette famille est super joviale. Rien à voir avec ce soit disant Taj Mahal. 

The restaurant has an atmosphere more or less typical of India. The service is terribly long and no servers were smiling. We waited slightly more than an hour to have our meals and we even had to ask to fill our glasses of water. The flavors were there, but nothing great. Came to pay, the server charged me things that I did not ordered and he redid my bill twice. I will not return to this restaurant for several reasons mentioned above, but the main reason is that at the corner of 3rd Avenue and Verdun, there is a fabulous Indian restaurant. It is a real family restaurant and this family is super cheerful. Nothing to do with this so-called Taj Mahal."}
{"text":"Good solid Indian
Butter chicken is there highlight
Prices are good especially if you order takeout combos for 1 person turns out you ll have enough for 2 hungry men, add maybe a side order and you're good to go for 2 under 30$"}
{"text":"Love, love, loved it. Great Indian food... maybe the best I've ever had. Nothing we tasted amond 6-7 dishes wasn't A+. Can't say enough good things about their food. Decor was nice even though the place doesn't look like much from outside and the area is sort of run-down. I highly recommend it. Well done guys, keep it up! We'll be back and ordering take-out too, do doubt. Kudos."}
{"text":"I was with my gilfriend, we came on Monday around 9pm. Pretty much most of the restaurants nearby were closed, so kudos to this place.
The deco is great, quite unusually beautiful for an indian restaurant. Service was fast and friendly. We had a jaifrazi and khaima (not sure), and boy it was quite spicy (the waiter told us)!!
Overall great place."}
{"text":"Très bon , bon service and les plats sont ne sont pas trop épicés. délicieux !! Nous avons mangé Biryani aux légumes et cari a l'agneau"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service for a BYOW, I was very impressed. We decided to split one of their combination menus for two and let me tell you for a big eater I was having a hard time finishing the food in front of me ! Best mulligatawny soup I've ever had and the curries phenomenal. 

Definitely a gem in Verdun's wellington neighbourhood... which is starting to get pretty up and coming ! In a nutshell, great food, great service, great decor and great prices... what more can you ask for ? I will be back to this place !!! Bravo !"}
{"text":"The lamb Colombo was very good (super spicy, which I love).

Unfortunately, they forgot 2 of the 4 things I ordered; from the time we sat down, it took 1h45 to get our food (on a quiet weekday night); and the butter chicken was so sweet it was almost inedible.

I won't visit again."}
{"text":"Le resto était vide un vendredi soir et pas pour rien...la nourriture est fade ce qui est décevant pour de la nourriture indienne normalement si savoureuse.  Rien n'était épicé!"}
{"text":"Worst service ... I wish we would have option for zero star... manager is rude person with no sense of hosting or respecting guests...i tried many Indian restaurant in North America and this one fits to bottom so far..."}
{"text":"Came at 9 pm the guy didn't look happy to see us at all because the place Closes at 10 the kitchen.

The delivery guy came
In and was so nice to us since I couldn't flag down the waiter he took our plates prepped our take out bags and was super smiley.

Return at 9 again and the waiter rushed me again saying the close at 10. He went in the back to change out of his uniform which isn't professional but I did eat quickly took the rest to go because they're were all sitting around the table talking waiting to close"}
{"text":"I don't often eat Indian but this was a nice restaurant with unique decor and we had a pleasant time. The naan bread was nice and crispy, the butter chicken was tasty and a good amount of spicy in other dishes"}
{"text":"Second time coming here.  Wasn't very impressed with the food or the service.  We got there a tad bit late but that doesn't mean you can rush your customers out and make them feel unwelcome.  Food was alright but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting-- terrible food and bad standards of cleanliness. I saw food and dirty dishes left for over a day on a table by the window! If they are willing to advertise their dirty dishes from the street, what does the kitchen look like? Gross."}
{"text":"Belle trouvaille que ce restaurant. Lors de l'anniversaire d'un membre de la famille, nous sommes allé à ce restaurant indien ou nous pouvions apporter notre vin. Il a été possible d'obtenir un prix de groupe. Des plats de différentes nourritures ont été apportés sur les tables. Poulet au beurre, tandoori, plats végétariens , pain NAAN etc. Tout était chaud et satisfaisant.  Le service fut très professionnel. C'est un restaurant de grandeur moyenne avec une décoration simple d'inspiration indienne mais nous sommes loin du Taj Mahal. J'y retourne c'est sur."}
{"text":"2nd time ordering delivery from here, 1 word: FANTABULOUS! Amazing Indian food, around 40$ for 2 people to eat it's affordable especially for the portions. (Easily could feed 3 hungry adults with one combo for 2 or 2 main dishes with polao rice which would each add up to about 40$). Delivery took about an hour but so worth it! Absolutely must have their nan bread it is perfect with every dish and every sauce! Can't wait to go eat in-house 'cuz it's byow and the food is fantastic and hot delivery so it can only be better there! So far staff seem pretty polite and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Délicieux! Grosses portions!
Mais pas donné comparé au restos indiens sur jean-talon mettons"}
{"text":"my SO and I went there on a whim as we were walking around the Verdun area! We love Indian food and were excited to discover this place.
First and foremost: they had two groups of 8 having dinner that night. I know they were groups of 8 because it took 1 hour 45 minutes for our food to arrive due to a simply terrible service. so yes, I had the time to count. They could have brought us some bread... or SOMETHING, or told us about the delay, but we were ignored the whole time. I hoped that the appalling delay would be compensated by great flavor. I am reading the other reviews here and I'm confused: did you know butter chicken should not taste like sugar was dropped in it, or have you just skipped on the authentic Indian your whole life? I don't mean to sound pretentious (oh well...) but the flavor was not there, the food tasted like something I could have made in my slow cooker at home, but LESS flavorful. So disappointed! 

On the flip side, the Samosa I had as an appetizer was good! So that earns you a star. And a pity star. Because I dislike feeling like I HAVE to write a bad review, but you guys need to step up your service and food game."}
{"text":"Anciennement connu sous le nom du Salon Rouge, le Tajmahal L'Inde est le nouveau resto qui a pris sa place. Nouveau proprio, nouvelle bouffe et semi nouveau concept. La plupart du décor est le même que l'original, à l'exception de quelques affiches et de la musique d'ambiance.

Avant de vous y rendre, n'oubliez pas de passer par la SAQ ou bien un dépanneur pour une bouteille de vin ou une caisse de bière. C'est un BYO mais ça n'est pas vraiment publicisé. Côté bouffe, c'est de l'indien typique et ils ont une bonne variété de plats et de combinaisons pour 2 à 4 personnes. Ils ont aussi des spéciaux pour le lunch que j'espère essayer bientôt.

Mon coup de cur était le poulet aux épinards et la petite sauce/chutney qui venait avec les papadums. Le reste était vraiment juste correct, mais rien de plus. J'aurais voulu des plats un peu plus épicés avec plus de piquant, et les samosa me donnaient l'impression d'être pré fait ailleurs et non sur place. Ça n'est pas le meilleur indien en ville, mais pour Verdun, c'est pas pire."}
{"text":"This is the first time, I actually had a good Dahl soup, it  tasted homemade, with lemon and just the right balance of salt and spices. When I was homesick, I had eaten  at many Indian restaurants all over New York City and Jersey,  the Dahl soup was not as good as the one at this restaurant.  The Indian salad was excellent, lots of onions but not too strong, lots of variety and a beautiful presentation. The Chana was decent, the chick peas were soft and it had flavor but not too spicy. This is an exceptional Indian restaurant in Montreal, don't bother to go to parc-extension for your Indian food."}
{"text":"Got there at 5, looked at us like we were aliens and told us they weren't open yet.
Went there already food and service was good but now this experience kinda ruined it"}
