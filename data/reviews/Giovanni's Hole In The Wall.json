{"text":"Well this is awkward. I do not take a bad review lightly. So, I just called to order a pizza from here, as it has been a while, and was told that I was red flagged in their system to not have my order taken. For what you might ask? Well, let me begin by saying I am never rude nor do I not pay my bill. I am polite and always tip very well. That being said let us go ahead and explore my last experience with Papa Pinny's Pizzeria. I ordered a pizza, it arrived late and cold, I accepted the pizza in my hands and tipped the driver, and upon opening the pizza box in my kitchen it was very apparent the top of the pizza had shifted as if the delivery driver took a very, very, sharp turn...  Like a U turn... which led to the pizza topping shifting a good third worth over. So when I saw this, considering how much was spent on the pie (They are by no means a cheap pizzeria), I called and politely said that I was not satisfied with the quality of the pizza as it arrived. I mean.. Hell yes I want a pizza to arrive looking like a pizza with the toppings intact, who doesn't? The person who answered the phone said they would sent out a new pizza, when the new pizza arrived the delivery driver curtly requested I return the damaged pizza, which I did. I did not choose post anything at the time because I do not like to post negative reviews and understand that sometimes things just happen. We were satisfied with the new pizza and its condition. So, this bad review is because Papa Pinny's Pizzeria clearly does not take responsibility for a poor product that was clearly their error. Shame on them."}
{"text":"Have orders for delivery twice, the pizza was amazing and delivered quickly. Will be my go-to for a convenient dinner."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food quality is first rate, and the service is very personable. The owner makes sure you are happy with the experience, and offers his sincere gratitude for your business.      I really like the pizza. I asked for extra thin crust, and that's just what I got. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food. The pizza is amazing!!! The crust is perfect. And the staff is so friendly and remember us every time we walk in. We have become regulars and would recommend eating here to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it is delicious! Husband had the sausage and peppers and I had a pizza with artichokes, tomatoes, pepperoni and sausage. This was AMAZING! We will be ordering more often!"}
{"text":"We drove out of our way from the Strip because of the Yelp ratings.   We got the Pinny Signature pizza. It was good, but not awesome or anything outstanding. The pizza knots were ok, but nothing memorable. The sauce for the pizza and the knots were too tomatoey for my liking and lacked typical Italian seasoning. Got the six-piece wings (hot) and they came with an order of fries. The wings and fries were both good and worthwhile.   Service was meh. The server either wasn't paying much attention or something else was amiss. Kept having to repeat and reclarify the order. There wasn't any language barrier, so I don't know...  While she was attentive, she gave off the aire of hovering over us -which was both annoying and creepy. She also stood behind the refrigeration/display counter staring in our direction when not hovering -no doubt she was watching the game on TV -but it was creepy.   I'm glad others have had good experiences here. But there are other choices for independent Mom&Pop pizzeria fare -and I think we will continue to shop around."}
{"text":"Wow that was weird!  :-P  I just placed an order for delivery from Papa Pinny's and the subtotal without tax or anything added on was $23.  With tax and everything else it came to $29.  I asked to apply a coupon that came attached to their menu for $3 off a $20 order because it qualified by $3 and change.    The cashier is new and needed to call her boss Jason (or James?) in order to apply the discount.  After a prolonged hold she told me that they would NOT honor the coupon because the taxes can't count toward the order.    I told her that answer didn't make any sense, and reconfirmed that my subtotal was $23 without taxes, which should amply qualify my order for the coupon.  She agreed.  I asked to speak with her boss but she said he wasn't there, she had to call him on the phone.    Rather than wait another 20 minutes to get the food underway I just put the order on my card without the discount and told her that I would Yelp it.  I'm blown away that in this age of Yelp and Social Media, a pizza joint would refuse to honor their own coupon."}
{"text":"I've been having really bad luck with pizza around Vegas lately but thankfully this place broke the bad trend. I just ordered delivery from this place and it was amazing!! The garlic knots are sooo good, i only wish i ordered more of them. The pizza was very good too. I got a cheese pizza with Italian sausage, jalapeños and garlic. I recommend it. It is more expensive for delivery with the $6 delivery fee, but I'd rather pay more for food that's actually good instead of having free delivery and crappy pizza lol Will order again"}
{"text":"It's ok. Stopped by for a quick snack before piano class. Just had a hot dog and two drinks, service was fast and courteous."}
{"text":"The five star reviews are spot on. Here's what I liked the best:  1. Warm hospitality and a cozy atmosphere. 2. The bread sticks and garlic knots.Tasty sauce. 3. The menu. Check it out. Great variety. 4. The salmon. Served with salad, pasta, bread, and a nice sauce with capers. 5. Attention to refills. 6. Portions are generous (wife and daughter will finish their pizza and stromboli at home). 7. The check. Very reasonable.  Thanks, Rosie. You're special."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza (the best in town!), friendly employees, and a great find! If you're looking for a really good pizza place and a great local business to support, this is it! They deliver, too :)"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza I've eaten here in Las Vegas!! It's so good and really fresh! Totally recommend to anyone who wants to go! The staff is very friendly and nice! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worse pizza I have EVER had in my life !!!!! The tomatoe sauce has no seasoning, iwatched them dump a can of tomatoe sauce straight in the line to sauce pizzas. Real authentic Italian huh? NOT! They tried to give me old crust instead of a fresh dough because they said they were \"watching food costs\" if you ask me that's a poor excuse for a restaurant. The \"chicken cutlets\" are dryer than the Sahara desert.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!  They have Mexicans cooking \"Italian FOOD\" disgrace to Italian Food !  Avanti Pizza Is The Way To Go For Authenic Italian Pizza in Hendersong"}
{"text":"What A Joke. I was hung up 4 times. My daughter once. I tried to order off the website from there menu . From there house specials a Eggplant Parm dinner . Was told I am looking at the wrong menu. Then the person in charge is yelling from the background we only got what's on the menu . The funnily thing is I'm looking at the menu . I know they don't make it in a hoagie but that's not what I was ordering. From there own menu under house specials Eggplant Parm. With a salad and pasta. He kept trying to out me on hold but actually hanging up. The person in the background was no better. Place is completely unorganized. Don't tell the leafs are pink when I see there green. Now if your out of the item then that another thing. But I was told I am not looking at the right menu and they they only have what's on the menus That's actually funny because that item was on the me ue"}
{"text":"Forget all the other pizza places!!! We found our new place to order a surprise pizza and hot wings from. Everything was fresh and tasted on point. We're definitely ordering from Papa Pinny's Pizza!! Dinner was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful first experience. The pizza is excellent, lots of flavor without lots of salt. My husband is a back-east Italian who's very picky about pizza, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great find! Great service. The waitress makes you feel right at home, very attentive and friendly. Garlic knots were a hit, house salad was great with the house dressing. Ordered pasta and the clam linguini and chicken Marsala did not disappoint. Will definitely come back as I hear the pizza is wonderful."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza, garlic knots and fries were all delicious. Also the delivery driver was very polite :)))))"}
{"text":"Papa Pinny is one of my favorite places to eat. A LOT of toppings on the pizza. Fresh and delicious. For me and my friend, medium pizza was enough to finish. Great place to hang out and eat with friends."}
{"text":"Not from this area and found them on Yelp.  The service was fantastic.  There were 20 of us that came in from a soccer tournament.  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating.  All the food was delicious.  The pizza was hands down the best I have tasted in a long time!  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Soooo amazing!  May have found our new go to for pizza delivery!  Our  very picky teen called the food a religious experience! The pizza, stromboli and the Ooohhh my garlic knots! ! All must have!  Fast delivery too,  which rocks when you work nights, on the run, running late  and starving! Like tonight! Writing this while getting ready and anticipating food awesomeness!"}
{"text":"We've been in Las Vegas over 25 years and have longed for the great tasting pizzas from our Midwest upbringing.  We have tried almost every pizza place in town and we have finally found a pizza that blows every other place in town away.  We found  it on Yelp, and decided lets go......what a stroke of luck and genius.  Walked in smelled amazing, the owner Jason greeted us right away and recommended a pizza.  WOW, YUMMY, the crust is crisp and delicious and the toppings (Pepperoni & Sausage and Veggies) were to die for..(think he brings in his ingredients from Chicago, where he's from)  The prices are reasonable, beer was cold and the place is spotless.  We were planning our return trip on the way home.  Way to go Jason!!!!!  John & Jayne (Packer fans, sorry)"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! Came in cold off the street and let me tell you, I went on the limb and just asked for their recommendations off the the menu needles to say it was unbelievably delicious. Garlic knots, eggplant parmigiana, chicken Marsala Spinoni cake, you can't go wrong!!! Jason and family are super!!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Italian places and this place has topped every Italian place we have been to.  Our 8 month old loves the spaghetti.  The pizza and house salad with the Italian house dressing is fabulous.  We look forward to exploring more items on the menu when we come back.  You can tell that quality ingredients are used."}
{"text":"I waited 2 hours for a cold pizza. My house is 5 mins from the restaurant. Definetly off my list for food options now."}
{"text":"We ordered the garlic knots, lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, chicken parmesan, white pizza and a pepperoni/sausage pizza. Every single dish was fantastic. The garlic knots had an amazing flavor and the texture was divine. Highly recommend the garlic knots. The pizza crust was cooked perfectly and the cheese on the pizza was the best we've ever tasted. Chicken was tender and the alfredo sauce was creamy and consistent. Best meal in Vegas. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER! The service here is awesome. The owners make you feel welcome and have a personal conversation with you. The staff here is very kind and caring. Not to even mention the food here! I have never had better pizza! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Repeat customer.  Their pizza is just the way I like it and my wife loves their hot wings.  Good service an fair prices.  Now we need to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Family friendly place with the BEST pizza around!!!! Been here three times and will come back as much as possible. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for great pizza! They also have great deals on Groupon right now"}
{"text":"This is an edit to my first review.  Papa Pinny's was very courteous, and gave me a credit for a new pizza.  This time the pizza was excellent.  The crust crispy, and well done.  The pizza toppings were fresh and flavorful.  I am very glad I gave Papa Pinny's another chance, it was well worth it.  Definitely will order Papa Pinny's again.  Just got a soggy pizza delivered after waiting for it for an hour.  It's like the crust was drenched in water, no crisp to the crust what so ever.  Total disappointment! Especially for the $26 price tag."}
{"text":"Great food! Highly recommend! Prices are reasonable and you walk out the door after your meal with the mindset that your money is well spent! If I can give 10 stars I would!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for dinner. I had read the YELP reviews prior and thought I should stop in. We were very impressed as we entered. The restaurant and kitchen was very clean. There were large TV's mounted on the walls playing different sports.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. Jason F greeted us as we walked in, and explained the menu as well as their signature menu items.  The place had a relaxed atmosphere, and great food.    I ordered the eggplant Parmesan entree.  It came with pasta, along with a bread stick and a small salad... The house dressing was awesome!  We also ordered a cheese pizza for the kids, and a Cesar salad. The food was excellent, and priced well. We will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Bravo. My boyfriend is a chef at a high end hotel on the strip and we both appreciate a clean kitchen and very yummy, fresh food.  Antipasto could have used a few more greens but it's hard to complain when the pizza is delicious and the meats and cheese are fresh.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was suspect when we pulled up but it was great. Great service. Great bruschetta. Great garlic knots. Great salad with home made dressing. Great eggplant parm. Even great ice tea. Lol  T a must if you want great simple Italian or pizza.   Manga manga"}
{"text":"Great local spot! Definitely more than just a pizzeria...cozy, Italian restaurant, delicious food, great ambiance, and the owner is great! All of the food we ordered was delicious but my favorite was the garlic bread!!! Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new pizza place. Glad we chose Papa Penny's Pizzeria! The dinner started off with bruschetta which is really good. I would have posted a pic, but it did not last long  enough to take it. We will be back for the bruschetta!   We ordered a Hawaiian pizza. It was loaded with pineapple. It was really good. Our kids got the cheese and pepperoni pizza, they both ate it up.   The waitress was really nice. The owner made sure we were happy with our meal, which we were!   We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm  The food is INCREDIBLE!!!! I work next door to Papa Pinny's, and we all eat there every day! My fiancé and I are in love with our new spot! The personable staff and owners are so friendly and they open every pie and show you - then they admire their own work. It's a beautiful thing! They make you feel like family. If you're visiting Vegas, or are lucky enough to live here you should eat here. You WON'T be disappointed! If my fiancé approves, then it's truly worth it. THEY HAVE AMAZING PASTAS, CAESAR and other SALADS, DESSERTS, AND PIZZA!!!!!!!!   Thank you guys for such a great experience, as always!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service!  The pizza is what I think of as \"New York\" style - very thin crust. Fold it. Eat it.  Lunch special - 2 large slices and a soda for $6. Total bargain for what you get. *might not always be available... I don't know*  My personal bias is against loud TVs in restaurants; but in a pizza place, I can let that slide. I frequently do some work in this little strip of shops. Papa Pinny's is certainly going to become  regular lunch place for me."}
{"text":"Trying hard to find a great family pizzeria that we can return to often...  we ordered here the other night and we're going to tonight as well.  Very much enjoyed the food the other day.  Ordered mozzarella sticks and a cheese pizza (YUM!!!) and got a 1/2-1/2 meat loves and Hawaiian  which was a great choice with plenty of flavor, ingredients, cheese as well as plenty of residual greases from all.  This was deliciously satisfying to everyone here.   Even the left over pizza that was hurriedly warmed in the counter top oven the next day was a treat.   Will be coming back I'm sure..."}
{"text":"Holy moly... went in to grab a snack since we were next door at laser tag. Ordered garlic knots and they were by far the best I've ever had! They melted in my mouth. We got kicked out of laser tag because they don't allow outside food or beverage so we went back to eat at Pinny's and they treated us to garlic bread as well. Owners were so friendly! We will be going back this Monday for our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Jessica was super awesome with here Service. She was pleasant and a sweet gal. Because of her I will return trying as much of the menus. I had the Chicken wings and it was the way they should be. Perfect, I was surprise by the presentation, I never expected it to be payed out just like the picture. Lol"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in town! Great service, great food, and great people. I highly recommend this restaurant. Jason the owner is a great guy and takes pride in what he does. Rose is one of the best servers I have seen in a while. She is awesome. I recommend the bruschetta and ANY pizza, the calzones are great too. Make sure you asked for Rose."}
{"text":"Was in this restaurant today and witnessed an employee  ,say racial comments to a uber eats driver ,was so rude right in front of me ! Saying he doesn't serve mexicans!!!!! I am mexican American! !! Was so offened i will never patronize  this establishment  again !!!! Talk about classless made the poor ladie cry !!!! How come he didn't  say that to me?? I wasn't gonna let my kids hear the comotion so i ignored it ,but i  had to let you folks  know!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in to have dinner and we had a great first experience. My wife and I shared shared a Calzone, kids had pizza. They finished the first, so we had to order a second one. Finally, a huge serving of Tiramisu to share. Everything was delicious!! Especially the tiramisu!! Thanks to our waitress and Papa Pinny himself for a memorable evening!!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, fast and friendly service. Will definitely go back or order delivery in the future."}
{"text":"This pizza place is absolutely amazing. The service was amazing the woman at the front desk greeted us and even the pizza chefs in the back had great customer interaction it was awesome. The food was absolutely delicious. We found this place off of Yelp reviews and we made the plunge. And I am glad we did. This couldn't have been any better. They offer a string of spaghetti for 10 cents. Seems a little pricey for me but that single string was absolutely amazing well worth the 10 cents. You don't have to take my review to heart but this place is well worth a shot. If you think papa johns or Pizza Hut is good you need to take a dip into the deep end of the pizza pool and try it. We will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly service, a great experience all around. I highly recommend it, the atmosphere was great and the people are extremely nice. I went with my grandparents and the staff was very accommodating; they didn't try to rush us and were attentive and talkative. Family friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"I was eating there and I heard a racial slur. I would never eat there, I don't want to come to a place and find out they spit in my food because they don't like the color of my skin"}
{"text":"Small, family owned restaurant where there are two TV's and the kitchen is visible.   Ordered their chicken piccata to go. I like that they didn't skimp on the portions of pasta and chicken. My only wish the next time I order would be for more capers & less butter."}
{"text":"I am giving this little hole is the wall restaurant five stars for their amazing service and delicious food. As soon as you walk in they greet you with a welcoming smile. We ordered wings which were very juicy and a meat lovers pizza that had the right amount of everything (specially the mozarella). Thanks to David and everyone working there for the great service! we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"EW at the restaurant's response. Like clearly there is a picture of the nasty pizza with the 1\" inch thick crust, as I described. Your business response makes me sure that I will never be returning to your establishment. On top of the pizza being thick, it was gross. I tried to call your restaurant the next day, and it was closed, otherwise I would've dropped what you describe as \"pizza\" off. Your server even explained to me that the cook was new. It was a half-and-half pizza, nothing crazy off the menu and it still was done incorrectly and, instead of your restaurant taking fault, you blame me for being incoherent when clearly the server understood me if my pizza was the correct half-and-half but just thick and gross. \"INCOHERENT\"??! Puh-lease. I have plenty of degrees that say otherwise."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Nice and quaint place. Ordered the mozzarella sticks, italian beef sandwich, and chicken alfredo pizza. All very tasty. Mozzarella sticks were crunchy on the outside with just enough cheese in the inside. Beef sandwich was so good not too salty. Chicken alfredo pizza..bomb!!"}
{"text":"First: Ordered a pizza for delivery. A bit pricey at $25+ for a supreme, but the pizza was huge and loaded up with toppings. Crust was good, sauce had flavor, and there was plenty of cheese. Order arrived on time, if not a bit early. It's rare for me to do delivery, but this is a place I'd keep in mind for the future. Four stars!  Second: Came in to pick up an order of pasta. Location is cozy, staff was polite, order was again ready quickly. The chicken piccata has protein, pasta, a bread stick and a side salad, all nicely priced for $14. Unfortunately, the sauce makes this dish and it was lackluster. Something was missing, it was just okay. The side salad was ordered with bleu cheese dressing which seemed to be either a cheap bottled brand or made in-house by someone who doesn't know it. It was gross and ruined the salad. Two stars?  Third: Ordered takeout again, got the antipasto salad with the bruschetta app. Ton of food, around $15. The bruschetta was fine but the salad was a bust. Looked more like a plate of cold cuts with meats and cheeses on a scant handful of spring mix. \"House italian\" dressing was a creamy version that was gross and brown? The whole thing looked and tasted like it was made by someone who doesn't like salads for other people who don't like salads. But the bruschetta was good. Three stars it is.  TLDR: Stick to the pizza and maybe the appetizers. Order pickup or delivery through the app, they're quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to dine in instead of order to go, the selection is awesome from hot and cold sandwiches to pasta and specialty dishes to large pizzas or pizza slice specials. We went for the special of two large pizza slices with a fountain drink and the chicken piccata which came with an entree sized house salad and a large piece of garlic bread. Both dishes were great and the entrees are huge. Everyone that works here is extremely friendly and attentive they even asked if we wanted to change the channel on their three large tvs. Great place definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Good but only 3 stars because the delivery driver can't read,I included exact address directions and he still went the wrong way thus making my order cold."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.   It was small, cute with lots of great big screen TVs.  The pizza was good...not great and it really didn't taste \"CHICAGO\" to me. If you're looking for authentic Chicago pizza I'd go to Aurelio's.  The garlic knots were some of the best I've ever had.  The service was good too. Even though it was slightly better than average I doubt I'll be back.  Glad I tried it."}
{"text":"I went into this place tonight to have a slice of pizza with my husband and son.  Pizza  is their food of choice in any given situation, but we hadn't gone in to Papa Pinny's yet.  Boy, am I glad we did! It's our new favorite!!! I ordered a garden salad, expecting iceberg lettuce, half a tomato, and a bit of bitter dressing, like other pizza places.What I got was such a level up, I was amazed! 4 or 5 different greens, chick peas, kidney beans, tomato, cucumber, olive, etc...beautiful array, topped with mozzarella cheese, and wonderful, homemade dressing...plus, the amazingly charming owners treated us to some extra special garlic bread...the kind my Italian grandma used to make! We ate like no tomorrow!  When the pizza came out, it was cooked to flavorful perfection! The crust was a cut above. We will definitely go back, bring friends, and hope to score more of that incredible garlic bread! Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is the second time I've been here in the past 3 years and and I come here every time I am here for viva Las Vegas rockabilly weekend. And I am blow away always with the quality and service.  Chef snoop was amazing and was working by himself. We were a party of 6 and order just about half the menu but he made sure to make the food fast and with love. Can't wait to come back when I visit for EDC."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered pizza, wings and bruschetta and did not disappoint! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and a great calzone! Absolutely will be back to sample more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Love the food, service, and atmosphere!  No joke, stop by and try it yourself. New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"You get big servings. Salads are great, calzone and pizza were delicious. Even the chicken strips and fries were tasty! The service was excellent...definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got so many good reviews, it must be all of their friends. It doesn't even come close to Rocco's pizza Summerlin location (across from Red Rock Casino)  The 4 cheese pizza was way way too salty, with too much sauce which was overly acidic. The fettuccine Alfredo had no taste and the sauce tasted like it came from a can. The grilled chicken in the Alfredo was the only thing that saved the dish and was pretty good. We also had a side of meatballs which the sauce also tasted like it came straight out of a can. They were also way too salty and didn't have much flavor. The texture was also not great.   Nora's or Gino's has much better pasta. Rocco's for pizza."}
{"text":"Craving pizza and not able to leave my house, I called in an order for delivery one weekday afternoon. The lady who answered the phone and took my order was very sweet. I ordered a house salad with house Italian dressing, and a pepperoni and mushroom calzone. Total with tax and tip was $27. A bit pricey for a meal for one in my opinion. She quoted me 45 mins for delivery and the delivery time was spot on, if not few mins early.   The calzone was pretty good. It was stuffed with delicious ricotta and mozzarella cheese, and I got pepperoni and Mushrooms as toppings. The zone came with a side of marinara sauce which was tasty. The house salad had spring mix, black olives, garbanzo and kidney beans and mozzarella cheese. The Italian dressing was very good, definitely house made. This wasn't anything that I need to have again ASAP, but I'd be inclined to order the salad again for that yummy Italian dressing."}
{"text":"This was a total accidental blessing of a find! I was dropping my friend off at the gym next-door and I had a craving for garlic knots so I stopped in to see if they had any. Not only did they, without exaggeration these are the best garlic knots I've ever had in my life!! This place was so good and the pasta smell so good when I walked in the door that I took my friend back there to sit and dying in the next day.The owner was great, very friendly and offered us complementary wine. We had the fettuccine Alfredo which was bomb, and of course more of those amazing garlic knots. It is a little bit higher price then a cheap quick bite to go, but reasonable for the food and the portions. I highly recommend this if you like authentic Italian, it has a real New York feel which I do realize is not Italy, but I have not been to Italy so the best reference I can give use New York."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall Italian restaurant is really good! Lunch specials is amazing and the dinner and cheesecake is da bomb!!"}
{"text":"Was eating my food when I heard racial slurs coming from the owner shame but I'm never coming here again and I wish I could give this no stars"}
{"text":"I have never visited Papa Pinny's but have ordered Uber Eats from there at least five times. I have tried the chicken parmesan, the chicken piccata, chicken fingers, salad and desserts.   There's a reason why I keep ordering from this place. The food is GREAT! Not once have they screwed up my order and the food is fresh and delicious.  I plan on going to the location just to meet the people who work there because they rule!  Much Love!"}
{"text":"The attention and ther service are great. The owner is a incredible and nice gentleman and the food is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend you this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food great owner treats everyone like family highly recommended! All food is great from wings to the pizza can't go wrong. Signature to supreme"}
{"text":"Wow this place is worth it. Came here on a recomendation from yelp and it did not dissapoint. The staff is feindly and the ower/chef came from the kitchen to talk to us and made us feel wellcomed and at home. We order the fried calamari, it was fresh ,light and cooked to perfection. Then it was on to pizza, omg the best crust i have ever eaten. It was fluffy, and very tasty and fresh, i ate it first. The rest of the pizza was even better than the crust. We loved it and we will definatly be back when we are back in vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! The ingredients were fresh and I loved the crust! The workers were all cheerful and nice!"}
{"text":"Love the food and services I recommend to all me coworker and friends a great place to go after work super NICE GUYS THERE including the owner"}
{"text":"Yummy Great, great pizza. Great Bruschetta bread.  Ate in. Very plain and comfy. Service great. I believe it was Rose who took care of us. Couldn't be nicer. Will come back many times and also do take out"}
{"text":"We get this delivered. It's always still hot when it arrives. Love the mozzarella sticks! Never ever have leftovers/ the boys devour it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken madeira and was disappointed. The past was undercooked and so was the chicken. The supreme pizza tasted exactly like costco pizza except twice the price. The lady taking the order was really snooty."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They communicated expectations clearly and the food was amazing. We had bruschetta, garlic knots and Pizza. Everything exceeded expectations. If you are a regular or visiting Vegas try this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this place has a very cute authentic decor inside, felt like i was at a mob museum. But staff is friendly and giovanni himself is such a gentleman. He comes out and interacts with the guests with a big glass of wine in his hand. Makes you feel like your part of the family.  He even walked me to the door when i was done. Great food as well."}
{"text":"We came for dinner before playing laser tag next door. Small dining room with other customers who seemed to be regulars. The pizza was great-- nice, thinner crust. We even had s couple of ice cold Peronis. The staff was very attentive and friendly. They even made a birthday treat for my daughter on the house!  We enjoyed our experience and will be back."}
{"text":"WOULD GIVE ZERO IF I COULD!! Literally just saw the owner throw money in a woman's face and push her out the door holy smoke!!! Not sure exactly what the issue was older lady behind the counter started yelling 1st?!?!? YIKES.. With that said WHATEVER the issue was it was handled extremely wrong!!!!! Ordered pizza and chicken tenders ummm.. would have been good if my stomach didn't turn from nervousness!!! Will NOT return.."}
{"text":"I miss the original Papa Pinny's. Apparently new owners took over and they are very disappointing. The marinara sauce is awful, the chicken piccata is a mess, the meatballs taste like garbage, the mozzarella sticks were burned, bottled soda was expired, and there's parsley dumped all over everything. They took a great neighborhood restaurant and turned it into crap."}
{"text":"Really good food! We ordered calzones and chicken masalas. Chicken masalas came with salad and garlic bread. Everything taste really good and also customer service was good and good price. Nice and quiet place. We will be back again to try pizza next time!"}
{"text":"We had pizza from here today it was delicious.  X large is big and full of toppings.  Not a whole ton of sauce which is the way I like it.  He made us fries and wings too!  The chef remembered my kids who come in here and when they did he made my daughter fresh Alfredo for her pizza!  The guy working the counter very friendly.  This will be our go to pizza place while we are here.  It's always nice to have delicious food and excellent service.  Try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I never leave disappointed. Great food and friendly service. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Way off the strip but the best pizza i have ever had!!!! The staff is friendly, the owner is passionate about his food and it shows. I dodnt jave the salad but a friend did, i tried the house italian salad dressing that was phenominal. I will be back and I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"moved over to north west side of town looking for a good pizza place. read yelp and found this place.  ordered by phone for delivery and got a pizza with chicken wings and French fries. quoted 45minutes came within the time. pizza was warm and good wings and fries good.  overall food was good service was pleasant and fast. had to laugh as my address is the same as some condos in the area so the driver called and double-check, thought that was nice and professional.   will order again."}
{"text":"My first visit. The pizza was very good. Very cheesy, and the tomato sauce had a nice taste. The Italian sausage topping, though, was sparse. Some slices had only one small piece of sausage, and no slice had a lot. That was my only gripe, but even so, I enjoyed the pizza. The crust was not quite as good as Bambino's, which is a little crisper, but it was a good pizza. I also tried the meatballs, which were good, but garlicky."}
{"text":"As a transplant from Jersey where pizza is king I can say Papa PInny's is hands down my favorite pizza place in Vegas.....  Jason and his staff are the best and if there is even a slight issue they will go above and beyond to rectify it. I have even had him create a pizza not on his menu, that is how awesome he is......."}
{"text":"Had a large sausage, onion and garlic pizza and thought it was very good. Crust, cheese and sauce were just right. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Owner was really incredible when it came to service level. Usually hear little pizza spots are kinda bad and give you a vibe of eat and get out. Here they treat you very well and check on you very often."}
{"text":"Listen guys. Whatever you do check this place out. I stopped by cause my girls wanted pizza and oh boy..... best pizzas in town by far. The pasta apparently is not bad either.  I will return to this place for Italian food as often as I can.  Save room for dessert. CHEESECAKE IS OFF THE Hook!"}
{"text":"The new owner sign concerned us but after getting our orders we were really happy! The food pictured in the menu is the actual plate. Hot dog was the best I have ever had. One of us had white fish and it was awesome. Bottom line is its not a pizzeria it's an Italian restaurant with plates priced under $15.00 that would cost $25 at other places. Already back for a second trip."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago. Needless to say what I expect from a pizza place. My girlfriend and I have ordered here twice now. The first time was excellent! The second time we ordered a plain cheese pizza to be delivered. And it took nearly an hour and a half on a Tuesday night. When we received the pizza it looked like the driver did donuts in the parking lot and gave it to us. I'm giving it a 4 star rating because when we called to complain they were very kind and rushed the second pizza to us in 20 minutes. The owner delivered it himself and allowed us to keep the previous pizza as well. Customer service goes a long way in my book. We'll order again."}
{"text":"Rosie greeted us as soon as we walked in, so polite & awesome customer service. She recommended the Chicago Dog with fries, & it was delicious! Glad I decided to give it a try. Very clean & laid back place to eat. We will b back to try everything else on the menu"}
{"text":"I am not even supposed to have pizza anymore, but once in a while I cheat and this is the only place west of the Mississippi I will do that with! We love their delivery for our lazy nights, and the garlic knots are some of the best I have had since living in Jersey as a kid."}
{"text":"Just go to Papa Pinny's and enjoy. Jason, the owner is top notch as is his restaurant. You will go back without giving it a second thought."}
{"text":"Nothing but 'wonderful' for this pizzeria. Best service, good price, and delicious pizza! Spot on pizza margherita; the pizza crust had a wonderful taste, the sauce was devine, and toppings were perfect. I don't normally eat a lot of pizza all at once, but with this one I couldn't stop eating more. The kids enjoyed their pizza, as well. We will be returning and make this our go-to for pizza.   Finally found the right pizza place in the Summerlin area! Just wish we found it sooner. I must repeat one last thing, excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Just ordered my first pizza for delivery and it was amazing. The lady on the phone was very helpful and very nice the delivery was fast and the food is amazing the anti-Posto salad is super good there's a lot of awesome stuff inside of it I definitely recommend ordering from this place to anybody who wants to have really good pizza. I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Las Vegas a couple of years ago, we have run through a dozen or more pizzerias looking for a truly outstanding pizza with delivery.  This is the one.  Our search ended here.  I don't know about anything else on the menu, and I don't care.  This is our go-to place for great pizza."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - the food was delicious. I came in with my two kids to have a quick lunch and was greeted by the friendly staff.   There was a football game on, but one of the staff members changed the channel for my son to watch cartoons while we waited for our food and after we finished eating, he helped me carry my leftovers since my hands were full.   I ordered a small cheese pizza, fries, and an Italian sub - simple, yet satisfying.  I'll be coming back whenever I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"An adorable restaurant with excellent service and an authentic Italian feel. The Philly Steak is to die for! :)"}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time the lasagna is fantastic Probably the best lasagna I've had in Vegas and I've been here for over 10 years. The owner was very nice great customer service I will definitely come back again. Have a lasagna it's great!"}
{"text":"I just called in to place an order for delivery. The chicken wings come with fries. I mentioned the last time they delivered fries they were soggy so I'd like to substitute since fries are typically not a good delivery item. \"We don't do that.\" Ummm ok. Then no fries and I'll have blue cheese and ranch with those and a large pizza. \"We're going to have to charge you for the ranch and blue cheese.\" I'm not going to spend $25 at your establish PLUS tip ur driver AND pay the delivery fee for a small pizza and 6 chicken wings and you wanna nitpick with me about dressing costs when I already passed on the soggy fries. Bye Felicia! I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner! Of course, we enjoyed the garlic knots which lived up to the hype and we ordered the Pinny's supreme pizza. The pizza was delicious and they don't skimp on the toppings!  I love that the layout of the restaurant is simple and cozy - the decor and atmosphere made me feel right at home.  Also, Rosie was our server and she was absolutely amazing from start to finish. She is such a warm and genuine spirit and made my dining experience that much more memorable.  The quality of food is excellent and I'll be sure to make another visit soon! My hunt for amazing pizza on the west side has come to an end here at Pinny's!"}
{"text":"This place is my first choice when it comes to pizza Talk about quality and customer service! Oh and by the way try out their Chicago hotdogs they are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a couple doors down from where my daughter takes piano lessons. Small hole in the wall with only 6 or so tables, and it seems like they recently remodeled and added outdoor tables and wine decor inside.   This isn't the first time we have been here. Treated my daughter (5 years old) to a candle lit dinner last night and it was great so it reminded me to review. I didn't review in the past, because I loved the pizza but the spinach salad was sooooo greasy, and I wanted to only give a 4 or a 5 cuz I know they're trying. Waited it out and they've since removed that salad from the menu, ha!   I was at the mercy of the kindergartener, so we ended up with a cheese pizza and Caesar salad. I really liked the Caesar. Perfectly dressed...not crazy amounts of dressing.   Pizza is surprisingly good here. The crust is crisp on the bottom and sides, and chewy. I recently saw this Yelp type influencers posting videos of some pizza place that uses scissors and the guy citing talks about the \"crack crack\"...it's just like that. I like the semi tart sauce. Cheese is a little greasy since it's normal shredded mozzarella (as opposed to the buffalo mozzarella like Grimaldi's, or whatever they use there), but a very satisfying pizza.   They brought us this super tasty garlic bread (basically a super buttered, super toasted soft hoagie), complimentary.   Sit down service can be slow because there are only a few tables, and the server (who we've had every time) has to answer phones, be a hostess, put together Grub Hub orders, etc. She is a super sweet lady and I tip her 50% every time. I know she is trying her best and I appreciate her.   I'm sad that we will be quitting piano at this location and it's pretty far for us to drive, but we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm sad right now.  We drove across town to our favorite pizza restaurant.   We found new ownership and many changes.  The menu is the same, but far from the same food.  My usual salad with tomatoes, cheese and dressing was the same recipe, but instead of thick sliced tomatoes red ripe and juicy, it was thin sliced half ripe tomatoes.  Ugg.  The cheese garlic bread had cheese, thin as possible, on 2 of the 5 pieces.  The pizza was the worst disaster of all.  About 2 to 3 pieces of sausage each piece.  Definitely not the same quality ingredients.  No friendly owner to say hello and thanks for coming in and cold careless waitress.  We won't be back.  Sorry to see the original go.  This new owner has zero chance of survival."}
{"text":"First timer at Papa Pinny's , the Antipasto salad was excellent hefty amount of Italian meats, the house dressing was great. The signature pizza was awesome,  my daughter's Lasagna was also  hefty and good. Everything was great,  clean atmosphere friendly staff. Will come back to try more."}
{"text":"This place looked like a nice place.  I waited patiently for someone to come take my order.  Waited about 10 mins.  No one came.  I never saw a sign that says u have to order the counter.  A group of four came in and ordered way after anyone asked if I wanted to order.  I went to the counter and explained I was diabetic and couldn't wait... lady said I'm sorry ... put there order in 2 mins ago..."}
{"text":"My brother comes here very frequently, and I came along once. Been craving it ever since. Their garlic knots will blow you away! It is only for true garlic lovers though, be warned. They'll knock your socks off. Their pastas are delicious, pizzas are excellent, fingers & wings are phenomenal, too. Tiramisu is a must have. Love this place, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Papa Pinny's is great. Ordering delivery is easy and they are always friendly on the phone. Hands down, they make the most amazing garlic knots. I'm not even a fan of garlic knots but these guys made me a believer. Garlicy, doughy heaven. The house salad is great as well. They have an awesome homemade house dressing. The large portion is generous. (Big enough for three people as a side.) Don't forget to try the cannoli! Scrumptious."}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about getting a bad pizza. We had 2 pizzas delivered. It looked like the pizza was dropped with all toppings shifted to  side. It was very gooey and we pulled pieces with almost nothing on it. Top it all off and the bottom of the pizza was burnt. For the quality it was over priced and would like our tip back. I would include a picture but can't seem to do that on the app."}
{"text":"Didn't get get the pizza I wanted and the Manager said their is nothing he can do. Fucking ridiculous."}
{"text":"Big time fan of this place. I love pizza, and this rates up there with the best. Rediculously good crust and the toppings are on point. We pounded the pinny's signature supreme = amazing."}
{"text":"Our service was excellent!! Reminds me of a New York Italian restaurant . James the manager and chief is so good. Pizza is fabulous. The sauce is old world. Sausage is fantastic. We will be back ."}
{"text":"I love the taste of their crust, it's thin, and crispy.  There's other places I've been to in Rhode Island that remind me of the same perfect crispy crust.  The pepperoni pizza I had was greasy but exactly how I prefer it, dripping.  The mozzarella cheese is excellent quality.  The consistency of the service has been great both visits here.  The chief is a well spoken, understanding person and takes pride in his cooking.  May 19th at 2:30 PM was my first time here.  I chose to dine in with my friend from Rhode Island in town.  I had ordered a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms & peppers it was really good! I didn't snap a picture because it was so good to split.   Last night (June 4th 8 PM) I placed a pick up order for large pepperoni pizza because hubby was getting out from work.  Honestly we loved it to go too!  I see some reviews complaining about soggy salad for delivery when it's difficult to transport cold items with hot items.  I would suggest sticking with hot food if you request delivery.  If not, you should definitely dine like we did our first visit.  Very nice tables and furniture to get comfortable.  I love this cozy place. It's 7 minutes from our house."}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas for a soccer tournament and a parent found this place.  Fantastic food and even better service!  If I were local, this would be a regular stop for me and my family."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, I liked what they had to offer on the menu. The person that answered was polite and courteous and my order came quickly and was delivered within good time.   The pizza? Not a fan. I ordered their version of a margarita (sp?) and one half pepperoni half cheese.   As soon as I took a slice of the first, the tomato and one basil leaf with a slice of unmelted mozzarella slid off entirely. The pizza is covered in sauce and they place a regular slice of tomato, one leaf of basil, and a slice of fresh mozzarella. The mozzarella is poor quality. It didn't melt and the consistency and flavor were totally off. It tasted like rubber. I wanted to give it another chance, but the second slice was completely soggy. Wet pizza crust from the tomato and too much sauce. Would not recommend ordering.   The second pizza I took a slice of and because the ratio of cheese to crust was out of balance, the toppings came completely off.   Way too much cheese for a super thin crust. The texture of the crust was ok, but the crust doesn't have enough salt in the dough. The sauce is ok. A bit tart, but decent if not completely drowned by cheese.   The timing and service were really good.  The pizza. Some of the worst I have had in a long time. Won't order again."}
{"text":"Three for lunch ordered penne alla vodka ( which is a white sauce and not a pink sauce, just a heads up!), Philly cheesesteak and spaghetti with meatballs. Everything was good! Service was quick and great. Very friendly. Good atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"After searching on Yelp and wanting to eat pizza, we saw that this place had almost 5 stars. I didn't believe it until we ate the food. it was awesome! My kids complimented on it and the cheese was high quality, not like Little Caesars or any other commercial pizza parlors. The house salad was amazing.. We are from California and we were at a nearby baseball park for a tournament this restaurant was well worth it we will always come back when we are in town thank you for such a delicious meal and kind service."}
{"text":"Had a large Supreme delivered to my office and it was amazing. The pie was delivered hot and on time. Best pizza I've had since living in New York.  You will taste the quality of the ingredients on the first bite. Really impressed and so happy to find a go to pizza joint."}
{"text":"Tiny, cozy, and pleasant. And probably the best meatball sub I have had in Las Vegas. Will have to come back and try the pizza.  Very gracious owner, and staff."}
{"text":"Amazing food definitely coming back. Garlic knots are a must have!!!! The service was great as well very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This small, locally owned mom-and-pop-type shop has several tables to dine in. You'll be surrounded by lots of Chicago memorabilia hanging on the walls as you look through a menu that isn't limited to pizza. There's plenty of other Italian-American dishes ranging from pastas to calzones to sandwiches and chicken wings.  The pizza is pretty good compared to most quickie, take-out or delivery places but not on par with the top pizza makers in town. Their crust is thin, chewy, with only slight crispness. Their meat lover's pizza is generous with toppings with a tangy sauce with some acidity to it. Their white pizza was excessively oily (yeah, I know it's a white pie, but even by those standards it was too much).   They're a clear step up from pizza chains and prices are respectable. As close as they are to my house, I'm sure I'll give them another shot and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"We just happened upon this gem tonight.  The food is awesome,this is the best place in Vegas that I have found,we come from the east coast and have not had a decent pizza til now.  The waitress Rosie was awesome,and the owner came out and introduced himself and had a drink with us.  If you order pizza(full menu,BTW) the beers are 2.00 unlimited,how great is that!!  This is definitely going to be our go to place.  We felt relaxed and welcomed all the way around.  Its located right next door to Laser Blast on W.Sahara Blvd.  Give it a try,,you will thank me!"}
{"text":"What a charming place! Live accordian music and candlelight for ambience! I hate to post this cause I want to keep the secret all to myself. It is truly a tiny hole in the wall but amazing. Food is amazing and will def be back. Try the \"bigga\" glass of red and yummy garlic bread. Yum."}
{"text":"Best part. They deliver through grub hub.   Had fettuccini Alfredo that was greasy, garlic bread that was soggy and cold and a salad that was limp with no dressing.   Also ordered an Italian sandwich that was not very good.   Suggestion. Get in the car and go to Rocco's. They are so much better"}
{"text":"This was literally a waste of time and money. Where do these great reviews come from?   I ordered eggplant parmesan and chicken marsala. It was as good as a frozen microwave meal.No real flavor or any depth to the sauces. We've pretty much had a couple of bites, ate the bread and the rest lingered in the fridge for days. Italian food never sits around in our home.   This was really a disappointing experience; pretty much the exact opposite of what was anticipated because of the reviews. I know we only had two dishes, could have been a bad day but do I really want to go for seconds? No, it was so unappetizing   In my opinion, I would not recommend this place to anyone. I am better off making my own as I have been."}
{"text":"All I can say is, AMAZING!!! pizza and wings are my favorite and my boyfriend and I have always had a spot we go to but it's clear on the other side of town from our home. My boyfriend found this spot on Yelp and I'm so happy he did...we had the supreme pizza, mild fingers and mozzarella sticks and it was delicious! Pizza was crispy but still loaded and not too think, chicken was fresh and delicious with crispy french fries and the mozzarella sticks were super cheesy! Was so yummy but not only was the food great the service was exceptional! Very warming seeing the owner helping the cook making sure our food is done and server was great! Thank you can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Delicious food! My family ordered garlic bread, calamari, hot wings, and pizza. ALL of it was great. I really appreciated that they brought out the food in a timely manner. It's a small place but nice and clean. the service was excellent. I can't think of anything to complain about."}
{"text":"I was at the store next to this pizzeria to get a gift with my 3 year old baby girl for my stepdads bday when all of a sudden I hear her say, \"Mommy, I need to go bathroom.\" The store I was in did not have a public restroom so I went next door to this pizzeria where their bathroom was locked. I looked at the older woman who seemed nice that was there and said, \" I'm so sorry but my 3 year old needs to go potty.\" Where she replied, \"It's only for customers.\" So i said, \"she's only 3\" like really what harm could it have done to them? Now I understand how there are places with this policy, but I don't understand how you can say that when you see a toddler that needs to use the restroom. As I was walking out the man putting the pizza together in the background felt the need to yell \"It's only for customers\" which was not necessary since I was already walking out the door. Honestly had they let my baby girl use their bathroom I would have gladly repaid that kindness by purchasing something as a thank you..I almost mentioned it too but it all felt so wrong I could not wait to get out of there plus I didn't want my toddler to pee on herself. You will never have a customer out of me.. you may not care about that either but it's sad how people no longer have compassion... God bless you guys just the same."}
{"text":"Food is great. Had spaghetti and meatballs. Husband had shrimp special. Like the splits of wine. Most placed don't store wine correctly. Definitely gourmet  not just a pizza place. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Being in Las Vegas for a week having a lot of different foods. I haven't had pizza. A good pizza place. Woke up on a later afternoon thier were no more dart competition me & my bf slept in. When we got dress my bf found this place heard a lot of great things most definitely the garlic knots. Reading the yelp reviews the garlic knots is a must try.  It's was a nice drive to get there. When we got there it my bf got a little discouraged about the place being small but we decided to go in anyways. It's a small place with 7 tables we were told to sit anywhere we like. Looked at the menu and seen a lot of pastas, sandwiches, & of course pizzas.  We were serve by a lady a nice lady asked what we wanted to drink and she mentioned about the garlic knots so we got a large order of the (12 knots). About 5 minutes later the knots came in they looked so damn good real garlic hella garlicky but good. So if you don't like a lot of garlic don't get it. Then I check in to this place & notice they had a $5 off coupon just by checking in. We had a speciality pizza we got the all meat pizza.  We were eating the knots then the pizza came in hot & fresh the cheese was zooey & cheesy it was New York style the crust was light and crispy. I had two slices I got full quick. My bf and his friend ordered zeppolis with chocolate drizzle. They LOVED it. They said it was soft & warm. I didn't want it because I don't like chocolate.  This place is wonderful. The food is great for pizza and desserts. I would definitely will go again when Im here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"That's my first time here because one of my friend brought me here, the food was delicious, homemade and fresh. The service was awesome and I'll coming back at any time. I recommend the restaurant if you want to coming with your friend for really good Italian cuisine. They have the best tiramisu in town. We just love it."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Where do I start?! First off, my order consisted of a 12\" Pinny's Signature Supreme Pizza, with extra pepperoni, extra mushrooms, extra cheese and extra sauce, and 12 pieces Jumbo Wings Medium sauce with blue cheese. It came to $42.45. Worth every heavenly morsel! My delivery time was 30 to 45 minutes it arrived at 37 minutes into the delivery time, mind you, I live on West Charleston and Torrey Pines. Kudos to the driver, he was very friendly and made my mouth wish I had ordered the garlic knots, they sound Delish! So on to the food, the smell of the pizza and wings, drew me in like those old cartoons where they levitate to the food, I kid you not! The pizza was piled high with toppings and extra pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese and sauce as I had asked! Woohoo!! It gets better, I went to lift a piece of pizza out of the box and it was a little soggy, now, I know it was contributed to all the extras so I wasn't too shocked. Now the great part! The pizza, despite a little soggyness(my fault) was beyond, it had the green and black olives, crispy pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms( no can here) and crispy big (not too big) bacon. The onions and green peppers were fresh and crisp not soggy Now the sauce is homemade in the best way! Great seasoning! The crust was crisp on the edges and tender and flavorful. Homemade dough is the secret! Man, do they have it right, all of it! Now the catcher, I called to give my praise and Rosy answered I asked to speak to the manager, Rosy politely related that they do not have a manager, yet a owner and he was with a customer, \" Could she take a message\". I went in and praised my order from wait time, to the sauce, to delivery driver John. Best online order experience I have ever had! No question about it! Now just a little back story, I throw down in the kitchen in all styles of food, so I know my way around the kitchen. I bake,cook,grill and make all my own breads and dough. I make pizza as well, and let me to tell you, this pizza and wings made me do the happy dance and want more! I just moved today, and afterwards, did not want to cook, after being in the hot, muggy, humid air. I was skeptical, reading the reviews, I decided to give Papa Pinny's Pizzeria my coin and I am elated I did! I have lived here since 1990, and it is really hard to find a great pizza place, pizza hut has been mine because I got tired of paying big bucks to only get disappointed. I can vouch , not the case here, I hope Pappa stays around for the rest of my years in this life and then some! Don't change a thing Pappa! Don't get overwhelmed with profit margin and cut corners, and whatever you do Pappa, DO NOT FIRE ROSY OR JOHN, HECK THE PIZZA MAKER EITHER!! I appericate you!"}
{"text":"We ordered a signature Xl supreme through yelp to be delivered.  With tip and tax came out to a little over 30$, definitely worth it.  Nice side pizza cut into decent size slices.  The combination of ingredients was great, but best of all, was the dough.  Their dough blows everything I've tried lately out of the water.  I recommend ordering their pizza, I know I will  definitely be ordering from them again.  Updated review -  Ordered exact same pizza, never been so disappointed or seen such inconsistency. The pizza was extremely extremely greasy, flavor was off, missing meatballs and green olives, and was just really not very good.. will not order from them again, the pizza was terrible this time"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place had the four cheese pizza pie which was extremely salty way too much tomato sauce and crust sucked. Had 2 slice and threw out the rest it was not edible. I also had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken pasta was heavy in cream sauce. It was ok. The grilled chicken was good. The garlic bread was dry. Wife had the meatballs and she said it sucked as well.  I won't be going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible Delivery! It took over an hour! Food was delivered cold and my sandwich was soggy. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN! I didn't want to leave any stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great quality food, clean, and authentic tasting! Love his place. The sauces they use are phenomenal. Pizza's are outstanding."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times food was great. Would come here again and also will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Tried this place for delivery one night and were very satisfied. I got the chicken parm hoagie and my husband got the philly. Both were really delicious and massive! We ordered a side of cheese garlic bread, so cheesy and toasty. Quick delivery. Got it in about 30 when quoted 60. Will be trying the pizza next!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with my 5 & 8 year old.  Kids had Spaghetti with meat sauce and 8\" cheese pizza.  The kids spaghetti was delicious and a very generous serving.  We had the 16\" supreme.  It was delicious as well.  Finished with 2 sorbets for dinner.  Service was wonderful. Will definitely stop here again!"}
{"text":"If you like Olive Garden this is not the  place is not for you.  This is a high end Italian restaurant.  The lady that answers the phone is a delight.  Delivery timely and the food is excellent.   You'll be hard fought to find better delivery food meal ... Buon Appetito."}
{"text":"I was just on this side ofbtown for an appointment & had a taste for pizza so I went to ol trusty Yelp put in Pizza and Papa Pinny's came up. This small pizzaria was so good fresh tasting pizza and wonderful & friendly service. If u haven't yet u got ro try them out and u won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pizza and cheesesteaks!!! Coming from Philadelphia, that says a lot!"}
{"text":"Also called: Giovanni's Hole in the Wall. On the SE corner of Sahara and Cimarron. Wow! My wife got the lobster and shrimp pasta dish ($17) and I was hungry after a bike ride and got the chicken parm. for dinner ($15). There is just something wonderful when you love the sauces and flavors. They came out just right. Both dishes came with a nice dark green salad and garlic bread; mine also came with a side of spaghetti. Wife's lobster and shrimp pasta had a super generous amount of big shrimp and lobster both of which were very flavorful. We left with half the food for breakfast the next day. The big $5 glass or red wine was also quite good. It's a very small restaurant with a nice quiet ambience. We will be back enthusiastically."}
{"text":"This place is def not as good at people have rated it. Cost me 70$ bucks for 1 large pizza, 24 \"jumbo\" wings (wings were medium to small size at most, 10 tiny fried pieces of dough they called zepolis and a really really small piece of spimoni cake. I asked for the wings to be extra crispy and they were not. They told me 30 mins at first then I got a text saying it was going to be an hour. I told them to please not ring doorbell I have a baby sleeping and big dogs that bark.... they rang door bell. Will definitely not eat here again nor would I recommend anyone to eat here"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here so far has been amazing! The pizza is by far my favorite and the garlic knots are out of this world! The cheese is stretchy and if you are more of a cheese person that a sauce person like myself then you will love it! I've had the philly sandwich and the sausage pepper sandwich. The everything pizza is my all time favorite! It weights like 10lbs!"}
{"text":"Solid service. Cozy little hole in the wall. The guys here are very courteous and polite. I had a quick lunch. For $5.99 I got a MONSTER slice and a coke. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmigiano hoagie for lunch. .. so delish!  It was big,  enough for 2 people OR save the other half for dinner!  The fries was off the hook as well! Great experience for my first time visiting,  no complaints here!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I eat here at least once a week and have never been disappointed. The variety on the menu hits whatever you are craving. Jason and the rest of the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place. The pizza the wings the fries, and the garlic knots  salad is pretty cool too. The delivery takes a little long considering I live 3 minutes away but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza - I really like the Hawaiian and the garlic knots are great too. Also the people that work here are always super friendly and attentive. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Really impressive, one of the very best pizzas I've had here in Vegas. The owner is really kind and really takes a lot of pride in his business."}
{"text":"Great little find here.  Almost a year old - if you are looking for a Chicago style pizza (Chicago thin), Chicago dogs with fries and Italian beef - some of the best comfort foods in the city.  The owner and staff are from the Windy City - so if you are from Illinois like myself....stop by and check them out.  Great food and friendly neighborhood eatery.  I will be back to try some of the Italian food and some pizza pie."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to Papa Pinny's. LOVED IT !!!!!    LOVED IT!!!!! Outstanding food. Garlic knots were delicious. Garlic bread to die for.  And the best hand tossed pizza in town . The owner, Papa Pinny, is quite the charmer. We were made to feel soooo welcome  John, that made our pizza, is now a friend.  Our family was treated like we were their family. What a lovely experience, what a delightful evening. We will be back soon.  Go! Enjoy! You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This pizza place has become a wonderful hole in the wall.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  The place is small.  Just a few tables.  But the service is 5 plus. The caprice was amazing.  Very fresh.   The house salad was also delicious.  I enjoyed the spaghetti which had fresh parsley.  Meat balls were A+.  Very good.   The lobster ravioli was excellent.  I also tried the clam sauce which was very good too.  One of the best in town I was told.  Someone also ordered the fettuccine and loved it.   So I highly recommend, but go with patience and to enjoy the atmosphere which is unique."}
{"text":"Not only is their pizza perfect and delicious, their customer service is amazing too. I ordered a 2 liter of soda but for whatever reason, it was forgotten for my delivery. After I asked about it and the driver confirmed it was on receipt and paid for, he actually left and came back when it within a few minutes. I can't that you enough for that steller service and and will be a loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"The pizza is wonderful, Driver can't really follow directions or find the location. Dunno why he couldn't see me waving my arms like a madman 50 feet in front of him with the headlights on. Oh well, at least the pizza is good, the fries are soft but taste fresh, and I'm finally back inside."}
{"text":"The garlic bread here is to die for. The salads are good. But the spaghetti wasn't that good....to me. The atmosphere was nice, staff were helpful, and the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations when I set foot in the establishment. Jason, the owner of Papa's really caters to his guests. But that is just the start. Hands down, this has got to be the best pizza I have ever had in the Las Vegas Valley. Jason uses all the freshest, premium ingredients he can get his hands on. The quality proves itself over and over with each single bite of pizza!!  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Papa Pinnys is a small cozy place. The pizza is around $30.00 but there are little coupons on the box. If you collect about 10 you get a free pizza.  The pizza is delicious and they are generous with the toppings. I'll typically start with the knots which are pretty amazing! They have minced garlic on the top with I think some olive oil. I don't waste any of it ! If some of it falls off I save it to put on my pizza. I love ...love garlic!   The customer service is great! I brought  coupons with me the server let me know which one would be the most beneficial.  My drink was also topped off often so that is always a plus for me. When you are thinking about ordering from a pizza chain I would suggest trying this place out! I like trying new things instead of eating the same old pizza. The knots are worth the trip alone!"}
{"text":"We tried to order delivery via EAT24, but we were out of the delivery area. I went on Papa Pinny's website and walla delivery!!!!  We ordered a large Supreme Pizza, a medium White  Pizza, Chicken Fingers and Fries, Pasta with Garlic and Olive Oil. Supreme pizza was very tasty, lots of great flavor, but the crust didn't support the amount of toppings. Wish they would have cooked a bit longer. The White Pizza would have been amazing except they use frozen chopped spinach, not fresh! I won't order that particular pizza again. The chicken fingers were great! Some of the best I have had, the French Fries were not crispy.... but it was delivered so I won't hold that against them.  The delivery part weighs in again with the pasta. The flavors are amazing! But wish the pasta was a bit more al dente. It's hard to have good pasta delivery!!! The side salad was great! That was a nice surprise for a pizza place!  This one was tough to review. Three stars because of delivery issues on the quality of the food, but I think if you eat in it would be much better!"}
{"text":"I forgot to write a review for this place! We went there a couple weeks ago because of its Yelp 5 star review. Not the closest pizza place to our house but the rating had us curious. We walked in and was greeted by Rosie. Salad, garlic knots, fries, pizza and cheese raviolis were all A++++! We assumed that Rosie owned the place because she made everyone feel like they were right at home. The food was killer and Rosie was the cherry on top of the experience!"}
{"text":"Papas the best called in the order on a busy work day nothing better the showing up to one hell of a piping hot pizza and a cold ice tea to make the day perfecto. Don't go anywhere else if you're nearby stop in and eat one of these guys supreme pies. Awesome staff and even better pizza.  Finally a mom and pop that has class!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The people are really nice, the food is amazing ... seriously legit Italian food. Try the Pinny's Supreme I have it all the time. He has a legit Chicago Dog with fries for under $5  bucks I have it all the time ... they have good beer too. They have TV's with sports and news. I found this place late one evening when I had a pizza craving and I think I'm here more than any of the employees :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just love this place! We came to LV from Chicago and it has been rather disappointing finding a good pizza place! I was so happy to find they offer gluten free crust! Hurray! The pizza is always hot, whether picked up or delivered, and we have not been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Pizza somehow arrived cold, burnt, and not cut all the way through. The Uber Eats driver was nice though. I personally would only eat in at this place so I could make them remake the food."}
{"text":"This is a family owned business so the people who work here care a lot about providing you with good service. They are very personalized and attentive. We ordered the Alfredo chicken pizza and it was great. The cheese and the Alfredo sauce just melted in your mouth.   This pizzeria also had a good selection of sandwiches and italian dishes so you have a good variety if u do not want to eat pizza. I was surprised to see a decent beer selection and imports such as Peroni. The place is relative small and it's best suitable for a quick and laid back meal. Overall, this is a good spot to satisfy your pizza crave."}
{"text":"Those garlic knots... o m g. I don't know what they put in the sauce they serve with them but I want to swim in it. I hope this is the sauce they serve on everything, I can't wait to try some more dishes.  This time, we got the Philly cheese steak and the Italian beef. They were both excellent. The Philly cheese steak is definitely in the list for re-order along with those garlic knots.  Did I mention the garlic knots? So they're amazing and chewy and doughy and garlicky and buttery delicious.  Delivery was fast too, I'll definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while looking for pizza nearby. What a find!! Great atmosphere, great food!!! Everything we ordered, and it was a TON, was delicious. Food was a 10/10, fabulous service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Greeted by a nice lady when my bf and I walked in. I didn't catch her name though. The place isn't very big, limited tables. There are a couple of TVs in there & filled with football stuff! definitely a place to hang out at for game nights.   So we ordered a couple of things starting with the garlic knots. Myyyyyy goodness. These were amazing! By far the best I've had in Vegas. Came out hot & fresh & just amazing. Probably my favorite out of everything that we ordered. We got a large margarita pizza & with the check-in, it's $5 off! I'm not sure if I even liked margarita pizzas before today??? Lol but this pizza was soooo good! Hot, fresh, crispy crust, good flavoring. Idk what else you can really ask for. We also ordered zeppolis ,or however you spell it, to go. These were okay. I'm not sure if it was cos we took it to go? They weren't bad though.   The nice lady always made sure to ask if we were okay, or if we needed anything, and made sure our waters were never empty. Really good customer service!   Overall, definitely one of the best pizzerias in the valley. Will keep coming back! Even if it's quite a drive lol."}
{"text":"Came here because of the high yelp reviews.  Thought i give it a try.     Ordered a small supreme with no olives.  It was alright.  Nothing special  Was hoping for it to be amazing as everyone raved about on the reviews.  But that didn't happen for me.     I did like the restaurant inside though.  Felt like old school Italian.  That was cool.     Would i come back...maybe if i was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, you can guess that I'm going to be picky about pizza. I live by myself, so I like to order delivery once a month. I didn't want to review after my first pizza' it was delicious, but a mess. I ordered sausage and green pepper and the sauce was to die for. I also ordered chicken parm done perfectly! I thought this was gonna be my place! So I ordered again last night, just pizza and wings and, once again, the pizza was a mess. All the ingredients had slid to the side and cheese was resealed. You know the look. The crust is so good, the sauce perfect, but they can't get it to your house cut and toppings spread all over. I don't know what the problem is but when you receive your pizza like that, you can't get that perfect, cheesy first bite. And of course, the left overs are a mess, had to tear the pizza in where I thought the slice was. Disappointed, this would have been my new pizza home. UPDATED REVIEW: The owner, Jason, was concerned that I had received my pizza in poor condition. I reordered today, and my pizza was PERFECT! Delicious, meaty, perfect crust! Thank you for being so concerned about your customers, I really appreciate that. By the way, I also ordered the Chicken Parm, and there is something so addicting about that sauce, it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit here and was even better than the first, staff was awesome as usual, you MUST get the garlic knots, pizza was GREAT! Defiantly a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza restaurant EVER! The hospitality was unreal! Everyone was so friendly and wanted to be serving you! The wine glasses were HUGE which is a total plus. The owner was the sweetest man ever! He wanted to take pictures with all of us! Their gluten free pizza crust was the best I have ever had as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"great food.  long wait for delivery (65 min), but was worth the wait.  To their defense, it was on a saturday night so thats kind of expected. New to the area, but will definitely become a frequenter."}
{"text":"They really, really know what they're doing here! Our pizzas were fantastic. The crust was thin, but easily held up to the mountain of toppings without getting soggy...throughout the whole meal. My son and the grandkids constantly commented on how good it was, too. I apologize to my daughter for ruining them on cheap pizza, but even the non-crust eaters ate the crust. The toppings are super generous. You could barely see the pizza under the ham on my son's half. For a supreme pizza lover, this is the place. Go for the super,   Heck, one of the kids noted that the Coke tasted like McDonald's Coke. I can vouch for that statement. Some places have their mix a little too syrupy, but this was spot on. They have a nice espresso machine, so they may have a great water filtration system, too.   Garlic knots? Check! Bruschetta? Check!   The mango sorbet was very good, but the banana/dulce de leche gelato was unreal."}
{"text":"I had been really sick for a while, I really wanted authentic simple pasta! My husband makes pomodoro sauce and also a garlic basil olive oil sauce. I wanted one of those. They have both! I ordered both and the side salads were huge with quality ingredients! Both of the pastas were homemade, fresh and just like the real deal ( my husband is Italian)   Also they are really good about double checking the orders for special instructions. Their prices are very reasonable. Every time I've called the store they have been really nice and accommodating!"}
{"text":"We love the food here! Although the inside is a little small, it's very comfortable. Owner and staff are always nice. The calamari is the best in town!! We have tried the pizza and subs, all has been great."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and pasta.  Quality is good, they deliver, and the service is impeccable."}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from here and the food was great! I had the chicken parmesan with a side salad and drink. Fast delivery and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this neighborhood gem!!  We had pizza, garlic knots and soup which were all delicious and the servers were friendly and attentive. All the customers around us also talked about how much they were enjoying their meals.   Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Garlic knots are a must to try. The pizza is amazing...addicting.  The sauce is delicious try the calzone with jalapeño peppers and pineapple.  Sooooo hood service great. Right next to laser tag.  Super convenient"}
{"text":"Awesome Super Bowl pizza, chicken wings and fingers! Food was ready to pick up in 20 minutes!!"}
{"text":"I found this place quite by accident a few weeks ago.  I was in the same plaza getting an eye exam with my daughter and decided to stop in for lunch while we waited for our glasses to be finished.  I had not read any yelp reviews before going there.  Seating are clean and inviting.  You can see back into the kitchen which was equally clean.  Awesome!  We were greeted and waited on by the manager, Dave who made us feel welcome.  He told us about the place, how long they had been there, etc...  It was just pretty cool to chat with him.  I kept it pretty simple for my first time in, I got a 2 slice lunch special and my daughter got the spaghetti.  Both were amazing!  I have been back several times since but always get pizza, it is that great.  They do have a chef there, not a \"cook\" who makes some great looking dishes.  I have seen what others around me are eating and I keep saying I am going to try something different, but I always stick with what I know.  Also now, our friend Rosie works there! We know her from way back and the most friendliest person you can meet.    This is my new local pizza hang out."}
{"text":"The Pizza at Papa Pinny's is excellent. We ordered a large with pepperoni and garlic to go. The car smelled awesome on the way home.We loved it! Great crust, excellent sauce which took me back to NYC and tasty pepperonis. I would say as an east coast guy who is a bit spoiled the only thing that keeps this pizza from being among the very best in Las Vegas is the cheese. The cheese is very good mind you but if they just went one step up in quality I would say it would take this pizza up to a higher level like Grimaldi's, Due Forni, or Settebellos, which are world class. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were recently in Las Vegas for a soccer tournament and looked for a place that could provide pizza for our team dinner.  We found Papa Pinny's online.  We placed the order and these guys delivered!  Even got a courtesy phone call to update us on our order.  They also provided all the extra needed plates, utensils, etc and four different salad dressings with the salad that we ordered without us even needing to request.  Awesome service and delicious pizza!  Way to go guys, you exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Wow, wow and wow. I was extremely impressed with the high level of customer service. I was ready to give a 5 Star review before eating!! It's a small hole in the wall family owned place. Exactly what we were looking for. We ordered off the website and picked up and it was ready at the exact minute it said it would be. The gentleman in there went above and beyond welcoming us, checking our order and making small talk.   It is a little pricy and I wish there were available coupons or coupon codes. The pizza was a little greasy but delicious reminds me of my hometown NY. NY pizza is hard to find out here so I was surprised. The gluten free pizza was delicious and cooked to perfection.   The wings are a great traditional wings!! Will defiantly be back when I'm visiting again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, great house salad with blue cheese , great chicken marsala tender great flavor. Asked to what we wanted to watch on tv, and turned it down so we could talk. Kept drinks filled. Guy who owns the resturant came by to see if we were happy. They also takeout."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall spot! Never knew about it until I yelped whats around me. And thank god I found this place there pizza is really awesome! And the service is just as good! This is my 3rd time ordering now and haven't been disappointed yet! A definite must try! But the only problem is that they close at 9pm during the week ."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique experience. Very friendly staff, large portions, great prices. Try the pizza challenge."}
{"text":"We have ordered from PPP twice in the last week or so. We loved the pizza and the pasta dishes (dinners come with a delicious salad). The service is excellent, and the owner is an A+ guy."}
{"text":"This was my go-to pizza place until tonight. Best garlic knots and stromboli I've had since I got to Vegas. Something changed over there since I last ordered from them. I'm sad to say that the Stromboli I received had under-cooked dough.. it was raw! I don't think it's my responsibility to heat it up more especially when I'm paying for a product that should be ready to eat. I was so disappointed :-( The garlic knots were also much smaller and not as good as before. The 3 stars is for the quality of food this time around where as before I would've rated it 5 stars. The only reason it didn't get 2 stars was because the delivery guy is the same and always super nice and personable."}
{"text":"First time here.  Greeted by Mr. Giovanni himself.  The atmosphere felt like we entered his home.  Live Italian music filled the whole place.   It was like you seen in the movies.  Since it was our first time I asked Mr. Giovanni what's the specialty and he recommended and explained several dishes.  My wife chose the Steak and Lobster and I had the Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo.  OMG!  Excellent!  Finished off the meals with thr New York Cheesecake.  Yum!  Thank you for your hospitality and great food.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all. Staff there is super welcoming!!! Second of all the pizza and bruschetta was absolutely amazing! Best pizza we've found in Vegas since we moved from jersey! We will definitely be going there again! If you're going just for apps be sure to grab two plates of bruschetta me and my fiancé fought over the last one :)    Thanks again for amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had a coupon for a BOGO pizza, so we thought we would give it a shot.  Glad we did.  Pizza was excellent.  Papa Pinny himself was there, and gave us some complimentary garlic bread while we waited for our pizza.  We ordered the meat lovers and the white pizzas.  The meat lovers had a generous amount of meat and a delicious, slightly sweet sauce.  The white pizza was equally amazing, bursting with garlic.  Papa even gave us a complimentary piece of his homemade cheesecake.  This is a MUST if you eat here.  Rich and creamy, with a fresh taste from the lemon zest in the filling.  I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome - we had the Chicken Parmesan and  the Margherita Pizza delivered. These guys know what there doing."}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone from here, and a 3/5 is about right. The food was hot, the delivery was accomplished in time stated, and the crust was crisp and well-seasoned. But, the meat and cheese were overly greasy, and seemingly old ingredients. Basically the least important features of the experience were amazing, while the whole point (what you eat) failed to impress. Maybe it was an off day, might try it when I'm in the area sometime~"}
{"text":"The food was hot and tasty. The garlic knots are delicious perfect amount of fresh garlic. Is family friendly and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Don't believe the good reviews. Apparently Papa Pinny figured out how to buy reviews on Yelp. The pizza is nothing special, overpriced and the customer service is inconsistent at best, but primarily irrational and hot headed. There are too many choices around to deal with all that. I suggest Pizza My Dear. The prices are fair, they don't skimp on toppings and they know how to treat people."}
{"text":"So this review is a couple days late we were in here Saturday night and OMG what a blast we had. We had a large group (4 adults and 4 kids) not only was the waitress AMAZING so was the owner as he came over and chatted. Rosie (I hope I got that right) you were as beautiful as anyone could ever be so much fun xoxo the pizzas were delish the beer was cold and they even brought cake and sang to our little birthday beauty !!! Thank you guys for such a great time we will for sure be back !"}
{"text":"Oh boy!! Are you looking for a place that has true Italian food. Well I got the place just for you! Oh yes I do! It Papa Pinny's Pizzeria... The food oh so good it feels like I just walk into Italy kitchen. Each bit you take you can taste the fresh products. They make everything fresh when you order. They are all very friendly and welcoming as if they had known you forever. The food is not slapped together like some place but made as if it they was serving their own family's. Best place that I have found so far...  The prices are very good to. Very reasonable.."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall pizzeria is definitely worth checking out. Walking in you feel immediately welcome with a warm ambience and friendly staff. The options on the menu vary, both in food and price. I got an extra large supreme pizza for about $20 but they also offer many other Italian dishes. They also have a great happy hour! 2 for 1 wine or beer, half priced appetizers, and free tapas with wine or beer. The service was great. Papa Pinny himself came out and took very good care of us. All and all it was a great dining experience and I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable date night!"}
{"text":"We yelped of course and ordered pizza by phone and did a pick up. Very friendly folk and we timed the pizza just right. The pizza was half cheese, half pepperoni. It was very good."}
{"text":"I'm actually reluctant to mention this pizzeria but, since I'm not in Las Vegas often, I won't be bothered by not being able to get a table. There is a hidden gem, on west Sahara Boulevard, Papa Pinny's Pizzeria.  Last evening, we enjoyed a very expensive family meal. This evening, we were looking for a good Italian meal that wouldn't require a second mortgage. Frankly, I was hesitant to dine at a pizzeria because we wanted a sit-down meal and more than pizza. Papa Pinny's was a great choice.  From our salads, garlic knots and garlic bread starters, to our entrées, that included chicken marsala and salmon, everything was exceptional. Rosie, our server, was very attentive and made terrific recommendations. I rarely give five star ratings but Papa Pinny's deserves it. Be aware that the atmosphere is pure pizzeria with limited seating.   When we return to Las Vegas, Papa Pinny's is on our dining list."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Pizza is great and the other menu items my family ordered were great too.  I had the chicken parmesan and loved it.  The salads were fresh and full of high quality ingredients.  Service was top notch."}
{"text":"Delivery time was estimated to be 25 to 40 minutes. It's now been 90 minutes and they are still not here and did not notify me when my order was going to be delayed. I don't care how their food taste with the service they will need to provide some type of recovery for me to give them a chance again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  We had the supreme, and it was very tasty. The staff was very friendly, asked how I had heard about them, and seemed pleased when I said that I had found them on Yelp. I highly recommend Papa Pinney's Pizzaria on West Sahara."}
{"text":"We have now been here several times and with several people.  Not just a pizzeria.  We have tried most of the items on the menu from Chicken Parmigiana to Pasta dishes to Lasagna to salads.  Everything is really great.  The BIGGA Meatball either as a side or with spaghetti is a treat.  Service has been very good.  They converted the small dining space from a regular pizza parlor to a nice little restaurant.  Very sophisticated food at very reasonable prices.  The pizza is good, too. Now that's Italian!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  Everything is so freah,homemade and authentic.  I might even come from so cal just for the meatballs!!"}
{"text":"Meh. We ordered a small pizza, chicken fingers with fries and another side of fries ($36 with tip) for delivery through the Eat24 app on a Thursday night and it took more than an hour to deliver. The food wasn't worth the wait in any sense. First, everything was lukewarm, at best. The chicken fingers were soggy and a weird texture (yuck), the fries were dried out and cold and the ranch was watery and flavorless. The pizza (simple cheese) was the best part, but it was mediocre: not good or bad, but at least not dripping in oil or something. We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"I could make this a blog about pizza. Don't worry, I'll try to restrain myself!  I ordered a 12\" pizza from Papa Pinny's Pizzeria, thru UberEATS (sorry, Yelp!). It is the first time I've ordered from them. I had a 12\" pizza with black olives, fresh garlic, anchovies, and shrimp. Loved the garlic, but it was very strong, so consider that if your date isn't gonna eat it with you!  I choose Papa Pinney's because 1. I'd never tried them before, 2. My usual go-tos were all closed, 3. They offer shrimp as a topping, one of the few places in Las Vegas that do, and 4. I always like to try new places. I'm constantly in search of the best!  Papa Pinney's pleasantly surprised me. A true New York style pizza, with a crusty rim but soft under crust, perfect for folding; a very fresh-tasting tomato sauce, and nice, melty Italian cheeses. I put it in a 250° oven for a few minutes, box and all, when it arrived, because delivery pizza inevitably ends up being delivered lukewarm. It was delicious!  I subtracted one star for two reasons: Their smallest pizza is a 12\", way too big for two people with small appetites and smaller wallets (although I'm betting this very good pizza will be great tomorrow, too); and although I'm thankful for the shrimp, please, Papa Pinney, remove the tails from the shrimp and chop them up, so I can have a bite of shrimp with each mouthful!  A hearty recommendation for this local pizzeria. If they chop the shrimp and offer a 10\" pizza, I'll upgrade my review to five stars!"}
{"text":"Jason the owner was really nice and very welcoming. One of the best pizza I ever had. And the calamari is bomb! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely excellent- but believe it or not, that's not the best part of the experience. We came in from L.A. and drove across town from where we were staying because we had heard good things. There's tons of places you can get pizza in Vegas, but from now on, in my mind- there is only ONE. PAPA PINNY'S!!!  We were immediately welcomed by Kiana and Tom who were both incredibly friendly. The restaurant is charming and inviting. It's exactly what a traditional pizzeria should be. We hit them up on a Monday night not during peak hours, so they weren't busy- but that may have been the best timing ever.   We ordered garlic knots and a supreme pizza. After we ordered, Kiana came out to offer us some complimentary wine. Shortly after that, Papa Pinny himself came out to introduce himself to us and talk with us about our experience. He also offered us some complimentary wine. Did I mention that he brought us out some complimentary garlic bread? Delicious garlic bread. Some of the best garlic bread I've ever had.   Really cool to watch a hand-tossed pizza being made like a true artist like Tom! And the pizza was delicious. Perfect mix of sauce and toppings. Loved it.   Like I said- the food is outstanding, but not even the best part of the experience. The best part is the people. Everyone was so incredibly kind and friendly. Tom and Papa Pinny kept coming over to visit. And there was a nice gentleman there named Scott. We talked a lot. We talked about hockey. We talked about Los Angeles and Vegas and Hughes Aircraft and you can tell- these people care about their customers. And it wasn't phony. These people are just genuinely cool, kind people. How often do you walk out of a pizza place feeling loved and respected? How often do you walk out of a pizza place feeling like you've made new friends? Feeling like family.  Papa Pinny has a guest book for everyone to sign. We were glad to sign it. And at one point, Papa came to take a picture with the family. We were told they were collecting photos of happy customers to put up on the wall at some point.   Long story short: I can't say enough good things about this place. And we love the people. We will be back. I can't wait to come back.  And maybe next time we'll take the challenge of the massive square cut pizza they offer!  God Bless Papa Pinny, Tom, Kiana and Scott and everyone there! TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new pizza place in town, and we found a winner! Def will be back very soon.  The garlic knots were to DIE for, very fresh ingredients on the Meat Lovers Pizza also! Cant go wrong with the Zeppolis for dessert. We dined in and the server was very friendly as well! Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"We order from Papa Pinny's quite regularly. Kids like the Stromboli, I love their Chicken Parmesan and the Hubs likes their Chicken Marsala. Love their white fish dinner, bummed they don't deliver it anymore. Overall their food is pretty good and consistent, delivery is usually pretty fast. Unfortunately though - they end up being very pricey for the amount of food, partly because their delivery fees are a little high. Good little Italian spot."}
{"text":"You'll feel like you stepped into Italy, and your tastebuds will thank you! Great ambiance, excellent service, ample servings, and DELICIOUS!!!! Will definitely come back (a LOT)!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this was awesome! We had, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, fries, and a supreme pizza. And I don't have one complaint about anything. I'm certainly no pizza expert, but this was a great pizza! I've never had a pizza that thick with a crispy crust. You have got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Good New York style pizza (yum!), friendly service, and open late! Highly recommended and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super impressive! I've called over here a few times now and from the moment they say hello the customer service is on point. The food is delicious, atmosphere is charming and everyone is incredibly pleasant, welcoming and helpful!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was average and the service and atmosphere were terrible. There are a few tables in the whole place so not a comfortable place to dine in by any means. Our waitress was an older Italian lady seemed like she was having a bad day. We were the only table in the place and we still had to get her attention to fill our drinks. In our opinion she should've retired 10 years ago. Maybe this place is better for delivery but in our opinion there are better Italian options in the area. Such as Roma deli for a great lunch or Nora's for great sit down dinner."}
{"text":"I had an incredible pasta dish with a nice salad and great bread.The price was great and the presentation was spot on and Jason runs a very clean restaurant with great hospitality. The pizza is amazing and I have heard the lasagne is also good."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town!  The prices are reasonable and the staff if very friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend the garlic knots as an appetizer.  You will not be disappointed. We always get the thin crust and love, love, love this pizza.  They have cold beer and lots of tv's so go spend an evening you will not regret."}
{"text":"Decent pies, a ma' and pa' store Italian chi-town memorabilia (I think) small spot on the map. Pizza's not the best but edible when you haven't had nothing all day. Being from the east coast Manhattan, what I like to do sometimes is a slice taste test and It would've been cool if they had slices any hr instead only during lunch time specials. It was evening and needed a quick bite but had to settle for a small pie. They probably were running out of sauce cause the 12inch I ordered didn't had much and it was like a light spread coating, the dough and cheese is what filled me up instead. I should've ask to put it back in the oven and cook it more for a mild darker edge cause the crust was too softy bread white all around. Maybe if I'm across the way next time I'll go for a well done thin crust. The women behind the counter was courteous and friendly thou. It's aaiight as we say .."}
{"text":"Hubby was wanting pizza and I was wanting some kind of pasta. This place was perfect for both of our cravings. The smells from the kitchen were amazing and the food tasted amazing as well. Customer service was excellent as well. Very clean dining and kitchen area. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I came for the garlic knots, I stayed for the pizza.  After reading the reviews about the garlic knots I decided they sounded worth driving across town for. Y'all were right and for that, I thank you! Covered in buttery goodness and chunks of real garlic, I'm a fan. I honestly would just order those along next time with extra sauce. Pay for the extra sauce people and dunk your little hearts out.  The pizzas were simply okay. I had their signature supreme and although it was loaded with toppings, it lacked in the cheese and sauce. The crust was delicious. A little crunch and a whole lotta flavour. The white pizza was delicious in flavour but the crust was a miss for me. Perhaps I could order the white pizza with the supreme crust next time? I dunno! I'll have to ask.  I did drive across town and back for the order (we're talking 20 minutes and then some each way) so no points deducted for the food not being hot. When I picked up the boxes the food was piping hot and my car smelled of marinara and garlic for days. I was able to order pickup through the Yelp app, my order was accurate, and the staff was super nice.  I was surprised to see the intimate space set up like a little Italy. Different styles of tables and chairs for your to dine in. They even have a few tables set up outside. It would be a really cute little date night spot. It's true love if you both order your own garlic knots and don't mind kissing after."}
{"text":"Love this place. My hubby ordered the Chicken Marsala and said it was the best he has tasted in a very long time. I got the Italian combo Sub and all I can say is it is delicious. Great delivery service as well."}
{"text":"Hanging out with the girls just had the best pizza in town .so yummy & delicious  chicken Alfredo pizza. . It was perfect delicious and extremely reasonable. Great service very polite extremely friendly & very clean ."}
{"text":"To support local biz, We've been going here at least every other week. It's close to home, and the pizza is satisfactory. However this last time, they got my pizza order wrong, and then did not double cut as we always get, and then argued about the situation after the fact. Not that hard guys.   I didn't blame the order taker or the pizza cook. But a guy came from the back and was totally disrespectful, full of profanity. I called for the owner who came from the back.  He was rather apologetic, but the guy from the back continued with the profanities. I could  not believe it. Giovanni , the owner, stood there and listened to him shout profanities and did nothing.  He disappeared after 2min.   Mistakes happen. I have no problems with mistaken orders. But I cannot believe the absolute poor service, profanities, and the owner cowering to an employee, despite clear mistakes. No, i will never be back. Giovanni is the new owner. He's in for a rough year.  There are at least a half dozen pizza places within a mile from here. It's not about one pizza order, right or wong. if I'm right, they will be out of business in 18months."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian food ever, not to mention the attention to detail in guest service. Amazing food, amazing staff!"}
{"text":"I was a bit confused if this place is under new ownership or not as the sign above it implied it was.  I thought the Garlic Knots were average, although I never seem to like bread appetizers as much as most people.  They were definitely loaded with garlic if that's your thing.    Pizza was solid.  Fairly thin and relatively crispy.  Sauce a bit too thin for my tastes and I actually like it a bit cheesier and greasier.  Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Few night ago I ordered for delivery and I was supriced how fast my food came and how good was it I will give you five stars and hope you will continue doing good job ..."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!Such a cute place, I like all the decoration,food is delicious, I had 16 ounce steak and 8 ounce lobster tail with home made cheese cake,very friendly staff and warming host, I had a very nice dinner even it was with my cousin and I paid the bill"}
{"text":"I came in twice. The first time I came in I got a cheese pizza extra sauce well done.  It was a little light on the cheese.  Came in and mentioned it. The chef says,\"say no more.  I got you.  Thanks for coming back\"  The next pizza was perfect.  This is NY style pizza.  Very small place.  Clean and tidy.  Great pizza.  ( that's all I have tried so far )"}
