{"text":"It is so hard finding a gluten-free vegan bakery, even in health-conscious San Francisco Bay Area. It's either gluten free OR vegan, never both. My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, soy, and eggs. He's never had a birthday cake since we've always celebrated his birthdays in the Bay. This year, we stayed home in Vegas and I was able to order from Ala Mode. Ordering online was easy and I got great customer service through email. I wanted blue ombre waves to resemble water for my son's shark-themed party and they delivered. And when I cut into the cake and saw the fluffy texture, I was truly impressed. That first slice of cake disappeared pretty fast! Ala Mode is a godsend!"}
{"text":"Ala mode is the best vegan bakery in Las Vegas.  Yes, I know it's the ONLY vegan bakery in LV, but those bakers who *think* they know what vegan is, should take baking lessons from Ala Mode."}
{"text":"A La Mode makes the best cupcakes!  I am vegan and have family members with gluten and dairy intolerance so it is nearly impossible to find something we are all okay to enjoy.  I have loved their vegan cupcakes and ice cream since they are Atomic # 7, and I can not wait for them to have a storefront I can swing by for a yummy treat whenever the mood strikes :-)"}
{"text":"They must be out of business. Tried calling it says to order on line. Tried there website but it's not there. Tried before on website it said they were working on out but sent messages but no response bummer!!"}
{"text":"For the amount i paid for a custom birthday cake, it definitely did not exceed or even meet expectations. I was very disappointed that the quality of the work on the custom cake was poor since previous reviews indicated they did great work."}
{"text":"I am writing this review a bit late. I got married August of last year in Las Vegas . I am from California and I was freaking with the idea that I would have to make my own (vegan) cake and transport it (from California) then decorate it along with all of the other wedding \"stuff\". I was elated when I found A la mode. Everyone I spoke with at A la mode was incredible . They paid attention to every thought and concern. I had some sample cupcakes overnighted to me and they were packaged perfectly and tasted super fresh and delicious. The wedding went off without a hitch, everything was perfect. When I arrived at the reception I saw the cake and it was beautiful. A la mode exceeded my expectations. The cake was delicious and everyone enjoyed it, non- vegans (everyone except me) could not tell the difference and loved it! THANK YOU A LA MODE!!!!"}
{"text":"The perfect solution! 
Thanks so much for the delivery of my Husband's birthday cake. It truly was delicious. I personally loved the flavor and how the icing was creamy and smooth but not sweet at all. Highly recommend your bakery. So happy we tried your goods out. I love that you are local. Thanks for providing the community a place to go for good ingredients and a better option for those who need alternative options."}
{"text":"We got a cake from here and not only was the cake wonderful they delivered it right to our door! It was the perfect size little cake to celebrate my sons 4th birthday and he loved it! Chocolate frosting and vanilla cake, so good. Must try!"}
{"text":"I ordered cupcakes from A La Mode for a little party the Canadian and I threw in our suite at the Bellagio. I was a little worried about the hassle because the website notes that our hotel won't accept deliveries from A La Mode for us, but she's a great communicator and the delivery went flawlessly. The cupcakes themselves were delicious and exactly the right size for serving at a gathering like ours. The texture is also great -- I wondered a little bit if a gluten-free baked good without eggs would have the consistency of a sedimentary rock, but that is 100% NOT the case with these! My guests and I agree that the lemon in particular was amazing, but the flavors were all delicious. One of my guests, who is both gluten intolerant and allergic to eggs, practically bounced with joy when I told him ALL of the cupcakes were safe for him."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how small the cake was.    But had the cake tasted awesome it would have made up for it.   It was one of the worst cakes I had ever tasted .    Very very disappointing"}
{"text":"Ordered the Lemon with lemon cream.  The cake was excellent and was above and beyond for a gluten free cake in terms of taste.   The yellow writing blended in the cake so that it was difficult to read.  It arrived on time and was great to have for the party for those who have allergies.  Would not hesitate to use again."}
{"text":"Will give 10 stars if I can!!
I ordered delicious cupcakes and 2 of the mix and loved it!! The best vegan treats I ate!!
The shipping was a little expensive but hey it worth it! High quality goods and the mix was easy to make!!"}
{"text":"A la mode was able to take an order for me less than a week away from my event and deliver a delicious cake more beautiful than I could have imagined! They also dealt with my crazed nervous emails gracefully and quickly responding to assure me everything would be fine. And it was. Just amazing to have a bakery able to offer gluten free and dairy free deliciousness. I'm so glad you exist! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I got a box of their banana cupcakes. It was certainly a surprise when A La Mode called me on my cellphone. They said I had a special delivery and asked if I was available in the afternoon to receive them. I'm not vegan but I do indulge in vegan food once in a while. Not all vegan dishes and desserts are bland or taste processed. Anyway, the cupcakes were fantastic. They were not dry and were a delight for my tastebuds. I have a couple vegan coworkers and I would highly recommend them to try A La Mode out."}
{"text":"We were married at the Harley Davidson Chopper Chapel, on Sept 1.  My family has some pretty wacky allergies, so I had to find a bakery that could accommodate them AND would deliver.  A La Mode stepped up.  We ordered the vanilla cake with strawberry filling and chocolate frosting.  We specified gluten and dairy free, the top two allergies.  (Truth be told, I have 75 specific allergies and don't know how they would have made a cake with all of mine included).

There were 7 of us, and his parents are NOT gluten free fans.  So, this was going to be a challenge.  A La Mode stepped up to the plate flawlessly!!!  

The cake was easily something we would have ordered prior to our allergy days.  It was simply awesome.  

We ordered the cake that was supposed to feed 8.  After dinner, it could have fed 16.  When it first appeared it looked small, but it is dense and moist.  Not heavy, just spongy...  there was no grainy funky gluten free cake texture.  

They delivered on time, and even asked if they could deliver closer to our wedding time so it was the freshest possible product.

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered my daughters 21 birthday cake she is vegan and it has to be perfect also ordered her a muffin basket all of it was great so great in fact that nobu kept our left over cake lol it never arrived back at our room like requested and we were told they accidental served it lol well I don't blame them it was fantastic !"}
{"text":"On time delivery even though I some how put the wrong address. And didn't even notice when double, triple checked it. The cake was so moist and delicious, it was for my fianc√©s birthday and he isn't vegan and he loved it."}
{"text":"I am using A La Mode for my wedding cake. My wedding is more than two months away, and I was so blown away by their cake samples that I felt compelled to write a review now. 

If you are vegan, you already know it is hard to find cake that is light and flavorful. If you are gluten free, you already know it's hard to find cake that is moist and spongy and not grainy. I don't know what A La Mode is doing (maybe witch craft), but they seem to have solved all of the above! 

Their samples blew me away. The cake was so moist and even fluffy! The icing selections were all smooth and the flavors not overpowering. The berry compotes were out of this world. You could really taste the natural flavor of the berries (unlike others that are loaded with sugars, syrups, and oils). I was literally licking the box to get all of it out!

I seriously do not know why Whole Foods hasn't jumped on this already and started carrying their product because it blows Red Velvet out of the water. 

I used to think Atlas in NYC had the best baked vegan goods but A La Mode has taken the cake (har har!). And they are considerably more healthy being gluten free AND organic."}
{"text":"I ordered a Strawberry Dream cake from this bakery for my Mom's birthday. The cake was amazing. The icing was light and just the right amount of sweetness, I do not normally eat icing from cakes, but this was too good to take off. The actual cake itself was moist and flavorful. Vegan or not, you will enjoy this cake regardless. I'll definitely buy more from them. Also the service is very friendly and the owner was very helpful. Every penny spent on this cake is worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered my wedding cake from A La Mode, and I couldn't have been happier with the results! I sent in my request with a photo, and they gave me detailed feedback as to how the cake would look. They delivered the cake, matched my colors perfectly, and the cake was honestly the best cake I have ever tasted, vegan or non-vegan! For reference, I got the chocolate cake, with german chocolate filling, and almond icing. For the second layer I got the lemon cake with vanilla frosting. Both were equally amazing, I kept sneaking off of the dance floor to eat more! No one knew it was Vegan gluten free, and everything commented on how delicious it was. I will order cupcakes from them for our one year anniversary, even though I'll have to pay to have them shipped. It was that good!"}
{"text":"Ginger used to own Atomic #7 which was the happiest place on earth !! A Vegan ( & everything else) Ice cream shop that was pure heaven !! (How we miss it) . This is her Vegan cake online store ... she's an amazing baker/creator .. the best we've ever known &we've tried lotsa vegan eats !!"}
