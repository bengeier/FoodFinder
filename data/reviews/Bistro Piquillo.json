{"text":"Warm service,  the homemade jams are delicious. I took the eggs Benedict, my fav was the muffin they served it on. Overall good but I wish the plates were more garnished (fruits maybe? ). I'll try dinner, the tapas and paella seem interesting !"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants que j'ai testé à Montréal ! Nourriture de qualité et très bon vins au rendez-vous. La serveuse et propriétaire est d'origine portugaise et le chef,son mari, est espagnol. Elle est très serviable et adore partager son savoir sur les plats, leurs origines etc. J'adore et je reviendrai !"}
{"text":"Back in Montreal!  It takes a little getting used to fact that not a lot of Montreal restaurants have Yelp reviews.  So I'm going to help contribute reviews for Montreal restaurants (especially for Montreal visitors).  Had an appointment at the Verdun hospital.  So glad that Wellington street was nearby.  Quickly looked at where I could grab lunch and came upon this highly rated bistro.  The ratings were deserved.  It's a really cute bistro located on a corner street.  Simple, countryish, clean decor.  Great tapas, friendly owner-staff (husband is the chef and wife is the server).  Seriously do get the octopus.  So tender!  We also enjoyed the sardines, stuffed mushrooms and cod nuggets.  Will definitely visit again!  Having lived in San Francisco for nearly a decade, this place reminds of some of the popular bistros in the Mission District."}
{"text":"Service was magnificent.  The food was obviously made by someone who understands how to treat every ingredient.  I am floored. Love it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that offers delicious Tapas and Spanish food, good for brunch or dinner. Its homemade dishes are professionally prepared (the cook worked under Gordon Ramsay), and the wife and husband duo are extremely kind people who make you feel like guests in their house. The restaurant is small sizes but perfect for the atmosphere, with a nice decor. Decent selection of Spanish and Portuguese wines!  Overall a great experience, great for a date or classy evening."}
{"text":"A nice place for brunch at Verdun, the owner is very friendly, make you feel at home, Spanish style food is quite delicious, small place but warm, must try !"}
{"text":"Good tapas. The benedict is ok-ish, eggs a bit overcooked. I liked the waffles. Sebun found it not sweet enough.  Occasion: catch up with Sophie during their visit back from China. Baobao met Zoey for the first time and had a cute hand shake with her.   Would go back for the tapas and maybe try the steak for brunch."}
{"text":"Small cozy atmosphere. Place sits maybe 25. Everything made out in the open by a capable Chef. Waitress is extremely nice and friendly. Great service. Tapas were fantastic. Sauce on the steak was a little salty for my taste. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for brunch, but can assure you that the food is prepared with heart and soul, the ambiance is lovely, and the coffee refills are abundant! Brunch is excellent, service is excellent, and don't get me started on those homemade jams! Highly recommend supporting this small restaurant in Verdin!"}
{"text":"Great Spanish food.  Octopus is very good.  Service is very good and moderately priced"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch.  The restaurant is well decorated,  the host is very pleasant and the food was really good. The homemade jams are a must have. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm just reviewing for brunch, as I haven't eaten dinner there yet. Both times, I had a variation of eggs Benny, including one with smoked salmon.  This was the BEST hollandaise sauce ever on eggs benny.  It was whipped to perfection and super light and fluffy. After my brunch,  I had to have a creamy desert which was quite good as well. The coffee was great with a bottomless cup. The price is not cheap but it's not crazy expensive.  The owners are super nice and you can tell they are dedicated to their work.  Can't wait to go there for dinner!"}
{"text":"In case it's a concern, owners are more than happy to concoct vegetarian eats for vegetarian customers at brunch. Nice variety of sauteed veggies, often seasonal veg from the garden."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a charming little venue and I tried the brunch service.  What I loved was the attentive and friendly service, the homemade jams and the setting. However, the coffee was just ok and my plate, a porkbelly, kale and egg casserole, was good but not exceptionnal. I would like to come back and try the paella as the service and place was nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic find. I had the eggs Benedict for brunch, very good. The chorizo was delicious. I will have to go back soon for tapas."}
{"text":"Quand on rentre dans le restaurant c'est comme si on entrait dans la maison d'une amie. C'est beau, mignon, ensoleillé. L'accueil est chaleureux. J'y suis allée pour bruncher et c'était vraiment bon. Je recommande pour commencer doucement la journée."}
{"text":"Brunch: impeccable classic Benedict eggs fluffy creamy hollandaise, smoked ham, and home made salty cookie, for 11.50$ what a great price for quality of ingredients. French toast was thick and served with home picked peaches, also great. Owners are super friendly and love cooking fresh and quality. Will try diner soon..."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. Great service. The owners are such amazing people. So friendly. I'm definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! Went for brunch with my family and we are looking forward to going back maybe for lunch or supper. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something authentic and unique."}
{"text":"C'est un incontournable des restaurants de Verdun! Les gérants sont des personnes adorables! Le cuisiner est espagnol et elle est portugaise donc chacun apporte sa spécialité de son pays !  Tout est fait de produits frais! Excellentes tapas, je vous recommande les acras de morues ainsi que les gambas à l'ail. Entrées assez copieuses et parfaites aussi pour les partagées. Pour ce qui est des plats principaux, vous ne pouvez pas partir sans avoir goûté à leur paella!! Un véritable délice culinaire bien espagnol !!  Très bon aussi le riz â l'encre de seiche!  Pour les adeptes de vin, ils ont des vins excellents d'importation privée !  Et bien entendu avant de partir, laissez vous tentez par les natas!! Les meilleurs jamais goûtées!  Vraiment je vous le conseille !"}
{"text":"I was wondering why one would need to make a reservation for 10 am on a Sunday morning, but about 20 minutes after my friend and I arrived at Bistro Piquillo, the place started filling up fast! The early morning escapade was worth it: the place is small, cozy, welcoming, comfortable and SO friendly. The food is delicious: hearty, healthy and plentiful. The dishes aren't ordinary eggs 'n bacon breakfast fare. Instead, we are presented with a creative, detailed and diverse menu to please the most finicky palate. The price is very reasonable for the way-above-average meal. I kept sneaking a peak at the food on other tables, and next time I'll indulge in those gorgeous golden fries. I will be back for sure. Run, don't walk to Bistro Piquillo!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and very warm atmosphere, in one hour spent at this place we became friends with it's owners. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had in Montreal. We arrived for a late Sunday brunch, probably after their typical weekend brunch rush. We were promptly greeted and given our choice of tables. The restaurant was very cozy, simply but tastefully decorated, and very comfortable. I felt like a friend had invited me over for a meal. After enjoying the complimentary bread and preserves, my friend had a perfectly cooked breakfast burrito, while I enjoy the Eggs Benedict.   I would love to go back to this restaurant soon. Unfortunately, my \"friend\" is now my ex, and my enjoyment of this wonderful place will probably be ruined by memories. However, as soon as a much better person comes along to replace him, with whom I can make even better memories, I will be sure to return."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful bistro, the owners are extremely friendly and the food is great. I left the restaurant feeling as though I had just had dinner at a friends home. The couple that own Piquillo are Spanish and Portuguese and the menu consists of a combination of flavours from these two cuisines.   We were a group of four and we're able to try almost the entire tapas menu.Highlights include: the oysters, Spanish Caesar salad and stuffed mushrooms. For dessert you absolutely must have the natas, they are by far the best I've ever had.   This little bistro is a real gem. I can only find two minor short comings the bread that they served was not the best and in my mind should have been served with Spanish olive oil and the presentation of the ketchup and mayo for the fries (they came in Heinz and Hellman's plastic bottles).  This restaurant is a great example of the great things that are happening in Verdun. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Super petit bistrot. Un choix raisonnable de plus bien maîtrisé. La salle est intimiste. Chaudement recommandé!"}
{"text":"Les propriétaires sont supers,  ils s'assurent vraiment qu'on ait tout ce que nous avons besoin!! Les plats sont généreux et très goûteux!"}
{"text":"Just found this place. Great Spanish inspired tapas and brunch. They also serve and sell homemade jams. Recommend if your in the Verdun area."}
{"text":"Bouffe originale, intéressante et savoureuse mais les portions sont très petites, considérant le prix."}
{"text":"Good service, the waitress was telly me story and that was interesting. The terasse was perfect. Cozy environement. Don't buy the chorizo (too dry)."}
{"text":"Superbe food, excellent service and an atmosphere to stay for. We were happy to stumble upon this local gem. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice small place, the brunch is good. I like their potatoes, smoke salmon. The brunch is not as much as other brunch, coffee is extra charge, 2.5 per person."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, from the Mackarel to the Black Rice with Cuttlefish to the exquisite Natas.  The only reason I put four stars instead of five was because I found the main dish was lacking in cuttlefish to make this dish perfect. Annabele was the perfect host, full of charm and always smiling and ready to share a story. Very quaint \"Bistro du quartier\"."}
{"text":"Had a brunch there with my bf. really a wonderful place. The food was absolutely delicious. I especially enjoyed the home made jam!"}
{"text":"J ai adoré ma visite chez Piquillo !!! J ai hâte d y retouner !!!! Nous y sommes allés pour le brunch, c était délicieux. J ai pris l omelette aux fromages en wrap, miammm, mon copain, le hemingway, il a adoré !!! Bella est adorable !!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little bistro owned by a passionate couple (waitress/pastry chef and cook). Great service and the quality of the food is out of this world! They make everything in house, have a garden to cultivate their own veggies and make their own jams, smoked salmon, special spicy piri piri sauce etc...A must try! Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Bistro Piquillo is one of these small charming restaurants I keep discovering in Verdun. It is a family business, husband and wife run the place that seems to be hugely popular during the weekend with the brunching crowds, I find their brunch pretty good, the poached eggs \"Hemingway\" with home made smoked salmon and the fried eggs with pork belly \"Huevos Campesinos\" are wonderful choices if you are in need of hearty breakfast.  Our first visit was with friends who have a little boy. Our host who takes care of the tables was so attentive to him. That said the service in Bistro Piquillo is superbly friendly, but the extra attention given to the kid was simply amazing.  Yesterday I chose to have a proper lunch at bistro piquillo. The goat cheese salad from the tapas menu was a perfect starter, the star turned to be the Sunday roast, healthy portion of roasted lamb slices, finely cut and arranged on top of variety of veggies. Sunday roast needs a glass of red wine and we were recommended delicious Spanish red,  perfect match for the food and my weekend optimism.   One small note, I don't like their coffee very much. Drink your coffee somewhere else and go there for the brunch. The delicious lunch we had is an indication about a potentially glorious dinner I could expect in Bistro Piquillo. The tapas menu and wine list consisting of Spanish, Portuguese wines are the other factors suggesting I need to visit again. I've started planning it and will report accordingly soon!"}
{"text":"Cute bistro owned by an adorable couple Came here for a tapas dinner and was slightly disappointed by the very small menu. What we had was good, not extraordinary and the prices were fair.  I'd like to come back for brunch since that seems to be their true specialty!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning.   I overslept we  my girlfriend and both of us needed a  good hearty breakfast.  I just loved this place.  Not only did we both get a very tasty meal.  The complementary jam was just perfect."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review to keep this place a secret as it excellent! Small, in an unassuming building a block behind Wellington. we went for supper on Friday and were lucky to get the last table. First the service: It is a small place run by the owners, a couple who have a passion for food and wine. They love talking about the food and the history behind it with the Portuguese and Spanish influences. Very knowledgeable not only about the food but also about the wine, we had some out of the ordinary wines which were excellent and reasonably priced. I cannot say enough about the service and \"at home\" atmosphere. The food: We elected to go for the tapas and wow! Everything we had from salad to squid was excellent but the must try is the blood pudding/sausage simply excellent - my girlfriend who is not really a fan ended up eating half of it . I cannot rant or rave enough about Bistro Piquillo. It is not cheap , but worth every penny spent!  This is what dining out should be about, if you are looking for the \"rock star' chef experience don't go here. If you want great food, more than exceptional service, feeling at ease in a local, comfortable atmosphere this is the place."}
{"text":"Great food! The owners are a wonderfully energetic couple. You must try this place, both for dinner (musts : tapas and tartare) and brunch"}
{"text":"5 étoiles pour les saveurs !! Aussi les assiettes tapas sont quand meme consistantes meme si petites, servie avec pain et fromage, belle presentation , bon service, prix raisonable."}
