{"text":"CROWDED, too many people for the space. Ran out of all the meat-based dishes the night we went, and it was early evening when this happened. LOOOOONG lines for what food was available, slow service. Small portions. Ugh. Go to the one in Chandler instead."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this festival. It's in October so it can be pretty hot. They have lots of shade areas set up.  We do the \"inside\" food because we think it tastes better. The lamb shank is delicious and just falls off the bone. Other favorites include the potatoes and mousaka. The stuffed grape leaves..... not so much.
 They run out of Baklava on midday Sunday so be sure to purchase on arrival. The nice ladies will hold it for you so you don't have to tote it around the grounds. We inevitably try on the Greek Fisherman's hats or a T shirt, or jewelry, and always find something to buy. It's a fun afternoon listening to live tunes, eating great chow and getting in touch with my inner Greek."}
{"text":"We went with a huge group to this festival in 2009. I wasn't expecting much after visiting the Greek festival in Tempe, but this one blew us away.

Fist of all, it's huge, and super organized. There are all kinds of merchants and places to get food, as well as dancing and other activities. 

The food was unbelievable. All kinds of fried goodness, meats and different things to drink (however I am NOT a fan of ouzo, black licorice tastes like vomit to me).

The dancing was fun to watch and the crowd was really pleasant and easy to be around.

I would definitely recommend this, and am planning on making it an annual stop. Some say Phoenix lacks vulture, but you just have to look closely and you'll find it all over the place."}
{"text":"Have been to a number of these, but today was the first time in awhile.  Great family event with tons of arts, crafts, performances, and of course great food.  Parking is a little bit of chore if you don't get here at the opening bell (I recommend parking on 20th Street along Granada Park), but once you're inside its pretty easy to get around.  The dance performances in the main stage area are an especially great treat.  The food and drink lines can get long, but move pretty fast.  In terms of food choices, I recommend the dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with beef and rice), saganaki (flambeed cheese & wine), souvlaki (chicken or pork skewers), and the baklava sundae (yes, thats right, baklava mixed with ice cream).  Highly recommend coming at or near the opening bell if you wanna avoid the bigger crowds.  All in all, a great valley event beaming with tradition, great for Greeks and non-Greeks alike."}
{"text":"Have been going for years for the festival and food and wow, have they really slipped.  Won't bore you with a long list, but suffice to say the attitude at the door and in the food area is, well, crabby.  Just a couple examples: After paying to go yesterday, and spending a lot, we came back today for \"take out.\"  As my family sat in the running car by the entrance and I jumped out to pick up about $100 of take out food for 10 people, I was hassled.  They wanted me to pay for the festival even though I was only picking up takeout food.  Then, inside, a woman in the food area got snippy with me about the line.  Apparently, I was not waiting where she wanted.  No problem  I'll move.  She pointed to a Disney Land line of ropes and poles that was totally empty.  Ok.  So I hopped under a rope (since the line was totally empty and I wasn't cutting anyone off) rather than walk through the long, empty, maze.  Mon dieu!  Apparently that was a huge infraction and the lady yelled at me.  Really??   Bottom line, I come here for fun and food and although the food is yummy, it diminishes in appeal with served with a huge slice of snark and attitude.  I sure hope the festival committee works on their community relations for next year!"}
{"text":"Good Greek delicacies and culture. Can't wait til next years festival. OPA!"}
{"text":"I went with the bf and his friend on Sat night.
What seemed like cons weren't:
Don't park at the fest, park for free at Chuck Schwab on Lincoln, and take free shuttle.
Long line for food? Moved quickly.
Very crowded, looking for seating? Just keep walking, tables were meant to be shared with your extended Greek family.

We pretty much had a smorgasbord of as many tasty options as we could and shared or at least tried each others food.
My personal favorites: The chicken, Greek fries, Loukoumades (honey balls!!!!), and dolmades with beef and the lemon dill sauce mmmmm!!
The Mythos beer was tasty and stronger than Bud Light.

The chicken souvlaki was a little disappointing, and I am spoiled and much prefer my bf's pastichio (Greek lasagna). The tubey noodles were interesting, but the sauce just didn't have that extra special something. Maybe not enough cinnamon?
Prices were okay, nothing unreasonable for a fest. Some portions were more generous than others, but just get what you like.
All the good Greek pastries were available please excuse my spelling, but at least I can pronounce them- melamakarna, koudambethes, baklava, the Easter bread, and more.

There was beautiful artwork and jewelry to look at (or to buy if you have more money than me), Greek merchandise with funny sayings on the tshirts and aprons, and of course, charity tables, because it was at the Greek Orthodox church, and it's good to help others. The best part was, you think you've seen all they have to offer, and you realize there's another room of stuff to look at, eat, etc.

We go almost every year, I like this location better than when it was in Scottsdale, and we'll be back next year."}
{"text":"I have been to Many of these and Holy Trinity in Phx has to be one of the top ones I have attended. Food is authentic and fresh. The Feta cheese is outstanding! Loved all the small shops and the fact I could find kasseri cheese. Friendly staff and generous portions."}
{"text":"I've been coming for years. Paid $3 for adult entrance fee. We arrived at 7:00pm on a Saturday night. The place was so jammed we couldn't even walk. Shuttles were bussing hundreds in as we stood there with nowhere to move. Food lines for even less desirable options were no less than 45 minutes with the indoor popular items at least 1.5 hours. Uncomfortable, no seats. We left. They have let this slip over the years. No longer fun. I'd pay money not to come. Please plan for your guests and don't oversell the venue. A shame, used to be a unique and fun Phoenix treasure."}
{"text":"I took my group home of 3 DD adults to this festival on Sat. I did not mind paying the admission charge until I realized we had spent money for the privilege of spending more money. I expected more entertainment, especially for a festival that advertised their corporate sponsors near the entryway, and some free activities. Nope sorry, one stage where there were two amazing musicians at the time we were there. 
The food was mostly priced more than my guys could afford, and not looking Greek, or at least I think that was the problem, we had a hard time even getting someone to acknowledge us to take our orders.
I was having to order separately for  3 of us, and in the confusion, the drink server insisted we had not paid for one of the drinks. I argued with him, and then thought he might be right, so I ended up paying twice for one soda. Because it was one of the guy's drink, and I am responsible for handling his funds on outings, I had to replace that $2 with my own money. Not nice to rip people off on church grounds.
I had been to another Greek festival years ago, and found the people warm and compassionate, and totally enjoyed it. I found these people to be borderline rude, and certainly not caring. I will never return to this fest, and I will never have the same good feelings the other festival created in me towards the Orthodox faith. Perhaps it
is the economic situation in the mother country, but all I saw there were greedy people, teaching their children greed by showering them with money as they dance, charging admission for no reason other than they could, overcharging for food which was only marginal, and actually stealing from the disadvantaged, even if it was inadvertently."}
{"text":"10/09

Went by myself to the Greek Festival.  I really encourage others who want to take these excursions, but are hesitant to go by themselves.  It's a great way to check out events w/out the worry of boring your other companions who may not enjoy the same types of activities as you, plus you just might make new acquaintances!  Had I not gone tonight, I would've missed out on the chance meeting of two dear friends (a coworker and her adorable father), and consequently meeting her aunt, Greek uncle, cousins, and nephews!  And I thought I was the sole Asian among this lot of Greeks- I think I spotted only a couple of Indians and African-Americans in the three hours I was there!

For $10, I purchased a spanakopita (spinach and cheese-stuffed phyllo-dough pie, $3), dolmades (lemon-infused rice and beef-stuffed grape leaves, $3 for 2 pcs.), and pastitsio [Greek-style \"lasagna\" of pasta (rigatoni), meat sauce, and bechamel, $4).  I didn't care for the spanakopita as it was all butter-laden phyllo and not much filling, but the dolmades/dolmas were very flavorful.  The winner, all around the table, was the pastitsio!  Loved, loved, loved the bechamel sauce!  Other tablemates purchased and shared their choices of moussaka, an eggplant, meat sauce, and bechamel layered baked dish (delish!);  saganaki (flambeed cheese, commonly Kasseri or Kefalotyri) w/ stale pita bread; and loukoumades, Greek-style doughnuts soaked in honey [I've never favored this greasy-tasting pastry... biting into one always makes me wish I was eating gulab jamun, an Indian sweet made by deep-frying milkballs (milk solids and flour), bathing them in rosewater/saffron syrup, and then topping them w/ cardamom seeds] instead.  For dessert, I bought take-home packs ($8 each) of kataifi- one of my fave Greek sweets- made with shredded phyllo dough, nuts, and honey; and baklava, a multi-layered pastry of phyllo, walnuts, and honey.  (Of course, I portioned a few for the table to enjoy along w/ me.)  Both were very good, w/ the kataifi being less sweeter than the baklava, yet, to a friend and me, more delightful w/ the added textural surprise of the shredded phyllo!  Enjoy the photos!"}
{"text":"This was my first Greek culture festival, and I had a great time. There were rooms and rooms of Greek apparel and kitchen items. This includes authentic ingredients. Also there was other stuff \"just because\", you know; just because it's a festival, such as a variety of oil paintings. We got a tour of a tiny museum of the history of the Greek community in Phoenix, and the tour was given by a lady whose parents were in the old photos on the walls. Pretty amazing.

I thank the festival folks for the free parking and shuttle. It made it very nice. If I had to suggest an improvement, it would be for customer service, because my buddy tried to buy ouzo but the guy behind the booze counter looked right past her and helped the men behind her instead. All of the other counter people were great; very helpful, but that one... left an impression. 

The gyro was tasty. We got a plate of doughnut-type pastries that were either filled with or drenched in some kind of sweet syrup. It was like biting into a lava doughnut, with cinnamon. We got the larger size, and that one plate was more than we both could eat. The chocolate-syrup-drizzled baklava was in a MUCH smaller portion, but also an experience to repeat. 

To me, the Greek dancing looked like European folk dancing. They had live music, and exhibition dances from various age groups.  It ended with an open dance floor in the evening. That was very popular, and when the colored lights came on and the bright white lights went out, there was a roar of appreciation from the crowd. The whole festival, people seemed happy."}
{"text":"The dancing is so cute, the music great and the food blew my mind!! Be sure to grab a gyro, Greek fries and a BAKLAVA SUNDAE.  Yum yum yum!! There are also lots of vendors to buys jewelry, art, T-shirts etc.  there is also a market to buy pita, olives feta etc.  The authentic food was the highlight!  Can't wait till next year!"}
{"text":"How could one guy play the bouzuoki that fast for two hours straight?"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Greek festivals so I guess this is what I am judging against. The parking there was not too bad. I do not know if it is because there was not a lot of people there at 1200ish or what. We paid one of the $5.00 at the church/festival so we got pretty close. There is street parking available, but there weren't that many people parked on the road. The admission was only $3.00 for adults, I think 12 and under are free and senior citizens are free. So we went with 5 and paid a total of $6.00. Well there is the good stuff. The food is different places. The ones that are highly visible are the ones that are quite expensive. 3 sticks of little bit of chicken was $8.00 a Gyro was $6.00. The Gyro meat was preformed pattys. It was ok, ok if you are really hungry. The flat bread for the Guro was good too No sides with anything of course. There was a place inside that looked like you could get a good helping of food for around $12.00. After lunch my kids was to go jump on the bouncy houses so I was headed to take them. I then hear my wife calling me. There is a sign saying how much it cost to let your kids get on the jumpy house.  Well that was done, $14.00, sorry that was the end of that. Now my wife and her mother want to check out the vendors to see what they are offering. Just about every vendor selling the same products, custom jewelry and skirts with brass like coins on them. It was good to get the kids out of the house, but should have gone somewhere else and spent less money. Sorry I wouldn't go back."}
