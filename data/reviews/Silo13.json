{"text":"Very small place,
Difficult to find not straightforward. It's in one of the retail shops in a building.

Just a regular small cafe but instead of coffee there was cereal. Seemed over priced for one bowl! You can probably get a whole pack at a store for the price of a bowl.

The selection of cereal was also disappointing, very little and none unique at all.

Wouldn't recommend going out of your way for this one"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Cereals from Europe, rare cereals you can't find anywhere, cereals I remember from my childhood, it is really amazing. The people who work there are very, very friendly and helpful. I took a standard bowl of cereal home and it lasted for days. Not kidding. You get a lot ...A LOT for your money. The choice of milk option is really amazing as well, you get it in these lovely little bottles. The decor is fun with graffiti and subdued lighting. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for an idea as awesome as this.. and they did not disappoint. The girls who work there were super friendly and helpful. Atmosphere is very nice. The cereal choices are awesome, lots and lots of choices. On top of this they have lots of different milk choices, and even more toppings choices. You can eat as much as your bowl will fit, all for $10. If I lived closer I'd probably be here almost every day. They do take out as well. Love this place. Also a bonus: they use paper straws instead of plastic; thank you from the earth. Highly recommend *two thumbs up*"}
