{"text":"Chicken Paprikash was just as good as I hoped! Best Chicken Paprikash in Parma!! One order is HUGE good for sharing! I like doing take out. Definitely a neighborhood dive bar feel where regulars love to be!"}
{"text":"Stuff cabbage diner was the worst I ever had in my life OMG could not eat was take out we don't live far diner was cold.shame"}
{"text":"Our first visit here.....was great.  Heard about the chicken paprikash so tried it.....awesome.  We also tried the goulash, also excellent.  Good food, friendly staff and reasonable prices.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant quite often because I love the food. Tonight will most likely be my last visit. 
Our server was efficient although not overly friendly. She didn't review any specials or try to upsell anything but did cover the basics of her job. The three that were working were more concerned with sitting on the other side of the wall and talking rather than taking care of customers. Two other parties came in after we sat and were told you are welcome to come in but we are closing in twenty minutes. You can sit in the bar of you want but don't feel like you have to, I can take care of you if you would like. She made them feel unwelcome. That is unacceptable in the hospitality business. The first two ladies went to the bar without being seated in the restaurant. The family that came in and heard three times after being seated that there are no specials because we close in twenty minutes but I can still take care of you, we close early today and we have been slow anyway so you can go to the bar. I would have left and I think they might have. Either way, I felt we were rushed, unwelcomed and it is a shame. The food is delicious but customers should feel welcome. I am in the service industry and was very disappointed in the server that did all the talking to arriving guests. When did servers stop wanting to make money? Maybe she should find a new career path. Four stars for the delicious food."}
{"text":"I found this place to be a little interesting on the inside. It was very dark and only the bar area was open on a Saturday afternoon. I of course ordered the pierogies- I wouldn't order them again only because I have had much better. I was a little put off as well when I tried to order the pierogi meal with the french onion soup. The bartender told me it would be a $4 up-charge for that specific soup, yet soup was included with the meal and a bowl of it on it's own was $4,25 and other soups were listed for the same price...It was just very strange!"}
{"text":"The Clubhouse is a family restaurant type of place, with an expansive menu of traditional Hungarian dishes and pub grub. Their corned beef is really tasty, as is their chicken paprikash. They have nightly specials like chicken and liver as well. Old people definitely like this place as we were the only people dining who were under 70 ( I think everyone would agree that 70 is old). Our waitress was great with the older crowd and has developed a really, really loud voice to accommodate the seniors. I surprised myself and I actually sort of like this place. It is Parma at its best (or worst, depending on how snobby you are). 


The dining room is in the back, so don't get confused when you walk into the bar. There is definitely a slightly creepy dining room most likely filled with old people."}
{"text":"The food was awful!  My husband had the chicken paprikash and saod it was not even edible, mind you he's polish and knows what it should taste like. The Portobello pasta I had was so bad I sent it back. The service was just okay. I can say that we will never return."}
{"text":"Hands down best Hungarian goulash I have eaten, better than my moms! The beef was so tender I could cut it with my fork. The dumplings took me back to my childhood but these actually melted in my mouth. My friend got the Lake Erie perch & fries which was also phenomenal. The fish is lightly breaded & the fries are fresh cut. Highly recommend for the food....not so much the atmosphere but the staff makes up for that. Can't wait to go back & try the chicken paprikash!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and kitchen always open till close. Yankee pot roast is my go to every wed"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices, great local spot if you live in the area. They are known for their chicken paprikash but the menu was plentiful. They have a great assortment of foods, from salad, to wings, to chicken and pasta dishes.

Naturally I tried their signature dish as I mentioned above, and it was AWESOME. so flavorful and delicious, my husband had their lake erie ribs and he said the meat just fell right off the bone. A half slab is perfect for one unless you're really hungry.

The wait and Bar staff were awesome, super friendly and helpful. Im glad this place is local, its always busy but the wait isnt obsurd and its totally worth the price.

Great meal!"}
{"text":"When in the mood for chicken paprikash, this is the go-to place. If salads, dressing were better, I would give 5 star"}
{"text":"Clubhouse is some of the best food around, but if you don't want to watch judge Judy or murder she wrote reruns, eat in the restaurant, not the bar....its littered with regulars and professional drinkers...as for food of course try the hot wings and the grubby one burger!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, it's a bit unclear on why this place is ranked so highly. I see a lot of notes about the chicken paprikash, but before my diet changed, I had it. The individuals who think this is the best chicken paprikash they've ever had must not have someone who makes chicken paprikash. It isn't bad, but it is far from the best. No where near any home cooked paprikash I've ever had, and I can give you three places off the top of my head that will blow it away. 

Now, MY visit. A Saturday night in Parma isn't going to be anything special, but the restaurant was pretty empty. The non bar area is exclusively seating people who want Eastern European food, but are too old or lazy to make it themselves. I don't criticize or judge others for their lifestyles, that's their business, so do not take this as judgement: Everyone in here was either over 70 years old, or would be classified as obese. It isn't the place to go for healthful or well balanced meals.

There is no one seating people, rather you walk in and just sit down. The podium for the hostess is covered in their...stuff. Our server, Rosalie, was nice and polite. She was also reasonably (but not overly) helpful in trying to find something on the menu that would fit my dietary needs. I landed on...a potato. Yea, I seriously had a potato for dinner...this is the only option they had for me. 

My issues really where the bathroom. This was a three, possibly edging towards a four, until I went into the bathroom. They seem to have tried to remodel it, but gave up 75% through. They could use more frequent visits to follow up on customers not flushing, and a tad more space, or making it a single person. I physically did not fit in the urinal, or at the sink. As in, when I tried to wash my hands, the divider flopped over to the right and I was putting pressure on it trying to get my hands on the sink. The soap was out, and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. 

I know people often don't think of the restroom as a symbol of the business, but I see it like the kitchen (and often notice this correlation). It is a staple area, used by the staff, that is rarely seen, and rarely mentioned. Not off limits, but not really talked about. If the associates (or management) care, they clean as they go, or they notify that attention is needed. This should be as clean/well maintained or better than the kitchen, a place customers can't go...so what does the kitchen look like, and what shortcuts do they take there? Clearly the staff isn't using soap when they wash their hands."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and decent prices.  I had the chicken paprikash, it was good, but not the best I have ever had.  The onion soup was very tasty, but the soda we had with dinner was flat.  My wife had the white pizza and she enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Parma area, so I can rag on it all I want.  

The ambience here sucks.  It's a crappy suburban diner type place with padded tablecloths and paper napkins wrapped around cheap silverware.  But hey, that's how family restaurants are sometimes and the owners are good people.

That said, the Chicken Paprikash is the best I have ever had next to my Grandma's and when I made it myself once.  The sauce is perfect, chicken juicy, and the dumplings  large.  Would prefer the dumplings be a little lighter, but who other than my grandmother would spend so much time ensuring their fluffiness?  Heavier dumplings are easier and faster to make, so I can't blame them for their density.  The salad is pretty tasty too, for a simple iceberg.  

If you have to be in Parma for any reason and like Hungarian or Czech/Slovak food as much as I do, it's a must visit...or, at the very least, pick up their huge portions and have dinner at home."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and friendly, I can't say enough good things about this place. The Chicken Paprikash is awesome!"}
{"text":"So my mom decides to treat my family to dinner and we see the sign that says \"Oktoberfest Menu\" so we decide to eat here. You figure a restaurant that serves pretty decent paprikash couldn't screw up an Oktoberfest menu so we ordered the wienerschnitzel, which is basically breaded and pan-fried pork. They bring it out and it looks like a deflated fish fry because they used batter and deep fried the pork! So we cut it in half and took a bite and it was very chewy and overcooked. No problem... Just send it back and get the Wurst plate instead. How can you screw up sausage? The wurst plate comes out and we try the bratwurst and it has the uncanny resemblance of the brats you would make for a cookout with burgers. As for the knockwurst, oversized hot dog. We have been to some pretty decent German restaurants and know what these sausages are supposed to taste like. For $16 a plate that is what I expect from an Oktoberfest menu. So we tell the manager how dissapointed we were and she said, \"We only serve the very best to our customers, those are Johnsonville.\" I rest my case. We still had to pay for our $16 hot dogs that we didn't eat. I will not be eating there anymore. If you want good German fare you might want to go to a German restaurant."}
{"text":"The bar is dark and dingy like most Cleveland hole In the walls, the restaurant is nothing to write home about, but the food is awesome. Great Eastern European home cooking, with the best chicken paprikash I've ever had. Truly a hidden gem to say the least.  The five star rating is defiantly for the food, not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've always wanted to eat here but never have. Came here tonight and I ordered the chicken paprikash  and my husband ordered a bacon horseradish burger. Both were really good. My husband always orders his burgers medium rare but they usually come out over-cooked, not this time. It was perfectly done. 

Was a good dinner!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a fun place to drink but unfortunately now all it is, is a bunch of old fart's who want to watch sports on tv on a Saturday night and complain if you want to play music on the jukebox. Food is good though."}
{"text":"stopped in to have a Hungarian dish called Chicken Paprikash.  it's white meat chicken and dumplings smothered in a paprika cream sauce.  it was homey and good.  friendly service and reasonable prices.  2 draft beers and two orders of Chicken Paprikash came out to $35"}
{"text":"Holy Old People.  That was my first thought when I walked in this place.  Holy AMAZING CHICKEN PAPRIKASH.  That was my last thought walking out of this place."}
{"text":"This place was a warm respite on a wintry night. We were given a choice between 3 of the 6 beers on tap. There were four TVs playing sports and a few people watching and doing play-by-play commentary. Mostly harmless. Being vegetarians, we did not partake of the supposedly amazing chicken paprikash. I'd be willing to come back here if you buy me free beer."}
{"text":"The Clubhouse, though small for some tastes, offers quality food and service without pretention or long waits. I strongly recommend the Beef Stroganoff and Chicken Paprikash entrees and the Tuna Melt if you are looking for something quick. It's nice to go to a bar that has seats readily available to grab a reasonably priced meal and drink and listen to some Led Zeppelin while you wait."}
{"text":"Hate to do it because the food is really great, but that old bag behind the bar needs to learn how to take care of the \"guests\" much better. I get the elderly get cranky, but don't tell me to \"go to Hell\" when I come in there to solely spend money and enjoy myself... the girls behind the bar barely had any clue how to take a card, and swipe it through a machine. Telling me I don't know what I'm talking about because the granny said she's been \"doing this for 40 years\"... obviously not. I work with the same systems at my job and do it all the time, and when I tried \"helping\" her understand how to do it she was too stubborn and senile to learn. Now I'm going to enjoy my chicken paprikash angry. FOOD IS DELISH though!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my most favorite go to places in Parma. If we are unsure of what we feel like for dinner, the Clubhouse is my fallback. The food is phenomenal- especially the Chicken Paprikash. Dare I say, it's almost as good as my grandmothers. I have never had food I didn't like here and I have had most of everything on the menu. The bar also serves food late night which is nice on the weekends! I highly suggest coming on Saturday nights as that's when they do karaoke and music trivia. All of the bartenders are extremely nice and the kitchen staff is extremely friendly as well. I would definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Son & daughter-n-law tooK us here during our recent visit from MI.  After being told our wait would be 15 mins at 5:45pm on a Saturday night, we were seated an hour & a half later.  (The restaurant has 2 tables for 8; all other tables are for 4 persons.  There were 6 of us, so we had to wait for 2- four person tables that were adjacent to each other to clear.  Much harder than it sounds apparently.). We ended up order one dish of chicken paprikas and feeding it to our grandson in the lobby -because after waiting for 1 hour & 30 mins - he was starving!  
After finally being seated, we ordered Hungarian goulash, beef stroganknoff, Italian peppers & sausage and Chicken paprikas.  The beef in the Hungarian goulash resembled dog food.  The stroganknoff noodles were like fettuccini; not the egg noodles we expected?  The marinara sauce on the Italian dish was pretty poor and the sausage was scarce.
One star for perogies and the IPA on draft.  Otherwise - not going back; no; Never!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were talking about The Clubhouse today. It really does look like a strip club from outside. We both agreed the chicken paprikash was our favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place for Chicken Paprikash. The chicken is tender and with dumplings that are not big and doughy. Just got a side salad with it. Small plate size was plenty for me. Yes this is a family style restaurant, , which is fine with me. Restaurant was clean and the waitress friendly."}
{"text":"I have faith in humanity and when someone says a place has the best of something, I go and try that dish. For today, it was a chicken paprikash challenge and the contender was the Clubhouse. 

Generous parking lot, albeit for a small place. Place had an older clientele, felt like being at Denny's or Bob Evans at 9AM). However, the restaurant was clean, the service was prompt, very friendly and checked in on us frequently.

I like to ask the servers what their favorite menu items are and she said she had been eating the paprikash here for ten years and still hasn't gotten tired of it. There are daily specials (today was yankee pot roast). I got the chicken paprikash (you can get a small or large portion), came with dinner rolls and a salad. Salad did look fresh, with very long slices of cucumbers. Dinner rolls were warm and fresh as well. So we were off to a good start. This was the first time I'd ever eaten paprikas, but was very happy and satisfied. Picture dumplings and chicken strips swimming in a sour cream sauce. Chicken was tender and the dumplings were soft. I did feel the dumpling to chicken ratio was a little high though. When I left the restaurant it seemed that's what everybody ordered but hey I can see why. Meal came out very quickly.

I think the paprikash was very tasty but it's a hearty meal and for my preference just isn't one of my go to dishes."}
