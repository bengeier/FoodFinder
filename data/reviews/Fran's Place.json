{"text":"Love the Midwestern cooking especially the hot beef. Can't go wrong in this family owned restaurant. GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we were looking for a Sunday breakfast.  Yelp recommendations pointed us to Fran's Place.  We were fortunate to beat the crowd and got seat.  Fran came to great us and we had a fabulous meal.  The waffles were the best and everyone in our party of four was defiantly satisfied with their meals.  It was not speedy but well worth the wait for home cooked food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I just found out about Frans and have loved the food and the service is wonderful.   The cabbage rolls are so good even better than my sisters.  Don't believe  everything you hear or read that is negative.   I know these people are very familiar with proper food handling  and being very clean.  The building is old but adds ambience to sitting down eating. I will continue to go there for a long time."}
{"text":"Fran's was a great little surprise on a quick road trip to AZ for a memorial service. We checked out of  our motel and looked on YELP for somewhere to stop for breakfast. We were not disappointed. It reminded me of a little home town diner. Food was great. I had a ginormous pancake for the side with my omelet. Will go back if I ever find myself in Mesa again."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked Walleye from Minnesota. Family owned and very nice people! Give it a try when you're in Mesa! The antique malls are right down the street, and so is the vegetable market! Perfect day!!"}
{"text":"Had the BEST fish at Fran's yesterday!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was really looking forward to trying out Fran's as we used to go here when it was Kat's Place. The food was pretty good but for a Sunday morning, I think they were understaffed which translated into a frustrating visit. We order a simple bacon, eggs, hash brown and toast combo and never ended up getting the toast at all ad when I asked about it 10-15 mins after I got my meal (and was able to flag down the waitress) instead of a plain \"I'm sorry. I forgot\", I got a well, we only have a 4 slice toaster in the back. This is after I saw two breakfasts for others get their meal with toast delivered. I also had to ask for my daughter's OJ after the meal was delivered. Not sure I'll go back since the food was good but the prices were average but high for the service we received."}
{"text":"I just read over all the \"old blogs\" about this restaurant---and noticed the one written in February of 2013, had some wrong information that I would like to correct.  First of all, I lived in Scottsdale for over 15 years and ate out every day of my life.  Don't believe there was a restaurant in Scottsdale that I have not  experienced--from a 1 star to a 5 star.  I moved to Mesa a couple of years ago, and found it difficult to find good restaurants that were not \"franchises\".  Someone recommended Fran's Place to me---and I have been a \"regular\" ever since.  Back to the gal that wrote in last February.  First of all, Fran DOES NOT SMOKE----never has---and whoever was smoking in front of the door---definitely not her----and if it was one of the waitresses--they would not be smoking at that location.  Secondly, her omelettes are the best I've ever had---definitely not a \"franchise taste\"-----and those are definitely not \"boxed hashbrowns\".  Fran makes many of the soups, the daily specials, and her son, Brian is the chef, and his wife, Brenda also prepares some of the specialties as well as being a waitress ---and between the three of them, the food they prepare is just downright outstanding---truly homecooked--as good or better than my Mother's.  I don't believe I've been disappointed in anything I've ordered there in the past two years.  Fresh fruit and vegetables daily--best real mashed potatoes and gravy, sandwiches, all breakfast items---soups are fantastic---I just love this place----the gals that work there are friendly and the atmosphere reminds me of \"Cheers\"----it's not uncommon to have people talking with one another from table to table.  Remember, it's a \"hole in the wall\"---but the only 5 STAR \"hole in the wall\" I've experienced in my 18 years in Arizona."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for good breakfast spots. The service was friendly, the food was very good. We had an egg/bacon/pancake combo, a side of biscuits and gravy, and an omelette. All were better than average."}
{"text":"Super quaint and cozy (see, small and old timey) great place for breakfast. I think they are open on Friday evenings as well, but we have only been there for breakfast.  The food is home-made and you can tell everything is made with that rare ingredient, love.   I highly recommend this place, but don't go expecting some fancy/trendy type place. This is old school, home cooking, with a super friendly staff!  Every time I try a new breakfast place, I always scan the menu for the elusive \"Monte Cristo\", so I was uber-excited when I saw it on Fran's menu and quickly decided that was my order. Ordered with a side of hash browns (to which you can add grilled onions and pepper, which I recommend!) instead of fries, and patiently waited.   Enjoyed a regular old cup of coffee, which was nothing special, but hit the spot!  The food arrived after a short wait (they were busy), and it was well worth it. Many Monte Cristo's are deep fried, but Frans is not, so I was very excited about that!  Great flavor, they grill the meats before adding to sandwich, and everything was in perfect proportion. And the hash browns with onions and peppers, seems simple right??  Well it's that LOVE I mentioned before, that make them extra freaking tasty.   Yum. Now I am hungry."}
{"text":"Truly my favorite breakfast and lunch place in Arizona, Chicken fried steak and eggs are absolutely to die for. If you don't like Fran's food. you must not like to eat at all! Don't forget their Friday fish fry, a digestive delight.."}
{"text":"Went here this morning before Christmas shopping with the wife for the first time ! After transferring to Arizona this last August we were looking for a great breakfast place, and have to say we really enjoyed the food and the small town atmosphere here ! Nothing fancy but just great food and selection, truly happy with finding Fran's.....Will definitely be back for many more !"}
{"text":"Just like eating at home!!! Best fish I've had in AZ!!! Will be back again. Next time for fish Friday dinner, then again for breakfast! !!! So glad we stopped!!"}
{"text":"Wife and Iwalked in and a waitress picked up two menus and walked to a table, no hi, follow me, nothing.  There was a glass of water on the table with some already consumed.  She brought another glass of water and one straw.  We ordered coffee and when my wife drank half there was a ring of old coffee around the inside of the cup.  we told the waitress and she brought another cup already filled.  This cup had caked on egg on the top of the handle.  My wife was half way finished with her meal and had to ask for her toast.  Waitress dropped a fork on the floor and it was still there when we left.  Not the cleanest place to eat."}
{"text":"Great home cooked meals. Fran is a sweetheart. A must visit."}
{"text":"AHmazing... looks tiny but is mighty with flavorful comfort food :0) the works omlette was DeLiCiOuS along with golden brown perfect hashbrowns and  pancakes mmmmm Plus we got to meet Fran and her sister, what sweethearts... so happy to have found this wonderful place. We'll be back, my favorite yelp find yet!!!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place, because I had an hour free in the morning. They kind of open late for a midwest place, a lot of the other cafes are usually open at 6 or earlier. Anyway, their food was alright actually kind of bland, I had the chicken fried steak, with the usual sides because I have tried it at all the other places around them. For the money, they are definitely inferior to the other cafes and even if they were cheaper, they were still below the other places in the area. Okay they are not that expensive, but compare to the other same type of cafes, they are about 20-30% more expansive and compare with even the higher end ones, they did not come very close at all. This was probably the first and last time, because I usually don't get an hour off that often. Plus they were very slow for a place that has a capacity of about 20 people. I gave them a 2 star because it was like meh, I've had better and at a better price too. I definitely did not thought it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited here a few weeks ago based on the reviews. The windows were painted with words \"everything's homemade\" and \"we cook from the heart not a box\". Those words are a HUGE stretch. The omelet was nothing better than you'd get at Denny's. Not fresh eggs but boxed. The hashbrowns were frozen. Also not homemade but I guess technically not from a box. We overflowed our coffee cups twice because the waitress filled the cup to the brim AFTER being aware we wanted creamer added. We weren't greeted when we came in and the coffee waitress passed by us twice. Its a small dining room so she had to pass very close. No way to have missed us standing there. We actually had to ask if we should seat ourselves. We didn't know the protocol as it is self seating at some places and as no one was interested in assisting us we assumed that was how its done. The waitress huffed exasperatingly and stated she would be right with us. All of this was after we passed Fran herself standing on the front stairs smoking. We had to pass through the cloud to get in. I made a joke about that being Fran and my boyfriend said yeah right. Come to find out....I was right! Needless to say...we will never be returning. If we wanted poor service and shoddy food we would go to a big chain breakfast."}
{"text":"Good homemade cooking. Ma and pop place. Great service too! If you want a more intimate conversion though others can easily hear you. The crowd is mainly elderly but it doesn't matter best food ever! Glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here in two weeks. I came on a Friday for the Walleye. Excellent. Today we're having the cabbage rolls. You do need to call ahead for this meal so they know how many to make for the day. The breakfasts look amazing. Our next trip."}
{"text":"Sitting for 15 minutes & no one has taken our order.  The customer service was just horrible.   Can't say anything bad about the food.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"Yum!  Love this little locally owned and operated, cozy, friendly restaurant. Opened about 9 months ago (I think). Open 7 days a week and all year (not seasonal).  Great, fresh, home cooked food.  Daily specials and special fish dinners on Fridays.  Went for a late breakfast - love that breakfast is served ALL day! That takes the pressure off of having to rush on a lazy Saturday or Sunday. I had the Ultimate omlette which was loaded with ham, bacon, sausage, all FRESH green peppers, onions, mushrooms & tomatoes with home fried potatoes.  It was delicious!    My friend had the chicken fried steak with hash browns.  The steak was really good - the coating was perfect! It was a nice super crispy golden brown and covered with sausage gravy - which was also very good.  They don't over season or salt anything which is good - you can add your own to suit your tastes.    Washed down with hot (hot) fresh coffee. Excellent.    They have homemade pies but we had no room left to eat another bite so we'll just have to go back."}
{"text":"Good home cooking and comfort food. Sweet family, great community feeling."}
{"text":"We've been here b4 with no major problems but today was horrible! Everywhere had a wait this morning.. Now i know why Fran's didnt. Hardly anyone there yet we waited almost 15 minutes to have our order taken.. From that point on nothing but bad service the waitress acting so busy hardly doing anything and once the food finally arrived it was a total mess and just completely tasteless? Mess up bacon n eggs really???? Won't b back here.. Next time we'll b waiting \"somewhere\" for great food! Sorry Fran your employees aren't doing a good job for your business at all."}
{"text":"Home made! Very unassuming! And spot on. Nothing complex and not fancy maybe even a bit grungy but a must try for a classic breakfast. Even Matt 2 says it's a 4 out of 5, though not fine dinning like Over Easy."}
{"text":"Great sausage gravy!! I'm from the South. I know my sausage gravy. Well done Fran, well done. I had the chicken fried steak, eggs and gravy. All very good. Server was a bit like a chicken with her head caught off, but not rude. Mom had a patty melt. She thought it was \"pretty good.\" All in all, I'd go back."}
{"text":"We live close to Fran's place, and usually have breakfast there once every weekend.  During snowbird season it gets very busy, and there is very little waiting area.   Each time we've had to wait, it wasn't for very long.  We love the small town feel of the place.  The waitresses are very friendly, service is fairly quick and the food is DELICIOUS!  We've never had anything bad.  Best Patty Melts ever.  During winter they have a Friday fish fry that is really good.   I want to highly recommend Fran's Place, but then again it just makes it busier, and the locals have to wait.  Oh well, I'm glad for Fran that they are busy. It is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First time there. Food was very good and not so spicy that you can't eat it. You can always spice up your food if you like it that way. Service was a little scatty but overall worth the wait.  Everyone very friendly.    The place is not fancy but warm & welcoming.   Will return."}
{"text":"Wow.  Perfect place if you are looking for GREAT FOOD and a \"mom and pop\" feel atmosphere and rock-bottom prices.  My husband ordered bread pudding and it looked like it would feed a small, hungry Army. He said it was excellent.  Would've given five ***** if they had better 'light' or salad selections.   This is a place for people that aren't counting calories!"}
{"text":"Awful experience today for a Sunday brunch. First time at Frans Place, definitely the last. We waited ten minutes before anyone said a word to us at the door. Gave us menus and we sat ourselves. Coffee and waters came quick but our waitress was a bit short, blank facial exressions, absolutely hates Sunday morning kinda looks. I ordered 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and I asked for home fries instead of bacon (we are mainly vegetarian). My fiance got a veggie omelet with a biscuit. When our meals came out after 20-30 minutes, there was ham in his omelet and I had bacon instead of potatoes because \"we don't have homefries\" was all she said. No offering another side, just gave me the bacon. I only had one pancake on my plate as well. Plain, completely undercooked and mushy in the middle was he. When our server came back, we returned the ham omelet and she didn't offer anything else, just took off with the food. After keith had nothing, I had two eggs and 1/4 of an undone pancake and I paid for that meal alone and left a small tip. Will never come back, I feel like we were ignored and our waitress was rude the entire time. Oh and the worst part? The food really sucked (the omelet was almost soggy.. it was pretty gross) and was not what we ordered. We ended up stopping for donuts on the way home. Wouldn't really risk your Sunday morning diner time on this place, you may end up sorely disappointed like us."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Big Pig Omelette, biscuits and gravy,  pancakes, raisin toast and cheese omelette were all very, very good!  Definitely quaint and small with no frills but the food made up for it.  Friendly staff and quick service.  Will definitely be back on our next trip to Mesa!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Corned beef hash from a can, bland eggs. Country fried steak was amazing. The service however was terrible. Ran out of waffle batter at 9 am on a Sunday with an empty restaurant. Was told we could get pancakes with the strawberry topping instead of waffles. Then we were told there was no strawberry topping. Spoke to Fran herself and she claimed they stopped carrying strawberries because people are allergic!?!! Our order came out wrong and the waitress actually argued with me for five minutes about what we ordered. We were there for an hour and a half and will not be back. Overpriced for what you get and just not worth it."}
{"text":"The wife and I have come here several times over the past year. The food and service has always been fantastic. It's a Midwest style down home cooking. The food is all made from scratch and definitely not health food!  We always come early and they are usually busy. The crowd is mostly older folks. I highly recommend the works omelet. It's one of the best breakfast places in the east valley. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The best turkey pot pie in the whole valley. A special every Thursday. If you leave hungry then you are a glutton."}
{"text":"Reopened as  Two Seasons Cafe serving same kind of food as old Frans.  I want to check out Fran's new place and I'm sure it is great, but this location at 6320 East Main is open again."}
{"text":"I had one of their numerous specials.  Very reasonably priced for the midwest portions that arrive piping hot to my table.  I chose one of the dishesthey are known for, biscuits and gravy.  For $3.99 I chowed down on one over easy egg and a single biscuit with scrumptious gravy.  By no means was it visually appealing but was it good!!! The bisciut was buttery and the gravy had just the perfect ratio of pepper to sausage.  The clientele was mostly of the older generation, great place to read the paper and shoot the bull with strong coffee in hand.  The waitresses were what I expected, like talking to an old friend.  I took a piece of their bread pudding home, something else they're known for.  Great place!! Wish I lived closer to this little gem, perfect place for a stop when we're out on our motorcycles!"}
{"text":"Darling spot! Family run fun spot that's been around a LONG time! It's run by (or at least partially) Fran's daughter in law. Food is literally homemade. We overheard them discussing freshly made pies and bread pudding, fresh from the oven. Cool!  My split pea soup wasn't as thick as I usually have it but the taste was great  it was paired with 1/2 ham sandwich which was an old school tasty throwback served with a side of chips.   My husband, the burger meister, got big happy eyes after his first bite. The meat was fresh, juicy and an awesome squishy white bun. The patties are hand formed deliciousness. The fries are coated and are an add on, otherwise it comes with Lays style potato chips. His root beer float was old fashioned, made with two scoops of great ice cream, quality root beer and free with the burger and fries.   We both left stuffed, charmed and charmed by our waitress."}
{"text":"Frans Place is now Two Seasons Cafe. Same Location, Same great food. 6320 East Main Street , Mesa."}
{"text":"lots of old farts talking about all ther medical issues . The food is decent , service as well. I do like the hash with eggs sunny side up ( they don't do poached)  cool little building"}
{"text":"Simple old time American food. Nothing to shout about. It is made there ... okay. Small place. Staff was okay friendly. Coffee was like dark water - no flavor - go find a Starbucks if you want coffee. I will not eat here again. Expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place with really great fish. Small place with good staff. The fish was very good and the price was fair."}
{"text":"I have to say this is a rare gem - truly a home owned and home cooking kind of place with a staff that is so wonderfully friendly.   There were four of us that went tonight and two of us had the fish, one had the hot roast beef sandwich and one had the country fried steak dinner.  Every plate got rave reviews - I had the walleye dinner and it did not disappoint - perfect down to the core, breaded just right and cooked not one minute too long or too short.  There are homemade mashed potatoes and gravy that made one of us order a side on the side!  Yes it is that good.  Homemade pie and desserts - this is down home cooking at it's very finest.  I have had breakfast and lunch there also and they were both outstanding meals.   Just for balance I tried to think of one negative comment and I just can't find one!   It is all good. To put frosting on the cake, our server was what every server should aspire to be - friendly, attentive and responsive."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great for breakfast, good hash browns, have them add onions and green peppers.  Excellent home made pies. Ask for Brenda or Cathy.  Everything is home made."}
{"text":"My parents read how great this place was, so we decided to try it out. We went for dinner for fish fry. It was the first night they opened for winter. They are open only Friday nights for dinner starting the begining of Nov. Well, it was horrible. Service food amount cost and cleanliness were horrible. I figured it was because it was the first night they opened. Maybe they will be better next time. So a few weeks later, i took my husband there for fish fry. Again it was horrible. We again waited 15 min just to get a menu and water. Another 15 to be waited on. Another 10 for our tiny plate of salad and another 30 for our fish dinner. Fish was soggy. The waitress said one of thier fryer machines broke and that was why the wait was so long. They had pies and desserts laid out on a machine by the front door uncovered. They had salad pre made on plates stacked on top of each other ( bottom of plated on top of salad). The ice tea tasted old. We could see the kitchen from where we sat. The cook was cutting the fish stipes on a side table that a waitress just sat dirty dishes. The cook also looked dirty and unkept. The waitresses were unprofessional and scattered. They had young teenagers in street clothes pouring water. I suppose it was one of the employees kids. The prices were high for very little nasty food. We couldnt even get a waitress to refill drinks, get some lemon or extra napkins. I have never been there for breakfast and will never go there again after I saw how food was handled and kept.  Not sure why this place has alot of great reviews. Even if their breakfast is good, look in the kitchen and cleanliness first. You probably wont eat there after."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food!  Try to get here before 9am place gets busy. Home cooked meal is what u are looking for this is your place."}
{"text":"Tasty home style food for a good price. Clientele was an older crowd. I had the country fried steak and eggs with home fries and coffee. I enjoyed it. Service could've been a little friendlier but overall not bad for our first time there. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Really good home cooked food!! :)  Very cozy place... With very nice employees... Got to meet Fran...she goes around every table greeting... Of course when she's there. Really little place... But food delish!! I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Honestly was just looking for some good breakfast food...yelped and found this place. Sooooo glad I did, They didn't have a few things we asked for ie Apple juice or waffles (their waffle maker was broke) but they certainly made up for it with their warmth and friendliness. My daughter wanted choc chips in her pancakes and they didn't have that but still made her choc drop pancakes. Honestly the sweetest people! And I was told when we come back to call in advance and they would make sure they had choc chips on hand. Great customer service and the food was fantastic. Thanks for helping us have a great morning!!!"}
{"text":"Had a good late breakfast there, and it was good.  Went back for their walleye today and we were very disappointed. Bill was $36 for two walleye dinners and one diet coke.  We had been looking forward to the walleye being from Minnesota.  We tried."}
{"text":"This was like eating slop.  Let me slop some gravy on some week old hard biscuts for you lol.  If you are old and on your way out and want to hang out with a bunch of old people than this is the place for you.  Best thing was the coffee and everything else sucked!  Don't recomment unless you are blind, can't taste, and are stupid to give them your money."}
{"text":"Service was awful. I tried Tuesday special Pastie; it was horrible and way overpriced. Not a true northern Michigan pastie. Very small portion with roast beef and celery which are not ingredients in a traditional pastie.  Skip this place for lunch ."}
{"text":"I will never return to this poor excuse of a place. Was excited about the Pork Tenderloin sandwich, was dried out and had no flavor whatsoever. Not to mention the fact that I wanted onion rings and got crappy frozen french fries. Home cooking? I think not."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. Food is simple diner food, not over the top but really  good and home made quality. A few specialties are really outstanding (e.g. stuffed cabbage). As with any sole proprietorship, diners will experience some unevenness in service and food, but that is to be expected. If consistency (i.e. sameness) is desired, then one would probably be better off at a chain, like Appelbees.  My aging mother-in-law particularly likes it since it reminds here of a 50's era mom and pop place."}
{"text":"My dad Larry comes here all the time but I have only been in 3 times and today it was great. I ordered the fish is was hot and moist on the inside with a crispy crust. My daughter ordered 2 pancakes and bacon the pancakes were buttery and fluffy and the bacon was Applewood and thick slices. I really felt as though I made this meal myself. Great job to our cook Brenda and waitress Heather."}
{"text":"We stopped to check out the food not from a box and we were not disappointed. I have the best patty melt I have ever had, EVER! It was so good and they gave me a rootbeer float for ordering a burger! The service was friendly and the food really was homemade and totally worth the drive. Loved it."}
{"text":"We visit Mesa often and Fran's Place will always be our favorite spot for breakfast.  Service is not fast but the food is worth the wait, you won't be disappointed.  The bacon is so flavorful, omelettes are amazing and I love that we can add onions and peppers to to the home fries!  Thank you Fran Brian and Brenda for a good ol'  American breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty darn good.  The turn off was the whole time we were trying to eat , they were walking around killing flies. Not the most appetizing thing in the world."}
{"text":"Lupe is the super-waitress.  Ask for her.  The food is high-quality.  Fran circulates and assures that everything is done right.  She is charming but blunt.  I order low-carb things.  The sausage patties are NOT greasy and rich--they are perfectly balanced and delicious.  The egg orders come out PRECISELY as requested...and quickly.  There isn't an ironically-bearded hipster in sight.  The conversations are friendly and light-hearted.  The patrons are mostly retirees and working class folk who deserve a decent meal and some simple human kindness.  They get plenty of both here.  It is my \"go to\" place in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to yelp.  Very... interesting!  I went for the Friday fish fry.  The fish was pretty good.  The ambiance was... interesting!  I can tell you that at 31 years old, I was probably the youngest customer by about 40 years.  But hey, it's Leisure World, right?  The place was PACKED with about a 30 minute wait, which I hear is pretty normal on Fish Friday.  Good service, good food."}
{"text":"We have gone here for breakfast a few times. It is a great breakfast place with reasonable prices and good portions. It is simple food but done correctly which seems to be hard to find nowadays. Example, order bacon extra crispy or an egg sunny side up and they will actually come to your table that way. The only advice that I would have is that dine in is a better experience than take out."}
{"text":"My breakfast spot on special occasions.  I've been 10 or so times.  One time I got a waitress I've only seen that one time and the service was bad.  Every other time it was great.  Sometimes the eggs are done badly.  I've yet to find a breakfast place on planet earth that doesn't mess up eggs from time to time.  But they get it right more often than most.  I gave them 5 stars, so these are nitpicks.  This place is great.  These pictures of waffles are forcing me to try their waffles next time."}
{"text":"Small place. Never knew it was there until I looked it up on Yelp.  The sausage gravy is perfect and you can tell it is homemade. The portions were perfect. The staff is friendly and the food came out faster than I expected."}
{"text":"This place is extremely cute. It's got that \"home-y\" Mid-Western feel (or what I imagine it'd be like LOL). My friends and I checked this place out for a late breakfast/post-exam pick me up. And we loved it! Owners are from Minnesota and they put up cute pictures and posters of the place all around. Servings are great for the price (pretty cheap!) and the servers are incredibly sweet. Definitely feel comfortable and relaxed here. I got biscuits and gravy with an egg on the side and it hit the spot! (My carb, sweet spot --to be exact). My friends ordered some other usual breakfast foods, and all were pleased. They have items for lunch and dinner too, and it's all pretty standard \"diner\" type food. We'll definitely be back though, and I'm personally looking forward to a nice, tasty stack of pancakes or a waffle. Yum!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a really good breakfast you have got try this place. Small Town feel, wonderful service."}
{"text":"Great little place for a good breakfast!  All served fresh and hot by a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall bliss. Yum - eeee! Honest down home comfort food. The biscuits and gravy were amazing. Hash browns are a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant but had never been in - its in a little building that's not much to look at from the outside but inside its a very cute little dinner. The real star is the food which was Awsome we had breakfast and the bacon was perfect the hash browns where delicious and them made the best sunny side up eggs I've ever see (whites done perfect, not runny) - the staff was very friendly and I met one of the cooks an she was very sweet. We definitely will go back."}
