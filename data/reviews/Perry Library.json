{"text":"Before I had my daughter, I thought libraries were all but obsolete.  I mean, who needs books when you have the Internet? Boy was I wrong! There are so many wonderful programs for everyone from story time for babies, to book clubs for adults. One of my favorite programs is their summer reading program, not only because it encourages kids of all ages to read year round, but because you get cool prizes including a free book for completing the program! (Note: I completed the program with my daughter, not as myself, so I don't know what prizes they offer to adults. But for the kids, they had cute little toys and then like I said, the free book, which is awesome.)

This library has a big selection of kids books, including the nearly indestructible board books for babies. The board books are smartly placed in a bookshelf-like toy box where little ones can easily go through and choose what looks good to them. No need to keep these in catalog order, which of course makes sense for these little guys.

Plus, I've learned that I enjoy checking books out for myself.  I don't have to spend the money to buy a book to read once and then have sit on a shelf. It's great!

I love that their catalog is online. The website is easy to navigate, and it's easy to place holds and check your account. The self-checkout process is easy, and the number of books that you can check out, plus the length of time you can keep them is great. I'm bummed that it took me so long to rediscover libraries, but I'm sure glad I did. I'll be returning for many years to come."}
{"text":"Chandler public library is a lot better D.V .  It s cleaner, more to provide for it  members and amazing customer service.  Right off of Riggs and Val Vista and caters to both Chandler and Gilbert citizen.  Love Chandler public library!  QC Maricopa library definitely is not a 5 star rating of any level.  Dusty and smells and the books are most older and dirty, they really need to clean house there.  And their Wi, and printing are so uncertain.  most of the time down! super annoying."}
{"text":"This is the location of the Gilbert Public Library that I visit the most, going several times a month.  Because it's located at Perry High School, it's definitely not the quietest location. I try to avoid going around the time school gets out, because despite all the signs stating not to park at the curb, people always do, blocking the entrance and exit to the parking lot.

I love how easy it is to reserve books or waitlist them online, pick them up inside off the hold shelf where they're sorted by last name, and self-check them out all without standing in line or needing anyone's help.  This saves a ton of time when I'm out running errands.  

Near the entrance there's a spot for donating items.  This has been great for those books my kids have outgrown, cookbooks I no longer need, and movies we no longer watch. 

This location is large and open, and usually clean.  There are several small tables for children, as well as plenty of seating for adults."}
{"text":"This branch of the Maricopa Public Library system is located at Perry High School and serves as a school library and public library. There are a variety of books, audiobooks, DVDs, Blu-rays, and CDs for adults, children and teens and a collection of large print. They have online resources such as ebooks, downloadable audiobooks, online magazines, databases for research and streaming movies and music. 
If the branch doesn't have an item you want, you can request it from another branch and they send it over for free!  There are also programs that are free to the public for kids, adults and teens."}
{"text":"This is a great library.  Friendly helpful staff.  I love that you can check out yourself.  Quick and easy.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"This library is wonderful and though we usually go to the downtown Chandler Library, this library is much closer to where we live.  I really love the library system and I don't know about the other Maricopa County Libraries, but though this one is small, it is very convenient for us.

The drop box outside of the library allows you to drop books and media into the secured box that is really easy to use.  They have a slot for books and a slot for media.

Inside the library, you can check your items back in without waiting for someone else to do this.  They have an automated system where you place your library item on a conveyor belt, it somehow detects your book or media and then it shows in the screen it's been checked back in and then it goes on the conveyor belt into the back to be put back into circulation.  LOVE, LOVE this!!!

And the system for checking out books has gotten super easy.  You can either use your library card or memorize your number.  You can place all your items in the box of the same type - like all books together (stacked on top of each other) and the electronic system will detect all the books and check the out at the same time.  Then, if you have a pile of DVDs, you can do that all at once instead of scanning each item separately.  LOVE, LOVE this!

I also like that you don't have to print out a receipt, so that saves a little bit of trees.

This is a high school library that also serves as a Maricopa County Library.  It is open and spacious, well organized.  There are many computer terminals for people to use as well as computer terminals for younger kids (these are placed on tables that are lowered for their height.  

This library is very clean, quiet (as any library should be), plenty of parking outside.  The library staff and security guards are all very nice and friendly.  There are 4 checkout stations and 1 check in, which is plenty as this does not take long.

Some other pluses are that you can renew things online.  Media can be renewed up to 5 times (or 5 weeks for DVDs) as long as no one else is requesting the item.  Books are for 3 weeks at a time and you can renew up to 5 times.  The online feature is awesome.

I love that you can check up to 10 DVDs at a time out, too.  During the summer, this is awesome and fewer trips out in the heat to go back to the library.  And also, they have lots and lots of DVDs so even the newer ones, they have many copies.

Love the organization, cleanliness and closeness of this library to us."}
