{"text":"We LOVE this place! The service is excellent!  You feel like you are taken care of like their own family. The food is prepared with love, always delicious. My favorites are the breakfasts and souvlaki!  Yum! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast at a great price!! I enjoyed the eggs, peameal bacon and home fries. The pancakes were just average though. The service was fast and very welcoming. The lady who served me was so nice and called me \"sweetheart\". I liked the diner atmosphere and the pictures of Greece on the walls."}
{"text":"Simple, tasty breakfast that won't break the bank. Their pancakes are one of the better ones I've had for a while from similar breakfast joints."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why there are so many high ratings for this place.   

This was a terrible place to eat when I used to go to school in the area, and it really have not changed one bit.  

After reading the Yelp reviews, I was convinced the place has changed with the neighborhood, and I may have been missing out on a gem.  

The poor attitude of the waitress, the bent cutleries, the chipped plates, and poorly assembled breakfast was a nostalgic experience I wish to forget."}
{"text":"After the crazy ice storm we were without power so we walked over to Motorama for breakfast. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. Two of us ordered the big breakfast and one got the club sandwich. When the big breakfasts came out it didn't look like a ton of food but I really struggled to finish, and I can eat. My husband got the club and really enjoyed it, the fries were just okay. The food was so well prepared, the over easy eggs were perfect. The only issue was the wait time for the food but I blame the ice storm and the fact that they were really busy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a no fuss place. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. It's like coming home. There's always loud chatter in the kitchen and it makes for a nice atmosphere. The food is great, I really don't care if I make it before 11AM for free coffee. I mean if you can't afford a cup of coffee maybe you should stay home. It's family run for more than 50 years and that itself is a testament to all other chain places. Why go to a chain when you can come here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The server Maria is honestly the nicest woman in the world. The food is so fresh and delicious the price is right and the portions are amazingly large"}
{"text":"Loved the sausages, the pancakes are not so great though. Get here before 11 for free coffee!"}
{"text":"I chose this spot based on other great reviews. It has the vibe of a greasy spoon, with excellent service. My food came out super fast and was delicious.

I ordered the eggs florentine and it was superb. The hollandaise had a great flavor, the eggs were fluffy and the potatoes were nice and golden brown. I love trying different Benedicts and Florentines when I travel and am very picky. This dish stood up to many of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Absolute best diner breakfast in the city. Super friendly, great food and service. Highly recommended for all. Get the eggs Benny deluxe."}
{"text":"New cook? Long time waitress burned out? Suffice it to say, it was a shit show in here today. This is a 3-star place, so now my stars average out. (I was super generous with my first review.)"}
{"text":"I went there because I read the nice reviews on yelp. To me it was a very typical brunch place! There wasn't anything special about the food. I ordered the Greek omelette... It was much like the Greek omelette I make at home. The fries on the side weren't cooked very well (they were hard inside) and were very greasy. The staff were amazing though; they were very nice and welcoming. Overall, I'd say it was an ok place for a brunch but don't expect anything exceptional :) By the way, the coffee is free before 11am."}
{"text":"I kinda loved this place. Had the breakfast special, your basic bacon and eggs. My overeasy eggs were perfect, the hashbrowns were fried up with what I think is a litle garlic, yummy, but the coffee was sooo weak it was close to undrinkable. That was the only problem. Which, on a Sunday morning, can kinda suck. You need that caffeine."}
{"text":"More grease on the east (Yum). *3.5 stars.

I was in the exact same boat as Nicole C: I'd passed by Motorama so many times over the last three years, that I finally bit the bullet and popped in for a hangover breakfast and, man, am I glad I did.

This is a classic spoon. Lots of greasy, super-friendly staff (I'm pretty sure I was referred to as \"sweetie\", \"honey\" and \"sugar pie\" during breakfast. Sure, that looks good on screen now, but it was waaaay less cute the longer I went without a Caesar.

The food was dirt cheap, really tasty (real home fries!) and came out before I whimpered through my second cup of coffee.

A small word of warning: I think some of the clientele from the lovely bars farther east (see my pub Danforth pub crawl list) roll in here for their first beer of the morning.

Looking forward to visiting without the apocalypse in my head."}
{"text":"We are breakfast people.  We do not need anything fancy, just a good serving of eggs, sausage, homefries and rye toast.  This wonderful diner serves it up quick, hot and delicious!  This is our second visit and both times it was perfect.  Love!!"}
{"text":"Motorama was one of those places that I kept passing by saying \"yea I'll totally check out that place next time!\" but I just never did. So after 3 years of walk-by's I finally decided to check this place out with my friend. We hit it before 11am so that we could still take part of our free coffee (I had tea cause coffee is GROSS) with our all day breakfast deals. 

UM - WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T I KNOW THIS PLACE WAS DELICIOUS?

Seriously for $5.35 (taxes incl.) I got 3 wide strips of lightly spiced bacon, two eggs, 2 pieces of toast and these hash browns which I wanted to motorboat. 

I don't know what was on those hash browns - it was probably just salt and pepper for all I know, but I couldn't get them into my mouth fast enough. 

I don't know why it took me so long to discover breakfast at this place, even though it is a bit of a dive, I'm totally a dive-diner girl. But once I left I didn't feel at all greasy and my wallet still had plenty of cash left to burn. Perhaps for another round in the evening?! MOAR HASH BROWNS!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place today for a late lunch with a friend.  Darn, really wish I had tried it sooner.

Basic food, very wallet friendly prices and family run (or so I assumed)--it is like you are eating in their home and they certainly treated us well.  

While you can certainly get a good lunch here, breakfast is obviously the reason to go.  (I suspect they may be closed for dinner).  Probably not a good enough reason to travel to the east end but certainly a good enough reason to stay in the east end--especially if you are searching for a great greasy spoon along the Danforth.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This is our favourite spot in the neighbourhood to take our family for breakfast.  We love the kid-friendly atmosphere and amazing service from Maria and her family and staff. The breakfast offering is your typical Canadian style but very nicely prepared as to your liking and great value for your money."}
{"text":"A great family owned breakfast spot.  It's inexpensive and feels like home.  The mother/daughter combo provide excellent service.  There are a lot of regulars that come here so I know it's a solid spot"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot on the Danforth! Lovely service and waiters are always so attentive and helpful. Food is on the cheap side and with excellent quality.

Always a reliable place to go when undecided where to eat on the Danforth for breaky or lunch!"}
{"text":"If you love delicious, greasy diner food and staff that will welcome you with a big smile, this is the right place. 

They love kids and always want to know how you're doing. They'll make up your food any way you want it and it's cheap."}
{"text":"Great cheap eats.  Good atmosphere.  Great prices.  Really a nice spot for people on a budget.  Also good for kids... there's a kids' menu and a casual vibe.  Families can feed here for less.  I talked to the current owner--they've had the place for 8 yrs., but the place is about 75 yrs old, so it's got a nice history.  She says no one knows for sure where the name came from.  They need bike parking!   Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Although. Itching is fancy there but the warm welcome. By Mary makes u feel like u're home. She welcomes you as you are a family and make sure u have the food you ordered. This is more important the food quality itself. I like to drop by for a breakfast every now and then. It worth a try"}
{"text":"A good go-to greasy spoon diner. The service is solid as is the food. There is a good deal on the all the All Day special if you go early enough (free bottomless coffee!). The place is popular with families, young couples, and old friends. It's a great neighbourhood gem. It's also one of the few places that cooks eggs properly, which is something that I'm really picky about. 

My only complaint is that it is not Air Conditioned! Be wary if you're sensitive to heat, or sit on the little patio out front."}
{"text":"We go to Motorama for breakfast frequently and we love it! A family owned business that has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and fantastic location. You also can't argue with the prices.

My son loved his pancakes, but unfortunately, my orange juice was warm, my eggs were uncooked, my toast came 10 minutes after everything else and was soggy and so were my home fries. The bacon was good, though. All of this after waiting a half hour or more for the food.

Too bad our first experience was poor because I'm probably not going to be returning."}
