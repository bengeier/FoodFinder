{"text":"Quality is so-so. The har gow is probably the best dish we tried. We ordered beef rice noodle roll, beef balls, spare ribs and some other steamed and fried food. The dough is too thick for the fried dumplings. The dough on the rice noodle roll is too soft and can't hold up its shape. Overall, I can only give 3 stars. I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"We had ordered a congee with lean pork, liver and kidney (???). The waitress gave us a congee with shrimps and fishes. When we told her that wasn't our order. She said it was ????There were no liver and kidney in their congee (???). Come on! Did she know what is ???? Won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Good dim sum at good prices. The pin on Yelp is in he wrong place, although the address is correct. It's on Silver Star north of Passmore."}
{"text":"Been here with my family consistently almost every week for the past month. Great food and great service. Can see that it's getting more hype and the restaurant is very busy even before 12 on weekends. Always call ahead if you're sure to visit at a certain time. Dishes are great for eat-in and stir fries are available for take out as well!

Sharing some of my recommendations:
Steamed \"fun guo\" - translucent dumpling filled with minced meat, arrowroot pieces, preserved veggie and peanuts. Dumpling wrapper is bouncy but not thick. Great quality.

Fried taro dumpling - crunchy on the outside, fluffy inside. 

Squid tentacles - hot and fresh and not too salty

Vegetarian rice rolls - imitation \"chicken\" with fried tofu pieces. Light and fluffy, not overseasoned

Preserved meat mini rice pot - great value for price. Good amount of meat and rice. Good for eat-in and takeout

Grilled beef ribs - favourite of little kids and adults. Comes with shrimp chips.

Haven't had any disappointing dishes so far.

The only downside is the restaurant is small, so seating might not be as comfortable as other spacious dimsum restaurants. Some items might take a little longer than others, but if you speak to the boss (lady) she'll ensure your order gets through."}
{"text":"Perfect refreshment! The steamed bun is a must.  I tried Steamed Dumpling today-- so yummy!"}
{"text":"If you want quality dim sum in your tummy, this is the place to be.   Nothing fancy but delicious dim sum with awesome service with a smile."}
{"text":"My go-to dimsum place. I come here every time I have a dimsum craving, even in the evening - just ask for the dimsum sheet! Prices are fair and there's something for everyone.

The salted fish & chicken fried rice here is one of the best in town, spare ribs, deep fried savory triangle, shrimp roll with salad dressing, custard bun are all great too!"}
{"text":"Came this afternoon for dim sum. Not bad at all. Their car booths are a tad squishy, but I survived. Most of their stuff is average, and their prices are not bad ($2 something for size small). 

An odd thing is that their hot sesame jellyfish option (slightly spicy with sesame oil) had jellyfish pieces that weren't very long. They chopped up the jellyfish. It make it awkward to eat, but it was tasty. Their deep fried taro puffs (wu gok) were piping hot, which is the way they should be. They have duck feet, which should make Grandpa happy if I bring him here. Their boiled veggies were pretty good. Their lava salty egg custard steamed buns were definitely lava, but slightly runny lava. I tried to break my bun in half to see what the inside looked like. I pressed down, and the lava squirted out onto the table. Thankfully, there was still lots inside. 

We had a number of dishes that I have not specified, but for $13 after tax and tip per person for three people, this was not bad. Nice to have another dim sum option."}
{"text":"It's pretty rare for me to give 4* to any Chinese food place so buckle your seatbelts, kids. We're in for a wild ride.

Came for dimsum with my dude and we ordered 8 dimsum. Pretty ridiculous because we're just two people but it was all good.

Tea was iron goddess and it was average. Took about 3 refills, or maybe 2.5, to get a more palatable flavour out.

The real definitive factor of a great dimsum place is their shrimp dumpling (??). It's an XL but definitely worth. The wrap looked thick but it tore easily, which is a positive. They used whole shrimps, not mashed shrimp, which increased how springy it felt to bite into it. The flavour was fresh and not overloaded with MSG.

Siu mai (??) was great too. Instead of roe, they had one whole shrimp on top. The meat was quite dark, but it was because it was lean pork. I know conventionally, the best type of pork for siumai is a bit of fat (ideally 50/50), but I def preferred all dark.

Best deal ever is their steamed milk dessert. Portion was literally twice the amount of other places. They steam it with the lid on, not with saran wrap, so yay! Not eating toxins today!

Def recommend this place. I put one star off because they asked if we could share our table with someone :( also no WiFi.

But yea space was rather clean, not cramped, and generally clean (ie no bits of food stuck to stuff)."}
{"text":"Be aware this is a cash only Restarant. 
The food was ok but not great, don't forget the 10% tip or she will give you a not very nice look lol
Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday during lunch hour. The restaurant was full and we, a group of 4 waited for 15mins to be seated. 

I would say it is not the cheapest dim sum place but is worth my money. You must order their lava custer steamed buns. Is soooo good. 

I would not suggest you to order any fired rice or fried Noodles becuz it tasteless and colorless. Just order dim sum, you can go wrong with that. 

Service is slowwww. 3 people are worKing and is slowwww. Kitchen is slowwww. Our dishes comes out one by one very 10 to 15 mins."}
{"text":"Tak fu is an absolute hidden gem for dim sum! I didn't expect anything from this hole in the wall kind of restaurant and was very impressed by the end of it. This was one of the better, if not the best, recent dim sum I have had in the past while. I'm definitely going to make this my go to dim sum place.

Ordering is through a simple sheet with English also on it. Everything was hot and flavourful and all the items we ordered tasted at least average or better. You can probably tell from the images the food is dark in colour and hence more of the items are richer in flavour compared to other dim sum places. Favourites included the char siu pastry bun, the custard buns, and the curried squid, but everything was excellent.

Pricing was extremely reasonable (totalled around $60 for 13 items) and service is of your typical Chinese restaurant, so no real complaints with fast and efficient service."}
{"text":"At first I was considering five stars for the place but here's how it's going down...Only open from 9:00 AM until 4:00 PM. It may not look like much from the exterior but once inside, I guess it's alright. Fairly decent servers showing courtesy and prompt service. The weekend yum...special 'crusted' BBQ pork bun...Delicious! Only available on weekends. Their other dim sum...Not too bad as well. Although some could use more filling.  Tried another savoury pastry dish...Yum! Nice and flaky.  Now the part where one star is dropped from the rating...Wifey found a piece of hair in her rice noodle. Total turn-off. I know that it happens but...no...not good when the customer sees hair in their food. Another star was taken off due to a 'dirty' styrofoam container asked for our leftovers. I had to ask for a replacement.  Not sure if we'd go back. But for that weekend specially-crusted BBQ pork bun...Hmmm...Decisions."}
{"text":"Weekend Dim Sum with Dad! New tries again. We went right at 9am when they opened. Place is very small and atomsphere was like a HK Style \"Tea Meal\" Diner. Ordered 11 items to try.

1. Flaky Pastry BBQ Pork Buns (Weekend Special Only) The pastry on the top is more similar to a \"coconut cocktail bun\" topping. The bun was really moist and fresh, with a slight crisp toast at the bottom. Pretty good!

2. Ha Gow 
Pretty Big had like 2 whole shrimps inside..but didn't have any bamboo shoots inside. Skin was really thin and nicely made. Taste was ok.

3. Glutinous Rice Fried Dumplings
Freshly deep fried, texture was good, filling was just 1 filling, just grounded meat and a lot of sauce. 

4. Lotus Wrapped Steamed Sticky Rice.
Taste was there in the filling, but the rice itself was a little bland.

5. Shrimp Steamed Rice Rolls
The Rice rolls were really smooth and texture was excellent. BUT...I found a piece of hair inside...I know it happens sometimes...but I was pretty grossed out after that...(didn't point it out..just didn't eat that piece, still wanted the rest of the food to come untampered lol)

6. Steamed Dumplings with Pork & Peanuts
Again the texture of the skin was really well made, but the filling in this one was mostly radish and hardly any pork pieces at all. Taste was ok.

7. Chicken Steamed Buns
They were really fluffy, fillings was great and taste great!

8. Speciality Pastries
It was basically a flat round flaky pastry, topped with lots of sesame seeds, and filled with the same pork filling as the Glutinous Rice Fried Dumplings. It was good, nice flakiness, pipping hot, and just enough seasoning.

9. Fishballs with Special Sauce
Deeped fried dace fishballs with a mini clam fermented tofu sauce. Freshly fried and very moist and flavourful. But the mixture inside was not throughly mixed. Some balls had more cilantro in it than others. 

10. Siu Mai
Pretty huge and a jumbo shrimp on top. Inside the pork there was also mushrooms pieces. Was pretty tasty and good.

11. Sticky Fried Rice with Preserved Meats
It kinda looked like a mess on a plate. It was the last item and it looked like it was just plopped on a plate and 3 pieces of preserved meats on top. Taste was not bad..the rice was well cooked. But there was hardly anything in it..just little flecks of Chinese Sausages, 1 thin slice on top, 1 thin slice of pork liver sausage, and 1 thin slice of preserved pork, all on top.

Didn't finished the fried sticky rice so asked for a pack away box. The pack away box was not really clean..there was stain at the edge and a particle in the middle...asked for a new one...but I wasn't sure if she just went in and wiped it :'( 

Service was pretty pleasant, despite the minor issues. 

That's if for now folks!"}
{"text":"Not the large, banquet hall type dim sum; back to basics decor with old-school dim sum (some dishes popular from decades ago that are not found in other restaurants) I am a fan of the Stewed Oyster Congee (strong oyster flavor with lots of small, soft pork pieces), Shrimp Paste Squid and the 'Flowing' Egg Yolk Bun is not bad. They have an interesting rice noodle roll filled with cilantro & century egg. 

Lunch hour ends at 4pm."}
{"text":"i went for dim sum at this place.  not a huge place.  it's not cheap but you sure get some nice dim sum.   no excess sauce, not too salty, things are very fresh, it seems that they steam/make to order when you put in your order of dim sum.  you can tell by the way the food tastes and by the time the food takes to get to you.  it's worth the wait.  the bbq pork rice roll i got was perfect.  you can tell the rice roll was freshly rolled.  we also got the pot rice.  poh chai fan.  if you know what i mean.  it was perfect.  the pot was made to order, you can tell by the way the rice tasted.  the tea that they served was also very unique.  they only pour in boiling water into your teapot.  this makes a difference in the way the tea tastes.  a server would come by very often to see if you needed more boiling water for you tea to steep in.  waiting staff was good.  they actually smiled and joked around!  we also tried the steamed chicken paw.  this too was done well.  not too much sauce.  not too much garlice and the meat comes loose from the bone very easily.  

all in all, this is a hidden gem in scarborough.  not too many young kids.  mainly old retired folks.  it can get a bit loud."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Overall value: 4 stars

Defu offers good value for your money, and indeed the value is what propels the rating to 4 stars.  

We came here for dinner.  We ordered a Filet Mignon in Hong Kong Style Sauce ($10), a Chinese Mushroom with Vegetable ($8) and a Chinese Sausage Hot Pot Rice ($6).  The portion of the vegetable dish was stunning.  If I only show you the picture, I doubt you would guess that it only costs $8.  It was rather well made: not too oily or salty, big thick mushrooms, fresh vegetable, nicely stir fried.  The portion of a mere $6 hot pot rice was equally impressive.  It fed both of us.  Quality wise, it was below average, because there was no crust at the bottom and it was not fragrant.  Nevertheless, we would likely order it again because 2 bowls of white rice cost $3.  For additional $3, we can get an appetizer-sized meat.  The filet mignon tasted decent.  The sauce was the star of this dish.  The meat was not tender enough, but I could chew through it.  Again, the portion was large for $10 of pure protein.  At the end of the meal, we both found the meal satisfying, as if we had had comfort food for dinner.

Services was sufficient and fast.  Meal comes with free starter soup and dessert soup.  We didn't order any seafood or fancy dishes, so I cannot comment on them.

I find Defu a good neighbourhood restaurant for regular family dinners or dinner gathering among close friends.  This is not a fancy restaurant where you want to impress someone, unless you want to impress upon them that you know where the good deals are."}
{"text":"Okay, I came back for dim sum. I'm definitely comfortable giving this place 3.5 stars, since their dim sum is infinite times better than their dinner.

We arrived at around 2pm, and we were the only ones there by the time it was 2:30. Some of the stuff we ordered include veggie dumplings, har gow, siu mai, and two rice noodle rolls. The rice noodle rolls were probably some of the best I've ever had; it was not too thin and not too thick, and smooth as well. Everything else ranged from standard to decent.

In addition, we ordered the milky custard buns, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for every single person visiting. This is exactly how custard buns should be done: Hot (of course, cool it down before you eat it), yellow milky, and full of flavour. It was so good we ordered two dishes of it for a total of 6 buns.

Service was, well, not much better than dinner, but at least we were attended to this time.

{"text":"We love eating dim sum every where we go in Canada and the US.  This restaurant has Great dim sum at an affordable price in Toronto!  You will not be disappointed. I would go back there again next time we go to Toronto."}
{"text":"A very old-styled dim sum restaurant. Not very spacious but their dim sum are worthy the trip."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

Went here for dim sum today and I will definitely come back. This place is very small and quite clean. It reminds me of the nosy dim sum places in Hong Kong. I love how the items are made to order (er, steamed to order). You can tell the food quality is higher and not oily. 

We had mostly the standard items, har gao, siu mai, bbq pork cheung fun, spareribs rice, chiu chou dumplings, mushroom dumpling, radish cake and spring rolls (yes, I love me some spring rolls). No complaints about the food. The bbq pork Cheung fun is worth mentioning since it was that good. The rice noodles is very silky and not sticky. I haven't had cheung fun this good in a very long time. The hao gao is also pretty good as it is quite big and it has good shrimp taste. A lot of places I go to just doesn't have that good ol' shrimp flavor in them. The spring rolls didn't look that good to me, but it tasted really good. 

They didn't charge us for tea, probably because of they forgot one of my items. If you don't like long line ups, come at an odd hour or come earlier. I highly recommend this place for anyone that enjoys high quality dim for a reasonable price.

I'm not sure what time they open, but they close at 1 am!"}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum.  Hidden gem!  Food was great and at reasonable prices.  Recommend if you are looking for a dim sum place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Father's Day today (and my \"b\"-day), Hubby said it was my choice for lunch - wherever I wanted.  I could have gone with something seriously upscale like sashimi a la carte or something equally indulgent ... but I wanted to go where I feel like I am at home - comfortable to be ME!  Decibel level quite high as the restaurant was packed and everyone was animated and having a good time (why not)?!

So I chose my favourite dim-sum (yum-cha) place.  We totally blew the calorie budget:

Foong jow - 5/5
Custard steamed buns - 5/5
Taofu pi with pork - 5/5
Curried cuttlefish - 3.5/5 (not as good as usual, cuttlefish was oversteamed and a bit tough)
Siu mai with a shrimp on top - 4.5/5 - seasoning was nice, different to what I had before

But what makes this place so amazing --- THEY ARE NICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS and the food is solid!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff (in a Chinese dim sum place....) hidden gem. A small restaurant with traditional dim sums but they are better than the ones in the fancy restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try dim sum in Markham for a whil. We decided to come here after reading the reviews and were happy that we came here! First off, I want to praise the waitresses in this place. I told them of daughter's peanut allergy and they were really careful with it. They went above and beyond for us. We ordered with our eyes the following: Congee With Vegetable And Pork, Steamed Chicken With Fish Maw and Black Mushrooms,
Steam Rice Noodle Roll with Fried Dough In Special Style,
Steam Rice Noodle Roll with Preserved Eggs, Beef Rice Noodle Roll, Steam Rice Noodle Roll with Shrimp, Steamed Mini Sticky Rice with meat in Lotus Leaf and 
De Fu Steamed Shrimp Dumpling. 

The waitress told us that it's best not to serve daughter the Steam Rice Noodle Roll with Fried Dough In Special Style because they fried the dough with oil that was contaminated with peanuts. She also told us that there's peanuts in their sauce even though it's not written there. The waitress even made the effort to show us the can with ingredients that even though peanuts weren't listed, she was adamant that peanuts were in it. 

Everything was delicious here and was freshly made. Place was empty when we got there but it slowly started filling up. Hubs was a little hesitant in going here because the parking lot was empty. Of course it's empty! We went there on a Tuesday morning! 

The only negative thing about this place was the bottom of their plates were sticky. I think they hand wash their dishes. 

Will definitely return when in the Markham area!"}
{"text":"I do not like to give negative ratings to the hard working restaurant operators in Toronto since they are a few notches above all of N. America as is.  But to be fair to Yelpers visiting Toronto/Markham/Scarborough for their Dim Sum cravings, I would suggest to skip Tak Fu.  Taste, value, originalities, cleanliness were all absent or lacking here.  Many established Dim Sum places offer the one price during early bird hours from open till 10:30 am, this place does not, so no value there at all.  Portion wise, it's even smaller than most.  Taste wise, choice of oil used was not that good.  Originalities, the names on the menu might sound different, but boy was I disappointed when the actual showed up.  Cleanliness, too much smell of bleach on the table ware and bathrooms need an update for sure, very messy and disorganized."}
{"text":"The best dim sum in the entire world, period. Far better than Rol San, the service is better and the food is cheaper too. The dim sum here is extremely fresh and the quality is amazing. Their minced beef pies and BBQ pork buns are my favorite things to order and I always order extra of both to take home."}
{"text":"This place has the best dim sum and you can tell by the line up.  What's great is that every dish is made with care.  My personal favourite are the steamed rice rolls; they have a very smooth texture, and the fillings are different then most places.

The staff are wonderful and extremely helpful and friendly despite how busy it always is.  

Highly recommend coming here if you want good dim sum but don't come hungry because you will likely have to wait in line a while."}
{"text":"Dim Sum the whole day? Here at Tak Fu, you may able to order dim sum if you have cravings at odd hours.. as who said dim sum is only good for breakfast and lunch?

This place is small to be a dim sum restaurant as on holidays or weekends prime lunch area, there maybe a wait. Try not to get the table in the front at this time as you might be pushed and shuffled by the waiting crowds.

Prices are quite reasonable with Small ($2), Medium ($3), Large ($4) and XL ($4.80).

We ended up sharing:

Sweet and Creamy Bun (M)
Steamed Shrimp Dumpling (M)
Steamed Pork Dumpling (M)
Steamed Chicken Bun with Minced Ginger (S)
Beef Rice Noodle Roll (M)
Speciality Pastry (L)
Steamed Bean Curd Roll with Satay Sauce (M)
Steamed Beef Dumpling (S)

After eating all these buns and dumplings, I am definitely stuffed! Most of the dishes we ordered were quite standard, nothing too amazing. 

Tak Fu does serves Cantonese dishes for dinner. The dinner set are priced reasonably too.

Service here is a little confusing as our orders kind of delivered to the table next to us.. But aside from that the staffs are quite friendly.

It is an ok place to have dim sum in the area, but if you want to impress your date or have a more laid back experience where you can hang out and sip your tea, I would suggest you go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"i guess theres a reason why this place is jam packed in the morning... the dimsum is quite delicious here.   the food speaks for itself.  Price isnt the cheapest you would find in scarborough but not too bad... the chiu chow style congee is very tasty."}
