{"text":"Went for lunch.  Everyone enjoyed it.   The tacos dorados was very good.  The empanadas were delicious.  The corn tortillas are made fresh.   The difference can be tasted.   Will return."}
{"text":"Service was so slow, they kept trying to bring us dishes we didn't order, waited at least 15 minutes to pay our bill. Food was ok, a little pricey but I guess seafood usually is. The portions could've been a little bigger for the price. The music was pretty intense, it was a little too loud for me at least. Still looking for the perfect mariscos spot ,, any recommendations?"}
{"text":"Antojintos Sinaloa has a very extensive menu of appetizers, seafood and entrees of various kinds. Most of the items will look familiar to anyone familiar with Tex-Mex. The flavors were authentic and tasty. From the outside, this looks tiny, but inside it is spacious and clean. One thing that's a little confusing is the booths are ornamented with wooden carvings from Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco, which is a completely different state than Sinaloa. I had the carne asado but they have a lot of seafood, so I'll have to try that next time. I'm glad it's in new in the neighborhood."}
