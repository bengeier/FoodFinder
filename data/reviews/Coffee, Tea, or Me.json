{"text":"This is the cutest Coffee shop. They play jazz music to sooth the soul. The Thrifty ice cream is the best ever, I wanted to get another scoop and it is reasonably priced. I recommend this spot to anyone who loves Coffee, Tea or Ice cream ;)"}
{"text":"Great space.  Great ice cream! Great location! Ask for Shawana! I would give 5 stars but I haven't finished eating!"}
{"text":"I like this place but I'm partial to businesses owned and operated by persons not corporations and this place sure has that going for it. They work for your business and they care. A Subway will be opening up next door but other than that and Landry's, this busy strip has two other small businesses that serve great food with a more urban than suburban atmosphere. Coffee Tea etc has a great soundtrack and if the lighting was improved (even sun light warm fluorescent build are unmusical and unappetizing) it be five stars for me. I'm coming here with my laptop before work with good coffee drinks (standard fare) tic whack my mail or after work to reward my inner child with some ice cream. Thrifty beats the heck out of the overly sweet 31 flavors. The serve large portions here. Support you local owners and enjoy your coffee, tea, simple sandwiches and indulgent ice cream desserts in the shop near the crossing of the freeways."}
{"text":"Poetry , karaoke, thrifty ice cream.....if you remember the yum that is thrifty ice cream your delight will be equaled only by the sheer generosity of these scoops!  An iced coffee kept my buddy happy and upon enjoying a shared sip.... I concur! Nicely executed!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Very cute, independent coffee shop with great ice cream choices. There was construction happening outside, but better is good! The Barista was very patient, kind and knowledgeable. Makes a great Americano! They have a 6 SHOT DRINK that is cheaper and better tasting that Starbucks. If you're in the area, stop by!"}
{"text":"Come for the coffee, come back again for the coffee and the hospitality.  The owners and staff made me feel at home.  The service  was beyond what is expected nowadays. I walked out with a hot cup of coffee and a warm feeling.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, simple menu, plain interior. Ranked in order of impact on the rating. I've seen this place on Groupon, but had trouble locating them from the street as they are  behind the Landry's and signage simply says \"coffee shop\" rather than the store name.  Was welcomed by multiple staff when I entered, menu is small and consists of hot and cold coffees, a few sandwiches, and Thrifty ice cream- a brand multiple small cafes have started selling, which I totally don't understand.  Iced vanilla latte was simple enough, and not overly sweet. Price was on par with anywhere else.  If you're really in need of a caffeine fix, they offer the Godzilla: 6 shots of espresso in a 32 ounce cup. Watch out!"}
{"text":"This was a Small, nice clean store. They had 0ne TV up front but it was kind of away from the normal sit-down area. The clerk was helpful in giving me suggestion because I was not sure exactly what i wanted. I ended up going with the Cold Vanilla Latte. It was prepare fairly quick and was rather tasty."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service. Kinda hard to spot with the construction going on in the plaza. I ordered a simple large frozen caramel frapp that was delicious. I'll definitely stop by again and try some other treats."}
{"text":"Wonderful place...wonderful people! I love it and I'm so grateful to see another black owned business."}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot. As a vegas native, I wish we had more places like this & hope these guys do well. I ordered the recommended vanilla mocha, so delicious! I stopped in looking for a place to hang for my lunch breaks and think I've found it here. I would only add that I would like to have the option to have my coffee served in a real cup. It's too good to be served in a paper one with a plastic lid!"}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yeeaaasssss !!! I've never been a coffee fan but the Ice Cream sure does make up for it. They have a good variety of ice cream flavors and I'm Picky when it comes to my cold desserts.  I ordered 1 scoop of the rainbow sherbet. She filled the cup all the way to the top!! Definitely not stingy! Price is very reasonable. I am still eating my first cup but I do intend on trying another flavor!! Ladies sitting next to me where complementing their lattes. So that must mean its good! Lol Oh! And they serve chicken wings here too!!!! Mmmm tempting....  I came in 8pm on a Wednesday night. I wanted my favorite treat after my pasta dinner. Door was wide open with hip music flowing from it. It seemed almost like a party! DJ Needles was his name. Wednesdays is Comedy night. Professionals and Amateurs welcome. I dropped a couple tears no lie. My gym visit is NOT needed after spending the night here. Lol  The owner was present! (Very rare at some places) Very nice guy. I loove his hair  Customer service is great!! I didn't ask the 2 young ladies names but they were smiling and attentive. I was at the counter every hour. Lol. I am impressed and left with the feeling that I MUST return next week and bring friends.   I give a thumbs up! For your time, money, and tummy ^_^} this a great place to come for Coffee, Ice Cream, Tea, or Me?  (Yes you will find me here ;)"}
{"text":"The coffee is great, thrifty ice cream is delicious... the staff is super friendly and the owners are out of this world. I love this super comfortable shop I look forward to going in every single time and can't wait for the next time I get to go back."}
{"text":"Great service , great food , great deal! We got a discount from restaurant.com so we only had to pay $15 for $30 of food, which goes a long way here. We got two sandwiches, voss water, two cafe drinks and two ice creams. The sandwiches were AMAZING! We got pastrami turkey with provolone on a croissant and roast beef with pepper jack on a croissant.   The great thing is you get to choose what bread, meat and cheese and they will toast it for you on the panini grill of you want. The toasted croissant was very good.   The server there was a great guy! Very helpful and friendly. I give him an A+. He made the whole adventure worthwhile.  Also they give you a TON of ice cream so be prepared to eat a lot! It's a great deal!  Cool little gem worth stopping by when in Vegas, especially since Starbucks here charges $6 for the same drink that costs only $3.75 outside of Vegas. This place just has regular good prices."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food. The layout of the tables and chairs is not cramped and cluttered and they do karaoke or open Mic nights on Wednesdays from 8-10PM. Nice decor and affordable prices. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee or tea. The serve some food too. And ice cream! Its clean, not to noisy, and the staff is very polite and helpful. A refreshing change from the overcrowded commercialized shops. I highly recommend a visit or two."}
{"text":"Kinda stupid they advertise open mic stand up comedy at 8:30pm when the coffee shop closes at 5pm? Thanks for making me waste a trip. This is not funny"}
{"text":"I have been trying to get coffee at this place multiple times BUT had no luck since they don't open until late in the day 9am really ....it also seems like a ice cream place than coffee shop. If you are real coffee drinkers wouldn't come here. If you want fabulous pastries and coffee visit coffee bean"}
{"text":"Not only was it easy to find but I felt the warm welcoming of the staff as soon as I entered!   This wasn't your average coffee shop.. they brewed the coffee per cup & explained the step by step process while I witnessed a bowl a coffee beans turn into a hot cup of magnificence in a matter of minutes.  And mmhmm.. donuts were served as well! Yummy!!  I didn't expect this. The best coffee at a great price served with a little history/knowledge on how coffee was made-------the proper way ;)  Thanks Guys!"}
