{"text":"Great service . Jace is wonderful. The deep dish pizza is nothing like Pizza Hut but it's ok. The Caesar salad was delish. I recommend this place to anyone who likes American food ."}
{"text":"This place is always poppin!!!! I love it here and the food is great! The one thing i wish was different is the parking... I have been coming here for years and parking is always an issue.
Some of my favorite dishes include the french dip, the bbq chicken salad, and the balsamic glazed chicken. The pazookis arent bad either;)"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch for my birthday and i was not impressed at all.  I ordered a beer & they were out off it and i. Ordered  a vodka & tonic which wasn't bad but i saw our drinks just sitting at the bar for way to long. I ordered the prime rib dip.. The waitress then came over and said they were out of the bread for the sandwich and ask if  they could put it on a hamburger bun; the food was good. But how do you run out of stuff in the middle of the week? My brother ordered another beer and that like our drinks before just sat at the bar. After we said we didn't want desert they just brought the bill didn't even ask if I wanted another drink. The all around service needs  major improvement"}
{"text":"TGIF Meets APPLEBEES.

Don't bother going if you think its a Brewery, they think the beer is \"made\" in the back. They are over staffed and under trained. The pregnant hostess in the front is worthless and needs to stay off her phone, the whole kneeling down trick was not working.  With 8+ servers on at lunch and no defined sections, everyone is running around and has no time to give superior service. Please for the love of God help your servers out, give them sections maybe 3- 6 tables all in the same area, that was half the problem. And let them know when they get a new table if they are busy. It took 15 minutes for me to flag down a server, and then another 5 to get my drinks. The menu might as well have a table of contents and the beer menu is basic. The place needs a good manager or management team. There is some positive, was once I got a server he was attentive and was able to sell a perfect check. The food was ok but no different form Applebee's, you go there to get the corporate consistency. 

The best part of my entire visit was the dessert cookie!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here. Even when they're busy the servers do quite well. And the wings and pizza are great! 

Make sure you download the BJ's app. You can get on the wait list before you get there and you get points with every purchase."}
{"text":"A French Dip that's twice the price and half the size of Arbys, and almost not as good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed !   We were asked to wait and sat down to watch people coming after us being seated.  We asked again and told they would get to us, and no they were not taking names.  Waited again and were not seated until it happened again.  We were seated and not given menus.  When I asked about gluten free we were given a list of foods in different categories, with no prices.  Asked again and were finally given a menu.  We made our choices and waited a long time for each course.  We reminded our server 4 times about our dessert and waited 40 min to finally get it.  The check came and were charged a dollar more for an item the server quoted.  Her answer was \"sorry, I was wrong.\""}
{"text":"I F*CKING LOVE BJ'S!  No pun intended. The restaurant is great too. The service is fantastic, but then again, who can say no to BJ's? The food is pretty damn good and the beer selection is awesome. Really though, I always feel treated right, the staff is awesome. The bar tenders are actually pretty cool and personable even when they're busy. Anyone who's read my reviews knows by now, that if it's a good review it's gonna be short and sweet, but my bad reviews are gonna be LONG and very descriptive. This place got the formula right. Great food, great atmosphere, great people, great beer, great desserts, terrible parking lot. The best places always have the worst parking lots."}
{"text":"Great service and food what more could I say. Our waitress Danielle was awesome she kept a smile on her face and made sure we was satisfied."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here recently @ BJ Brewery and had a great time.  I ordered Moroccan Salmon and a glass of local tap beer and my choices were awesome!  We also ordered fried calamari and avocado roll for appetizers to share.  The lunch was just perfect with great food and great company."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, service is terrible and food a 2 out of 10.  This is my third visit, keep hoping for a positive enjoyable experience, never again.  The waitress gave us silverware 3 times, no clue what she was doing!  The jambalaya salad was nothing more than chili pepper dumped on the shrimp, horrible.  My son had a medium steak, yes I know this is not a steak house, however it was leather, my dog wouldn't eat it.  We got the check before desert, call me crazy but bad food and a server with no clue for $110.00.....your right I am crazy for trying 3 times, never again."}
{"text":"BJ's has a nice open layout and a good atmosphere, especially if you like sports. There's many TV's around and a bar area where there's a big variety of beers and drinks. 
As I don't drink, smoke or like sports I won't comment on these.

I decided to try BJ's for their deep dish pizza which is advertised as Chicago style and has received positive praise so far.

The appetizers were quite good and not very heavy.

The pizza reminded me of Uno's, though not quite as good:
It wasn't real Chicago style in that the crust was relatively thick. It was more Pizza Hut pan pizza than Chicago style.

 The sauce was not on top as per Chicago tradition but it tasted great, as tangy as it should be. The other ingredients tasted fresh also. The crust was relatively generic, it was baked pretty good and was crispy on the outside but didn't much taste and was too thick to be true Chicago style. Greasiness factor was slightly above average. A small pizza can easily feed 1 person with a big appetite.

So for the pizza, 
As Chicago style: 2/5.
As \"generic deep dish pan pizza\" Pizza Hut style: 5/5 
 (much better than Pizza Hut's)

Service was just adequate. Servers weren't really attentive, they catered mostly to the people at the bar and only visited my table once after they served our order.

When I went to BJ's I wasn't aware of any big game on the TV but the people at the table next to me were shouting and cursing when they got excited (as did 2 other tables plus plenty of people in the bar area) every 3 minutes or so. I'm not a sports fan so I don't care about sports events but it appears this place is more of sports bar than a restaurant. Prepare to be annoyed by noises and shouting.

Overall I'd give this 2.5/5 (rounded to 3 because the pizza was good, not Chicago style though)."}
{"text":"Oh yum!  Our entire group thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at BJ's.  We were hungry at the Mesa Swap Meet, and decided not to stand in the long lines for fast food, so drove a ways to BJ's.  What a great decision!

First the drinks - the beer drinkers in our group loved the selection (I noticed the Chicago-based Not Your Fathers Rootbeer), and I had the skinny Margarita.  This is usually a sad imitation of a real Margarita - but not at BJ's.  Wow - it was one of the best Margarita's I've ever had.  Waitress said they have their own special blend, and there were lemon. and orange slices on the glass.

The food also was perfect.  I had the Bacon Ranch Piadina - and it was awesome - I never had anything like this before, and the fries were great too!  Others had the Quinoa Bowl, a lunch salad, and a flat bread style pizza.  All were great.

Although we were on vacation, we made a special effort to eat at BJ's one more time rather than try a new place.  So good!!  Wish that there were some locations in Illinois (near Chicago!)"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that they are a national chain, BJs actually has really great pizza.  They have a large beer selection, including a sampler and different seasonal brews.  They have a large menu with the usual apps (wings, southwest eggrolls), pastas, burgers, salads, and pizza.  My husband and I come here for their deep dish pizza- the crust is buttery and cooked to perfection.  Their traditional cheese is delicious and topped with chunks of tomatoes, and they have great specialty pizzas like bbq chicken or spinach and artichoke.  Dessert here is also the bomb- deep dish baked to order cookies called pizookies, available in different flavors and topped with ice cream (my fav is the oreo)."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times.  I hope I don't have to go back again. The service is consistently bad, the food takes forever to be delivered to the table (45+ minutes average) and the food is average at best.  I honestly don't know why there is always a wait to get a seat."}
{"text":"We have been having dinner at BJ's a couple of times a month for the past couple of years. The food and service are always good and we enjoy the vibe of the restaurant. So dinner last night was delicious as usual. We got the bill and paid cash, expecting change back. The server returned $0.50 of the $6.47 we expected. Granted, a 20% tip was going to be $6.20 and we normally tip well, but we didn't tell her to keep the change. And she gave us back 2 quarters! I don't know what to think except that we decided we wouldn't plan to go back again...ever. It should have been up to us to leave the tip."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was pretty slow! Took about 15-20min to receive drink refills after asking for one! Maybe it was just an overwhelming busy night. Will go back!"}
{"text":"The service was good and our server was very nice. The wait was a little long but we had everything right. We ordered a pazooki and that took like 10 minutes or maybe a little bit longer but we enjoyed our pazooki."}
{"text":"First time visiting a BJs restaurant and came away liking it. It was a bit small for a brewery inside, but had a great bar and TVs. Lots of beer and alcohol choices. Had a very good California burger. Pretty much a nicer version of red robin or chilies. Spent about $25 a person for food and a beer. Would go back"}
{"text":"Erica Is Simply theBEST!!! 

Having a great meal at the bar while my wife was at a work interview. Being from Reno, NV,  I am a frequent visitor of BJ's. But hands down, though having good visits to my local BJ's, this was a most rewarding treat! Erica was a delightful lady to meet. Attentive, vivacious, and quite personable... Needless to say she is splendiferous while being quite professional and attentive to other patrons! Giving my visit a 10 for service, food, and above all friendliness & professionalism!"}
{"text":"Loved our server, Jennifer! Best wishes to her and her baby girl  Excellent service and great food. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Good food. Staff is attentive and always telling me about new items and specials. The bar is fully stocked and but I especially love the speciality beers. Bartender was great at letting me sample a couple before I made up my mind. Only downside is the place is jammed packed, tables are close to each other. Sometimes I felt like I was shouting at my dinner date."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fair here. Nice place, clean and friendly staff. The food is always good as well. Only issue I have with this place is the fact that the darn floors are so slippery I have almost slipped several times and I've seen a couple people fall. Take care while you walk through the place."}
{"text":"Dinner with a group of 10 on Tuesday night.  Placed was packed but service was still good.  Great variety of draft beer, very good appetizers and Lemon Chicken was very good.  Definitely going to be a regular dinner spot."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great beers.

I have gone a few times and the food is always good. Love the choices of home brewed beers.

The service isn't the best. Each time the server seemed uninterested in serving us. The time to get the food is always slow also.

If you don't care how long it takes to get food this is a good spot. Wouldn't recommend to anyone on any sort of time crunch or busy schedule."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love coming to this place. The food is piquant, the service is wonderful, and we always have a good time. I would suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on this trip to BJ's we got here at 6:10 p.m. seated at 6:35 p.m. it's a Thursday they have the rib special dinner and they were out of ribs! seriously BJ's? At 6:35 Prime dinner hour you think they would have been prepared with their special of the day. We Come here once in a great while it's been about a year because service was terrible the last time we were here. Now I have to say the availability of their specials is definitely not good don't know if we'll be coming back sorry to say. Update as we asked for the check we see ribs being served two other tables this will be the last time we came to BJ's. The server said they found a few more ribs, really."}
{"text":"Ive been here numerous times. A good place for consistent food and drinks when shopping or errands on that side of town.
This review is for Friday night with a group of 7 at around 7pm. We were expecting a wait (it's Friday at dinner rush) so my husband & I got there early and ordered drinks at the bar after putting our names on the list. The wait was an hour - typical for a popular restaurant on a Friday night. We enjoyed a glass of Pinot and a house lager before the rest of our party joined us.
We were so lucky- an 8 top table in the bar area opened up and we swooped it up! I prefer bar dining, anyways. We are a low maintenance group that understands the workings of a busy restaurant. Our server was friendly and efficient for how busy she was. We ordered the avocado rolls, calamari and boneless buffalo wings for apps. Everyone had beer or cocktails and started Cesar salads. Everything was timed right and satisfying. We ordered 3 pizzas (theirs are deep dish). My husband asked for no tomatoes on ours and they made with tomatoes- but they realized the mistake and started making one without while leaving the pizza with so we weren't eating after the rest of our group. The server was apologetic and the manager brought the correct pizza out when it was ready. 
They handled the situation correctly and we were happy with the service. For some people this would ruin their dinner... But really- stuff happens, the apologized and fixed it! What more could you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"Great tasting food, good service, nice atmosphere. 
Will be back soon.
Highly reccomended!!"}
{"text":"I am a local. That is I was born here. Since BJ's open I've been here a lot and by that I mean weekly. I would say 2 out of 5 times it goes wonderfully, but 2 out of 5 is why I don't come here as often is why I don't come here as often  but it is convenient  and most people are satisfied. And rightly so they do have some excellent things before they change the jambalaya it was my very favorite. And the Jeremiah red is the best micro brew available in a restaurant chain. I am @ at BJ's today with my mother in law and enjoyed a mushroom Portobello swiss burger rare the first time it came out was not correct however the server rectify the situation quickly and I had a wonderful meal. But he insisted to call the manager over which seemed rather unconcerned  with  problem with the food. Despite the lack of managerial assistance the meal went great."}
{"text":"This place has phenomenol service! The beer and food is pretty darn good too (we had the new Orleans jambalaya & the cherry Chipotle smoked salmon). But I am leaving this review mostly because I was so blown away by the customer service.... from the hostess, the server, the manager and even the bus boy! Everyone was incredibly kind and went out of their way to accommodate us in having a pleasant experience. Well done guys, THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"I've always liked BJ's, however this was my first time trying a burger. I was disappointed. I ordered the sliders minus onion and lettuce. All I got was way overcooked patties between 2 buns. They decided to omit the pickles, ketchup and cheese (paid an extra 1.50 for the cheese). Lesson learned, don't order burgers from here."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would.  Slow, inaccurate service and average food.  They made a mistake on our order and after correcting it, it was still on our bill.  The waiter asked us during the middle of eating \"you probably don't want dessert, do you?\"  That was easy to answer."}
{"text":"Came to this place with family. Price is right for what you get. Desserts are famous here. I got the red velvet pazookie is was so delicious had to order 1 more. Service was alright . They just wanna turn around tables there. Other than that the hostess was very nice had to only wait for 5 minutes for a table.  and the server was showing his hospitality there. Good job"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at BJ's on Eastern for what we thought would be a nice dinner. I have eaten at the one in Summerlin and really liked it. I was so disappointed at the customer service. We were seated after about 10 minutes. Then 20 minutes passed and we were never even acknowledged by anyone! 3 sets of customers sat in our aisle after us and all had their drinks and orders in. I have no idea how they could ignore a table.The wait staff was congregated at the restroom entrance, no sense of customer service. I spoke with the Manager and all he did was apologize. We walked out. THE WORST service ever!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good (even though my order was wrong) but the waitress got a group of employees and started looking at my party and started laughing at all of us. she didn't even say she was sorry to any of us tonight. not eating here again because I don't like being laughed at."}
{"text":"Bjs rule...get ur mind out of the gutter beavis. But they do:) muhaaahhah"}
{"text":"Best waitress, top notch beer and awesome half price pizza on monday!! Can not ask for more with pizzookies at $3 as well just wow! If you enjoy good affordable food thats miles better than any regular diner, this is your place!"}
{"text":"We have been there several times since its opening. Great food, decent service, fun drinks. They have a good app that has given us lots of coupons and free stuff. The servers are inconsistent. Some are amazing...some ok. Never had a bad experience. Worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! We discovered the BJs app right before paying and saved $5 off of $20. Pretty convenient - you can pay your bill via the app and don't need to wait for your server. Our table ordered avocado rolls as a starter and they're absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Great food - truly very good.  Love the pizzas, both the tavern cut and the deep dish.  Excellent beer selection - they have their own brand as well as a good selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Just another chain restaurant. Dry meat, cold fries, poor service. Not sure what I expected when I walked in."}
{"text":"Okay, so my rating may say A-OK but that is only because I'm giving it an average rating of all of my combined experiences.  Honestly, I haven't been to this BJ's location since my birthday 2 1/2 years ago, which was an absolutely horrific experience.  This evening I decided to give it another go, since it's so close to home, well thankfully, this experience was like night and day, in comparison to 2 years ago.  Vicki was my server; she was friendly, my order was correct, and has ensured I will return to this location sooner rather than later (but only if I get to sit in her service section.)"}
{"text":"Very good beer selection, with rotating seasonal selections, with most going for $5.50.  A bit on the high side for me.  We ordered a vegetarian pizza with extra ham on half and the stuffed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were very tasty, came 6 to a plate, and were gone in a short amount of time.  The server in training put in the original pizza order in wrong, putting just ham on half.  They brought out this pizza already aware it was wrong, and brought another one out to make the order right.  Two pizzas for the price of one, good deal!! The pizza was very good, the sauce was sweet and the crust nice and crunchy."}
{"text":"Had AMAZING Service!!  Anthony was our server and he went above and beyond what any server has ever done for my family.  He brought a cider for me to try that he thought I would like and he was super attentive!  Our food was fantastic and everything was so nice!!"}
{"text":"daryl was the best server i have ever had! he deserves a nice tip every visit"}
{"text":"We had a large party - approximately 15 and request separate checks. The food was good, as always, but a shout out to our server, Gaelan K., who did a superior job handling our large table."}
{"text":"Nothing here to get real excided about. The prices are ok. The food also is ok"}
{"text":"I come to this place every time I visit Vegas.  The beers are good. The food is great and reasonably priced  My personal favorite is the pesto cilantro pizza, but I have really liked everything I've had there.

It is a really fun place to hang out at the bar.  My favorite bartender there, Mike, is quite the  charmer.  It's always nice to be flirted with, even if you are old enough to be his..uh.. slightly older sister.

I had to take away one star because the kitchen and bar close way too early."}
{"text":"Generally my wife and enjoy going for the good beer and tasty food. On our last trip when we go the bill I noticed that we had been billed for an extra beer. The waitress said she would take care of this. About ten minutes later she came by to say she was trying to get the manager to take it off the bill. Five minutes later we walked to the front and asked to see a manager. A lady who said she was a manager said she working on get the charge removed, but had to get approval from her manager who was busy with another matter. Get your act together, BJ."}
{"text":"Quickly climbing the charts as my favorite place to eat in town is BJ's! Their menu is incredible, their beer and wine list is excellent, and their service is great! Hubby got a huge burger that he quickly devoured. I ordered the Alfredo pizza (made from scratch) and it was the best pizza I've ever had! The kids got the mac and cheese and devoured it of course! To top off the dinner we had the chocolate chip pizzone, which was to die for! Be sure to call ahead and put your name on the list as this place is always packed, and for good reason! Run, don't walk, to this place."}
{"text":"I like this Resturaunt . It's always consistent in its meal perpetration and regardless of time of day I always get a seat. The service is great never had a bad server.  Seems priced right and could easily be my favorite neighborhood Resturaunt"}
{"text":"We got takeout on a Saturday night. The place was packed with people waiting.  When I entered I waited in line at the front desk only to be told the takeout desk was up the stairs by the bar.  My food was ready and brought out promptly.

I'm giving 3 stars for the lack of organization inside and the price.  We got an appetizer 1 medium pizza and a tavern style pizza for 50.00.  The pizza was good, but not great.  Nothing I would need or probably will have again.

This place is worth a try, but probably not a place I would return to"}
{"text":"I visited BJ's two nights ago solo with my two small kids. We had to wait a bit as it was a busy spring break night, but upon seating we were immediately greeted by our server, Dan. Dan was speedy and courteous and kind, and our food came out really quickly! Everything was delicious but what made the experience over-the-top great was Dan's professionalism, patience and kindness during our meal. Mid-dessert, my youngest needed to use the restroom so we asked Dan to make sure no one cleared the table while we were away. When we returned, we saw that Dan had made a fort of napkins and empty metal pitchers with a handwritten sign \"DO NOT TOUCH\" over the half-eaten pizookie plate. We laughed so much. The best customer service we've received anywhere in recent memory! Thank you, Dan!"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service and awesome pizzas. There rootbeer is without a doubt a 5. Lacking consistency in there food and service is why i am giving it a 4. Excellent ribs best in town."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome service!  Food is amazing. Employees are awesome. Every birthday or event I always come here. The menu has such a wide variety. They offer a rewards program and you can call ahead and tell them you will be there soon and they will hold a table. Also I come here for the pazooki :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the spaghetti. So delicious. Spicy. Loved the huge portions. My sister got the bison burger. Evrrtthing is so fresh and yummy.  Cheered me up for today. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Every time we go we love the food and love the service!! Recommend getting the app, for some great reward points etc..the Hickory brisket bacon burger is amazing!!!!! And you just have to get a Pizookie!! The Monkey bread and the salted caramel are our favorite!! I also love how they will substitute anything I need to for diet restrictions!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of BJ's since the late 90's when I first started going to the one in West Covina, CA.  Of course it's reasonable to expect menu changes from time to time and I have never been disappointed in the food quality.  This location can be a real chore to park at, and it's not uncommon to have to circle the lot for 15 minutes at dinnertime to find even a far spot.  I have always been a Brewhouse Blonde Fish and Chips fan, even through its changes throughout the years, and my last trip here was no exception.  My favorite beer is the Brewhouse Blonde and I can drink those for days.  The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my next favorite item and luckily for me, DW always orders it so I can sneak a bite or two.

Service last time I was there was a bit lacking as our server wan't completely focused on our orders.  After taking our drink orders, she bolted off before we could order any appetizers.  Once she came back around, we ordered up some Pepperoni Extreme and Margherita Fresca pizzas for our appetizers and off she went to put in the order.  When the order came out, we got the pepperoni, but a California Club pizza instead of the Margherita.  I guess this is what happens when servers don't write down your order.

I get it, servers have bad days, so there's no animosity here or malice there, and the rest of our order came back fine.  Our server could have checked in a few more times for refills but like I said, she was probably having a bad day, or was just about to clock out.  

It looked like a new menu since the last time I dined here, but my faves were still there.  BJ's was it's normal good self, but maybe its magic is starting to wear off for me.  It's a solid four stars for the food and the iffy service didn't make it lose any stars; it's just that this place isn't as great for me now as it was when I was in my twenties.  I miss the clam chowder and the chicken lettuce wraps.

Call ahead seating saves time and I wish all restaurants would do this.  Plenty of TVs all around the restaurant to keep abreast of the local and national sports teams.  I will definitely come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and ordered a cocktail and asked for a double. They brought me a shot on the side and didn't tell me the price of the bourbon. Ended up paying  $26 for one lousy drink?? Tell someone when a shot is more than the drink itself because you aren't \"allowed\" to make a double"}
{"text":"We come here 2 or 3 times a month maybe more, and we generally have a great experiance, we went in a few days ago and had better service from our food runner than our server, although the food was good the experiance was just eh. To start it took us a long while to get greeted, once we were it was by Sarah who seemed alright but way more focused on stocking and getting ready to leave than her tables, tables that were there after us were greeted and served before us, we ordered some drinks I had the watermelon ale which was fantastic, we had a Margherita Flatbread and sliders to start which were also fantastic, but we were abondonded on many ocasions, I've worked in the industry for many years and understand how the system works, maybe sarah was having a rough day, wasn't bad enough to were I'd avoid her section, just hope for a little more attention to detail next time, but we do love this place and the happy hour!! Recommend this location to anyone, I haven't had a meal or drink I haven't liked yet!!"}
{"text":"This review is going to be a bit lopsided because I only come in on Tuesdays for their drink specials.

The food I've had has been really good: flat bread pizzas, spring rolls, lettuce wraps, burgers, and best of all, their pizookie. All of it is great every time. Tuesdays are definitely the days to go; $2 BJ's pints from 10 to close. You'd think the selection of brews to have on special is too narrow, but they've got a beer for anyone. My favorites so far have been the Jeremiah Red (pretty strong Irish red ale), the Nit Wit (Belgian spiced ale), Big Fish (a pale ale stronger than the Piranha pale ale), and the Grand Cru (10% Beligian!). The servers we've had over the past couple years have all been great and really friendly. Totally worth it, if only for the Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Frances made our night amazing!! Her passion for serving is unlike any I've ever seen! She genuinely cares about her guests and their experience at the restaurant, which is something I find so rare since most servers only care about money. She told me that she has been serving since the 90's but I think she should be doing a lot more! Her enthusiasm and passion should have her in a managerial position! Or at the very least her base pay should be raised. BJ's is blessed to have such an amazing employee! I would 10/10 request her every time!"}
{"text":"Finally!  A BJ's in Henderson!  This location opened about a month ago, and from the business it was doing this past Friday night, it's going to be around for a long time.

The food is as good as I remember from my few visits to the Summerlin location.  The pizzas are fantastic (try the BJ's favorite or the Great White).  The loaded baked potatoes are gigantic and filled to the brim with your choice of toppings (the garden veggie and chili cheese are delicious).  And the salads, especially the field greens and the bbq chopped, are enormous and really tasty.

I went with a group of 8 people and our food came out relatively quickly (especially considering how busy it was).  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I'd recommend a visit!

Just a word of advice: if you're planning on visiting this location on a friday night or over the weekend, I'd recommend calling ahead and getting yourself on the wait list (it gets really busy!).  The restaurant only takes reservations for groups larger than 10, but if you call ahead about an hour before you want to eat, the greeter will put your name on the wait list and you'll get a table pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Drinks took 15, app took 20. Entrees took 35. No sense of urgency from staff. Rarely saw staff and never saw a manager. Disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and decided to stop for lunch. Got the soup and salad lunch special. Great choices of soup and salad. And didn't have to wait like at Olive Garden for soup and salad. Very good and will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful and the service is even better! We had Maggie as a server, and she was so attentive, fun, and amazing!"}
{"text":"I find this restaurant to have delicious food and a good ambiance. The service has never disappointed me throughout the many times I have eaten at the establishment. I find that the menu has many options, yet anything I have ever ordered comes out in perfect order and taste. The Parmesan crusted chicken is a family favorite. The portions are good-sized and no one has ever left hungry. The prices are a bit high in some cases, but the overall experience and good food make it worth spending a few extra dollars."}
{"text":"My mother and I went for lunch at about 2 PM. We walked right in and was immediately seated. The restaurant was very nice, open and clean. My mother and I both ordered the southern fried chicken, it was amazing! The portions were on the smaller side but very filling. We spent under $20 for the both of us. We will definitely be recommending this place to others and coming back again!"}
{"text":"BJ's is OK on occasion. My husband loves the mostly sauceless, tomato-strewn pan pizza. Me, not so much. However, the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud, but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant, in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy, and we see a lot of families, so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well.

I've tried various dishes here, such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy, and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur, so YMMV! On separate occasions, I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish, which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions, and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans, feta, red peppers, and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider, which is really sweet and hit the spot.

For dessert, the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good, so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally, I'm a caffeine fiend, so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks.

I recommend BJ's for a casual night out."}
{"text":"I like BJS but this location sucks takes for every to get any thing. Servers got their nose in the air. Food gets messed up.. I've been to this location three times same story..

Good luck to all that go to this location you'll be there for awhile.."}
{"text":"I can never figure out why this place is so crowded.  The location can't make up for the mediocre food and ineffective busybody service.  If you liked TGI Fridays 15 years ago this place is the updated brew house equivalent, with a dose of cheesecake factory for good measure.  After 3 visits the photos in the menu are the most impressive thing about the food.  The environment at BJ's  is stressful due to the busy crowds and chaotic haphazard service.  They have good beer,  but the house offerings are all pretty uninspired and safe.  The best beer offerings are available nearby in much better restaurants,  especially if you appreciate sole-proprietorships and less \"corporate\"  atmospheres.  Again 10-15 years ago this place would have been something.  Today it's only notable quality is the crowds."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving BJ's two stars is because the beer was good, and the food was OK. The service was absolutely awful and that is one of my biggest pet peeves. I hate complaining because I have been in the food service industry all my life, but we all were just so disappointed. We had a larger group for a birthday party. To a server, this is great news because this is your chance to make some tips; what you signed up to be a server for. Instead, we overheard snotty remarks about how big our group was and the lack of smiles and friendliness was not overlooked. It took over an hour to receive my food specifically, so I ate while everyone else was finished without complaint. I understand having a big group may take a while for food orders, but at least apologize and if you made a mistake, which had to have been the case with my order, own up to it. Instead, I got no apology, no explanation, no manager coming over to diffuse the situation, no comp of anything, no check up to see how my food came out, or anyone else in our party for that matter; just a throw of the plate in front of me when my food was finally presented. I can honestly say, even if the food was fantastic and they had the best beer I've ever had, I would never go back there purely for the service. I want to have an enjoyable experience when I go out and spend my hard earned money; not sit there feeling like a \"burden\" to our server."}
{"text":"Decided to have an early family lunch today at BJ's and they were great. We arrived around 11:30 a.m. right after the doors opened pretty much, and were seated within about 10 minutes. 

From the moment we walked in the atmosphere was pleasant and warm with friendly smiles from the hostess at the front desk. 

My husband and I both ordered a club sandwich (toasted sourdough bread with Swiss cheese, bacon, ham, and turkey) accompanied by a delicious salad. This was off of the Enlightened menu which provides delicious and healthy choices for all under a certain amount of calories (I think it was 700). 

Our waitress was sweet and our food was on the table in roughly 15-20 minutes. 

When we left we were all talking about how delicious the mozzarella sticks were! These were by far the best I have ever tasted! 

Thank you BJ's for a pleasant lunch today! You are definitely doing something right because the flow of people coming in as soon as the doors opened is proof.

{"text":"Love the BJ'S  location in columbus...... the locarion by Summit Mall needs to work on their customer service! We sat at a high top table in the bar for over 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon  and we were completely and rudely ignored by several servers.  The couple at the table next to us was also upset by the extremely inattentive service.  I asked the hostess if i could speak to a manager and of course, they did not come over.  Needless to say we left and will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner with our two kids and my youngest was not happy. She was super hungry and cranky (9 months old).  I put in the kids order as soon as our waitress, Shennah (not sure if I spelt that right), came over. She came back with our drinks AND a starter for my kids. It was just a little kids starter but it was so appreciative and we've never had that given to us before. It made my daughter happy, and she devoured the fruit within a minute or two. We actually ended up ordering her an additional side because she loved it. Our food was good, but our waitress really made our experience enjoyable!  She went above what we have ever experienced there before and we will definitely be back. If you stop in ask for her section. You'll be in great hands!"}
{"text":"From BJ's website, \"Our menu features BJ's own delicious, innovative spin on your favorite foods, including deep dish pizzas, salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs and so much more.\"  That's all true. Well, the delicious and innovative claims are debatable but they do have an extensive menu. Possibly too extensive.

The food is OK and much like that food you'll find at Yard House, Gordon Biersch, TGI Fridays, etc. Yes, they have their own \"spin\" but it's really not that much different.

Service has always been friendly. The food shows up quickly and I've never had to wait for a refill.  They really push their BJ's beer but they have a number of other beers on tap (ask for a Bud Light - go on, I dare you!).

Not a bad spot to grab lunch or dinner. Just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Start with the caprese salad. It's less than $4 and sooooo amazing! To drink get the Irish Root beer if you're 21+. You won't regret it! Made with handcrafted root beer. They also have tons of beer in draft but nothing you would usually see anywhere. But if you want a boring standard beer, your waiter will recommend something close but craft. They are so knowledgeable with their beers it's refreshing. Then, order the deep dish buffalo pizza. The hot sauce they put on there isn't your normal Franks Red Hot Sauce. It's kinda sweet, mild and tangy. Dessert? Save room for the pazookie!!! Mushy baked cookie right to your table. Amazing. And they're open late and everyone is friendly.."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Mediocre service.
I have tried othet BJs locations in the US which have been consistently good.
Unfortunately I chose to have dinner last  night at the Eastern Ave location in Las Vegas with a friend. Wait for table was short as stated.
Nicholas, our server, was dismissive and blamed the long wait for our food on inexperienced kitchen staff . When food finally came, IT WAS COLD. As it probably stood in the kitchen for at least 10 minutes. Requested onion rings instead of fries. Greasy and cold.
Will NOT recommended and will NEVER eat at this BJs again.
Do yourself a favor and go to In-n-Out Burger instead. Better tasting burgers and much better service because at least there you get what you pay for. Not at this BJs"}
{"text":"It's alright. The drinks menu is pretty good, but the food is pretty average. 
If you like chili, don't bother with theirs...you'd be better off having Stagg chili at home. The burgers, flatbread pizzas, salads are all ok. 
Red velvet bazookie was the bomb, but I can't justify another star just for that."}
{"text":"Been here twice, never really enjoy anything about it. The service is ok at best. As mentioned in other reviews these folks work real hard at \"upselling\" which is what they are supposed to do but it needs to be done with a better delivery, not so much of the car sales extra warranty and rain protector package. Now the food is about as boring and bland as anything I have ever had. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms for the table as an appitizer, this may sound stupid but all they tasted like were mushrooms. They are supposed to be stuffed with some other stuff but did not detect much of that. On to the entrees. I ordered the fried artichoke hearts with an aoli dipping sauce. They tasted like crunchy. Thats rite crunchy, no flavor at all. I ate 1 and became disenchanted. My mother had the pork chop and told me to have a bite so I could be a believer in there food again. It was served with sauteed onions so all I tasted was onion, again lack of any disconcerable flavor I.E. pork. I must say that my 1 year old daughter enjoyed her Mac N Cheese and apple sauce very much.Oh my other daughter ordered the mini corn dogs but got Mac N Cheese. The server offerd to correct it but we didnt really care any more. 1 thing I found odd was that at no time did the server ask any of us how the food was even though I clearly had not eaten any of mine and nor had my wife, (chicken lettuce wraps) they were'nt bad just not good. Overall not worth the $60 bill for such medeocricy. Its ok though. People with a limited palate and bland taste need a place to eat to."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great pan pizza try this restaurant. If you want great craft beer, go elsewhere. Their beer is average, but you'll pay a premium for it. A fair number of beers are not even on tap, which happens a lot. The service was perfect the first time I went there. The waitress read through the menu and made suggestions all while tending to drinks and not having to be flagged down. The last time I went was not good, I had an empty water and a waitress who didn't care to check on the table until I was ready to leave. The food is decent enough for the price, if there is no wait it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"No good customer service even when restaurant is almost empty!!! Left after 10 min waiting in the bar area and it's not the 1st time!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg the menu at Bj's is so big & the options are incredible. I personally love coming in for dinner I just love the atmosphere at that time:) the management at this location is awesome they will go out of there way to make sure that you are satisfied no questions asked! Also the staff at this location is very kind always have a smile on there faces & ready to greet you as soon as you walk threw that windmill door. If you haven't tried Bj's at all or this location at that I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"BEWARE of your take out orders. Double checking is a MUST. Ordered a French Dip sandwich for take out and the staff decided to hold the Au jus sauce. Nothing quite like a dip sandwich with no Dip. Careless staff."}
{"text":"We had a mixed experience here today.  I'll start with the positive:  The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks.  The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls, the other kind of spring rolls (not sure what they were called), and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer).  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!  
Ok, so now for the bad:  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion....
Anyway, not sure if we will be going here again, but maybe we'll try the deep dish pizza next time."}
{"text":"I'm going to give them a four star rating because of their pazookie dessert.  If you haven't tried or heard about a pazookie you must check it out.  It's one of the most delicious desserts in town.  It's a homemade cookie I. A deep dish pizza pan cooked 3/4 of the way through top end with a n amazing vanilla ice-cream.  The bar is hopping with dozens of beer options on tap and in bottles.  Menu is huge and all over the place, I'm not a big fan of the entrees.  Apps are good and dessert is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Terrible bar! And the bartender said it himself \"we just have a basic bar here.\" I asked for a Moscow Mule and he said it would be $12 bc they charge for each ingredient separate AND they don't serve it in a tin cup. Not that it's a huge deal, but that's part of that drinks schitck, especially if you want me to pay that much. So I asked for a rum and coke. No rum. I heard the lady beside me ask for several drinks and he kept turning her down, stating they didn't have those kinds of liquor.

Another person on here commented on the parking, and they were right. It sucks. That's one of THE FIRST THINGS my friend and I said as we got out of the car. The parking sucks. 

Food was good, can't complain about that. It was actually really good. But, probably won't go back since apparently the bartender only knows how to pour beer."}
{"text":"Very good service from our server, Dino. Very nice and on top of all our needs. Our bill was 38 bucks and change, which I did not feel was overpriced for all that for all we ordered. That included a beer each, a shared app, two sandwiches and a shared pizookie. ( Which was worth a return in itself). All of our food was good, service was great and our waters were never allowed to get empty. Both of our beers were BJ brands and were both well done. I can't really say anything that was bad but I can't say it was a solid 5 star. I only reserve those for the very best but if there was a  4 1/2 star rating I would give it to them."}
{"text":"Everything I had was great... My wife on the other hand, got food poisoning. She had the California Chicken sandwich and a caesar salad..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very friendly service specifically precilla  ! Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"Kevin Morrison - Manager of BJ's in Henderson is a moron.  I have eaten at the this restaurant about 150 times in three years.  It's a fast fix to mediocre food at cheap corporate prices  when you have a busy business schedule like myself-a step above Burger King, McDonalds and other fast food chains.  Basically this is corporate America - hiring idiots who can't deliver simple requests like a decent salad that doesn't look like a small Hamster portion with shredded and soggy lettuce and chopped tomato!  Looks like one of those prepackaged salads at McDonalds.  Sorry, I requested actual sliced tomato, avocado and red onion and real lettuce but the dumb server screwed it up.  Let alone I order a charbroiled steak (not fried) and they only charbroiled one side with that facing up (as if I would'nt notice).  When I sent back the salad without eating it this manager - a little \"piss ant\" bald jerk comes running out and tells me to leave the restaurant and not come back!  About a month before that the lot was entirely full without one space so I parked my car in the take out area and this little creep Morrison comes running up to the bar threatening to tow me!  When I complained to Corporate Management they actually defended him!  It must be difficult to find decent employees with the crappy wages they pay.  So much for getting repeat business - they could care less.  Better to hire twenty bad employees and pay them crap than hire five good ones and pay them fairly.  That's why their turnover is so high.  Steer clear of this place is my advice."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good--no complaints there. But the service was downright abysmal. We showed up at 4:30 p.m. for dinner and were seated immediately. The place was empty, so we figured service would be quick and attentive. We were very wrong. They were completely out of kids' menus, so we had to guess at what to order. Appetizer of guacamole and chips took 20 minutes to arrive. Kids' meals arrived shortly thereafter, but their applesauce was served in a sealed generic GFS container. A bowl would have been too much work, I guess. My husband's salad never did show up, so we asked for it to be removed from our check. Drinks were woefully neglected, and the check took another 15-20 minutes to be taken care of after we requested it. The whole time, it was impossible to find our server anywhere. Usually we give places a couple tries before we give up, but we aren't willing to drop another $50 on this place. Save your money and time and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I go here a lot, it's one of my favorite restaurants. Everything I have gotten here is amazing.One of my favorites is the Parmesan crusted chicken, the pizza is also great any day. But when you are there you must get the pizookie, it's a gift from above. Deep dish cookie with cool sweet ice cream on top is a great dessert for any time of the year. And to drink they brew their own root beer and cream sodas, also as you may guess it is off the wall good. In my book BJ's is a necessity."}
{"text":"Epic win! My husband and I stumbled into this restaurant wanting to try out something new. We were blown away by the large selection, the great service and delicious food. This place quickly became a favorite and we will definitely be visiting more often. After all, there are so many more menu items to try!"}
{"text":"We are frequent flyers to BJs and have been for years!  I really like the food and my & I both enjoy their beer.  I have had a couple of experiences over the years where I have had an issue with the food not being cooked enough, or the seared ahi not being what it usually is, but they always correct it for us when we mention it.  This doesn't happen that frequently though.  We also have a favorite waitress here, but won't mention her name because she happens to be everyone's favorite and her section gets full with all of her following.  Most of the other staff is friendly and efficient as well.  
It is very busy there especially during snowbird season.  So either call ahead to put your name on the list or get over 1000 points on your rewards card so you can call and make reservations.  :-)"}
{"text":"It's was a nice atmosphere and the food was good. Great service. Will go there again. Nice place to gather with a few friends. They also brew their own beer which is pretty nice :-)"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here on a late Thursday night and we had the best service out of all the locations here! Our waiter and busser were so attentive and helpful when it came to choosing things on the menu. They gave us samples of drinks that we were anxious to try and had great conversation. It's the closest one to my house so I will most definitely always come here!"}
{"text":"The jalapeño burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had! I also love their strawberry lemonade! Sometimes we wait a little bit for the food but it is totally worth the wait! Everytime someone visits from out of state we bring them to BJS and they love it as well!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday afternoon, it was not busy, the hostess immediately sat us. Despite the restaurant having numerous open tables she sat us directly next to another couple. And then we sat there and after 10 minutes without even waters or a server stopping by to say they would be with us soon we left. Completely unacceptable"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything i had eaten! I had the pulled pork sandwich and it came with fries and coleslaw.  Everything tasted fresh like it was made that day. The atmosphere is nice as well, the ceilings are really high so its not too noisy. The staff was very friendly and trained well for only being open a few days."}
{"text":"Called ahead and they told us to be in at 615pm. When we arrived they had no record of us in the system. They refused to help or fix the problem and told us we would have to wait a hour and fifteen minutes. Terrible service lady at the front could care less and did nothing to help."}
{"text":"I love their \"adult\" homemade rootbeer is very tasty and delicious! It is pretty strong since they put jameson in it too. 

The thai shrimp lettuce wraps are full of flavor and spicy! The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is so good! It is topped with buffalo chicken peices, celery, and ranch dressing. mmmM!! The grilled chicken stuffed potato was HUGE! It was topped with chicken and alfredo sauce. 

Don't get me started on their pizookies! The white chocolate macadamia topped with vanilla ice cream is my favorite!

Service is usually hit or miss here. The last time I went, our server SUCKED. It took her forever to take our orders. My friend accidentally dropped a piece of food in his water and when he asked her for a new water, she just filled it up. It took us about 5 more mins to wave her down to tell her that he wanted a new water due to him dropping food in it. Then she just brings us our check without even asking if we wanted dessert. And of course we wanted dessert! 

The food is great, but the service is just okay."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we will go back to try other menu options. The Honey-Sriracha Sprouts was very good and well liked as was the Calamari. The Jambalaya was also tasty. The Parmesan chicken was a bit disappointing and the Bacon Cheeseburger was average. There was a decent selection of drinks."}
{"text":"We walked in hoping to find the nascar race, out of six Tvs in the whole restaurant the manager Jamie came over to the front and said \"we can't accommodate you.\" And that was it, when asking why? She replied \"we only have six satellites and eight games on..\" And that was it. When there were barely any people in the restaurant and the same game was on three Tvs!, we walked over to twin peaks where they changed a TV for us! Now we're enjoying our time there watching the race"}
{"text":"Great restaurant & atmosphere! We shared the calamari appetizer & it was delicious. We had the cod & jalepenos burger for dinner. Both dishes were great!!! Nick is the nicest, most professional, down to earth waiter! He recommended great meals & his conversations were enjoyable! Thank you BJs & Nick!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you to our great server Angela H. and the other staff members for making my mom's 80th birthday celebration a success!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer, food and service. Our server, Corey, was excellent. Had the deep dish pizza last time, went with the pulled pork this time. Both were amazing! My fiance is a vegetarian and was extremely happy with her salad. She was also thrilled that there is actually a selection of items she can eat. We are new to the area but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First let me say that the selection and the food is great! But the service needs work. With this location being new they may just have a few kinks to work out, but both times we have gone we waited at least 15 minutes before being acknowledged by waitstaff and taking our drink order. I watched a few tables near us actually get up and leave. Also both times are appetizers came out after our meals. I am not going to write BJs off just yet because as I said earlier the food is good and the food and drink menu is huge! Hopefully the service will get better with time."}
{"text":"Took a group of people there for lunch. 

One of the wedge salads came out frozen, not sure how that is even possible if it is fresh and had just been plated. 

Ordered the Avacado Egg Rolls as an appetizer and found a \"Grown in California\" sticker in one of them. I guess we know where they get the Avacodos from... 

I know there were 11 people so a lot to coordinate, but the meals did not come out together and some were cold so I think there was a bit of mis-timing in preparing them."}
{"text":"If you want a big and tasty burger get the black and blu burger its so goood! Very juicy"}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times. The food was good and reasonably priced. Lots of options. We have had good service. I just don't know why all of their wine, cocktails and beer is so overpriced. Actually more than restaurants that we would consider high end. If we are planning on cocktails we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I paid a visit last Friday. This place has good food and more variety than yardhouse. But the drinks are way costly. The long island comes at 9.75$ and a mojito comes at 8.50$. If you have the money it's worth paying a visit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service. There are many menu items to choose from. 

Plus Pizookies are awesome! You get a free one for your birthday ;)"}
{"text":"Wow,  had a great lunch special today Chicken Tortilla Soup and Caesar Salad.

Unlimited Soup & Salad $6.95

Your choice of soup and a house or Caesar salad (unlimited refills). For some reason I thought I had to order only one type of salad and soup.  When the waiter came back and asked if I would like another soup/salad I didn't realize I could order a Clam Chowder, Chilli or Minestrone Soup.  It was fantastic!

They also have snacks and small bites starting at $2.95 so you can have a variety.  

Desserts?  Pizookie's to die for!!!

You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Your choice of Chocolate Chunk, Red Velvet, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut.

or

BJ's Baked Beignet
Their delicious bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream."}
{"text":"I love love this place... food and service is always great! The trio pazoooookie \"YUM\" always hits the spot for a sweet craving.."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried BJ's for the first time and the food was excellent.  After going through the entire menu (it's HUGE!!), we finally made a decision.  
He ordered the braised short rib.  The meat was very tender and tasty. I ordered the steak and it was cooked to perfection.  The baked potato was a bit over cooked but I can overlook that.
The server did forget my husband's beer but he apologized profusely for it.  Overall, we were surprised by the food and service."}
{"text":"So we had the fish tacos and the fish and chips. We are really satisfied with our choices. And because it's new years we get a free dessert. Yummy. Also what's great about this day is that my gf and I tried to come here on our first date over a year ago and it was so busy we went somewhere eles. So it's nice to come back to and have that date."}
{"text":"I'm in the service industry and I appreciate a good dining experience. I was about to go to P.F. Chang's for my lunch break until I realized you guys have 2 pokestops in your restaurant. I sat at the bartop and I think my bartenders name was Rebbeca. She saw me playing on my phone and we ended up talking pokemon. Your menu is huge and I like that there are so many options.  Service was great, the food was great, and I got to get my pokemon fix. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and looks ok. Nothing special to me, decent food, good beer but I am not going craze for it!. Fried calamari a bit greasy but tasty, fish tacos ok, steak was very good. I love coffee and they don't serve cappuccino. Great service!"}
{"text":"Actually the 3 stars are for the food.   Service was not good.  We had 3 meals delivered with the statement that the Parmesan chicken would be right out!  10 minutes later and having flagged down our waiter who said they were waiting for the broccoli .....seriously !   If that was even true, bring the other food and deliver the broccoli on a separate plate!  The waiter delivered the chicken and never even apologized....I wanted to tell him to reheat our dinners.   Wish a manger had come around."}
{"text":"This is good standard fare for a Brewhouse. There is a good beer list and a wide range of menu items. We have been here many times and always have a good meal. Great for families as well and there are lots of TV's around to catch any game going on. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and a large menu make this place stand out. The black and blue burger is awesome and they will even cook it medium rare for you. Also try the pazookie if you want desert. The meditteranian pizza is great too."}
{"text":"Been there about 4 times now. Service has been terrible each time. Food is average at best. Won't be going back unless I have too."}
{"text":"Very good service. ..food was outstanding. ..love it...A very memorable experience. ..and I'm in the restaurant industry. .exceptional service. ..very impressed...Veronica. ..was very professional at her execution and timing of our various dishes....I'm 1 happy customer:)"}
{"text":"This bj's has become a late night stop for us, and Rachel in the bar area always makes our experience here great. She remembers everything we drink and eat, and even the modifications. She's very attentive, always asks how we are doing,  and takes great care of us...it's nice to feel like you are welcome and wanted. So I only feel right giving her a 5star review.
 However be warned, on Sunday night there is a snarky older lady with short hair,  in the bar area that makes you feel unwanted and like you are wasting her time, she walks away while you are talking to her as if she cutting you off and interrupts you as if she needs you to hurry up, on everything. We have tried to give her the benefit of the doubt a couple times but now   we just avoid going on Sunday nights."}
{"text":"So no complaints here my mini pizza came out quickly, my beer is cold, and the bartender is pretty friendly.  I can't ask for much more.  I'm  glad I drove over here cause it's just like being at the one back home.  This is the fourth or fifth one I have gone to away from home and each time I'm glad I searched for one it is really nice that it's consistent.  Elizabeth has taken great care of me so far thanks for making me feel like I'm back home in California."}
{"text":"Well, I am pretty annoyed, and I will spell it out so you can decide. 
Location=Great! 
Service=Great
Tried the Tatonka Imperial Stout and was very impressed. My wife and I also ordered 2 Shots of FireBall!  
Ordered the Calamari and Ahi Tuna Poke appetizer. The Calamari was breaded perfectly, but was a bit chewy. The Ahi Tuna Poke was just ok. The Tuna's texture was a bit off. I also ordered a Black and Bleu Burger. Cooked a perfect Medium Rare and had some good flavor. Fries were nice and crispy. 
The Food Prices were on par. $10 Appetizers and a $9 burger. 
All in all, everything was very solid until...................
We got our check!!! $8.25 for 1 shot of FireBall!!! OMG!!!! Are you out of your mind??? By far the most expensive shot of Fireball I have ever had in my life! Seriously? FireBall is one of the least expensive non-well bottles at the bar. 
My friend owns a bar, and said he pays $6/750ml for FireBall and I pay $19/1.75L at Costco. I completely understand making a profit, but this was just insane! Typically priced around $5-6/shot depending on where you go. 
Not a place I will ever go again, and had I just stopped for a drink, I would've given them 1 Star, but the food was pretty good. 
I never ask how much liquor is before I order, lesson learned :("}
{"text":"Stopped per yelp recommendations. It was busy but the service was fast and friendly and I loved my food. We love this area of Phoenix and once again not disappointed by our choice."}
{"text":"Bjs is a nice restaurant to have a family dinner if you are not in a rush. Service to get seated just takes way to long and it doesn't have a lot of waiting area inside.  It's dark inside the restaurant so it's hard to see what your eating. The food is very good and never had a problem with our order! Had one bad waiter one time but besides him every other waiter/waitress was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I am not going back here for sure. Went with family on Friday night, there was 45 minutes wait. The food was okay, beers were terrible. A server spilled food all over my wife's purse and her work clothes. Nobody even asked us if we would like them to take care of dry cleaning the clothes. It was raining, so my wife brought her umbrella along and forgot it at the table. We called next day afternoon, and the manager said they don't have it and can't do anything about it. Looks like they don't care about stuff their customers left behind by mistake. Or they hire people that like to steal things their customers left behind by mistake."}
{"text":"They opened on Monday and so far everything was great! The service was good and so was the food! I had the kale and brussel sprouts salad with chicken and my boy friend had the California chicken. Definitely will be back back!"}
{"text":"The brew is ok I have had better, and the pizza is ok, nothing crazy good and the atmosphere is alright, I'd rather go somewhere else any day."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've discovered such a great restaurant that I find myself craving their food. A friend and I decided to come here on a whim because it was built at this location somewhat recently and we wanted to try something new. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. Service was fast and our waiter was helpful and knowledgeable about any questions we had. I thought they had a pretty interesting and large menu, plenty of great sounding dishes to choose from. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as our appetizer and we absolutely loved them. They were so perfect we get them every time we go! Our entrees came out quickly and we're just as delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. It easily became one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Horrible in comparison to other BJ's locations I've been to. I asked our waitress, Candice, for silverware and napkins at the same time my (first) date and I ordered drinks. Drinks came, no silverware. We then ordered an appetizer, no silverware after asking again. Then we ordered our entrees, they came and we still had no silverware or napkins. I don't know why I left our waitress a tip, she didn't do a damn thing. We had three different people bring out our food, none of which were Candice. There was a blonde spiky-haired guy, that brought out our appetizer, he spoke in the most ridiculous fake New York accent; awkward at least because he was loud as fuck. Horrible start to what I was hoping was going to be a good night with a fine young hunnie. Seriously upset I paid $58 for this crap, should've just taken her to Cane's and gotten better service from a high school kid. Bullshit. Their fries are garbage and from a bag too."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at BJ's.  The place is spectacular to look at but the food was just ok for the prices.  It did take a while to get our food and the food was not hot when it came out.  I don't think we will go back.  I noticed a table next to us waited a really long time for their dessert.  Our waiter seemed stressed."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I don't understand why this is only rated 3 stars. I've been here 3 times, and every time was enjoyable. The menu is huge so selecting your meal can get a little difficult. I've always had a great waitress, but the one I had the most recent time was the best. Her name was Alexis, and she anticipated everything we wanted. She always had drinks coming, was able to easily split the check, and was super friendly. I was in a group of 5, but she managed to stay on top of everything. We really enjoyed ourselves and are excited to go back again."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for lunch and wow did we get a greet.. Oh wait there was no greet lol waitress seriously walked up w a look of disgust on her face and said drinks?? Omg what where am I?? How abt how are u guys?? At least hi!!! Damn I was w my fiancé and our friend we all looked at each other like wtf but obviously ordered some drinks idk who trained This girl but usually when ppl order soda water u bring lime and when someone gets iced tea u ask if they use sweetener but whatever who am I?? Drops them off and seriously took off for five min then when she came back I asked for lime another five min I swear till I knew things were gonna be like this the whole time to where I got up asked for lime sugar and another server bc what I hate the most is when miserable servers ruin outings. She was pregnant idk what her deal was but u can still crack a smile but she was so not pleasant and awful omg like y r u in this industry if ur not pleasant go sit behind a desk if u hate ppl.. Sooo then we got alica and she was soooo sweet and perfect omg nit and day not just a great server w our order but so nice cracking jokes w us and really fixed everything pretty much so thank u alica I latterly thanked her for being pleasant from the nightmare we had b4 her so for the first part of service definitely put sour taste in my mouth and will not go back bc obviously the foods fine nothing to brag abt they re a lot of way better options to go spend ur money but at least the day ended good bc of alica."}
{"text":"Try them for the first time and it was pretty good, my kids love the chicken tender. Service was fast and friendly. Everything on menu are bar food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, a fellow yelper recommended it.  We went during lunch time and I must say it was delicious.  I just followed my friends lead and we went with the huge sampler platter which was all full of goodies.  I don't remember the names of everything but the guacamole filled mini burrito things were so freakin good.  I then had the mini pulled pork sliders and loved em in fact my mouth is watering as I think about them right now.  Anyway great place for a lunch meeting."}
{"text":"I have eaten there a few times, i have had the rib eye with baked potato, that tater was huge, rib eye had good flavor and it was medium rare as I ordered. I have also had the bbq chicken salad and sante fe salad as well as the wings, all delicious and not only that but the p lace can be packed and you still get your food fast and hot. Worth trying for sure"}
{"text":"BJ's has been my favorite kick back restaurant for years! Today's experience reminded me why I love them. The food was great and service was amazing!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service by Aubrey and staff.  Great food.  HIGHLY recommended. Thank you Aubrey for the friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"BJ's...what has happened to you?
I always thought you were above average, but today was a terrible experience.  We arrived after the regular lunch crowd and had to take a buzze and waitr.  At least half of the tables were empty, so we assumed maybe some of the staff had called in sick.
We waited almost 20 minutes and were finallly buzzed.  Our waiter was way out in lala land.  He took our drink orders and brought have of them and then told the rest of us, \"I had forgot what your ordered.\"  We both ordered...ice tea!  He was very unattentive.  We had to get up and find our own napkins and flatware.  After a hamburger was brought, we had to find our own ketchup and mustard.  We were brought wrong orders and were never offered refills on our drinks.
We were very disappointed in our service and the food was just OK."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because our waiter was rude and arrogant. The food and drinks was 5 stars . Keith is rude and makes u feel uncomfortable. I asked for prices on some beer and he said oh I don't know I just press buttons its different through out the region. I wanted to get up and punch him in the face . At the end he was trying to be nice even though he was pretty rude almost the entire Time ."}
{"text":"I went to a Bj's out in California on vacation one time and was very please to hear that we were getting one here in McCandless Crossing. That happiness was short lived. On a regular day,mind you, it took our waitress more than ten minutes to come and get us our drinks. The service in there is some of the worst for a restaurant chain. The food is alright but doesn't make up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Very good casual restaurant with a huge menu. Salads were large with fresh ingredients and good dark rolls. The stuffed potatoes are a fine and filling meal as a non meat option. Sandwichesvare generously dressed with meat, and our grilled fish was decent. Pleasant service and inviting drink menu. French fries were cold but quickly replaced."}
{"text":"Amazing deep dish pizza's, wonderful service. House draft is really good. I love the pizookee, wow just an all around fantastic place to eat!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice looking but the food experience is far from it.  The entree's we had were room temperature and the service was less than can be expected.  For what was paid we should have received much better food and service.  I have been to  many of their establishments in AZ and CA where we received much better food and service.  Cheesecake Factory is 10 minutes away and a much better option, one we should have used."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been back to this place about 5 times.  We used to be regulars at the location in our home town in Florida.  We were excited when they opened.  EVERY single time the service is absolutely the worst.  From the hostess to the wait staff.  Whenever we approach the hostess station we are met with a blank stare - no greeting, they don't ask how many we have, there is just an awkward silence before I feel uncomfortable and end up greeting the hostess instead...  Our first visit we were told by the hostess there was a 15 minute wait, so we sat down and waited around 20 minutes, making eye contact with the hostess, a young couple walked in and were seated immediately.  Then another, who were also seated immediately.  We stood up and asked why we hadn't been seated and the hostess simply replied \"Oh I forgot you were waiting.\"  No apology, nothing.  The wait staff is awful - no refills, no check in, different people delivering your food, no condiments, no silverware, getting a different drink when I do get a refill. On one occasion our waitress told us the cook \"forgot\" to cook our meal, so we waited almost an hour. When the manager came to our table he said \"I'm sorry I think our cook may be dyslexic.\" Eh - super offensive joke dude.  It has just always been an unpleasant experience.  We like the food and my partner loves the beer selection but it's not worth the hassle to come.  Sometimes we grab takeout but avoid the dine in experience and go to Burgatory.  Only plus is their deep dish pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"Horrible service every time. One time they brought cold food out. I just tried ordering take
Out and they hung up on me twice and then placed me on an indefinite hold. I hope the location gets it together. The one in Summerlin is always good."}
{"text":"Got a flatbread pizza which was good and a pulled pork sandwich which was just okay. Prices are a little high for the quality and quantity that you get. Dessert pizookies are delicious, but can't beat a Conley Cookie from Monte Cello's! I will probably come back not for the food, but to try their house craft beers. It seemed like they had a pretty wide selection."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fettuccine it wasn't worth the money. Along with there being a small spider on our table , place wasn't as good as people made it seem."}
{"text":"This is one of those cookie cutter type of place where you see your typical beer drinking crowd, your typical menu with not much surprise, and typical chained restaurant quality,  with your typical server trying rush you out of the door.   Nothing really out of the world but consistency is their best quality."}
{"text":"I went to Bj's when I lived in SF. I was excited to learn we had one in the north valley!

Nothing short of spectacular. Never had a problem here, food is always excellent, and if the food is ever late or ordered wrong, we're always compensated with something small like a free beer, desert, or that specific entree/app for free! Waitresses, waiters, and bussers are on there stuff. I recommend this place to friends who want something a little more upscale than Outback, or someone who wants something a little different than your old fashion pizza. You've got to try their cheeseburger pizza, it's astounding."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a medium rating because the service can be very \"spotty.\" In a way it's a victim of success because staff frequently gets slammed. The food is good. It's not a very good sports bar because the TV selection is rigid and you can find yourself watching golf and NASCAR while college basketball teams are fighting to get off the \"bubble.\" You can guess what I'm watching now!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location but second time at a BJ's Brewhouse. We went for an early supper, around 4pm so it wasn't busy. Our server was very polite and professional. Our food was great and the beer is superb. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and my garlic knot didn't come with it. Server said they were waiting on them. No big deal. A few minutes later, the manager comes over and apologized for the wait. Then instead of the one that comes with the meal, they give me three. Our second trip to a Brewhouse, our second great experience!!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! I would be lying if I said BJs didn't provide excellent service an were excellent food every time I visited. The staff is friendly and I've never had a waiter or waitress that was impolite, or didn't visit my table often. I constantly had my drinks re-filled. The root beer that they create themselves is fantastic!  The deep dish pizza is easily in my top 3 pizzas in mesa. The price is reasonable, especially considering what you're getting for the money nepeta every cent and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to bring your friends or family!"}
{"text":"BJs - 
I love the pizza and in house brew beer. There are two reasons I have give 3 star for this place.

1. Too much waiting time. I had to wait for hour and a half to get table?! Was the food worth the wait? Answer is NO? I can get same kinda stuff at many other restaurants 

2. Too Loud!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much.

First we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience. 

We were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope. 

First the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down.

To make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me.  

I spent almost $200 and left disappointed, that should never happen."}
{"text":"Met friends here last evening for dinner.  We had reservations and our table was ready.  That was the best part.
The service was not good:
- 4 of us were served food that was barely warm.  Since 2 meals were hot, it seems 4 meals sat under the warmer lights waiting for the 2 additional meals.  The flavor was decent, but barely warm food is not appealing to me.
- 1 did not like her meal, but maybe she just ordered the wrong thing, which all of us do at times.
- While we were eating, the restaurant filled up with a fairly long waiting line
- We finished our meals and waited for our server
- We waited for our server longer
- We finally flagged down another server and asked for our server
- Finally our server came and we asked for our checks and a box
- Still waiting for our server
- All this time there were people waiting to be seated
- After about 15 minutes we paid and left
- I mentioned to the hostess that the service was lacking.  I didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling that things will improve."}
{"text":"Very good pizza in a cool setting. The challenge is that this place can be extremely crowded even during off hours. And, it can be a little pricey for what you get. But there's no denying that their pizza is excellent."}
{"text":"Bartender provided great service considering how busy the place was with an hour wait. We ended up ordering food at the bar 45 minutes after getting a few drinks. Beers were really good! My glass of cab was a little pricey, that price for my wine I'd expect to pay in a steakhouse - not a brewhouse. Pizza was really good! Overall great service and food."}
{"text":"Get the potato skins, or the giant baked potatoes cause they are bomb. Also they really good pizza, and this thing called pazookie for desert. Staff is always friendly. 
I got the jambalaya and it was very tasty and spicy too."}
{"text":"I have always loved their unlimited soup and salad lunch and the price is fabulous! Recently we have been coming for dinner and the food is consistently good as well as the service. Tonight our server entered our order incorrectly and they could not have been more cordial about correcting the error. The manager came to our table twice and gave us a discount in addition to free dessert. Above and beyond our expectations!  We left our server a tip based on the full price of our dinner. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Waitress had no idea what she was doing, food was only OK and they forgot my wife entire entre. Drinks and food is way overpriced.  All in all a bad experience. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I wait....we arrived at 10:30pm, got seated by the manager who came from the bar area because hostess was busy talking story.  After 20 minutes at our little booth for 6 people, we were about to leave but a server finally comes to take our drink order. When we mentioned to server that we were about to leave, she apologized and gave an excuse of a server got \"cut\", so she will be starting our drink order. Decided to stay. Another server came 10 minutes after our drinks arrived to take our food order. Finally at 11:30pm, we are eating...yay! Food is good. Our table had a couple burgers, rib eye steak, chicken alfredo, and a salmon salad. Looking around our table, there are no complaints about the food. Server had no name tag, so I had to ask for his name. His name is Eric. There is only around table and another table of people right now, so I don't understand why service is so BAD! So long story, short...food is good but service is HORRIBLE! PEOPLE BEWARE!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this particular restaurant 3 times this year.  Food is great,  Stevie is friendly and knowledgeable and process reasonable (don't tell them,  they msy raise them! ). Love that jambalaya!"}
{"text":"Love this new location, mostly because it is close to the house. Usually come here for a few drinks and dinner with friends. It is usually busy around the normal dinner time 6-8pm. I love the lunch specials. Smaller portions but filling. I normally order a buffalo chicken pizza, grilled chicken pasta, or the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Not all at once those are just a couple of favs. Great service. Bartenders are awesome. Oh yea can't forget the pizookie."}
{"text":"The food is pretty consistent and good.  We are usually looking for a change of pace from I Hop or Village Inn type fare  when we go to BJs.   Usually have to wait to be seated so we try to avoid the usual peak hours.  Service can be inconsistent.  Sometimes have to flag down other staff to get served.  Luckily they've been responsive.  We've learned to be aggressive about getting drink refills.  The burgers are good. The Tomato soup is great and the Angel Hair pasta is good too.  Avoid the flatbread sandwiches- uninspired.  Ambiance is okay but acoustics aren't great- loud.   Parking is lacking especially on weekends.  We will be back in spite of spotty service.   Good alternative to the AppleBees routine when you are looking for a restaurant that serves alcohol."}
{"text":"Average tasting food (including room temperature fries) and inattentive service (getting orders wrong) means there's no reason to go back.  There are plenty of other mediocre places to go for food that appeals to the least common denominator, and it's probably better to go to one that turn lunch around in less than an hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. First, took a while to get seated even though there were barely any people. Second, the waitress wasn't very nice and helpful. Third, the water tasted awful- like it wasn't filtered. Fourth, the food quality was very poor and not warm at all & no eating utensils were given. And lastly, the service was very slow. I waited for a salad for 30 minutes! Overall, it was the worst service & food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain restaurant. I know it's in a mall. I know i shouldn't expect more but, I do. I have gone to BJ's many times in California and had consistently good results. Last friday I took a friend and my nephew to eat here and were very disappointed. The service was bad, the food mediocre at best and the prices were no value. I can understand if it was busy and the wait staff was swamped. But when people are standing around and you still have to flag them down for everything from water to the check, inexcusable. Also I am not opposed to paying for food that worth it but, this BJ's I could not justify anything."}
{"text":"Went for a night out with my girls last night and man was it busy! We called ahead to put our name on the list but still waited 30 min! (I suggest you call ahead unless you want to wait an hour on a Friday night). when we sat down we had a great server named Jace, and the clam chowder bread bowl I had was awesome! We will be coming back for more girls nights"}
{"text":"Did not know I like Brussels sprouts . Yes if you haven't heard BJs by the Big Dicks has some great cocktails."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Cynthia, and this hopefully isn't her fault, but my wife received her order unfinished, a pet peeve of mine. Salad was supposed to come with onion strings on top, which is what my wife was looking forward to. Cynthia brought her salad without the onion strings saying that they will be out shortly. About 5 minutes later, which is actually quite a bit for this item, a bus boy brought out the strings, not very hot. Then about 5 minutes after that, Cynthia brought out strings, which actually were hot. No excuse, no reason provided. It's obvious that someone should've picked up that the plate wasn't complete yet and not sent it out with the rest of the order. Then when we got two orders of strings, that showed there was no communication in the back."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible. Went with large group of 12 to celebrate a  birthday. Plan was to eat have a few drinks then take in a movie. Ending up tsking 2 hours and thats not counting the time to eat"}
{"text":"BJ'S Brewary is our go to place when we travel to az once or twice a year and usually end up there at least twice during our trip. We have had burgers, apps, chicken pitas and many other items.  All are delish!! We do enjoy the craft beers and sometimes have \"an extra because we are always within walking distance of our motel!! Being very responsible!!!!! On our last evening there the manager stopped by to visit and thanked us for coming to BJ'S! He was kind enough to give us a two for one beer on our bill! Very nice! We only wish this restaurant would make its way to North Dakota! Do not hesitate to give it a try....although there is usually a wait on just about every given night you can always hit the bar for a bump! A busy restaurant on a regular basis is a very good thing! Give it a try....you will be happy you did! Thumbs up all the way around!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat here but the manager on duty Monday August 29th around 5:30pm was very rude, very unapproachable, and disregarded me as a person. Not how I wanted to start my evening so I simply am going somewhere else as I advice others to do. If I wanted rude service today I would've gone to Dicks on the strip."}
{"text":"Good chain. Pretty fast. The deep dish pizzas aren't really deep dish like Chicago (saucy and soupy) more like a pan crust pizza from pizza hut but still pretty good to eat and definitely better than the average Chicago want to be. Haven't had the beer here but they have a great happy hour around 5. 

Biggest recommendation would be to order the world famous pizzuki, a giant cookie in a skillet covered in ice cream. Wow."}
{"text":"Fucking delicious. I went for lunch and had the soup and salad, some amazing choices.  Great beer selection but priced so you only want to have a couple."}
{"text":"Food is good. Expect long waits if you go at prime time which certainly should be no surprise.  Wait staff and hosting station is hit or miss. We've had outstanding service and horrible service. 

My biggest issue is with the deception of their menu and lack of ethics on the part of their management.  Their website (not the national one either, specifically the one you get after choosing McCandless) says that Tuesday's they have half off Glasses and Bottles of wine.  They told my wife that it does not apply to PA because of the liquor laws they can only discount so much.  Fair answer....except there are multiple other restaurant chains in the market that do offer half off bottles...in particular one that does so on Wednesdays and another on Sundays (I'll leave them nameless).  

Needless to say if the Manager is that much of a jack...it speaks volumes as to why the service and attitudes in general are spotty.  Go elsewhere. There are a TON of great options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"BJ's is a good local bar and with higher quality food than typical bars. Lots of good selections but mainly they have some great microbrews to try out. Not designed to be a 5 star restaurant and that's okay because if you're looking for some great beer, an atmosphere to have fun, and some great French fries try it out!"}
{"text":"We were there yesterday with a large party of 13 ppl. A lady Toni was our server. I could not believe how professional she was and outstanding service. We were such a headache with our party with like 5 separate checks and people trying to use coupons, but she seems to be on top of everything and extremely nice! Most servers would have lost it. It was my sons birthday and he had a great time. Only reason I'm not giving 5 is because we did have to wait 45 mins to be seated."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good, but at the end of the meal, our server lost my credit card and never found it. I just called back & spoke with a manager who explained they still haven't found it. So I just cancelled it and now get to begin the process of waiting for a replacement to reconfigure all of my auto-pay accounts that are linked to that card. I guess I would've thought they would have offered a comped meal or something, anything - heck, even a free appetizer on my next visit. I'm sure if I would've complained my food was overcooked, they would've done something. But all I got was, very simply, \"we're sorry\". Well, apology accepted, but I'm disappointed. Accidents & problems happen in business all the time, but how a business reacts and deals with those says a lot about their commitment to Service Excellence. I'm not really interested in a free meal, just a bit more genuine concern & attention to this matter than what was given. Show me this problem matters."}
{"text":"My husband and I were fans of BJ's....until last night. After reading some current reviews, it seems our experience is only following the trend. Everything started fine, server was decent, with preferred check in we only waited about 15 minutes on a busy Saturday night once we arrived. My husband and father in law both ordered the new stuffed burgers the barbecue brisket ones. When food arrived, both burgers had no barbecue sauce....uhmmm?! Fine we thought we can just ask the waitress for a few cups to dump on them...except we didn't see her again for 15-20 minutes after the food came. Whatever. We finished up and left. Hours later, my husband became incredibly sick, didn't sleep at all and spent all the next day hanging out in the bathroom, all he ate the previous day was some fruit and vegetables and that burger. Needless to say, I doubt we will be back for awhile, if ever."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare burger. Came out well done, sent it back and was told the \"chef\" would be recooking it himself. It then came out around medium well and not a drop of seasoning. My server, Aaron, was terrible. Ran out of soda twice, he never checked to see how things were, we got more service from the hostess. After he finally dropped our bill off it took 10 minutes for him to pick them back up. 
I used to love this place, looks like they must  have a new FOH manager and or new chef.  Stay away from this place until they fix the issues.  
TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"Super service.  Got the unlimited soups and salads so I could try different things.  A friend got the egg rolls and enjoyed them. The overall favorite were the pazookies.  So yummy. I was glad we tried them."}
{"text":"This is a good spot if you are in to having a lot of options when you order.  I am a fan of the pizza and burgers.  Those that know me, know that isn't much of a stretch.  I am not generally an adventurous eater, but if you are, this is well worth it.  There are enough pizza options to make you think you're eating at a pizza joint, and enough burger options to make you feel like they hate chick fil a.  Either way, its a good call.  If you enjoy an adult beverage, their beer selection is large, and if you cannot decide they will offer shot glass samplers to whet your palate.  The service was efficient and friendly.  On a side note they also make their own root beer which you can view in a large vat in the back of the restaurant.  Just a little fun fact.  Give this place a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great family spot.  Love that they bring kids starters to tide them over while we wait for our order. Had Santa Fe salad and chicken pesto flat bread. Both were great. Service was great and quick."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and this had to be one of the worst eating out experiences I have had in a long time. 
To start, it took 8 mins before anyone acknowledged me sitting there. It wasn't until my friend showed up until we were greeted and asked for drinks. We knew what we wanted so we ordered our food at that time too. The meal did come out timely even with the lunch rush. (Earned one star). However, we noticed instantly that there was a long black hair in the coleslaw. No one came back to refill our drinks or ask how the meal was. We were forced to eat the remaining part of our meals while the black hair in the food started at us. The salad plate and side dish were stacked on top of each other at the end of our small 2 person booth. No one stopped to pick it up. We waited and waited for the server to come by so we could get out check. I eventually had to flag down another server to help find ours. At that time we made him aware of the black hair, requested that side item to be removed off the bill. He finally removed those dishes from the table but left our other food plates in front of us. 
The manager came by (2nd star earned) apologized and removed an entire meal off the bill. He was the one that removed the last of the remaining food plates. 
It took us 1 and a half hours to eat lunch and check out at this place. With the hair, crummy service and mediocre food, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a night out with an old friend! Had some beer and potato skins and they were fantastic. I love the atmosphere, its warm-themed and and dimmed. Service was great :)"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from this BJ's often, mainly because it's one of the few places around us that delivers. The food isn't terrible, but the service usually is. Just about EVERY time we order, one or more of the following is inevitable; there is food missing, we are over charged, the person taking the order doesn't have a clue what they have on their menu, it takes an unreasonable time to get delivered (usually because the driver gets lost) and the \"delivery charge\" amount is excessive. The past few times have just been ridiculous. In fact, the last time we ordered, we had every one of the aforementioned go wrong. We were charged separately for every single thing that should've been included in our meals, (fries, salads, soups, etc.), the delivery gal headed the opposite direction of our location and took over an hour and a half to get here. The food was nasty, cold, rubbery and some things were missing. I don't know how the dine-in service and food is around lunchtime, but I can assure you that they need to do some serious adjustments to their take out/delivery! Just because we are eating take out, doesn't make our order, service or food less important. GET IT TOGETHER, FOLKS!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, each time was very satisfying. They have a good list of brews that are made in house, and are very tasty. The food is nicely presented and tastes great. Nice portion sizes as well. This is a good place to bring a business client/friend. Not expensive but a step up from Applebee's etc."}
{"text":"Even with all the other places to chose from, when I want a good draft beer and good food, I go to BJ's.  Tonight I had the belgian Grand Cru draft and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  Their beer prices are some of the best in town, especially if you make it during lunch or happy hour.  The Parmesan crusted chicken came ($13.95)with excitement and accolades from the bartender, so I decided to give it a try.  It was wonderful and comparable quality to many high-end restaurants.  This meal was seriously amazing and I would order it again tomorrow.  The bartenders are great, the beer is great, and the food is great!  We always have friendly service and get our money's worth every time we visit."}
{"text":"Service is always great, and the waiters are plesant and nice to have serve you.  This is one of my favorite breweries to come too.  They have a good selection of beer that is made in house, and you can also get a growler of any type to take home (or home made root beer, which is also amazing)  I have never had anything less than a great meal in the around 60 times I have ate here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We ordered the deep dish pizza, it's not your traditional deep dish it's more like a pan pizza but a solid pizza! We got the buffalo chicken and the flavors are great! Then of course you have to end the night with a pazookie!"}
{"text":"I will say there food is decent, it is what you would expect for a national chain. There beer is very good, both in quality and variety. However, we have been here 3 times since they have opened, and the service is horribly slow, each time. They also are not a participating location for a number of the offers that they app offers. 

This place has potential, I know it is a relatively new location, but the staff needs some serious additional training or enforcement by the manager. 

I'm not writing this location off, but I hope they get the service figured out. 

Also beware, the floors are crazy slippery, and that is when they are dry,"}
{"text":"Bj\"s  is one of those restaurants I have a love hate relationship with.  Some of the items, I just love some are not so great in my opinion.  First things first parking can be a hassle at times, and your bound to wait re guard less of what night of the week you attend.  I like the atmosphere and decor very much.  The wait staff is pleasant enough, yet often make mistakes with our orders.  In all fairness we usually have rather large family dinners there.

Now, the food.  They have great soups the tortilla soup is my daughters favorite with fresh avocados a top.  My son and I love the Tomato Soup, truly creamy and delicious with large homemade croutons.  I usually start to get full with just my soup.  On most evenings we go my daughter orders their Chicken Alfredo, she normally loves it.....occasionally can be dry.  I ordered a little more sauce was charges an additional 3.50 ouch!  My son usually goes for their Jumbalaya which is very delicious and huge portion, or their ribs both are very tasty.  I waiver between their New york strip, which by the way is great! or at times go for their other pasta dishes on the menu.  I personally am not impressed with their pasta  dishes, find them a bit tasteless.  Also their pork medallions with white cheddar mashed potatoes are great.....

I can't ever leave this restaurant with out eating desert.  My kids and I are crazy about their warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream a top called Pazooky, I'm sure I've
misspelled that....l.o.l. yet  a sinful and  necessary experience!  Dinner there usually can be a bit pricey with appetizers and desert usually about $90 to $!00  for the three of us.  Bj's is always a family favorite, with variety for all offering a huge menu and great to go service too.

Bottom line is, if I ask my kids to pick a restaurant to go to, always seems to be Bj's a leading contender!

{"text":"While I was in the ER my husband offered to go get me food. He went to pick it up around 1045pm. I didn't get home till past midnight. When I got home and opened my Thai chicken mango salad (which was in two small containers, because they ran out of a big on) I was disappointed to find that not only did my salad not have any mango there was no chicken. I will be in in the morning to get my money back. What a waste. Thanks for nothing.

Don't order take out late, they obviously don't care if they charge you full price and don't give you food. I got lettuce and dressing. Didn't eat it. So pissed and hungry!"}
{"text":"So I went here again with my kids this time on father's day very busy which was fine ....the bad is my order got lost some how so one hour later I  had to find the host  the manager came over and offer the whole meal free"}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a BJs, and was especially excited for their Deep Dish, since Pittsburgh is known for their local Pizza, but has very few Deep Dish options. Online takeout was fast and easy. That was about the end of the positives. After reading reviews, I ordered a medium Deep Dish with Extra sauce because I read it can be dry. They either forgot the extra sauce or the original has none. It was no more than a dab of tomato sauce on each slice. It also had very little cheese. What was left tasted like a dry, flavorless Pizza Hut Pan. I've been to Chicago/NYC several times, and this is no way a traditional Deep Dish by any means. It shouldn't even be labeled as such. Burgh's Pizza makes a Deep Dish that is far superior and is a short drive away. Disappointed. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Get RYAN as your waiter. Friendly knowledgable waiter. When u get a waiter like him it nakes my dining experience much more enjoyable.
Food was enjoyable. Everyone is happy."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! They're food is delicious and their customer service just  rox! Hit the bar cause Julia and Heather are the best bartenders you'll ever meet!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious, and they have a pretty decent happy hour special too - with food and drinks.  We have tried a lot of what's on their menu, and the only thing that I think didn't have much to offer was the tilapia dinner.

The Buffalo Chicken pizza there is one of the best I've ever had, highly recommend ordering it."}
{"text":"I don't drink booze much these days so I can't speak for their beer etc. However their salads are great. The burgers are really good, the fish and chips are darn good for the valley, and so are their soups. The only thing I have had that I was disappointed in was the stuffed mushrooms. I would give five stars except the staff though friendly don't seem very organized, and often take rather long to check back (or at least that has been so with me)."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited for over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. Definitely going down hill."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but everything has taken a turn for the worse, from the food to the service, even management is lacking. Hopefully they fix things and start taking pride in their product and service again."}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten-free pizza with several vegetable toppings for pick up. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and saw that the pizza hardly had any cheese at all, like Almost none, and very scant toppings. Despite paying $17 for this 10 inch gluten-free pizza, it was no better or even worse than a frozen pizza you buy at the grocery store. Meanwhile, My husband picked up a pizza at Costco. His pizza was three times the size for $10 and very copious amounts of toppings on it. I was not impressed and will not be ordering pizza from BJ's in the future ever."}
{"text":"My wife and I were searching for somewhere to have lunch on this side of the valley. We decided on BJs considering we had been there before and enjoyed our time.

We were greeted by the rudest hostess I've ever come across. At first we were ignored. When she finally greeted us her back turned to us and she was talking over her shoulder at us. She then sat us.
Our server was great!! She was very informative and gave us the perfect amount of time to look over the menu.
The food was good too. We had the mini bruchetta for an app. My wife order the mahi mahi tacos and I ordered chicken tenders. The price was just right for the amount. 
The reason this place did not get 5 stars was their rude hostess. Thankfully the service and good came through."}
{"text":"At bj's really good service our server was really will definitely recommended my wife a drink that she just got and we'll see how the drinks are and so far so good"}
{"text":"Service is always perfection...my favorite thing is how big the menu is, you can bring the whole fam in and everyone will find something they love. The consistency of the food is always great, I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Excellent environment,  and excellent service. Food is great and they have a good value for money."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and I made reservations on Saturday 1-16 on their mobile app because we know they are very busy on Saturdays.  the app told us 35 minute wait which was perfect because that's about how long of a drive we had.  when we arrived we gave out name and they asked to see the reservation on my girlfriends phone.  the host told us that we made it for their other Pittsburgh location and that we had to wait many hours to get put in as a walk in.  we left at that point t.  
     after thinking on the way home I couldn't imagine where their other location was at so I checked online and couldn't find one.  I called the restaurant and a woman rudely answered and said their app is all messed up and it never works right. my thought is  so why have it?   anyway she told me there is not another one in Pittsburgh.  so an hour and a half of driving for nothing.  personally I don't think it's worth the wait and hassle."}
{"text":"I've been there with my wife 3 times in the past 5 months. Every time we go, the food is amazing, however the service has been unsatisfactory all 3 times as well. They really need to improve their service. We went there tonight at 8pm and the service was acting as though it was 3am...like he was tired and just didn't care."}
{"text":"My sister and her husband asked us to meet them at BJ's. We had never been there,so, we didn't know what to expect.What a pleasant surprise!Our server was wonderful.She was very attentive without being intrusive.The food was fantastic and the portions were huge.We all had a cocktail and they were mixed to perfection.We had such a great time and We look forward to visiting BJ's again soon."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to this restaurant and love it! Their beer samplers are great and appetizers delicious. They do get pretty busy, but that has to say something about their business, right? The staff is friendly and willing to share their experience with the items on the menu. I like the option they have up at the bar area, like a \"seat yourself\" type area."}
{"text":"The family and I love this place, as does anyone I've taken there. 

First time I went I had a cheeseburger pizza - huge and delicious. 

Their beer is great too - brewed right on the spot. 

The fish tacos are fantastic-- it says a lot about a place that every time you go, everything you try, is just great. 

You'll pay a little bit, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great food. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice rewards program."}
{"text":"I have had great food every time I that I have came. The prices are very reasonable.I love that they have a great selection of beer and WINE.  My favorite dish is the parmesan crusted chicken! It is delicious. But I have had differnt apps and even the burgers are good. The only reason for fours stars, the service can be so hit or miss."}
{"text":"Ended up at BJ's based on a recommendation that their pizzas are really great. Not sure I agree... :)"}
{"text":"This place had a beautiful décor, service was really good and the food was ok. Menu was like a novel. About 18 pages long. Lol. I had soup and salad. Can hardly go wrong with that, but turns out my Cheese Broccoli soup was basically Cheese Cheese soup...entirely so cheesy I had to switch it out. The tomato bisque was hardly better. I suggest they bring back chicken noodle soup that the server said they had once before and took off the menu. Friend had blue cheese turkey sandwich and french fries he said it was good; could taste every flavor and it was a nice portion size he could only eat half. Total of about 25.00. Not bad for a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"ok food in a applebees sports bar type of environment.  Good beers and ok food - although the pizookie was great - just needs more ice cream)

Good selection of kids food as well."}
{"text":"Ok so I went 3 times in one week, thats how much I lOVE this place!! This time it was with a group of 6... unfortunatley they sat us in a booth barely big enough for all of us (probably didn't help having 3 buff men either ;P) but so this time we all kinda tried everyone elses meal and it all tasted amazing! as well as the Jerimah red beer! lol 

Dessert: Well i would say if you get a Pazooki and have less the 8 ppl don't get the party platter! HUGE is all i can say! The party Pazooki is a HUGE cookie i mean like 12\" to 14\" in a variety of flavors... We had gotten a triple chocolate (death by chocolate) had about 6 to 8 scoops of giridelhi choc. chip ice cream on a choc. choc. chip cookie... yea so now you see... Death by chocolate! lol We all had a little slice of the cooke and a scoop of the AMAZING ice cream! it was DEEEEEEELLLLICIOUS!!! :D"}
{"text":"We always have a great experience when we come to BJ'S but I'd like to applaud our server tonight, Mike C. He took phenomenal care of us, he was attentive and genuine. Highly recommended him, and BJ'S in general. Thanks for the awesome date night, and for telling us about the rewards card."}
{"text":"BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have received in a long time.  The menu is to die for, everything on it is exceptional, they will be seeing a lot more of me and my family.  They went above and beyond with their service. They forgot we were outside on the patio and extended every possible  courtesy to make our visit worth while.  Paula was our server and she was PHENOMENAL if anyone goes there please make sure you ask for her section you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Arrived about 9:00pm on 12/8.  The service was good and the ribs were amazing.  The atmosphere is nice.  I would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler this past week visiting family and it was my first time at Bj's. My brother told me he had been once before and the food was great but service was lacking. Our Server was Ian, he was very informative about the menu and catered to all of my allergy needs. He guided me to the gluten free pizza which was a delicious choice along with a bowl of the broccoli cheddar soup, such a yummy suggestion! My brother didn't want pizza so Ian suggested the roast beef dip and he loved it too! As busy as it was Ian kept our cups filled and was present just the right amount. Thank you for a wonderful experience and for being kind on the eyes! Ask for Ian for your next visit!"}
{"text":"My  husband and I have been a customer for many years. My recent experience was above and beyond. We typically always receive excellent service from Tracy at the bar,but I had to reach out to express my gratitude to the Manager David Renish!

Under the direction of David Renish the Senior Manager, one of his team members brought to his attention that we dropped some cash on the floor and were unaware of it until the next day.

David Renish called me and texted us that night to let us know that he found it and was going to hold it for us until we were able to visit again.  

The genuineness of the team to let the manager know that we dropped cash and did not keep it, is just another reason why we will be loyal customers of BJ's.

I just wanted to let  Chandler BJ's members of the team that they are amazing!!!

Oh and the food and beer are AMAZING TOO!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this Bj's location twice in the last two weeks.  But each time I have visited there was no host at the door to greet me and or my campanion.  The employees seem to busy to say hello or even acknowledge it's customers.  It takes far to long to be greeted and or seated.  During my last visit I ordered a drink, deep dish pizza and asked for water.  However, in my hour and half visit the water never arrived and I was not offered a refill even though it was included.  The taste of the pizza was fair but seem to lack sauce.  So, I asked my hard to track down waiter about the sauce and he offered to bring a side of it to the table.  That was a nice gester, but it would have been nicer to dip my warm pizza into warm sauce instead of sauce that was very cold seeming to have come straight from the refrigerator.  I would not recommend this Bj's is you are looking for attentive service and hospitality.  They continue to fail in both of those areas.

Sincerely,"}
{"text":"We've dined at BJ's many times and had both decent and not-so-decent experiences. I doubt we'll be back after this last time. There were four of us and we had appetizers, cocktails, dinners, and dessert. One of the entrees came with soup or salad and tortilla soup was ordered. When it arrived it was barely luke warm. By the time our server, Lacee, came around we told her that the soup was cold and asked if it could be reheated. She took it away without a word but before she returned all of our entrees arrived. When she got back with the soup she started to pour the broth over the dry ingredients without even asking if we still wanted it since we were already eating our dinners. When we said that we no longer wanted it because our dinners were already there, she rolled her eyes, made a face, and left the table while we were still talking to her. The rest of the meal was uneventful, the food was adequate although certainly not exceptional. The server tried to be more friendly towards the end of the meal but never once apologized for the cold soup. On our way out we stopped to tell the manager (according to the receipt the manager was April) what had happened and she could not have been more unconcerned. She smiled and listened but made no apologies nor did she even mention anything about talking to the server about the rolling of the eyes and the face she made. She obviously didn't care that her customers were less than satisfied. This is not the first time that we've had what I would consider poor service for the caliber of restaurant. Between mediocre food and mediocre service we won't be returning which is sad because it's a beautiful restaurant with an extensive menu."}
{"text":"I had an awesome rootbeer...no really.  The turkey cobb sandwhich was annihilated and the string fries were polished off.  The place was brand new when I went.  It was all good. I plan on going again soon."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here, and it was perfect! The staff were very attentive, and quickly got our drinks and food just kept coming. Also, Joe the manager that took care of us was AWESOME! He was very professional and took really good care of us from start to finish."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure. Great wait staff. Friendly and professional. Love the drinks. The beers are greats. Loyal customers. Great food also......"}
{"text":"I wanted to like them but nothing went right. The worst is when you give management feedback and they don't respond. Our beer was flat from the get go. Upon acknowledgement of that they have us new beers. But later we realized we were charged for the noncarbonated beers. When we complained our server told us there was nothing she could do. We attempted to escalate but it would have been the third time we spoke with management so there was no point in waiting. Our food took forever. We had the kids so we ordered theirs first, shortly after our app and then our food. Their food looked and was excellent hence the 2 stars. Wish I could give more on that account. Our food forever took another 30 mins for a super basic/cold queso app. And then another 40 mins after that for our food, a California flatbread and spicy pig tavern pizza. His actually looked great. Mine had more brown avocado than green. It was just frustrating to try and explain to management the slow service and food and just have them stare with no response. Seems like super young and inexperienced staff all throughout from management, servers and kitchen."}
{"text":"The BEER is AWESOME! We are beer lovers and this place has a great selection of micro-brew, although a bit pricey at $5 a pint, it is worth it! We ordered the deep dish pizza, half bbq chicken and half white(alfredo), yeah that's right you can get half and half! It was good, although it seemed like is was just reheated to order and not freshly cooked because it wasn't really hot and you could tell that the halfs had not been cooked together, that was a little disappointing but it still had a good flavor. The cilantro on the bbq chicken was a winner for me, I wasn't that into the white side honestly. The Pazookie's though, holy hot cookie with ice cream on top! We ordered the sampler so we could try 3 different flavors and it was heavenly! If you love beer, go here! But be willing to spend some dough!"}
{"text":"I didnt know this place existed around here. I absolutely love their fried artichokes appetizer which is totally worth $4. I would also recommend their clam chowder (around $8)  MAKE SURE TO ORDER IN A BREAD BOWL. They toast the bread and make it very tasty. I am not a big fan of their pizza, but overall good food. Very busy especially in the evenings. Make sure to call and ask how long the wait. 

***BE SURE TO END THE MEAL WITH A PIZOOKIE :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good casual dining. I will repeat."}
{"text":"I have a group of 12, so no simple request on an opening weekend. I called ahead and spoke with a staff member who informed me that they don't take reservations until after 2 weeks of being open . understandable, so I ask if they think there is a chance they could accomodate. Without hesitation the staff member says \"yes come over and we can get you in\". I arrive and am told it would be a 3 hour wait..... and get a look like I am stupid for even being there. Not a great first impression..... as I was leaving to try and find a place for 12 again, I hear the staff making snarky comments.... A lot of things will need to change before I dare try this place again. Too bad, it looked like it might be good."}
{"text":"If you have been to Hooters then you'll enjoy Twin Peaks. This place is what shooters is suppose to be."}
{"text":"Have to give this place 3-4 stars for food but 5 stars for service. Great service so I've gotta average it out.
Basic chain restaurant food. My shrimp tacos weren't so great. Didn't care for the crispy, dry flour tortilla. I prefer the corn.  Not much shrimp in tacos. Sauces were okay.  The seared ahi salad looked pretty good. Tasted the pulled pork sandwich and I really liked the savory sauce...not too sweet. Pizza was okay. A bit greasy but edible. I prefer thin crust.
Service was amazing.  Someone in my party ordered a mojito and her glass came to the table sticky. She told the waitress. Waitress offered to get her a new glass but she said she was okay and wrapped a napkin around it and was fine.  Even though she was fine w/ the glass, the manager came over and offered to replace the drink and she did.  Excellent customer service as the waitress did not just \"sit on it.\" She took the minor complaint to management and they took a minor complaint seriously and did something/anything about it to please the customer. Top, top service. Had to bump up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"It's a typical chain experience. Nothing special.

The menu presents very well, and I was intrigued by the variety of layered beer drinks they offered (aka a 'black and tan' but with several other combinations). I gave the bartender two shots at making what they called a 'Dark Side of the Moon' (their stout over a blue moon), but he poured way, way too fast and it came out a light brown mess. 

My wife had to return her fish dish because it was clearly foul, and my 'deep dish' pizza was closer to neapolitan style than Uno's or Lou Malnati's

No reason to go back."}
{"text":"Half off pizza on Monday was the reason I decided to come to BJs. It was a great deal and with the lunch draft special, I will definitely be back for lunch!  Also..Try the honey sriracha brussel sprouts, the twisted BLT salad, or the lemon pepper wings with your meal -yum!"}
{"text":"I'll chalk this up to being open a very short time.   Great beer selection and the food was pretty good.   The service left a lot to be desired.  It took 20 mins to get drinks - and we only got them after we asked a 2nd time.  We ordered the appetizers - which came out in a reasonable time - but we didn't get any plates.  Overall - our server was not very attentive.   
We will give them a 2nd chance - but we'll wait a while until they get kinks worked out."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant four times last week. All four times I sat at the bar. The first time I has good service and a personal pizza that was good.  I drank the IPA.  I was excited about having another brewpub nearby. The second time there was a second bartender. She was in the wrong business. She was not happy to be there and made sure you weren't happy either. No personality, slow and inattentive. I had the pale ale and the IPA with chicken wings. Once again the beer and food were good. The third trip the first bartender was on duty. OK service, nothing to write home about and the red beer was very good. 
Up to this point I was looking forward to visiting again. On the final visit the first bartender spilled an entire glass of beer into my and my guest's laps. Accidents happen. I expected that at least the first round of beers would be free for having bathed in beer earlier. When the check came all beers where on the check. I asked about getting the beers taken off and was told no, it would get her in trouble. 
I shouldn't have had to ask. When I did something should have been done. I paid my bill and decided there are plenty of places with good beer and good food. The service I had from the two bartenders is the best reason to not return. Occasional bad service is to be expected but two bad bartenders out of two says management needs to pay closer attention."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars cause the food is good. 35 mins in the heat cause, yes it's Friday night at 6, I understand it's busy. To walk into 10 open tables... WTF... 10 mins for water, while our server Nick was talking a long time to other guests. Almost 17 mins for my kids soda, 35 mins for mini corn dogs and a chicken club. Wow... Asked for water again never got it, never was brought ketchup. Asked for manager who did comp my meal and the app, payed for the 2 beers I waited oh so patiently for and my kids meal, begrudging left 10%, but I also am Industry. Y'all need some service lessons, ALWAYS BRING WATER NO MATER WHAT!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  Have enjoyed the white pizza.  I usually order it with extra garlic.  The pizza dough is fantastic.  I have tried the mozzeralla sticks and the avacado egg rolls.  Both were not that great.  And I agree with the other posters that the Pizookie should not be missed.

My only quibbles are that the prices are a little high and it is way too crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"The food is always good, the service friendly, and now it is also a Pokestop! Love the healthy menu options for me and the childrens menus are a hit with my family. Excellent location for friends and families to share a meal."}

{"text":"We arrived at 11:00 a.m. and we were greeted immediately, a hostess started to take us to our table in the bar section so we asked to be seated in the dining section instead.  The hostess rolled her eyes and rushed us to a booth in the dining section dropping the menus on the table and giving us the 5 second spiel on the drinks and walked off.  We immediately complained to the manager who apologized.  It would have been a nice gesture if the manager to came check to us to see if the experience had improved...needless to say the whole mood was ruined.

This used to be our favorite spot and the first time we ever received such a crappy attitude from a BJ's Brewhouse employee.  Glad we used our points on prior visits because we will not be going back...ever."}
{"text":"BJ's offer curb side Pickup. So call ahead if you're planing on taking some home. If you're dining in, Explore the Beers and Ale. Also you owe it to yourself to try the Pazookie (Dessert). Nice place for a Date night. As far as the Pizza, its NOT authentic Chicago style Deep Dish but its OK. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Added our name to the Waitlist via the BJ's app on Friday at 5:15pm. It initially said there was a 15 minute wait for parties of our size (3) which was perfect because that is how long it takes us to get there. We arrive and check-in. The Wait Time on the app now says 35 minutes which we expect to be no problem as we don't mind waiting a few minutes until 5:50pm for our table to be ready. The App also mentions that \"This is not a reservation, so you may experience a slight wait when you arrive.\" As it approaches 6pm and we hear other parties with similar sized groups being called to be seated we start to wonder if the Wait List has even helped our place in line. This location is rather new and there always seems to be a crowd in the lobby - which is totally normal and expected. On this visit, though, they actually served small slices of pizza to the guests waiting for their tables. We thought this was a great! (I always thought a restaurant should have a separate sidebar and waiting room with light snacks to make the wait a little more bearable.) Anyways, we are seated at 6:05pm and order our drinks. We tried to order their newly advertised Pumpkin beer and our waitress tells us that they sold out in 6 days and it's no longer available (it's not even November!). We decide to order an appetizer - Sriracha Queso with Chips. Our family is no stranger to queso and this is our 2nd time ordering it at BJ's. We are always surprised how it seems to lack the Sriracha part. For dinner, I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with fries. My wife, K, ordered the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles which was a new addition to the menu. Our son, G, ordered the BBQ Boneless wings - and the waitress suggested he try their Root Beer BBQ sauce on the side. We had a longer wait for our food than normal. Both adjacent tables who were seated after us received their meals before us - but there was no worry because our server brought us extra chips! Once the meals were delivered, I now understand why it took so long...they had to wait for my wife's dish to be delivered from Noodles & Company in Cranberry! The noodles and the portion size was much smaller than pictured. There was really no spicy component to it - it tasted more like an orange flavored sauce. My sandwich was delicious - lightly toasted and a healthy serving of avocado. G's Boneless Wings were plentiful - there had to be at least 15 on his plate! Overall, an OK experience that's why I gave it 3 stars. We still enjoy BJ's and their expansive menu - and especially the beer! The Jeremiah Red is my favorite! In the end, $50 for 3 is absolutely fair. We will be back again."}

{"text":"3/3/11: Tonight it was a takeout smorgasbord of goodies... New pork chops tasted great in restaurant & now in takeout too. Love Santa Fe rolls - next time I'm asking for two each of the sauces because then I don't have to worry about double-dipping accidentally at home. Same for requesting an extra sauce with pot stickers when I'm sharing a meal with someone  :) Tonight the takeout food is as good as in restaurant & it's a rare restaurant that can do that."}
{"text":"Average food, average service, average atmosphere. Yep, that's about it - the place is average. Just another average big chain restaurant with an Olive Garden personality.....Keep searching."}
{"text":"I love their enlightened Tuna salad, amazing. Their service is always on point when I go there. My plates are always cleared after im done eating. Love them. You have to get the Oreo pazooki"}
{"text":"We come to BJ's probability once or twice a week, sometimes more!!  The staff is great and the food is delicious. Last week I lost my wallet there but the manager found it and put it in the safe.  Everything was still in it when I picked it up. Honesty and integrity come with the service!!  Five stars and two thumbs up for BJ's!!"}
{"text":"Equivalent to any chain with mass produced over salted food. Not horrific but no different than a TGIF or Applebee's"}
{"text":"This is one of my sister & mine favorite places to munch... We went tonight & only had beers... while we normally we eat & indulge in the wicked selection of draft brews... from their house brews to the wide selection of more comerial beers... I don't think I drink the same beer twice in a visit...
as always the service was awesome... never had an empty glass... the check was under 20 bucks for 6 beers.... not bad... now I've never sat any where but the bar so all I can vouche for are the bartenders... but they're good... so"}
{"text":"FOOD= horrible
STAFF= Server was nice & management horrible
PRICE= $$


Management here really needs a clean up at this location.

BEWARE!!!!!!!!
 My husband and I were sharing the spinach dip and he cracked his tooth on something he spit out everything his tooth shattered and there was chunks of glass in our spinach dip!!!!!

We got the manager and he said he would take care of the dip (well I certainly hope so) but we wanted to know how our dip had crushed glass in there!!! 
Couldn't even finish our dinner since my husbands tooth was shattered and the manager gave the number to their HR department. Basically the manager and the HR lady never got back to us for paying this horrible incident. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"FOOD= Good
STAFF= Great
PRICE= $$


This is the best BJ's location in Vegas area & right across the street from Redrock Casino so something to do after lunch or dinner. 

Chili bowl, is very good and goes great with one of their house brewed beers.
Oreo pazookie is a must have and you might not want to share its amazing!"}
{"text":"This location has really odd customer service. My group had three adults and a baby. 
The hostess tried to seat us in a 2-person booth. I strongly doubted that we could fit and, sure enough, when we all sat down, I could not sit entirely on the side I shared with another person. I couldn't see how even our plates would all fit together. The hostess was annoyed when we asked for another table, even though we clearly could not eat there and even though there were other tables available. 

The food was fine--exactly like every other BJ's I've been to. I'm just going to go to another location when I decide to go again."}
{"text":"Don't be mistaken - BJ's does not serve craft beer. Some of them are good but it is contract corporate brewing. We enjoyed the Scottish Ale and the Brown Ale and a dessert. Our bartender was a super nice, service was great. That's all."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. Especially the all-you-can-eat soup and salad. The mozzarella and tomato salad is excellent. The clam chowder is also very good."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and every visit is awesome. Their bbq wings are THE best wings that I've had....way better than BWW. Servers are always polite. A little slow service one night I went in for some drinks but other than that, no complaints. Definitely will be back a lot."}
{"text":"The Glazed Salmon is wonderful. Pair that with the Piranha Pale Ale and you have a great dinner"}
{"text":"Always look forward to meals at this BJs location when we head south for the winter. Today's experience was a disappointment for these reasons: after being seated right away, took forty-five minutes to get meal; waitperson was not too interested in her job (\"What kind of beer? Well, I'll figure it out.\"; never offered a soft drink refill; never said a word when setting drinks on table; never said thank you when placing bill on table). Meal was three stars, having easily been four or five in the past. We have purchased gift cards for family members in the past, but will probably discontinue that."}
{"text":"I love this place! The clam chowder in the bread bowl is so yummy and of course every time I go, I get a pazookie"}
{"text":"So I used the BJ's mobile app to register my party and the app responded with an 85 minute wait. Not bad since I had a 45 minute drive to the restaurant. When we arrived we were told that the computer had crashed so I had to give my name for the wait list and my cell # for a text when my table was ready, and a 30-45 minute wait. After 30 minutes I was told that it would be 30 more minutes. After 30 more minutes I was told it would be 15-30 more minutes. Luckily for me, the 3rd person in our party had arrived before us and put her name in and after a 90 minute wait we were seated. I never did get that text I was promised. We could have left but we were all interested in how it would play out. Not even an apology! The host was of no help, the manager was of no help. The waiter was great, the food was very good (or were we just very hungry?). I would be leery of trusting the app, maybe call ahead instead. Any way you look at it, I can't recommend BJ's."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the place was packed! Our server Christy D. was on it. She checked on us regularly and we never felt neglected though we could tell she was slammed. We requested 2 beer samples and she brought a third she thought we might like. We did and ordered a pitcher of it. We ordered avocado egg rolls & the BJ's bacon cheeseburger pizza and the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Reasonably priced for the great quality. Servers are considerate and nice and I've always had a great experience coming here. On weekends there can be a little bit of a wait, but that's expected for most sit-down restaurants. Definitely a fan(:"}
{"text":"Man I forgot how good the pizza was. It was thick crunch yet soft. My wife and I will definitely go back. And the service was good. I think our server was over sat with customers but he did his best to make it pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent service from takeout! My order was accurate and hot, and Savannah did everything above and beyond to help me out! Without her it would be just another chain pizza place! Stop by and have a pazookie!"}
{"text":"I just went here for the 1st time. Great menu, salmon with couscous was well prepared. I would go here if you're trying to please different appetites, something for everyone.  Close to 101 and you can go to the Harkins Show in the Mall."}
{"text":"The last two times I've been here (all within the last week and a half) have been a disappointment when it comes to service. The food has been fantastic as always though. On a Sunday afternoon, my husband, parents, and 3-yr old daughter went in around 4:30-my dad had a flight to catch at 6:45. It apparently was shift change and getting someone to take our order was horrendous! We finally had to ask the hostess to help or my dad wouldn't have eaten! The second visit was on a Friday at 11:15 for lunch. Our waitress was great to start but then disappeared! My water glass was empty for at least ten minutes! No other staff would slow down enough for me to even ask anyone else. I finally had to yell toward our server to get her to come over. Both times, the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Blackened salmon was tasty.  You can never go wrong with the pizookie for dessert.   Our Server had a great personality which makes dining enjoyable.  For a chain restaraunt its solid."}
{"text":"Really good food a little pricy. Good berry drink no carb and no alcohol. Appetizers very tasty .
A place for every one family, Date, celebration, or sports."}
{"text":"Sub par, every time. On this occasion, I ordered a California chicken club with wedge fries and extra toasted bread... the bread was soft and mushy and the fries were very greasy and flavorless. They can't even get a sandwich made right, imagine how poorly executed the rest of their dishes are..."}
{"text":"Went here the first night in Surprise, AZ with my sister, her boyfriend, and my husband. We were visiting them for a few days and they highly recommended this place. 

We got the pot stickers and mozzarella sticks and both were very delicious. My husband had the porkchop and said it was very good. I got the small bite meatballs and they were very good. My sister got the small bite mac and cheese and we all tried a bite of it and it was very good. Her boyfriend got a hamburger and said it was ok. 

This place was reasonably priced and it was worth going to."}
{"text":"The service is always great. Very attentive and friendly. I just wish the food was better. And the beer is kind of meh. It's on par with Applebee's, so if that's your thing, then by all means, rush right over. If you're looking for a solid brew pub experience, make the trip to Church Brew Works. They have it full time."}
{"text":"Only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because of the service. Our waitress took so long to even come to us after being seated that when she greeted us we all knew what we wanted to drink and order. After that it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. We felt like when we flagged her down we would need to ask for everything because there was a chance we wouldn't see her again for another 20 minutes or so. 
Usually get better service than this. 

Food was good as always. Fettuccini Alfredo is yummy. I love the small bites. Got crispy artichokes and the bruschetta. If you don't eat a lot id recommend ordering some small bites and maybe sharing an entree with someone. That's a good amount. 

As always order the pizookie for dessert! You can't pass on it. Good place to come with a group. Try their beers or do the beer sampler. Overall the food is good here. Service varies."}
{"text":"I'm a regular there as I live close by and discovered a new salad that it just fabulous.  I eat healthy food and this fits my needs as it falls under their \"Enlightened\" category.  So next time you're in look for the Thai Mango Chicken salad.  It's very hearty and healthy too.  You may have to wait in line quite a while for a seat though.........."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews that mentioned slow and not so good service, long waits for food n drinks, etc,,,,I had a good experience last night about 6pm,,,(it was helpful I arrived well before 6pm and the dinner rush),,,i was able to get my name (party of four) on the seating list quickly and it was within minutes I was called n seated, our server and the expediters seemed fairly prompt and organized and the foods n drinks seemed timed appropriately.  The food quality was very good (one tilapia dish and one top sirloin dish) but the pizza was needing some work, I wouldn't order the pizza as it didn't appear to be their strong suit (such as throwing a few pieces of pepperoni on a pepperoni pizza order).  It was interesting that their menu offers just about everything, but they practically only have one type of dessert called 'pazookie' which is really good if you love semi cooked cookie dough w/ ice cream on top, be advised the pazookie pan is hot out of their 350 degree oven and is scalding hot, yeah I learned the hard way, I have never been to BJs before and the expediter server didn't say anything to me when she placed it on the table.  Our server seemed nice enough, good attitude and pleasant enough and he was efficient w/ just about everything, only forgetting one drink which was promptly served when reminded,,good job to him.  (I really wanted some cheesecake for dessert after a steak dinner,,,I hope that BJs will add that to their menu)."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience, Our waitress Taylor was so sweet and attentive. We will definitely be returning for the delicious food and exceptional service. (:"}
{"text":"Average at best. Still trying to figure out why they asked how I wanted my burger done... asked for rare and got bone dry well done. The cheese was all balled up on 1/4 of the burger. The itsy bitsy thin fries were pretty much cold by the time they arrived at the table. We had to ask for a napkin and silverware when our server checked back to see how the food was!  All in all a very poorly run place! I can only imagine they were half busy because they're still fairly new? It was our first visit and will most likely be our last! Blah..."}
{"text":"Everything is great here! including the service, curb side and take out. My family either eats in or gets curb side a few times a month here at BJ's. Our favorites are the burgers, ribs, roast beef dip and chicken tortilla soup. Total Yum!"}
{"text":"Tasty beer, diverse menu, and pretty decent happy hour at the bar. I'm not usually a fan of mid-priced chain restaurants, but I've never had a bad meal at BJ's. The deep dish pizza is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere, amazing food, we experience great service every time we go, The desserts are incredible, sometimes I have to order them first lol"}
{"text":"Yo.  I'm going to go against my own lame criteria and review a restaurant that is a huge chain.  This place is pretty damn good.  I've been there about 5 times and each one has been met with very nice staff, solid food, and great service.  

Try the steaks.  I  get the New York strip usually and it's always cooked perfect (order medium usually).  HUGE PORTIONS!!  You may enter a booth, eat, then have to sleep over because your stomach has created a seal against the table that you cannot break.  

I'm not a big fan of the pizzas as I think they are too doughy.  But pizza is a thing, much like the name of this restaurant, where I've really never had a bad one.  So, you may really enjoy it.  

Also get the rootbeer.  You MAY get diabeetus after finishing off a couple of mugs, but it will be worth it.  

So yeah, don't eat for a week before going. Let's all get some BJ's!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last night and was seriously shocked at the lack of service I received. The high school girl taking names at the door could care less about her job and clearly would rather be anywhere else but there. It was a busy Saturday night and the girl told us the wait would be 45 min. We deiced to wait. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. From the start I thought this was a terrible idea. I also have an out of state number so from the start I was worried something would go wrong. As we sat and waited the high schooler told each party after us a different time. The people after us was an hour, a few more people later it was 90min and then it was 25min. Clearly she had no idea what she was doing. 

Finally after about 40min I started to notice people being taken that had come in long after we did so I decided to inquire. The snotty high schooler gave such sass when I asked that I almost walked out right then and there (and trust me I should have!). Without looking up my name or  any sort of information she told me the people were being taken because they'd called ahead. That very well may be but she hadn't even looked my name up to make sure that was true. Clearly just an answer the management teaches the hostess to say. So I then inquired how long it would be until my name was called and she proceeded to tell me that actually my number had already been texted and I had missed my table. We had been sitting right in front of this girl the entire time with my phone in my hand and I had not missed a text. She then read me my number that I supposedly had given her and it was all sorts of wrong. Now I don't really blame the girl for messing up a phone number because it was busy and loud, and one that was out of state, but it was her attitude and her \"I don't give a crap\" tone that made it not okay. I started to get really angry because I was getting no where with this child who didn't know what she was doing. I proceed to ask how much longer it will be and she says \"it will be the next table\" so I ask again \"how long\" and she just kept giving a snarky response of \"it will be the next table\".

Due to this girl's attitude I decided it was time to ask for the manager. I had to ask THREE TIMES before I got the manager. The first time the manager was not around, the second she, the hostess, blew me off and the third I realized he was standing, hiding behind some other hostesses because he saw what was going on and didn't want to deal. It took three tries to get the manager and even on the third try the girls working the hostess desk played telephone to tell him why I was mad and he finally, slowly made his way over to me. At this point I was pretty upset and told him what a crappy job the hostess was doing and how disappointed we were. THE MANAGER WALKED AWAY FROM ME. In the middle of my rant he just walks away and disappears. Now I was upset but I was in no way out of control or doing anything that would require him walking away. A simple apology and a table would have done the trick but he walked away. At this point another hostess takes us to our table and the manager is still out of sight. He finally comes over a few minutes later and said \"sorry I was making sure you got a free app\". Still never did I get an apology for the poor treatment from the idiot at the door or from him...I didn't even want a free app!!!

After we sat down I tried to calm down but was still really shocked at how disrespected I had been. I was really hoping the food would make up for the lack of service but unfortunately it did not. The free appetizer we got wasn't bad (avocado spring rolls) but the pizza we ordered was TERRIBLE. We order a pizza with olives, onions, pepperoni, and sausage. The moment the pizza was put down on the table I looked at it funny, questioning if it was even throughly cooked. The second I took a bite I knew it was not. The pizza tasted uncooked and was cold. I wasn't about to complain after the lack of respect I had already received from the manager but the food was awful. 

I would not recommend this place at all. I have been to the one in Columbus and it wasn't bad but this place is truly awful. Even the staff that I didn't have a run in with looked miserable. It's a shame this place is so terribly run and doesn't offer good food when it just opened. I would recommend skipping this place and choosing somewhere else in Mccandless Crossing or somewhere else on McKnight Road. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had a Cobb salad and it was delicious. My husband had soup and salad and he liked it. The menus is like a book with lots of options to choose from. Our waiter was polite, knowledgeable , and available."}
{"text":"Had to wait 25 minutes to eat, which isn't a big deal, but my girlfriend and I were forgot about and skipped multiple times. Also the hostess had an attitude about it... We were sat with no silver wear. How am I supposed to eat my food, man? Good pizza, but a D- for the customer service. I'm sure there's a BJs somewhere else in town that can do you better."}
{"text":"For a brewery type restaurant they do a pretty good job, in fact mabe the best one in town for me. Most of these type of places do a very mediocre jobs with a very extensive menu. 

BJ's has a great gluten free options. the pizza is very good, probably the best I've had in town. good selection of beers. service is always pretty good."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with food because I did not eat here, but once you read the review I hope you understand the reasoning.  My in-laws were in for the week and on their first night we decided to try BJs because we are also new to the area . We called to place our name on the call ahead list. I called and asked if we could be added to the list at 6:30. The call to be placed on the list was took place at 5:35. We got to the restaurant at 6:25 and said we were on the list for 6:30.  The hostesses then proceeded to tell us it would still be a 50-60 wait! I was shocked ! I had a 3 year old in the party. I wouldn't have been upset had they told us this when we called, but there was NOTHING said in the initial call.  Give us the opportunity to choose to be there and get the chance to eat someone else. This was horrible."}
{"text":"What I love about the BJ's chain of restaurants is the consistency - which is all good!  From the servers to the food, this place never disappoints!  Only reason for 4 stars- would love to of seen this location, and/or more add a nice outside patio area.  Otherwise they are the best!  Oh, and they never make you feel rushed so its incredibly conducive for conversation, weather its a first date, business lunch or birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"We went here twice in one week, and will never go back. First time our server forgot about us during our meal and we had to go find her. Food was cold and tasteless. Second time we were seated and sat for 15 minutes with no one coming to the table. I asked the hostess to flag down a waiter/waitress, and she also said she would send the manager over. Manager never came over, and took 20 minutes to actually get service. People seated next to us got up and left because they were so frustrated.

Food isn't good. Burgers are tiny with tons of bun (bread is cheap, meat is not). Drinks are mediocre. NOTHING justifies the price, let alone the awful service. Never again."}
{"text":"Terrible, no, no attention or service after 10:30. Servers walk by you and ignore you, it's happened numerous times. We will not go back!"}
{"text":"The food is good; however, you will trade off the lack of beverage refills and lack of dessert. I went with a group of friends, on one of the group members' suggestion. My coffee was never refilled, not once; and I was never asked if I wanted dessert, despite having specifically told the server when I ordered dinner, that I intended to order dessert. I just got my bill. The food was good, but the service so abysmal, with the clear intention to scoot the customers out the door as rapidly as possible, that I will never to to any BJ's again."}
{"text":"I'm bias about reviewing this restaurant because I love eating and coming to either this location and or the Summerlin location.  I think they have a great menu and drinks and whether you want a simple lunch or just drinks and dinner, you'd be set.  The only bad things is the wait sometimes but if you come with 2 or 3 people you can usually snag a table in the bar area."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service has needs attention. Bartenders just like to talk themselves.  Can't get their attention to order drinks or food.  They are new wait 6 months to try."}
{"text":"It's a cool place. I had one very cool server on my first trip, Dino. I remember his name because he was so flamboyant, I mean that in a good way. Like he actually wanted to be our server. 

The food was pretty good. Not great. 

Second visit was pretty terrible. Our waitress was obviously just having an off day, and I get that. Food took 45 mins. They were not that busy. I know how long it takes to make some chicken tenders with fries, boneless buffalo wings and a salad. It's much less than 45 mins. The fact that my food was cold makes me think it was the waitress and not the kitchen, but who knows. 

Overall I wouldn't choose this place as my first choice. The menu is like the Bible, and there is no reasonable way to offer that vast of a variety of \"fresh\" food. 

Wouldn't avoid like the plague, mostly because of Dino being so cool on my first visit."}
{"text":"Im usually not one to write reviews but this needed to be said. We arrived at 830 tonight and were sat right away. We waited for over 30 min without anyone stopping by our table to greet us or take drink orders. We decided to leave and as we were leaving the manager and servers were all in the lobby talking and having a good time. Will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"I have to give this 5 stars because there was nothing lacking here this  evening when we chose a casual dinner near our Marriott Canyon villa.
The atmosphere was fun with sports screens but not too loud that we had to scream across the table. The food was reasonable priced and good size portions and delicious. Our female server gave us a good description of items to help us decide and it came promptly. I had a refreshing arugula & watermelon salad topped with feta. I tried the jambalaya which was delicious on the spicy side. But, the pumpkin cookie a la mode took care of the residual heat aftertaste. Glad we checked this one out and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and usually consistent food service. I ordered the New Orleans jambalaya and some mimosas. The first mimosa tastes more orange juice than champagne?, but the second one was more equal parts, so a bit better. Its a good place to take friends and family because it's upscale casual and food and service is ok,  but I don't go out of my way to have dinner there if I'm by myself."}
{"text":"First off  I been here a lot but first time I wrote a review,  The Service was good. The atmosphere is really nice and the Food was just Ok I tried The \"Gourmet Five Meat\" Mini Pizza. The oven roasted ham made it to salty other then that it was Ok. Like I said I been here a lot but have not been awhile it seems like they're going down hill on the the food hints the reason why I don't go often."}
{"text":"I like the gluten free pizza here the best. It's delicious and has a variety of toppings available. The service is friendly and the crowds are good. It's a good place to go for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I would rather go to Fat Heads and wait an hour than go back here. Food is ok and the service was awful."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! My husband & I come here often & we are never disappointed. We love all the food we have tried. The staff is very friendly & enthusiastic! Definitely going to continue to come again & again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. 

The staff has always been friendly and the service really good.  

Parking is a pain in the butt during peak hours.  

This is a go to place for us and it's never disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for the GF pizza because I had a craving for it, and it was phenomenal! I had the chicken bacon ranch and the crust was excellent, not dry, and the pizza had great flavor. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice, she was attentive and very fun. Loved it here and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"If this place wasn't so pricey sit would definitely get 5 Stars. Always clean and the service is always great. Their menu is huuuuugggge... Lots of variety and something for everyone regardless of how big your appetite is. BJ's house beers are pretty darn good as well. I'm rather impressed with the Hopstorm IPA."}
{"text":"Response to Don M on 4/28. I was in BJ's that day with my wife, had a great meal and service, only problem was  4 drunk nurses ( 2 male/ 2 female).  I complained and you were nicely asked to leave.  You were Nasty. Just FYI, while you were busy yelling at an employee out front, my wife took down both of your license plates and turned them into Mesa, Gilbert and Chandler police departments for their BOLO (be on the lookout) listings. You will be picked up in the future being the drunks you are. There were only 4 of you, not 5, unless your patient was imaginary."}
{"text":"Food and beer was reasonably priced and very good. We had called ahead to put our names in for a table and they had no record of us calling. They still sat us in 15 minutes when the wait was probably at least an hour. Other than that issue which I'm sure will get worked out once the restaurant has been open longer, this place is great."}
{"text":"BJ's is one of my top places to go to out of town. So glad it came to Pittsburgh. The avocado egg rolls are my number one appetizer ever anywhere I have been and I have been many places. The beer is also to brag about. I have told everyone and anyone they need to go here.  I had the ribs for the first time and they were also excellent.  Nothing I have ever had there has been anything but good.  Highly recommended especially if you like beer!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing to come back for.. service should be more professional.. Xavier was rude"}
{"text":"3/16/2014
We spent more time waiting than eating.
45 minute wait for order to arrive, after finally getting a server.
Food : meh
Another long wait for dessert. 
We were seated quickly and that was the only positive note.
First and last visit. 
Absolutely not impressed, really deserves \"zero star review\"."}
{"text":"Food is ok typical chain type food.  Servers and bar tenders were good.  We went here like everyday, because it was next to our hotel.  

Lots of beers to choose from.  The beers were better than the food."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst restaurant experiences. We arrived at noon and waited for about 25 minutes for a table. We were seated and ordered. It tok until 1:45 until our food arrived. The order was incomplete and it took awhile to get a server to correct it. There were 4 in our party and we all ordered soup and salad which should be a staple so we couldn't imagine why it took so long. My wife's soup was cold and I got seriously ill with a GI upset. You can be sure that we won't be going to BJs again!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on 6/5/15. It was to busy at all, but can someone tell me why it took over an Hour to get a bacon cheeseburger? I went with my wife and kids and they all got there meals that we ordered except me. Then the manager tells me I don't have a answer to why it took over an hour to even put in the order. This is how they treat Veterans?? I will never go to that restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"The food is good, as to be expected considering this is a chain restaurant. Haven't had any issue with the service yet.. It just seems that every time I go there and get two entrées and an appetizer the bill is higher than it should be.. The spinach and artichoke dip is out of this world! They have a very large drink menu my some really creative drinks, also have a decent happy hour.."}
{"text":"My one star rating has nothing to do with the food, which was very good, and everything to do with the manager of the evening, Amber, during our experience at BJ's on Saturday, July 16.  We were coming to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend.  I phoned ahead to get on the list for a table.  I specifically requested a table because my husband and I have disabilities that limit our movement and make it nearly impossible to maneuver ourselves into and out of a booth.  The hostess assured me that a table would be made available for us.  When my buzzer went off, Amber said our space was ready, but that it was a booth.  I explained that we required a table and she insisted that the booth can accommodate us because of the pullout section for seating.  As we approached the booth we saw an empty table for 4 and asked why we could not have that space.  She explained that she needed it and that as soon as the people in the table next to that one left, she would be setting it up for someone else.  Mind you, the people at the other table were in no way ready to move on and had settled in nicely for a good dinner with friends.  We sat down at the empty table and refused to get up because the space was available for us and we wanted that space for our dinner.  Amber was extremely rude and upset that we would not take the booth and kept repeating to us that she \"needs that table\".  The hostess attempted to give us our menus and Amber told her \"NO\" because she \"needs that table\".  Along comes the waitress assigned to the table, Christa, and we explained to her what was going on.  She was a delight and offered to get us something to drink while the table fiasco was sorted out.  Seeing that the table next to us was clearly not leaving, we asked her to bring us menus and we ordered our appetizer and dinner.  To be clear, an hour later that group next to us was still enjoying their time together.  I don't know what Amber's issue was, but she needs some intense training on customer service as she could not have been more rude and unprofessional if she tried.  We have never had an experience like this at BJ's, nor any other restaurant we've dined at.  We thank Christa for her excellent service and enjoyed our dinners.  It will, however, be some time before we frequent the Peoria location again."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night to celebrate a friends birthday. The wait was understandable. Was asked for drinks promptly upon seating. Waitress did not return with the beverages until 15 or so minutes had passed. Another 10 minutes for the waitress to take our order. It was some time (another 25 minutes) until we actually got our food. The food was sub par for the price. Fries were room temperature. Chicken Alfredo was dry and not creamy. Spent more time waiting than eating. Bathroom was also a mess. Water on the counters, water on the floor. Thrash overflowing. This was our first time to this establishment and will definitely be the last. Would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Not for breakfast! Not many choices and omelet was way over done.  I mentioned this (very nicely and with no request or expectation of a particular solution) to the server who apologized, said she would tell the kitchen manager, then didn't come around much. There was no offer to correct the problem or at least comp beverages. We never saw the manager, even just to check in about the issue.  Then the server just kept saying \"I really hope you'll come back\" in a way where she was almost waiting for us to say we would.  What I wonder is why would she expect us to come back to a place where we were dissatisfied, expressed that dissatisfaction and the only action taken is to tell the kitchen manager...  so it doesn't happen to someone else?  I don't typically go back to eat at places where the food was bad, especially if nothing was done to address it with us."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Me and a friend were invited to a private opening for the new staff basically a training session. The menu is large lots to choose from. We ordered 2 appetizers the queso dip with pulled pork and the honey Sriracha Brussels sprouts they were AMAZING! We ordered 2 pizzas they were good not enough sauce but decent flavor. The best part of the meal was dessert their warm pizza cookies with ice cream has a wanting to go back for more. Overall delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty slick place! (I felt under dressed in my shorts, no worries though)
Nice room. Will seat 100+. Someone paid attention to details here!
Great graphics on the walls, the logo's for their homebrew styled beers are excellent. Meaning they make you want to order and drink them (thats what a good logo does) http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/list.aspx Well crafted brews I will add. 7 are on tap year round with an additional 10+ specialty (seasonal) brews. ex: Pumpkin Ale, and Oktoberfest Marzen coming Oct./Nov.

It's a large menu. Listing Cocktails and Wines  throughout the Beers, Appetizers, Soups/Salads, Pizza, Burgers, Pastas, Entrees, and into the Kid's Menu. Tip: Dessert, try the PIZOOKIE®!! don't ask, just Do It!

Nice Bar too. You are welcome to eat a full menu there. But, before 7pm daily all appetizers 1/2 off (bar only) just an fyi. So I am told. I did not do this this visit. http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/beginnings.aspx (Sliders (4) Angus Beef is $7.95 w/ fries take 1/2 off before 7pm) 

Service was excellent. Food was good. Interesting variety well executed.
Big room, and it was filling to Full by 7pm, noise was very tolerable.

So if you find yourself on the westside near Red Rock Casino, BJ's is across the street. Easy parking. And they also have have \"Curbside pick up\" for To-Go ordering http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/curbside.aspx
Hours:
11am-10 pm Sun-Thurs
11am- 11pm Fri-Sat

No gaming that I saw either. (Nice break) 2 Nevada locations and plenty more http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/locations.aspx"}
{"text":"This used to be, hands down, my favorite restaurant. I moved away 2 years ago only to move back and find that the food has become subpar at best. The avacado eggrolls were hard and lacking of filling. The salads, which used to be hearty, are now mounds of lettuce with microscopic pieces of everything else. The lettuce wraps had gray chicken accompanied by them. The calamari looked as if someone deep fried a tarantula.....which is still making me nauseated just thinking about it..... We sent everything back and never even ate. We ended up walking next door to PF changs. sorry Bjs but you wont last if you dont start making quality food again....."}
{"text":"BJ's is a chain, but as far as chains go, they are better than most.  They have a huge menu, and I've never had a bad meal.  My favorites are the flat bread pizzas, bread bowl soups, and the sandwiches.  

The large selection continues with the beer, including a BJ's \"brand\".  I'm not sure where they are brewed, but it is not on the premises.  Some are better than others, and I prefer the Nutty Brewnette and the porter.

I've never had a real problem with the service, but with any chain it can be hit or miss.  Also, they are often very busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights, and you may experience slightly slower service due to the volume of patrons.  To avoid the wait time to be seated, you can call ahead and they will put your name on the seating list.

The happy hour is excellent, 3-7 on weekdays, cheap-er appetizers that are all pretty solid, and discounted BJ's beer.  The only problem is that you have to sit in the bar area, which can fill up quickly.

The take out service is very good, which is a plus since the restaurant can be so busy.  Little touches go a long way such as keeping warm food warm, not adding fries to the order until you arrive, and keeping the soup in a separate container from the bread bowl so you can combine them when you are ready to eat.  They also go over your entire order to ensure that it is exactly what you asked for."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I love the curbside food pick-up option. This is great when you are on your way home from work and don't want to cook. Unfortunately the food is not consistent in quality."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beer. Fresh salmon is winner but, the menu is so extensive that it's average at everything else"}
{"text":"Extensive menu, above average food, decent beer selection."}
{"text":"First visit to the new bjs at south hills village, the call ahead seating apparently has no affect as we waited an hour after calling in 2hrs  edited our arrival time.  Food quality was good, although some of the portions were a little misleading in the menu.  The biggest deduction was for safety, as all of the floors were a complete ice-rink!  And it was just as bad when we left as it was when we arrived!"}
{"text":"So very good everyone was nice great food and for the wings you might want 2 orders of 5 wings. I have had 5 wings and one huge burger and fries and the wings caused me to take half my burger home along with the fries which I partially ate as well. The meal as one was very very good. They even asked for dessert."}
{"text":"Reasonable HH in the bar area that is great for an after-work hangout. We ordered quite a few things off the specials and finished them all without complaints. In sum:

-California flatbread was tasty and completely made by the bacon. Toppings were not plentiful, but adequate and the HH portion was reasonably cut into 4 portions. Not bad for $4, but I wouldn't order the standard size. 
-Boneless buffalo wings were just as you'd expect. I like variations on other dishes, but don't mess with my buffalo. Good job on keeping it standard.
-Spinach-stuffed mushrooms (not on HH, but ~$5 for a small plate) were not my favorite. If you like lightly flavored 'shrooms, then great. I, however, expected more flavor and these were drab. 
-Avocado egg rolls were my favorite overall. Unique (at least to me!) and creamy, with a hint of spice that leaves you guessing what's going on in there.

Our waiter was great, non-intrusive (though we hung out for about 2 hours), and cute...so that's a win! My standard gin & soda was actually kinda strong...in a good way! Though BJ's did not blow me away, it's nice, comfortable food that is great for all folks. I'll be back to try some of their extensive menu offerings."}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Booths are small and therefore uncomfortable for larger people.  Caesar salad with grilled chicken was unoriginal and just blah and ok
  I would have gotten a burger but they're all served with shoestring  (McDonald's) fries.  I do believe this restaurant will last less than 2 years."}
{"text":"Visited March 20th 2016

Desert Ridge location second visit and still not impressed. 

The Pros: It was super busy and because there were only two of us, we were seated immediately. The Long Island Ice tea - one is all you need. Menu is large and can satisfy most in a party. 

The in- betweens:  The lighting. Low lighting that probably makes every-one have a \"soft focus\" effect and look prettier :)  However, the lighting  casts a weird glare on their menu which makes it even more difficult to read. 

The Cons: Menu too large to be able to specialize and pick something spectacular. I had the Mediterranean Tacos which my server claimed to be one of his favorites. I had no idea what I was eating, it was flavorless. The Mediterranean Tacos were supposed to have Feta but the Feta looked like a sprinkling of salt. My long island Ice Tea cost more than my meal (no joke). The font on the menu is too small, you will likely have to read the menu to anyone that may need to wear glasses."}
{"text":"And again service sucks, but let me get this straight \" the servers are excellent \" it's the management !!!! In their efforts to save money (as demanded by the owners)  they cut common sense service with the thought that they are doing a good job saving money when in fact they are shooting themselves in the foot. Wise up owners, your greed for making money is going to put your business \"out of business\"."}
{"text":"3 & a half stars. First time at BJs & I'll probably go again. 

We got the corn fritters with bacon aioli & mini bruschetta for appetizers. The corn fritters were Delicious & the bruschetta was yummy too. 

My husband ordered the bison burger & I had the parmesan crusted chicken. Only one of my pieces of chicken had the sauce on it & overall it was pretty good but nothing I'd order again (kinda wishing I had gone with a pizza). Only had a bite of my husbands burger & from what I can remember it was good & he liked it. 

Lastly, we ordered the cookies & cream pizookie & that was just delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came with a large group and the customer service was excellent. The food came out hot and delicious. They were on the spot with drink refills and condiment requests. The servers diligently kept up with removing plates. Impressed!

The place is clean. Staff was friendly. Easy access parking."}
{"text":"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse has some very good pizza and micro brewed beers..

I have had their Pale ale and I can't think of the name of it, but it was very good and had a great flavor (if you like pale ales)..

The pizza was great too, with fresh tomatoes on top (optional).

Service was above average, but it wasn't very busy because we got their pretty late. 

I would recommend this place to people who want to try a good pizza and different tasting beers.. They have really good cheap lunch specials too."}
{"text":"Bad night for service at BJ's. I ate here with 6 of my friends after they all got their food mine did not come out.  I figured it would be out in a sec... But no after 20 min of waiting I had to track down my waiter to ask about my food.  Only to be told by her I did not order anything.  Me and everyone I was with we're 100 percent positive I did order. The waitress was rude and not helpful and tried to make me feel dumb. Nothing worse than being treated like that in front of all my friends.  Once again horrible night for BJ's"}
{"text":"And to think I'm a large shareholder of this company.   California and Texas locations are perfect, but this particular one needs to get their 'ish' together.  

My waiter was cool, but my Mediterranean deep dish pizza was not cut properly and it was overcooked.   There were advertising on TV screens and on my table of a free pizookie if a mobile app was used,  and my waiter was clueless when I asked.  When it finally arrived, it was a very small size and burned!   Not going here again."}
{"text":"Worst pan pizza ever, dried up and tasteless. Avocado egg rolls nothing like we've had before. Gross. Never again. If you drink enough, I guess it won't matter.

Thought we'd give it another try. The one by us in Menifee, Ca was bad so we thought this one should be better. Wasn't."}
{"text":"good beer selection...tried them all!  food menu is a wide as can be...a couple great salads I always get like the italian chopped (which the just changed...bummer) and the french fries are awesome.  the soup and salad endless combo at lunch is a winner"}
{"text":"This is our first time here very impressive
The food was very good and fresh! The server was very friendly. I will come back"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food not just pizza but that was great too. Beer was good too and they even had drinks even if don't drink beer. Someone was always asking if we needed anything. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"Both our entrees and the appetizer tasted amazing! The fresh brew beer was excellent too. This place has a real clean vibe with interesting art work everywhere. The hostess was not friendly. It seemed like she was annoyed people were going there. Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and each time I've received excellent service from the moment I walk in to the time I exit.  Whether its dine in or carry-out, their staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  The food is always delicious, served hot  fresh from the oven and they toast the chips when you order chips & salsa!!!  My favorite items are the spinach and artichoke pizza followed by a white choc/macadamia or oreo pizookie.  If you go to the Eastern Ave location, you are better off parking  behind the restaurant, it is not only easier to find parking but also easier to exit."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices, great environment! Rhonda was our waitress and provided great service! The wife and I split a full rack of ribs, 2 bowls of clam chowder, 2 soft drinks for $30. 
This was my first visit. I'm very picky about restaurants and have no complaints. I will go again!"}
{"text":"I have gone here twice and each time excellent service and food. If you can put your diet on hold go and enjoy BJ's."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this no stars. I have to say that I had the worst experience at this restaurant. First of all, I found it rude that we were asked about being a member of the rewards club before even being sat, that makes it seem that we get 2nd rate service before we even get a table. Then we sat down and our server, couldn't tell you his name came over and you can tell he was just trained, maybe 2 weeks ago- total corporate nonsense too! Anyways, he asked us what we wanted to drink and my husband got the \"red\"beer, I can't remember the name, but it was SOO basic. I just got a water and an iced tea, which neither were refilled, and the ice tea was almost $2.50!! My husband was actually never offered another beer or anything else to drink either. Then it came to our food, I am a picky eater and on a strict diet, so I was able to order a lunch option because everything else was pretty heavy. Well I order, and asked for my modifications, and I still ended up with the wrong dish.  My husband got a burger, which was just grease... no flavor, and once my food got straightened out their first response was to buy us dessert, which I can't eat- so they did take my food off the menu because it was wrong, but it was also not good, I left most of it behind and so did my husband. So our bill was about 20 bucks and we still ended up stopping off at another restaurant so I could get a side of veggies and a salad and he could another beer!!! I would NOT recommend this place to anyone and I can tell you our friends and I frequent new fun places... this is not going to be one of them! Good luck but you lost a big group of avid drinkers and a big family who loves to go out to eat!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 30 people for lunch. The restaurant and staff were very accommodating - plenty of room for us and service was outstanding!  Brian and Woody were our servers and they were friendly and responsive. They split bills by family for us, our orders came out correct , and drinks were refilled fast!  This BJ's delivered exceptional service and we would definitely come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Always tasty food at BJ's. Can be at bit slow but overall a great place for a meal."}
{"text":"Where do I begin??? Reserved a TABLE for 5. They took us to booth. When I explained I asked for TABLE in reservations we were given a TABLE for 4. Waited forever for drinks. Cannot get refills on cranberry juice. 45 minutes and still no food. They have horrible customer service. Do not waste your money go to the Hub where you get excellent service and food. Do not waste time or money at this place"}
{"text":"I dont think I will go back there for food anymore. This is my second time to get overcooked food with poor service waitress,"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Service was prompt and the food was excellent. Very accommodating with substitutions for our \"Paleo\" requests. Definitely one of our \"go to\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Atmosphere is casual. Beer selection was limited. I consider it a decent place for bite but, nothing memorable. They do have a wide selection of entrees if you have a large hard to please group."}
{"text":"I ordered a BJ's classic pizza and the food was fantastic. The server and hostess was curteous and helped us with every question on the menus. Free parking and a relaxing atmosphere  makes this the place to be!"}
{"text":"Had a 60th birthday party for 15 people.   Our server, Dillon, did an excellent job on our order - drinks were kept full, appetizers all came out at the same time, even our entrees all came out together and were excellent.   Dillon was very attentive and gave great suggestions.   We highly recommend taking your large get together to BJs."}
{"text":"Don't order take out.  Takes as long as eat in. Order was wrong, salad was hot and hot food was cold. Bill was wrong,  take out service is slow. Don't bother."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. Food is really good. I love their seasonal stuff. I've always received exceptional service, even a few times when I've had my young baby with me. I've found a lot of places treat me poorly when I have my child with me, but never here! Will continue to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Good beer and good pizza.  The new goliath ale is very good.  Kids like the mashed potatoes.   Always busy"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have something new in the north hills! The food is always great. I try something new every time I come in. Sometimes the wait is a little crazy but that's not exactly a bad thing, for them at least. The berry cider and the cookie desert, omg! One of fave places!"}
{"text":"Service just ok.  Food was only 3 star, I could have made the California Burger much better myself at home.  Had to ask for my beer twice but it was good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Service was great, my waitress, not sure her name, bc they don't wear name tags or say there name. I'm ok with that. She was nice, honest about her favorites. The restaurant was steady, my drink was refilled regularly without having to ask. Food was good just has potato skins.  Sitting by yourself at a restaurant is not always fun. But my waitress was friendly and I felt comfortable."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I've always been satisfied. 
only 1 time has my food come out wrong and the manager was very apologetic and and had the right dish out in no time. You can't go wrong with the flat bread pizza!"}
{"text":"Yea the food was really good. We ordered many chicken dishes and deep dish pizza too. And ambience was also so nice. But 1 thing I noticed which is not major is the crowd and noise. I felt little discomfort while having a chat with my family. Other than that rest all was superb."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more...I really do.  Unfortunately, the execution just isn't there.
BJ's has an excellent variety of food and beverages.  The food ranges from average to good, with everything leaning on the expensive side.  If I were to review based solely on food and beverage, they would probably get a 3.5- to 4-star rating.  
The problem starts and stops with the service.  I understand the place is popular, busy during non-peak times and a downright unbearable wait during prime time, but the fact that they have such a constant stream of patrons makes the lack of execution in the kitchen even more unfathomable.  I am yet to have a meal here with over two entrees ordered where all the entrees came out at the same time.  I have waited as long as fifteen minutes between the first entree and last entree being served.  To me, that's unacceptable.  In addition, the wait staff seems to be rather hit or miss as to their general level of competency.  Nonetheless, I'm sure that I'll continue to wind up here every month or two. Sigh."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night and it was packed!! We used the BJ app. to get preferred seating but still waited about 35 minutes for a table. Our server was Matt and he was awesome!!! Gave our table a lot of attention and kept the drinks coming!! Food was great an everyone in our party enjoyed their meals. Reasonably priced and we can't wait to go back!! Great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"From what I could tell this restaurant is amazing. I chose a Cheese Burger with the Steak Fries and the Brewhouse Porter Beer. All that is left to say about this place is the food is great and the Beer amazing!"}
{"text":"The food has always been great, but the service not so good. Took both my 80 year old grandmothers out for dinner. I called ahead to so call make a reservation only to find out there really is no such thing. Called a half hour ahead of time, got to the place and had to wait another 45min. The hostess was rude, along with the managers. I asked for a seat to wait for my grandmother because she can't stand for a long time, only to be told yea if you can find one. I've loved both this location and the one in canton. Don't know if I'll be going back after such a horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and sat in the bar area. Dan was our server . He was so funny, friendly, helpful and happy to be our server which is so nice to see now a days. I had the caprese piadina which was really good and my husband had the lunch chicken breast with mash potatoes which he loved. So nice to be at a place where people don't hate their jobs and if they do ... no one is showing it. Lol  Great people and Food! Oh I forgot to mention the Salted Caramel Pizookie! So good!"}
{"text":"Just got home from BJ's.  Our dinner experience started bad when the hostess sat our party of 6 people in a booth make for 5 people.  We arrived at the Restaurant at 7:50 and didn't get our food until about 8:50 and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  When our food finally arrived we didn't have any utensils to eat with. We has to ask two different people before getting them.  Overall our experience was very poor and we will not be going back to this particular BJ's."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good and the 1/2 pound burger with fried jalepeno slices is really, really good.  Huge beer selection, including their own brew.  It's a nice place inside and our server was one of the best we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving three stars is because of the food, which was amazing, but the service really took away from the overall experience. I understand that establishments are weary to serve teenagers, but that's no reason to be treated like we're below the status of a regular customer. Every time our server spoke to us, I felt like we were being scoffed at. Not every teenager tips just below the minimum, so if that was the reason why the service was horrible, you won't be seeing me or my family here anytime soon. My party isn't stupid, we know the norms of tipping and dining out. I was excited to bring my foreign exchange student here to enjoy the highly regarded burgers, but the embarrassment my whole party experienced overshadowed it all. the waiter actually had the guts to scream at her because she couldn't hear him when he brought all the food to our table. first of all, the place is always filled with people, resulting in a volume problem. Second, she doesn't speak good English! we seriously had to endure him directly shouting at her and giving us attitude when she didn't speak up saying it wasn't her food, even going as far as to say \"you need to speak up next time.\" I haven't even stopped laughing because, really, this will be the last time me and my party will dine here after this experience. Bj's should know not every patron is the same, so why were we treated like every other  teenager who dines out? pathetic."}
{"text":"Don't order the pulled pork burger. Poor quality pork, fatty and with mysterious looking pieces of pork. The quality of the meal was poor. Meal was free after complaint."}
{"text":"Paula from Staten Island was our server and took care of us . She was a pleasure to talk to and made the night more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We came here at an off time - maybe 3-4 in the afternoon and the restaurant was not super busy. We were seated right away, but then we waited and waited...the tables around us were filled, but waitress after waitress passed us by. There was no acknowledgement we were even there, much less a drink order or anything. After about 10-15 minutes of just sitting there, we decided to just leave. No one even noticed.

I also noticed a lot of the waitstaff just standing around. There was a Pirates game on and they seemed more interested in that."}
{"text":"Sort of a mixed bag with this visit.  We ordered a Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread Pizza (excellent and just the right amount of food), a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich (sandwich was pretty good, but I didn't much care for the fries), and a Chicken Quesadilla (overly spicy in a brassy way).  The service was great at the start.  But, by the end, the restaurant had filled up and we had to wait a bit just to get our bill.  Still, overall, a very good meal."}
{"text":"As a whole I like BJ's Brewhouse.  I just didn't much care for my experience at this one.  My daughter and I (She's the LV resident) went in for lunch and took a booth in the bar.  Since I am somewhat a regular at my local BJs I already knew what I wanted.  The California Burger and a Blue Moon.  Our server tries to talk me out of my beer choice because he thought down selling was going to be a wise choice.  When I told him he could not get me to change my mind, he kept trying to do it.  This marks the first time he irritated me.  We place orders and it took almost 15 minutes for the appetizer to come out and this only after my daughter looked at her watch then looked at him (no, they were not busy.) This was our second irritation. The whole time we are waiting for our food, our tool of a server was standing at the end of the bar talking with the bartender.  This guy did not care about appearances and to me it was disrespectful to just be seen hanging out. Now I am getting pissed.  Fast forward now...food comes out, granted they are still not busy, us and maybe one other table in the bar.  My sandwich and fries come out, the fries are barely warm and bottom of my sandwich is soggy.  Probably because our server left it sitting too long while he was yapping with the bartender.  I am giving the restaurant 3 stars because I do still like the place.  Our server, in my opinion deserves negative stars.  I will not name our server, but the management should start watching what goes on in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok read my tip .. And my review is the establishment has to be watched as double charging is not tolerated and we all work hard for our money. Not only was the boneless chicken wings under par but mC Donald's does it better and for only 4.99 for 20 .. So to tally 1 dinner and 1 sent back and 3 drinks cost us 89.$ later ! This is not the first time we have been over charges after leaving this restaurant .. Beware!!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter to lunch who loves BJ's broccoli cheddar soup. She order it and it was delivered to the table with a small clothing label in it. I called it out to our waiter and he apologized and brought her a new bowl. What I liked best was that the manager came over immediately and also apologized for the inconvenience. She also bought our lunch for us which wasn't necessary but to me the was outstanding customer service which will definitely bring us back. Great manager and waiter during this visit."}
{"text":"When is it ok for a bartender to say \"hold on second\" because she is having important conversations w other customers on what beers She doesn't like? Excuse me but since when a customer wants to pay the bill and the bartender says \"hold on second\" with an irritated voice? Impolite and arrogant attitude in customer service brings down anyone who wants to go out. Bj- you are out of my list to go."}
{"text":"We've tried this place twice and have been very disappointed both times. The food and service are both very bad. The first time my order was completely  messed up. The second time I received a soggy salad drowned in dressing sk bad I couldn't eat it. Each time we waited an incredibly long time for what we ordered. The only redeeming  factor was that the manager handled things well and apologized appropriately. I won't be back. If I want good beer I can go elsewhere. If I want edible food I can go anywhere."}
{"text":"We like the food there but the front end service is getting worse and worse with each visit.  They offer the opportunity to put our names on the list online to save us time once we get there.  When I do this I always put in a note that we are a party of 6, 4 adults 2 kids and we need 1 high chair.  On our most recent visit  we were told the wait would be 25 more minutes, after 25 minutes it was \"oh, the booth we had for you cannot handle the high chair....so it will be another 20 minutes.  Ummmm, why didn't you look at my note in the first place??  The place is always busy, always packed and you end up tripping on people who are waiting. The front end staff just seems useless and clueless.  Once we were seated we had to ask twice for silverware.  \"I will try and find you some\".  You are a restaurant, you don't have silverware?  It was really nice of you to give the kids \"appetizers\" while we waited for silverware and to order but without silverware it is hard for them to eat..... The only reason we did not just walk away was I had a gift certificate to use up.  Even with their promos I am going to be hard pressed to go back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food. Especially loved their veggie options. The sriracha Brussel sprouts are not to be missed; give them a try even if you don't like normally go for them. Beer was ok, in house sodas great."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribeye, which was over cooked, and my companion ordered a half a rack of ribs, which were burnt. We told the server they were burned so bad you can clearly see it. She doesn't even stop walking says oh you don't like them, let me put another order,  and never came back. Very disappointed.  I will not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Significant improvement in the service upon our most recent visit. Glad we gave BJ's another try. Hope this continues."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at BJ's for several years and had pretty much everything on the menu. It's a really good place for lunch and dinner. Great drinks at the bar too."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment. Friendly staff

Take out service is excellent. Only stopped in for a few beers while waiting for a Togo pickup 

Nice to see the variety of beers even by the bottle. Found gulden Draak and Chimay blue! Friendly staff and quick service. 

Food was delicious, not over the top but a darn good veggie jalapeño burger with some amazing fries"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my wife after our flight into town. Overall this was a good choice for a late night dinner.

Service:
The server was very nice and informative. We asked for more than just restaurant stuff (things to do, places to go...etc). Waiter was thoughtful enough to think about the question and come back with a response vs. rambling off whatever popped into mind. 

Food:
Queso verde was good. Had a nice bite to it. The server (with disclaimer that he has never been to Chicago) suggested the Californian-Chicago style pizza. We were hungry so it filled a void, but I would never call it Chicago style. It had a puffy crust (comparably to Pizza Hut) which was cooked well. The sausage looked and tasted more like dominoes pizza. Roasted red peppers were tasty, but not able to redeem. Overall not a fan. 

Beer was good. Ended up with the crazy brewnette. Good brown."}
{"text":"Will update review ASAP but 2 times previous the pizza and salad I have been very disappointed.
Why?? I have been to several BJS all good deep dish. 
This place has not proofing pizza correctly.
Flat flavor... Over and over. 
I will try again seriously hope for better."}
{"text":"Fettuccine Alfredo beyond belief dry and tasteless.  Grilled chicken dry and tasteless.  Prices way too high for quality of food. Beer was good though. Can't understand how this place is so busy.  Much better options available with local businesses. Avoid this chain."}
{"text":"WAITED! 40mins for a simple mini deep dish & a bacon cheeseburger. The server that brought our food WAS NOT gracious or hospitable, she was so abrupt & discourteous that I felt like a dog or farm animal receiving slops. She never asked if there was anything else that we needed or wanted, she just clanked my plate down w/ what seemed like a pizza from PIZZAHUT & my husbands cold burger w/ fries & quickly turned away. By then, my appetite quickly disappeared & we left. So, if you want to be treated poorly & pay for it w/ your time & money, then I strongly recommend this place for you."}
{"text":"Have gone several times. Today was the final visit. Advised the server that I have some dietary needs. He assured me it would be find. Ordered the Sirloin Steak med, it came out rare and cold, ordered a baked potato that came out the color of a brown paper bag, it had to be several days old, it was replaced with another one only a day old (Yuk), ordered the Roasted Brussel sprouts with no seasoning, they came out with some nasty seasoning and undercooked. Service was mediocre, the food was terrible. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome desserts , wide variety , decent price!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is appalling. First time we came her service and food were great. Second time was horrible. Service got worse and worse and we waited 40 minutes for our dessert. After saying something to the manager who delivered our dessert, she gave us a $15 gift card and begged us to come back. We did and the service was bad yet again. These servers seem to disappear for long periods of time almost like they are on break or something. We came one last time today and it is our last time. Our waiter took a while to greet us. We then ordered drinks and an appetizer. Waiter returned with our water and said our drinks would be right up. He then disappeared. Another waiter approached us after 10 minutes or so and asked if our waiter had taken our order. We said just our app and he took our order. He then tracked down our waiter who had completely disappeared. The manager finally brought our drinks from the bar. Another person brought our appetizer. Waiter came by to check on us while we were waiting forever for our entrees and said nothing about when our food would be ready.  Someone else delivered our food and my pasta got cold looking for our server to come by so I could ask for more sauce, parmesan cheese, and fresh pepper. I finally flagged down the waiter that took our order.  Someone else brought the items.  It took forever to get our check and refills on our water from our actual waiter. It s too bad they can't get their act together. There is a great need for good restaurants in the Northwest. Guess we will have to wait for a new one to open. Will not return to BJ's."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, food has always been good, service has always been decent or better and they have some good beers. I'd definitely never complain about going back."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick beer monday to see if they'd worked the kinks out.  The Platform Brewery tap handle doesn't say what beer it is so I asked the blonde bartender. She replied, \"I don't know, I don't drink this stuff. I drink miller light bottles.\"    That was it....   pathetic."}
{"text":"Wait time was off by 25 minutes, but the manager did come to the table and apologize.  She also gave us a free appetizer.  I'd say that made up for the inconvenience and it was nice to know that the manager was aware of the issue.  Food was good, service was good.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"The steak was med I asked for med rare...it happens but I did let them know and the front of the house manager came out gave me extra mash which is surprisingly yummy with the black pepper gravy and ordered me another steak...med rare . we all have our chef egos but it's so nice to know that there are still people in the industry humble enough to redo something that others wouldn't flinch over . good job BJ's great customer service. 4 stars for service."}
{"text":"My family loves the food and drink here and we usually dine there about twice a year. My husband enjoys the craft beer and there is never any complaint about the food. However, the service in the dinning room is always painfully slow. It takes so long to get a drink refill or find your server when you need them for something."}
{"text":"Awful! Bacon cheeseburger was missing bacon and cheese. It took 15 minutes to fix. Chicken Alfredo was cardboard with noodles that had 1 tablespoon of something that looks like curdled milk."}
{"text":"Our server was great 
Our food was super slow.  Appetizers took an hour but we are a big party we were patiently waiting 
We had a problem with one of the plates and the manager came out to spoon out plate to make sure what we said was missing wasn't on the plate 
He mentioned how weird it was when he had just had it and didn't have a problem. 
I have neverrrrr seen anyone do anything like that. That was so disrespectful, rude, tasteless and no customer service at ALL! 

Were we treated this way because we are minorities? 
Not sure but felt so disrespected. 

We will make sure not to ever come back to another BJ's again.  



UPDATE BJS IN LAS VEGAS
May 2016

We received a gift card from bjs and decided to give it another try.  It was great. The waitress was super nice. This time around it was inly two of us vs 15.   Our food dis take for ever to come but it wasnt bad. My pizza was not very hot but it wasnt bad.  My husbands food was good along with the dessert he got."}
{"text":"Went here after a day at a nearby museum and the food definitely was more than I expected.  The waiter gave me a second soda drink without me asking and asked me if wanted a third, which I declined.  The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing and more than I expected and wish I had a place like this to go home to!"}
{"text":"Great service and now prime rib!  This was a fantastic dinner that I was not expecting. 
First time having more than lunch, service from Kyle was excellent you must try his expertise as he sold this dinner."}
{"text":"My husband an I go to BJ's in several places both in California and Las Vegas. The food is very good but my comment is on the service. The server we request is Keshia very nice to my grandsons, very considerate. She is one of our reasons for going all the way to this BJ''s rather than a closer restaurant or eating in our hotel. Also I didn't get her name but the manager was very accommodating when we made a request! I could definitely tell customer service is a priority at this restaurant.  A lot of places have good food but really good service will make you drive a little farther or wait a little longer, a well placed smile and welcoming service keep you coming back. Keisha makes this a welcoming place for us."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff is super friendly and the food is always good. I especially enjoy the bar area with all of the TVs for enjoying the games. I don't know the Manager's name but he was super helpful when we wanted to celebrate a friend's birthday."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate some bdays for my family members. my sis is trying to be healthier and I made her a beautiful fruit and yogurt bday cake. our server was awesome and he put in their fridge for us. great food and prices"}
{"text":"BJ's is a pretty great place.  It's a chain, but don't let that turn you off.  They have a large, delicious menu, and a selection of both on-site brewed, locally-brewed, and general beers.  It's got a nice atmosphere, so would be suitable for a business lunch, date, or just a trip with friends.

This location is in a plaza with a large mall, theater, and a ton of other places, so it's a great place to go, have a couple brews, and then do some shopping or see a movie!"}
{"text":"Starting with the good: Their version of Christmas Ale alongside their Hickory Brisket Burger was awesome.  Now the bad:  the span between our 3 entrées was nearly 15 minutes each.  My meal came out second. It was only THEN that a manager informed us that the seared Ahi tuna salad was unpopular and they didn't have any.  Hello: that information would have been good 30 minutes prior and NOT when another entrée was brought out.  He offered another type of Ahi tuna that would taste the same just not cut the same.  Not even close,  more like soggy seasoned chicken you would find in soup.  They did take the Ahi off the bill.  We likely won't return but try it and maybe your experience will be better."}
{"text":"Ok...so I waited for 4 visits to this place before finally giving it this bad review...what can I say, I WANTED so badly to give this place a chance, but they've failed with each and every visit. Why did I keep going back? Reading their menu, I get enticed (although I usually end up let down) AND it is literally located about a block away from my home...so convenience. ANYWAY...its the service mainly that gave is making me give this place 2 stars...horriblly horribly SLOW, and just plain terrible. EVERY time I've been here...so I give up on this place. 

Also, with tthis most recent visit...the first time I can say the food was just plain BAD. I ordered a  \"honey cripy chicken salad\" or something...okay, there was NOTHING honey about the chicken (breading or what not)...it was just some plain old chicken tenders...and the salad was really watery, so when they mixed in the dressing for the chopped salad...it had no flavor whatsoever....of course when I asked for a side of dressing after experiencing that I had to WAIT (see above)....ugh, I just plain give up on this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best Brewery in Town.  Great Beer, Great Food, Great Service!  We had the Pizza Deal thay have and The Portabello Mushroom Pizza was to die for.......so juicy and yummy!   My boyfriend had the Cheeseburger Pizza, which he loved - I'm not a huge fan,  I pefer a cheeseburger if I'm in thw mood.  However, there is something for everybody there, and a wide variety of beers!  Thank you BJ's for a special night out with my man"}
{"text":"It's like any other BJ's, it's fine, just not spectacular. Lunchtimes were always slammed and food took forever."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Good service, even when busy.  Their own microbrews.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of this place always way to loud really greasy food and unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested by several people so I thought we would finally give it a try.  We went to the one located on Eastern and I-215.  We were seated within 5 minutes after arriving.  We ordered Avocado Eggs Rolls and Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  I really liked the Avocado Eggs Rolls and the others loved the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  The Entrée's that were ordered were Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Fish Tacos and an Angus Burger. The Fish Taco plate came with (2) Fish Taco's.  I only ate (1) taco and I couldn't taste the fish.  My husband ate the other Taco and loved it. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good but could have been better if there was more of the special sauce over the whole meal instead of on just a portion of it.  The Angus Burger was a little dry and the menu said it came with Thousand Island Sauce, but that sauce was missing from the Burger.  The Pomegranate Margarita's were delicious.  I will try this restaurant one more time to check out the Pizza.  Our toal bill was $71.00."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest for a flavorful, texture-rich, full-bodied salad. The last one I really enjoyed was the Santa Fe Chicken Salad at the BJ's in Mesa. So, today I went to the Chandler restaurant for a work lunch in hopes of  satisfying the craving. Work hours meant no beer...maybe that's why I didn't inhale this one as fast. It was still good. I'd order it again. I'd also order the Pizookie made with  peanut butter cookie. That devilish little treat (that I shared, btw) got me on a new PB craving. Ugh.

The salad was $10.95, and came with well-seasoned chicken (minor kick), corn, avocado, tomatoes, red onions, tortilla strips and a good dressing."}
{"text":"Pretty good. My bf loves the lunch menu here. The seating isn't my favorite it's much too open for my taste. Even after they changed it from the time they opened. The menu is ginormous! So I think most of the food is pre made and frozen! The last experience for me wasn't the best. The waiter told me that my flat bread that I ordered wouldn't have bacon on it (the description of the item on the menu did not mention bacon) however as soon as he puts the food down on the table it is almost completely covered in bacon! So I asked him what it was and he apologized and then just took the food bank. Maybe he was nervous for making a mistake but he didn't even ask if I'd like something else instead. So I sat there foodless and unhappy! The hostess walked by and I mentioned this to her and then the manager appeared at our table trying to correct the situation. I did appreciate his efforts. But I didn't eat anything. I was over eating."}
{"text":"I am mainly pleased with B.J's Restaurant. The food is sometimes too greasy, but everything else is great!"}
{"text":"good service, OK food, feels like another america food place...nothing special. Asked for a M burger and got well done. hate it when it happens."}
{"text":"Love Happy Hour at the bar with great beer/cocktails, heavy apps and super service.  Look forward to special events coming up after the holidays!"}
{"text":"Bar food style place ... Good service. Note to self: return for the Avocado Rolls, skip the other 3 items in the 4 item appetizer sampler. Pizza is OK, but Chicago deep dish is not my favorite style. Menu is so extensive, I'll have to go back a few times to figure out what I like."}
{"text":"Just had the Bison Burger and the Margarita Pizza, I have to saw wow delicious, healthy and light. Also had 2 different beers this place specializes in any beer you can think of. I will be back very soon and will recommend. Across the street from the Red Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"Good quality food & nice staff, our server SAM, rocks! She was attentive, kind, and full of knowledge about the food and refreshments. 
Try the Oktoberfest beer! Then make sure to have dessert--they can make the desserts in a smaller portion size. Mall parking, nice location and comfy and cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We tried to go there one evening a few weeks ago, and there was a 3 hour wait for a table. Yesterday, I had customers in town and tried to go for lunch. We were seated immediately (as the restaurant was not full), and then were forgotten/ignored by the waiters for more than 20 minutes. Not even water or silverware was delivered. The wait staff seemed to deliberately avoid looking in our direction as they walked past. 
We flagged down a bus boy who seemed rather surprised that we should ask for a waiter. After a further 5 minutes, we left, again without a server coming to our table. As we left, the server and manager tried to intercept us but my customers had already left. After two attempts to try BJs, I doubt that there will be a third. Long wait times to get seated or being ignored after being seated do not seem to be a good indicator. 
As a general note, the parking situation is terrible at McCandless Crossing. Hopefully it will improve once the construction is finished."}
{"text":"Although the happy hour isn't great (used to be better; now only $1 off draft beers and 1/2 off flatbreads) I love going to the bar and having an early dinner. It tends to get quite busy during the dinner rush so I recommend. Food is okay but the service has always been a delightful experience. I always sit at the bar seating however. Nice spacious restaurant and I highly recommend the mini pizookies (great for one!)"}
{"text":"Move over Pizza Hut! BJ's has you pinned for their pan pizza! If you like Pizza Hut and like their Pan Pizzas then you'll definitely love BJ's Favorite Pizza! Their pizza in my opinion tastes better! mmmmmm! It's a pan pizza with all the fixin's Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and fresh Roma tomatoes. This pizza is so yummy!  It's nice they have different sizes you can order...mini size, small, medium & large of coarse. This way it suites your hunger and how many will be eating it!  I like it cuz sometimes I just want a taste and I can order the mini! ... I also like their chicken wings too! Luv it! gotta try it!"}
{"text":"I went into Bj's on my lunch brake this past Thursday and first off service was not great at all we waited a very long times for our soup and salads then it takes forever to get the dessert we ordered and then I was checking my bank account today as I always do making sure that all charges are accounted for and correct and I see 2 charges for the same thing at Bj's so in other words they some how managed to run my card twice this is not my first run in with this restaurant about 8 months ago I was at a Bj's and left a $10.00 tip on my card and same thing the next day was checking statements and there was an extra 90 dollars added to that tip I called and the manager said the server must have accidentally typed too many 0's so it took over a week to get that back and now this which is a smaller charge but still a inconvenience none the less and when I called the manager about this one that just happened all she said was that she is not sure what happened and that the one of the double charges was credited right back after they did it which would mean that he knew he ran my card twice somehow and never bothered to tell me it while I was there very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"I always come to this location because the food is always great, beer is always cold, and service is always perfect!!"}
{"text":"Only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 is because they can be a bit slow. But I keep going back because I love their food!

Great kids meals - and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - so good. I've turned several people on to it.

They have a new rewards program but seems to be a bit bumbly - the hostesses and servers seem to get disconnected handling it - but if you remind the server when they give you the check it usually gets resolved."}
{"text":"Very good, flatbread is very good. Google has calorie information online, and soon on the menu. The location is usually very loud, unless being in the backnroom. Make sure to order a pizooki."}
{"text":"Love the food but the wait was a little long but well well worth it. The service was good to especially for a bust Friday night. Thanks"}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite to eat and a cocktail...20 minutes to acknowledge us after we were seated! !! Drinks and food are good but service is lacking! !!"}
{"text":"Two hour wait to be seated.  Yes, the place is new but the Mgmt needs to get their act together if they want people to come back. Not impressed."}
{"text":"When a local bar charges you $9.75 for a Framboise Lambic on tap (12oz), I don't even want to give it 1 star. They have great food, but this is a travesty. This is not the Strip. I am a local! Beers on tap should never cost more than $5 in my opinion. Guess Ellis Island will see me more often now as they care more about their locals with $1.75 beers. The owners of BJ's sure don't care!"}
{"text":"As always the pizookie is delicious! We had the s'mores pb one was awesome!the salmon dish I had on the lighter menu was yum but the faux couscous was over salted and the newer waitress shorted me in change that night but , overall things got worked out and the food and atmosphere are wonderful! We brought two girls under 9 which I would not do again til they are a bit less bouncy! Better for a date night than family dinner- just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Had an ok experience here. It was packed at six thirty on a Tuesday night, so beware. Service was poor. We ordered an appetizer and never got it. Plus, it took forever to get our drinks and entrees. I had a beer sampler, which was really good and a lot of beer for the price. A great value, I would definitely recommend it! The pumpkin beer is one of the worst I've ever had - flat and watery. I had the ahi tuna salad for dinner; at $14 I  was really disappointed in the size. I few pieces of ahi and about the same amount of lettuce you'd get with a side salad. Friends ordered the small pizzas and were pleased."}
{"text":"Every BJ's employee we have encountered this evening has made us feel as if we were putting them out. From the receptionist (Hailey?) who was curt and not friendly when we called for seat-ahead to the waitress who was not happy when we asked to order beers from the happy hour menu - which we were seated in time for. We are not rude or demanding but but we sure felt disrespected."}
{"text":"busy friday night, was seated in 15 minutes at a nice table. great service. food was delicious. ate family style with shrimp scampi (excellent) and bj favorite deep dish pizza. prices are reasonable, food is great, we love this place!"}
{"text":"***** Service: Our server was great. I wish I could remember his name - he is a young Hispanic kid with a faux-hawk. Seriously, excellent server.

**** Kids: The menu is great, with several options for kids. All kids items are $5.99, which includes a main dish, side dish, and a drink.  The only problem I found is that if you have a child who needs a high-chair your wait will be longer because of the lack of tables - their booths are not designed to have a high-chair on the outside.

* Food: It is just not very good. My wife got the jalapeno burger and was not impressed, which is saying a lot because she is not very picky when it comes to burgers. I got the Cajun pasta with shrimp and, while the flavor was okay, the pasta was terrible.  At least half of the noodles were stuck together in groups of 2,3,4 and more! Obviously, this makes for some crunchy, impossible-to-eat pasta.  How hard is it to cook fettuccine noodles? It was like someone stuck them in a too-small pot and just left them there for 6-8 minutes and then tossed them on a plate.

Conclusion: Unless you are just looking for a place to get a drink and watch a game, go elsewhere.  There are probably 20 other restaurants within a 2-minute walk of this place, most of which will be a better food experience."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.We came in on an off time. It was about 3:30 pm. We were immediately seated and a few seconds later our waitress took our drink order, which came out almost immediately. 
Dirty Martini and a skinny Cosmo, both were so delicious!
We had explained to our waitress that we were in no hurry. We sat for a good 20 min talking, with the waitress stopping periodically to see if we were ready to order. We finally ordered and our food came out quickly. Asian chicken salad and bison burger. YUMMO!
I enjoyed having a great server who allowed us to pace the meal. She did not hover around rushing us. It was lovely! She got a great tip for her patience with us!
My new fav spot!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and ordered a sandwich with a veggie patty and no bacon. The sandwich came with bacon but luckily I saw the bacon before taking a bite. The manager offered a salad or soup while I waited for my replacement sandwich to be made which I did not want. This was the only accommodation offered. The replacement sandwich took forever to receive which resulted in me pretty much eating by myself since everyone else's food was gone by then. On my last bite of sandwich, I saw a small piece of food that I did not recognize but went ahead and ate the bite. I am certain it was a small piece of bacon fat. In addition to this, I ordered a beverage and had to flag down the waiter to get it because he had forgotten. This level of service is totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"We go to this location often.  The food is always good and service has always been a great experience.  Additionally, we usually bring by 3 year old son with us, and the servers are always so nice and sweet to him."}
{"text":"I've not been to BJ's in a while, and I'm not sure why I stayed away. I just had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and loved them.  I'm going back."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in vegas, but it's been over 7 years since I last went to a BJs. I was happy with the food and everything. I have to give 4 stars as a heads up to the restaurant though. On Sunday, the computers went down and the whole restaurant had an air of fustercluck to it. The floors were slippery (two elementary aged girls were holding hands and walking like they were in a skating rink with no blades; it was actually pretty cute), the bathrooms were a mess, and there was a lot of scrambling around on the floor. I feel like more could have been done by management to address the issue. The waiter, Ricardo maybe? had a beard but no mustache if that helps, was obviously experienced. I worked in a restaurant for a couple of years in vegas. I bet anything this guy has been working in restaurants for years and not just BJs. Do come here if you like deep dish pizza and pan-baked cookies with ice cream. I'm taking to you fatty! ;)

Seriously, it's good stuff. In terms of the powers that be: do a little more for the customer from the management side of things when things go awry. Have a game plan."}
{"text":"Food was really good but got skipped in line and ended up waiting nearly an hour to be seated. Hostess only calls name out once and it can be really hard to hear especially on a busy day."}
{"text":"Food was good but the 1 star is for the service.  Horrible service from the hostess to the waitress. We ate our food as quick as we could so we could leave. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I've eaten at BJ's a few times before but when I went there for lunch a few days ago I was surprised at how much I enjoyed on of their lunch specials.  I ordered their parmesan crusted chicken sandwich and LOVED it.  This is not something that I would typically order and I was so pleasantly surprised.  Although the food was awesome, our server was less than average.  She seemed as though she would rather be anywhere besides waiting on our table and I really didn't appreciate it.  She didn't bring out any of our food and never checked up on us until we were done with our meal.  The restaurant was not busy at all so that wasn't an excuse.  Besides her poor attitude, I would totally recommend this place, especially that sandwich."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery (a bacon cheeseburger) off of GrubHub. I specifically asked for a well done burger, and in the comments I wrote verbatim \"please cook very well done, no pink!\" I received a medium rare burger with burnt bacon. If you want an accurate order, save yourself the headache and order from someplace else!"}
{"text":"this was our first time here and it was quite enjoyable.  Our waitress, Kim, was super nice and attentive.  she also helped us sign up for the app so we can get points and offers. 

We went for lunch and ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken sandwich with ham and bacon.  Both were very good.

We had a couple of pints of Guineas which was perfectly poured and temperatures.

we plan to go again and try some of the house beers."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! I love dining here! I think their caesar salad is one of the best I've ever had in town. Their craft brews are on the hoppy side so if you are not into serious great tasting beer I'd suggest you stick to the mass-produced watered down beer for your drinking pleasure. Oh and there are plenty of televisions for sporting events."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food & great beer. The staff \" Alec S \" server rocked it. Knowledgeable about the menu & house beers. This is also a good family friendly environment. My go to for a good prime rib & top shelf craft beer lineup."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a promising menu. I was disappointed by some of their beer they made, it tasted like water. Also the pizza was small and overpriced. I'll give it another chance but not that great."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and what amazing service! I loved the flatbread pizzas you can't get any better! My wife and me shared a French dip and I've never had better. The horseradish sauce was really mild but that's why it was so good! I would deff recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal! It's good for family or friends"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place. The service is always great and the food....... delicious! My favorite place to pop in and enjoy and meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing seared ahi salad with a Jeremiah red. I will be asking for my server Justin P. again. I came in by myself and he made my time there awesome. Felt like royalty. Think I found my new favorite beer too."}
{"text":"Love the food and the beer what more is there to say. Oh yea, the pizza is real good but kinda pricey if you get a lot of toppings."}
{"text":"Second time at this location and was completely let down. Took about 20 minutes to get seated which isn't bad for a Friday night. I believe the manager was the one who seated us which made me think the service would be great for the night. Unfortunately our waiter didn't come to the table for a good 10 minutes. He took our drink & appetizer orders and left quickly. When our appetizers were brought to the table it was by a different waiter. We finished our appetizers and even cleaned up and stacked our plates, our original waiter filled our drinks and still never took away the empty plates. When it came to our main course order he didn't even bother writing it down and as expected a dish was forgotten and the kitchen was blamed. Our main course meals were brought out again by a different waiter. 

This guy seemed like he didn't even want to be at work tonight. If that's the case, clock out and let someone else tend to the customers. 

Food was okay tonight, maybe it was the mood we were put in that ruined it for us."}
{"text":"First off any place with the name BJ's gets an automatic extra star for obvious reasons hahaha. Otherwise this place would be getting a solid 3 stars. I like the location as compared to the other BJ's restaurants. Plenty of things to do in that shopping plaza; movie theater, stores, other bars etc. 

Their beers are my main reason for spending my money there, not exactly a brewery but they serve their own craft beers which are excellent for a chain establishment, what always surprises me is all the craft beers from breweries they have on tap. Either way you can't go wrong having a pint or pitcher from there. 

Food is definitely unique lots of different pizzas and burgers to choose from, pick one along with a beer and you're good. The staff there is pretty much on top of their game so feel free to ask what would go well with whatever you're drinking."}
{"text":"Lite tacos were actually pitas. Tasteless. My husband loves it as its a greasy food sports bar. But if I cant get a decent meal...even a basic salad or taco, they're dead to me."}
{"text":"Not a vegetarian but love fabulous veggie option..you must try the cauliflower pita tacos."}
{"text":"I have tried this location four times, with the most recent being Saturday July 11 at 10:30pm. 

They seem to be making small steps to improve their service. During my last visit the table runners appeared to have learned the table numbers because all food and drink brought to the table was correct. 

A few people have complained about the wait time. I have been there twice on Saturday evenings and each time I was told the wait would be 5 minutes and was seated before that time. My first visit was a Sunday afternoon and although I was seated promptly they got busy quickly, be prepared for a wait on Sunday afternoon. 

After being seated the waitress was prompt to take drink orders. However, the orders needed to be repeated due to how loud the background music was. They had the Cardinals vs Pirates game on the televisions and someone was raising and lowering the volume based on which team was at bat.

One area they need to improve on is kitchen communication. I have ordered their chicken potstickers twice, my first time and most recent visit. When the potstickers got to the table the chicken was cooked thoroughly, no pink, but was cold. The first time the potstickers came out then 2 minutes later my entree arrived, the most recent time my entree arrived before the appetizer.

For this trip when my entree, New Orleans Jambalaya, arrived cold. I have had jambalaya in New Orleans and the dish I had at BJ's lacked the flavor and spice that would be in a jambalaya in New Orleans.

The highlight for any trip to BJ's is their beverages. Their home made beers and soda's are tasty.

The first time I was there my waiter said they are like the Cheesecake Factory. After having been to BJ's four times and the Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count I disagree with what my first waiter said. The food and service at BJ's is well below the level that one gets at the Cheesecake Factory. If you are looking for a place to eat go the extra 3 miles down to the Cheesecake Factory. I won't be going back until September to give them time to improve."}
{"text":"Food sucked!!! Very bland!!! Plus service was very slow. We were there for 45min. Before we got any salad or meals. Shoulda known better than to eat at one of these corporate owned garbage places. What a waste of $100 !!!!"}
{"text":"Well, 4 stars for the half dozen times I've been here in the past, 0 stars for my most recent experience (6/28/16). I'll say we'll split the difference at 2. 

*Editors notes: I might have written the better part of a mark twain novel here, so I apologize.

8:30pm - walked in to the restaurant with my lady friend, greeted kindly by the hostess. \"Just going to sit at the bar, thanks\". 

8:31pm - sat at a pair of open seats at the 60% occupied bar. DIRECTLY in the middle. Easy enough. 

8:32pm - bartender, who is a slightly younger than middle aged woman, passes by my area, and without stopping, turns her head to say \"make sure to get your IDs out\"

Strange, I think, because even though I'm relatively young, my lady friend and I are both in our late 20's. Haven't been asked to order anything at this point, mind you. The tone of this premature ID request was a bit accusatory, prompting me to think, \"it's like a damn police state.\" \"Do I need an ID if I was ordering soda?\"

8:40 pm - \"do you know what you want?\"  \"Yes\" I reply. Lady friend orders, I order, \"piranha pale ale please\".  \"Have you had this before?\" \"Uh, yes?\" Strange question. She asks \"would you like to try it?\" \"No, I'll just order one\".

8:43pm- drinks arrive. \"May we also have a menu?\" \"Sure\". Menus are acquired.


9:00pm - (this is 15 minutes later) ready to order. Awkwardly opening my menu, closing my menu, placing my menu closer towards the bar, stacking both menus. Every common \"sign\" that a table is ready to order. Eye contact with bartender established, signs of hope, then hope is lost as I spend the next 10 minutes watching bartender pass back and forth, awkwardly avoiding eye contact.

9:10 - starting to get irritated. Aside from shouting at bartender vs. lighting myself on fire in protest, I can't seem to afford her attention. Getting too uncomfortable and awkward to order. We determine that unless we're acknowledged in 5 minutes, away we go.

9:20 - my 5 minutes turned to 10, I finally lean over the bar, and ask for the check. \"Sure\". Check arrives. I pay in exact change, leaving a $1 tips per drink. $2 in total extra on a $13.11 tab. We take our leave.

9:21 - I'm across the street, being seated at Burgatory, where I had a delightful experience before a 10:30 movie. I will be going to Burgatory from now on.

Moral of the story, I'm PAYING you for food and drink, don't make me work that damn hard for it. The food is standard American chain restaurant fare, although not bad by any means, not worth being unappreciated as a patron."}
{"text":"I came with my son on Mother's Day. It was very busy, but we didn't have to wait since it was just the two of us. It was our first time visiting this restaurant. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken. It was just ok. My son had the deep dish pizza. He thought it was good. It just needed a little more sauce. The reason for the four stars is primarily for the exceptional service we received. Our server, Matt was the best  server I've had in a very long time. Efficient, courteous, funny, and all-around amazing. That boy deserves a raise!! I will definitely go back and try something else on the menu. Hope we run into Matt!!"}
{"text":"I would normally have a picture of my food (chicken quinoa bowl) but I devoured it too fast. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The bartender was friendly and attentive even though she was busy. Great place!"}
{"text":"Sit at the bar....bartenders are great! Mahi tacos perfect."}
{"text":"This place has one of the largest menus I've seen in a while. To top it all off the food is pretty frickin' good. The burgers are better than many other chain restaurants I've tried. The pizza is surprisingly great. And the appetizers are good enough to make it a main meal."}
{"text":"It was ok at best. My husband and I have been there before and I should have just ordered a pizza because I know they are pretty delicious. We went with some friends and the 4 of us where sat by by a group of 20-25 people. Nothing a restaurant can do with loud groups but it would have been nice if they had made an effort to not cram a bunch of tables around a large party. Our friends and i felt like we had to yell and kept getting bumped into by the large party. Our server wasn't very attentive however there was a good runner you made sure we had refills. Back to the food...I ordered a burger which was ok. My problem is that the burger came out 10min after everyone else's food had hit the table. Server didn't come by to check if all food was ok. By the time I got my burger it was luke warm at best and my fries were cold. Knowing it was busy I ate what I could. Our server never came back to our table so as he was walking by I had to ask him for out check. He proceeded to go take another tables order ring that in and bring another table some drinks and then give us our check. I don't know if I'll be back maybe just order a pizza for take to avoid the mess of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast service and terrible food with mediocre beer. As an exercise in capitalism, BJ's is an interesting concept. As food and beverage, it is awful. Dry, over-cooked food service burgers and overly-bitter microbrews are the order of the day here. 

Skip this if you're looking for, well, anything. 

It was packed though, so maybe folks dig the ambiance of hundreds of people packed ass-to-elbows while being subjected to a 90s on 9 playlist."}
{"text":"I went in October and ordered Octoberfest only to be told they are sold out. I know this is going to sound small minded of me but aren't you a \"brewhouse?\" I got a regular brand beer and it was good. Food was great, salad fresh and waiter was very nice. I recently went back and had the same results, but no sold out beer which was nice. 
*BEWARE of the flooring. Both times I went with different groups and the floor has this slippery texture."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here tonight. I ordered a coffee and surprisingly they have a nice flavored coffee, was fresh. Went at night too, I thought it would be an old pot, but she said they make it fresh each time.

Ordered pizza which was great and an appetizer. It was really busy tonight but the service was still excellent. 

Last, we had the warm cookie and ice cream for desert. So amazing, you have to order this for sure. Perfect!! I liked it with my coffee, good combo."}
{"text":"We ate here again on Sunday night.  The food is always good.  The baked potatoes are a solid 2-3 lbs!"}
{"text":"The server seamed aloof. When we told him we are ready to order he walked off. We ordered the chocolate mint martini and the house red beer. Martini Was not good. Only tasted the alcohol. Our server complained about how hard they are to carry. The Fish and chips was over cooked and tasted of only oil. Had to ask for vinegar and the server gave us the salad oil and vinegar from another table. The server did not give condiments through the whole meal. The beer and pizza were good aside from the jalapeños that I didn't ask for yet found on my pizza. Definitely missed the mark."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner. BJ's restaurant great service and amazing time. My wife had the shrimp scampi pasta I have a lobster and steak was absolute fantastic and she highly suggest the cosmopolitans can't go wrong there"}
{"text":"So disappointed!!!  I used to love BJs restaurant.  Their food is no longer the great delicious quality that it used to be.  It was as if they received frozen prepared food in a box, microwaved it and served it.  Everything we ordered tasted stale or like a cheap thawed out frozen dinner.  Our waiter offered no resolution whatsoever and had a \"so sad too bad\" attitude stating that corporate changed some of their recipes and they had no control over it.  He also charged us full price for everything even though we ordered happy hour specials. We had to remind him that it was happy hour.  Never going back."}
{"text":"We eat here semi-often as we live almost walking distance. Food is always good, service has always been great. The Take out is where I spend the most time in the restaurant and the staff is always really friendly and giving my kids some laughs and sometimes even free deserts if the wait is long or something on the order isn't quite right. Burgers and Pizza you really can't go wrong and I rarely try anything else!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is slow lots of workers Doing nothing while one server is waiting 7 tables by herself,waitress was giving backhanded compliments when she felt uncomfortable about us getting upset about it taking a long time,hostess would not look at me when she sat us and was giving dirty looks every time she would walk by,I'm not looking for compensation just want you to fix it the problem. I love bjs and have been going here for years."}
{"text":"The best steak salad I've ever had! Love the fresh brewed beers too! Excellent menu with choices for everyone including gluten free. Every time I go to Chandler for business, I have to stop in at BJ's at least twice!!"}
{"text":"Went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse last night, as usual their food is excellent, but what seriously stood out was our waiter, Nick.  He's outstanding - he ran his backside off for everyone he waited on.  He even noticed when the server delivered the wrong order to the table, he made it right even though we told him it wasn't necessary.  WOW!!  When I complimented him on his EXCELLENT service, he told us we could ask for him the next time we come in.  I recommend everyone do the same, you will NOT be disappointed.  That said, tip him well, all waiters/waitresses depend on it!!!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed my experience at BJs. I've been going there occasionally for four years and the service has never let me down. They're always friendly :)

Plus, there's a large variety of pizza, beer, burgers, salads, pasta, and meat (steak, ribs) to try. And you can't leave without ordering a pizookie ;) trust me."}
{"text":"5 stars = The environment was great. There is a good view of a television from every table. That is often a problem with sports bars with large dining areas.

4 stars = The food was above average. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was very good. Well seasoned and the food was cooked just right. Only complaint is there was too much meat and not enough rice. Wasn't mixed perfectly but still good.

3 stars = The menu is too random. Like they haven't decided what type of food they are going to master. Because of this the food is different every time I come here. The food depends on which cook  is cooking which meal. 

2 stars = The server was awful. The only reason I am giving the server a 2 is because the server delivering the appetizers and food was very pleasant. Our server tried to remember the order but forgot and had to come back and ask. She did not refill drinks at all. She actually came by several times and looked at the empty glasses and ignored it.  She was too busy talking with other servers to pay attention to her tables. 

3 stars = Total Review 

I will try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer.  Enjoyed the spicy meatball pizza and the buffalo chicken pizza. Wonderful place to go grab a bite to eat. Good service."}
{"text":"I've been going to BJ's all over the country for over 10 years. You usually have to be prepared for a long wait before being seated and if you're in a group, don't be in a hurry. Other than that I typically don't have any complaints about BJ's. But this particular one has lousy service. It's the least crowded BJ's I've ever been with a wait that is usually less than 20 minutes. The last time my husband and I went to this BJ's we had time to look at the entire menu to see what's new (and it's long) before the waitress even came to our table to take drink orders. Our food was brought out by the food runner and we were done eating and waiting for a check before we saw the waitress again. Nobody ever stopped by to offer drink refills or make sure the food was what we had ordered. We sat there long enough that we probably could have dined and ditched before anyone even realized we had finished eating. We wanted to order a Pizookie but we had been in the restaurant over an hour already and knew we'd be there another 45 more if we ordered one."}
{"text":"The bartender and wait staff were very nice and professional.I had ONE drink at the bar, then we were seated, The manager at first seemed friendly, we spoke about the restaurant business in general, It was my daughter.s birthday, and she said it was her favorite restaurant,
Again, I had one beverage and asked for a glass  of wine with dinner. He claimed that I was slurring my words and appeared drunk. He is 25 years old, and has no clue what a drunk individual looks like. My friend was so intoxicated that I drove him home.  He had 5 beers, but was not questioned at all. I think this MANAGER is possibly a woman hater or something. As a former manager and owner of restaurants, I know what a liability it can be,


 He ruined our evening,

BTW I have a medical condition that prohibits me from having more than two beverages.

Also said my eyes were dialed. Yes, they were, I had drops in them as I had poison ivy in my eyes and lots of other places.

It is a shame that the staff is very good, and ruined by this manager"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was... Ok. Ordered a medium rare steak which was medium only. The presentation was not so great. Also ordered Angel hair pasta tasted like mr noodles with a lot of oil. 
California burger was good but a bit on the oily side. 
Kale and Brussels spout salad with blackened salmon was good. 
Overall experience was ok, the waitress was friendly and forthcoming."}
{"text":"Very happy with our food and even more impressed with our service. We had a party of 70 and our wait staff was excellent! - particularly our server - Airica. Very attentive and all the servers work together as a team for a great experience.  This is our second year in a row with a large group like this, and second very positive experience."}
{"text":"Service was great! Sadly the kitchen was on the slow side. Went in at an off-time but the restaurant was still fairly busy. Sadly, it took 30 min for our appetizer to come out and it was overly greasy! Literally our potato skins were sitting in a puddle of grease. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"BJ's server was certainly warm and welcoming, but it took so long to be served our food.  We ended up asking our server twice what might be the problem.  We finally were served and the food tasted okay, but the hot food was luke warm that our friends ordered. Thank goodness my husband and I ordered salads.  But what was totally disturbing and in bad taste was the video that the business picked out on it's 4 panel videos throughout the restaurant.  The video was of OJ Simpson's life and it wasn't appetizing in the least to see his murdered wife and his wedding and them kissing, etc. There are a whole lot of other sport figures that would deserve to have their pictures played over and over while eating.  BJ's needs to show more care to their customers.  Spoiled my appetite!"}
{"text":"One word review \"meh\". This place was seriously average, mediocre, nothing special. Great service but beyond that it was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Excruciatingly sloooowwwww service.  I've never witnessed such inefficient serving.  Bring drinks, don't take food order; bring order, but don't bring the meals for the kids because you can't carry everything.  How about just get the kids first, then the rest?  Drop off to go boxes after meal and not the check, too.  Lost 10-15 minutes of time waiting for huge gaps in service.

Food was fine, but I as a patron should not have to ask \"could you take my order\" or \"could I have my check\" when clearly I was ready for both at those times.  

Our server was either new or just not ready for work that day because she was operating in slow motion compared to her coworkers."}
{"text":"Waiter dressed like a plumber should have been our first clue - butt crack and all. He was incompetent despite having a tablet that was doing the work - he couldn't find the drinks or the menu. What a surprise - service was even worse. \"I'm swamped. I've got six tables.\" 
They were all doubles, within arm's reach.
We left w/o receiving several items."}
{"text":"I want to give a shoutout to April, one of the managers who took my catering order. She made it a breeze to order and was sensitive to all of my questions. Thank you April!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to BJ's for their special brews of beer! They always have something unique on tap to drink! Beer is a little more expensive then your typical bar, but you are paying for a microbrew.

There food isnt half bad either! They have a large selection of food to choose from - Pizza, Pasta, Sandwiches, etc. There is something for everyone here! 

If your going on a Friday night or Saturday night do the call ahead reservation right before you leave the house. It will save you 15-30min of waiting in line for a table."}
{"text":"This review is for the food only.  Not good.  I chose the avocado egg rolls for dinner, one of the more popular items reviewed here and the waitress noted that they were a favorite as well.  I love avocado on practically anything and I hated these.  The texture I think is what got to me - the overly creamy middle of avocado and cream cheese with the greasy roll was just a fail.  I really wanted to enjoy these, in fact I kept trying to give it another chance with one more bite.   But it just wasn't gonna happen."}
{"text":"Been going to BJs for several years and always had good service and food but won't be going back anytime soon. Today we ordered there new Nashville hot wing which in the menu picture looked saucy and rich but when we got them they were dry no taste. Always loved the chicken wrap but not today cheapened them used iceberg lettuce not butter lettuce like before chicken was dry. The tavern pizza was a joke. 15.00 for a so called 12 cut pizza ya righ. It was nothing more than a flatbread pizza with a higher price. We asked the servicer if she made a mistake and ordered the flatbread she said she didn't. She sent the manager to ask about our concerns. When he got there it was with an attitude and wanted to argue that we were wrong and asked why we didn't complain when it got there we ju said fine and asked him to leave. Overall like most corporate restaurant chains prices are way up and food portions and quality are way down."}
{"text":"Never made it in the door.  Used \"call ahead seating\" option only to be told we would have about an hour wait once we arrived.  The only benefit to calling ahead was that if we arrived at the same time as another customer, we would be seated before the other customer.  So drive 45 mintues to wait another hour and all the time waiting to beat out some poor sucker who walked in the same time as my group?  Doesn't make any sense and no thanks"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to eat at this location last night and I had such a great experience, as always! Our waiter was quick, kind, and genuine! I can not have gluten so I love going to BJs for their gluten free pizza. Last nights pizza was the best ever. I had a great time and left completely satisfied. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Consistent and easy for everyone to find something they like... If you're looking to avoid waiting for a table, open sitting in the bar doesn't seem to be much different with regard to service speed or atmosphere..."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here in on Fridays. They have s very large menu to order from. The staff is nice and the food is pretty good. Their beer is very good and the bar is a great place to watch a game and drink a cold one."}
{"text":"BJs Pizza....In the words of Bret Hart, the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be.  There may be a bit of hyperbole there, but damn, I'd be hard-pressed to say that ive ever tried a better pizza and thats saying something since this is a chain.

I've been frequenting both the San Jose, Roseville and Las Vegas locations (yeah, i get around) for almost four years and finally have the sense of mind to review it.  Whats nice about this place is that no matter which location you go to, you can always expect consistency.  Great ambiance, great food and great fun are to be had at each location and you can really tell the company strives for it.
Where to start, oh yeah, PIZZA!  The pizza is amazing.  It is the deep dish style not to be confused with the stuffed type youd get at Zacharys in the yay area or Giordano's in the Chi.

The pizza is baked to perfection, has the right bit of crunch to it and is just generally good all over.  The sandwiches, beer and desserts are nothing to scoff at either.  Please try a Pizookie if you ever get the opportunity.  I'd rank it right up there with the White Molten Chocolate Cake (believe it or not) at Chili's or the Brownie Sundae at MRKT inside the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas.

Do yourself a favor, eat at BJ's."}
{"text":"Pretty bad!  Just arrive home from dinner with my parents and my dad is eating chips and my mother went to bed hungry.   Service was subpar...you will find out for yourself if you visit this establishment.  Management was worse...once again you will find out for yourself if you visit this establishment.  Long story short was told happy hour was going on, ordered accordingly, was told happy hour was mistakenly announced and we were charged full price.  Ordered our food, mother's spaghetti was cold.  Server argued that they do not know how that could happen and could warm it in the microwave or \"remake\" it.  Manager came and try to argue the same point.  At least he didn't say they could warm it in the microwave but then again wen didn't give him a chance.  We chose to microwave it at home ourselves and left it on the table.  It WAS taken off our bill though. Not impressed and will not be back.  It's unfortunate, as BJ's  have a good menu and have I have had great experiences at other locations as well as recommending to coworkers/friends."}
{"text":"What a HORRIBLE experience.  Couldn't get my steak right (it was either dry like cow hide or so bloody it could have been mooing).  My mom's chicken was fair (she did NOT complain or send back).  It took so long to take food order that my hubby had to ask for someone, and the manager showed NO managerial skills.. instead he was a jerk to US!  I was offered no bread, chips, water, etc as I watched my family eat and finish their meals.  I had just gotten back into pittsburgh from visiting Erie, so we were tired and starving.  That experience was so HEINOUS I wouldn't go back If they offered to comp our next 5 meals!!"}
{"text":"If you have an hour and half to experience bad service and so so food this is the place. 
Not sure I'll be giving it a second chance."}
{"text":"While grabbing lunch here with a client, I had a waitress accidentally drop a tray of waters next to me with a glass falling on my shoulder and table.  The waitress was extremely apologetic and tried to do everything she could to make the situation better.  The reason for the poor rating has nothing to do with the service or the wait staff.  The reason is due to the manager that was on the floor.  She came over and after my client joked with the waitress about getting a free round of drinks for me having to sit there with a cold shirt for the entire meal.  The manager said she would take care of things and in the end gave us a $9.95 cookie for free.  Not only do I feel this is insulting but it shows how out of touch and cheap the management is.  I do not wish to get a call from the manager on duty or the GM, but when you have a customer ring up a $165 bill, $10 off the top is not much and shows that you are more concerned with your bottom line for every transaction than actually being sorry for a mistake that is your restaurants fault."}
{"text":"In the words of the late, great Arthur Ashe \"Trust has to be earned, and should come only after the passage of time\".  These words should be the foundation that I make my dining selections on when eating away from home. Selecting the BJ's location on Centennial in the Northwest part of Las Vegas should have never happened after the third or fourth time my family and I had a bad experience, but I kept believing that they could earn my trust.  My child, who loves the Pizookie however, makes that choice a bit more difficult. We have experienced more than a few 'let-downs' at this location, but the latest experience might be one of the worst. 

The latest implosion occurred tonight. We are rewards card holders and used the app to check in so our wait time might be lessened, but when we arrived we were still waiting, which we understood as it was a particularly busy night.  After an hour of waiting in the restaurant we asked how much longer the wait was. The hostess advised they were cleaning our table right then. Fifteen minutes later, the same hostess approaches us and said that she \"forgot us\" and that she would seat is promptly. Great start, BJ's. 

The hostess said she would have the manager come to us because of the situation, but of course that never happened. We had to ask for him ourselves and explained the latest disaster. Our server was very helpful for the most part, which was a good thing, but the potato skins that we ordered for an appetizer took nearly 30 minutes and when it came out it was skimpy to say the least. Two were missing any ingredients other than a hint of cheese (see pics).  

When my burger finally arrived (the smokehouse burger with bacon), the top bun looked like it was run over by a bus and the patty itself was as flat as paper.  The wedge-cut fries were mangled in only a way that Freddy Krueger could produce. There was one piece of lettuce that looked as if it was wilted days before it was served. Disgusting and inedible. There was another couple sitting opposite us who also had a burger, and it looked completely fine. Very frustrating. 

The manager visited our table on three separate occasions and to his credit tried to make the best of it. He advised that he is trying to make improvements to the location but after 3 years of hearing this I think I am finally listening to my inner-Arthur. The trust is not there and I am fed up.  I have been to many BJ's locations around the country and most have been wonderful. This location is an unmitigated disaster and needs to be exorcised."}
{"text":"Never going back. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I should have sent it back when I saw it - the pork was not pulled - it was cut into chunks and drowning in honey barbecue sauce. I couldn't eat it as a sandwich and when I bit into the \"pork\" it was gelatinous and tasted nothing like pork. It was disgusting. When my husband told the waitress (who was amazing, by the way), she told the kitchen manager who came to the table and threw so much attitude that I felt attacked. We weren't asking for a bill adjustment or a discount - we felt they ought to know. After we got rid of the kitchen manager, the waitress offered to get someone else for us to speak to and we asked her not to say anything to anyone else.  If I could give less than one star, I would."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant many times and every time we wonder why. They are so slow and if you have more than four people, be prepared to wait for at least an hour. With all the options nearby, don't go here. Last time for us."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food and customer service has always been great. I have taken my young daughter there several times and it is always pleasant, even when she makes a huge mess. Come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Food is so good. It's a shame they can't figure out how to provide the ultimate customer experience. Empty coffee and no silverware is not acceptable for that warm fuzzy feeling !"}
{"text":"I thought we would try a new restaurant are friends wanted to go somewhere else and my wife and I wanted to try BJ's we should of listened to them. First thing I wanted the Double Bone IN Pork Chop the menu said after 4:00 it was 5:00 they were out of them ok bummer so i ordered Chicken Alfredo big mistake the sauce was dry and tasteless the chicken tasted like it came out of a can my wife ordered a salad with chicken on it the salad was shredded so small it looked liked it came out of a paper shredder. She had them take it back. The only thing they have going for them is the desert. This is one restaurant I won't be going back to"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, reasonable prices.  

My only complaint is that, like many other places that THINK they serve Chicago-style deep-dish pizza, they don't.  What they claim is deep-dish is, in fact, just thick crust pizza - a loaf of bread with ingredients - far removed from what you get on Wabash Street in Chicago.   Chicago deep-dish is baked in a pan, but the crust is THIN.  It's the ingredients that make it a meal-on-a-slice.

 Did it taste good?  Yes.  Would I have it again?  Sure, it was flavorful.  But if you are expecting TRUE deep-dish pizza, this isn't it."}
{"text":"Our server was Fernando. I highly recommend you try to sit in his section. He is 5 stars. The food was awesome also. 5 stars. Great beer choices also. I had the tuna poke - very fresh-, and the 4 beer sampler. We eat there about once a month and each time has been great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch. Sat at the bar and Bill was our server/bartender. Bill was dope and super helpful. I love when people seem to actually enjoy their job, makes for a good reason to come back and ask for them by name. He's a great bartender and when I asked him to make me a surprise cocktail he didn't hesitate and made a great drink. Keep it up Bill. 

Pizza came out perfect as usual. I've never had a bad bjs pizza though. 

Good pizza. Great service. We'll be back to this location soon."}
{"text":"For a first trip in as an out of towner, I really enjoyed my experience. I sat at the bar, and having Amy take care of me was awesome. She is obviously super knowledgeable, from beers to food, super helpful with her co-workers, and clearly cares about her guest's visit. When I am back in town I will be sure to come in again!"}
{"text":"Ok, first I would like to add we have been eating at BJ's (my wife, kids and I) since they opened. We live right up the street and frequent Park West about once a week for dinner and a movie. In the beginning when I very first tried BJ's, they had one of the best burgers I have ever had! I could tell they used high quality beef, quality ingredients- a delicious bun, and were prepared superb. The appetizer was also delicious and original, an avocado egg roll with a delicious dipping sauce. I have also tried the roast beef french dip which was excellent and a chicken tortilla soup to die for. That is why it's such a bummer when the last few times I've been there it has been extremely inconsistent.
  When its good its really good, when it's bad, the service is horrible and the food has been lousy. However I never stop going to a place I like so much off of one bad food experience. Upon returning to see if it is really gone downhill like I feared, we were actually pleasantly surprised with our meals. So chalking it up as just an off day, we have gone back several times. I don't know what is going on, maybe it has to do with the manager who may be working at the time, or kitchen staff / wait staff, but it seems to oscillate from being one of my favorite places to go, to extremely poor food and service. When we're looking for a quick bite to eat and don't feel like cooking we'll stop by and have lunch or dinner, but unfortunately it is just too inconsistent. Their drink menu is awesome, and have plenty of microbrews to try. Myself being a fan of root beer, enjoys' their homemade root beer and my children often order they're orange creamsicle soda which is very delicious. They usually order off the children's menu, and the sliders offered on that menu are quite tasty.
   The only reason I decided to write a review for BJ's is I honestly hope management can fix the inconsistencies with their dining experience. When their game is tight, it truly is one of my favorite chain restaurants. With how close they are to our house, I look forward to many more years of dining at BJ's,  and would even drive several miles extra to dine there if I had to because it is just that good (when it's good). It makes me very nervous that they will become just like so many other really good restaurants that start out delicious only to have a gradual descent into mediocrity. I just hope they do not become complacent being average, because their food is so much more when they do go the extra mile. I would gladly give 5 stars if the issues I stated above can be rectified."}
{"text":"Descent food at reasonable price.  Love their Balsamic Chicken entree.  Their New England Clam Chowder is tasty too! Great atmosphere, family friendly, staff is always attentive."}
{"text":"Lacey, Lacey, Lacey...you're a rock star!

We went a few weeks ago with another couple and Lacey was our server.  As we all know, service can make or break an experience and we were so happy to get Lacey.  She knew the menu, made great suggestions for cocktails, had a great smile and attitude.

Here is what really made the night...my husband and I split something and it came with fries and he likes thick and I like the shoestring.  So, Lacey took it upon herself to do half and half on our order.  I know, it's not rocket science but the fact that she took an extra step and thought outside the box was awesome!

She is a true asset to this organization.

You go girl!"}
{"text":"I always have liked the food here, but the wait staff has become simply pathetic. I went to BJs on a Monday night when the restaurant is less than half full. I had a young (maybe 16-17 year old) Hispanic \"gentleman\" as my server. He never gave his name. He mumbled when taking my order and showed little interest in being polite. I hardly even saw my waiter. He had absolutely no interest in doing his job. The time he was actually on the floor, he was either chatting with other waiters at the bar or chatting with girls. While waiting for him come to the table and split our check, he spent 20 minutes talking with two girls one table, laughing and having a great time. No other server approached the table during this time. I tried to approach the bar to get the bartender to split the check, but he refused. A large, black woman (I assume from her clothes that she was the manager) was also just standing around. My friend made a snarky comment to her about the terrible service as we left; she responded like she was surprised and gave the weakest apology I have ever heard. To give proper credit, a short, white female (that was working in a busser/waiter assistant capacity) was extremely polite. She checked on our table twice and wasn't even our server. Everyone else was either black or Hispanic and couldn't care less. My friends and I were put in the corner and refused equal treatment. If you are non-white, I absolutely recommend BJs. The food is great and the wait staff will constantly check on you. But if you are white (like myself and two friends), the wait staff will be slow to take your order, show no interest in your table and spend all of their time slacking off or speaking to other non-white tables. BJs is just another racist business that hates whites."}
{"text":"I had no problems here at all. My girlfriend and I received a gift card for 50 dollar for Christmas so we wanted to give this place a try. Went on Saturday around 5 pm. Waited for 10 min for a table in the bar area. The place was busy for 5pm, which I always consider to be a good sign. We ordered 2 drinks each; two Irish red ales and two piranha pale ales. This is a craft brew house and I was impressed with their beer. We ordered one appetizer and a medium deep dish pizza. It was considered happy hour due to the Cardinals game being on.

Four beers, one medium pizza and an appetizer for 45 bucks. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"I attended a friend's birthday party two weeks ago and I ordered a calzone...it had onions and cheese.  It is so good.  A waiter and host knows little bit sign language.  It is cool. BJ offers tons of menu.  It is my first and last..I have not tried other food unfortunately.  A really fast service, seriously."}
{"text":"Where do I begin .......This particular BJ's is always busy and not only did we have to wait 30 min (they said 20) but once a booth became open in the bar area we had to flag down a waitress to clear off the table (several walked past us without even acknowledging the dirty table but upon observation I noticed a plethora of others had to do the same thing ) once the table was cleaned I notice we had the same waitress as the last  time and I was like ohhh joy (did you catch the sarcasm ) nevertheless I ordered my usual \"Cadillac margarita NO salt (this time I had to say NOOO salt so she can hear me since the last time she screwed it up) wellllllll this time was NOOOOO different she brings my drink out with NOOOO salt and I drink it and welp this time it had no salt but she brought me a grapefruit margarita no salt....after that once again she became sarcastic because of her error... we also ordered two pizookies and had a coupon for a free one, she took the information and 15 min later out comes 1 pizookie, soooooo im writing this to say Nicole N you may need to get your hearing checked because everything we ordered you brought what we didn't ordered (or what you thought you heard )......"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places open til midnight in Chandler. We love that. The food was really good and the blood orange sangria is to die for. The service could be better, but it just seemed like they didn't ha e enough staff."}
{"text":"Food is good! Service is very slow & wrong order keeps coming to our table. Not a good management."}
{"text":"PROS:
+Excellent Service
+Pizookie ('nuff said)
+Large entrees

CONS:
-The beer was lack luster and forgettable. If a dessert outshines the beer at a brewery, something is amiss.
-This pub is a local favorite so it gets very crowded and noisy around happy hour.

BOTTOM LINE
Go there for an appetizer and then the Pizookie. If it is your first time, get the mini trio. Do not try to get an entree and then the Pizzokie or you'll be sorry. My wife and I enjoy microbreweries and independents but decided to try this chain (107 restaurants as of June 2011). It was a good dessert experience, but we probably wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Quoted a 1 hour wait. Took almost 2. We were just a party of 6. Saw 50+ people leave. How hard is it to push 2 four person tables to accommodate a party of 6. They did offer to get an appetizer started for us. Thanks."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, pricing ok.  Drinks are way overpriced.  (especially the beers, I mean $8-$12 for a pint??)  Husband got baked ziti, he said he loved it. I had parmesan crusted chicken.  I can't lie, I have a feeling it was frozen, and microwaved, but it was honestly amazing.  With a menu that huge, no way anything is fresh, it's all frozen.  It is how you prepare it that matters, so no complaints here.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"I went here last night and my experience was awful. My server was inattentive my pizza did not have the items I requested and upon request my server just laughed it off and said \"oops this was my fault I'll throw artichokes on the side\" I said no thanks. Then he never refilled my beverage I was without a beerage through my entire main course. The balsamic chicken said it was a chicken breast and it was not the breast also the potatoes honestly taste like they were box mashed potatoes with cheese on them. My server honestly ruined the experience he brushed off every concern I had and it was annoying. We got our  check 15 minutes a free we finished. We were waiting on him, not vice versa. Will never ever go again."}
{"text":"Great appetizers and even better beers.  If you like pale ales, try the Piranha (It could become your favorite).  They have a patio which is key for those of us from California."}
{"text":"I frequent this place for lunch often, they have good lunch specials and their food is really good. I highly recommend asking your waiter what they recommend if you cannot decide, they always help point you towards what's good. I went there with three co-workers, we had a very good experience. Most of us decided to try something we had not tried before. I myself tried their turkey burger and my friend tried the chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Needless to say the turkey burger was cooked to perfection, it was nice and juicy and honestly for a turkey burger it was great. My friend loved her chicken and spinach quinoa dish. My other friends also enjoyed their meals (which I believe were boneless wings and a hot ham and cheese grill sandwich). Our server Brandon I was absolutely fantastic and was really attentive. One of my pet peeves is not have my water refilled and he did an amazing job at keeping our drinks full and made sure to check on us. Will definitely continue to come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Great service sitting at the bar for Happy Hour...cold drink after a long day and yummy app and pizza!"}
{"text":"What a great place to come and relax with friends! The service isn't always consistent, but it's usually fairly decent. The food is always good and dessert is the best! Despite the inconsistency in service, I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a good restaurant and the service was great. They have wonderful hamburgers and good beer. However, in a city in Arizona they have two handicap spots and Arizona must have 4 million handicap people. They have the same number of handicap slots that they do take out slots.  That is the only reason I downgraded the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a group of 17 people when I came to BJ's for the first time ever! We did put in a reservation and they accommodated us very well. I felt like we were at one of those huge tables you see in mansions where only like 1-3 people normally eat at, but we took up all the space ! Our waitress was very tentative and there was never really a drink empty too long before she had a new one. She was super funny too. 

My food was pretty great. I have a flatbread with bacon and ranch, super good. Everyone else in the group seemed to really enjoy their food. Those next to me had these massive burgers that they scarfed down. 

I will have to come back when I can get a drink or two because I heard their selection was pretty great, but I was not allowed to cocktail with this group. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my first time here and will try to be back soon!"}
{"text":"We go to BJ's  about every 6 weeks, and I like the atmosphere and the food,  but the service on every occasion I have eaten there is awful !  Why can't they get some decent servers?  It almost ruins a nice dinner.   Also it would be nice if the salads, and appetizers came out well before the main couirse  food, however they either forget them altogether, or you are in the middle of eating your salad when your hot food shows up. They can't get it right, it seems.  Even the manager can't seem to help the situation."}
{"text":"Went to BJ's in North Olmsted. Loved the pizza tasted. The order I got was BJ's favorite. So good. Definitely one of my favorite pizza places and will be"}
{"text":"The highlight: Wine half off  on Tuesdays.  That's a deal. It goes for both bottles and by the glass.  I believe the special applies all day long and not only during happy hour (3-7pm).  They have the basics:  their \"house wine\" is barefoot (listed at $19/bottle) but with the special it comes out to be very similar to what you can get it for at Trader Joe's.   

I shared the homemade Kettle Style Potato chips ($3): good choice.
I also shared the flatbread Margherita Fresca pizza which I don't strongly recommend;  It was $9 and barely any tomatoes.  Mainly just cheese with specs of tomatoes. 

I just ate here earlier today and had a great time.  There's a good overall ambiance with the music, the service, and the continuous crowd coming in and out (It's a tuesday evening and it was still crowded by 10PM). 

I probably would come back because of it's convenient location, minimal wait and decent prices."}
{"text":"We've only been here once but we really liked the booth setup.  Shoestring fries were very delicious, the fish was ok, the Asian salad was also very good.  Seems like typical college co-ed sports bar and the wait staff were very fast."}
{"text":"Food okay, service bad.

Baby back ribs dry, Asian chicken salad dry as well and the Asian dressing was off.  Asked the waitress what sides they have, she said look at the menu. I asked her what desserts thr have, she said it's in the dessert menu...nobody sings for your birthday .   The dessert was good though..ice cream on a warm cookie, tiny portion."}
{"text":"First time in. I was impressed. Busy with browns game on but service was quick. I ordered off the enlightened menu (lower calories). I ate the veggie pita tacos. They were delicious. They showed me how to download the app which is for their rewards program. Lots of craft beers. I had mixed drink but when I go back I will definitely try their seasonal pumpkin beer.  I'm looking forward to going back to try the place again."}
{"text":"Bjs.. well where do I begin. Food has always been so so.. nothing amazing. I come here because its convenient but truly nothin to brag about. One thing I dislike is the fact that all customers expect to wait at Bjs.. its different if you wait and you get 5 star service and food is amazing... but all it you get is Okay. You wait to get seated and you wait a long time to get food, even just appetizers.. when its busy youre lucky if you get your glass refilled with water without having to ask couple of times. This could be a good place... could be."}
{"text":"We come to this location often. The service both at the bar and tables are always good. They had a special going on. 2 for $25. It was a choice of salad or soup for each person (2 people) medium pizza and a pizookie. Such a great deal. Not sure how long it lasts. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have always had great customer service in this restaurant.  Great food and drinks and great atmosphere!  We were in here tonight and had the best customer service ever.  Our server was \"Little Debbie\". She got our order right, even made some great suggestions.  Fast, and very personable.  Thanks BJ's for standing out from the rest!"}
{"text":"Okay we are dining at BJ's. What a shocker. They use to have a very good Bloody Mary  not this time. They changed their tomato mix too sweet and not spicy . We sent it back. Bartender said oh yeah we switched suppliers. Then our food arrives shrimp taco were fish tacos , lettuce wraps appetizers came with the Meal. Waiter did ask for our frequent diner number. We will hit the yard house next time"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite spots to grab dinner.  Customer service slides down and so does our frequency.  Paid for ginger ale with dinner & requested a refill, waitress said they charge for refill.  This would have been fine if the second glass wasn't considerably smaller.  Waitress brought regular coke instead of diet and seemed put off at request to correct the error."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us that decided to try BJ's on a Friday night - we knew we would probably have to wait for a table.  Arrived and parking was terrible.  Once inside, we had to wait about 5 minutes to put our name into the wait system.  Gave our phone number for them to text when our table was ready and was told by the hostess that our was t time was 30-40 minutes.  Then received a text saying that our war time was 40-50 minutes.  After waiting 60 minutes I walked up to the hostess table where I was told that it would be another 25-30 minutes.  A BIG difference between 30 and 90 minutes!  

On to the food:
Our orders were Fish and Chips, hamburger, pasta and California Chicken club.
The food was average at best.  
Pasta, for some reason had a stalk of celery in it, however the flavor was ok
Hamburger had virtually no flavor at all
Fish and Chips were ok
California Chicken club was average, although the chicken was a little dry

On the plus side - French fries were amazing, we got a pizookie which was delicious and the server (I wish I remembered her name) was excellent."}
{"text":"Hostesses did not put our name on the list after doing the preferred VIP Checkin.  Kenneth was great in his service but the hostesses are worthless  pieces of human organisms.  Does a disservice to the waitstaff.   Food was consistent and good as usual.  Unfortunately for the waitstaff, this is the last time we are dining at this chain."}
{"text":"I have officially tried this place twice, and I don't recommend the food. I would go back to try one of their brews again.

First time around: Order messed up, I have a food allergy, let our server know, and found that ingredient in a pizza, but it was not listed in their menu.

Second time around: Shoestring fries that were so tiny and thin that they were unpalatable. Overpriced fish fry."}
{"text":"This place has thee most AHHHHHMAZING burgers!!! This is the only place we will go to get a good burger and we don't really live close but it's worth the drive. Just wish it was a little bit bigger, must go there!! Wish I could give more stars! Put one in a Robinson it would make a killing out here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at BJ's Steakhouse and Brewery. The food was excellent. I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls and the brisket burger. Both were tasty and the burger was huge so half went home as my midnight snack. Our server was awesome as was the rest of the staff. I'm sure we will dine there again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food came cold. Hostesses had the worst attitudes. Manager acted like he wanted nothing to do with anyone when we asked to remake our food because it came out ice cold. This place won't last"}
{"text":"Their pizza looks amazing but is just average, avacado egg rolls are amazing! All the dishes And deers we have had here except the pizza have met or exceeded our expectations. The atmosphere is fun yet comfortable the staff is excellent, it's definitely one of our go to restaurants."}
{"text":"I have eaten at BJ's several times and I have never been disappointed, today was no exception. I took a friend that had never been there before and she was very pleased as well.

We had a Margarete pizza appetizer that was delicious!  We had chicken sliders and beef sliders and they were wonderful!  We had an excellent server, our food came quickly, was hot and really good.

I would very much recomment BJ's and besides, they have Pepsi products - Hurray!!!!"}
{"text":"I love BJ's restaurant. My guilty pleasure is ALWAYS ordering the pizookie no matter how full I am from my other food selections.

I love the calamari. Tastes good. I usually get the steak and it comes with asparagus and mashed potato. I order my steak in medium rare to capture all of the flavor! If you haven't tried medium rare, you should definitely try!

I miss the red velvet pizookie, but I can settle for the white chocolate macadamia pizookie! Never disappoints. Who doesn't love a pizza cookie with some ice cream smothered on top? The hot and cold mixed tastes great!

Service was quick and waters were refilled pretty fast."}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst experiences ever here. It started with the hostess. She did not even greet us when we came in, and when she finally did acknowledge our presence she acted like we were annoying her.  After a few minutes she told us it was going to be a few more minutes. After a little time passed she came back and got menus and silverware, and started walk to seat us. She then turned around and told us NO!! Not yet. When she came back she started texting on her phone. A few more minutes went by and she stated asking us some question about if we were loyalty members or not, etc...  Then she didn't say anything for a few minutes. Very awkward silence. Then she told me to go and stand next to the stairs. Usually a host person would tell you it will be a few more minutes, not go stand next to the stairs. Keep in mind that this is 2:30 pm in the. Afternoon when thee are only about 20 people in a restaurant that can easily hold 200, and we are the only people waiting to be seated in a basically empty restaurant.How rude!!! She then walked by me and didn't say anything like I am suppose to be a mind reader and know that I am suppose that I follow her now. I get to the table, and proceeds to throw the menus and silverware on the table and walks away without saying anything.  When our waiter comes, he introduces him self and then proceeds to sit down next to us in the booth, like a long lost friend. Maybe he was really tired. He tells us the specials and gives us a few minutes to decide. When our waiter comes back, he again proceeds to sit down right next to us and take our order. We go ahead and order, and when our food comes 30 minutes later, a different person brings it out to us. They place it on our table and walk away, not a single word comes out of their mouth during this entire process. Not once during our entire meal did the server refill our drinks. If you really enjoy terrible service, this is the place for you. For the rest of us, spend your money else where."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza.   good ambience.  excellent service. are all worth the visit.    we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Happy hour 3-7 good time to go before the crowd is 3-4 pm . Good appetizer & drinks . Tried the roast beef dip it's average. Chicken lettuce cups are great. Good service in the bar seating area."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time. Service was VERY prompt and attentive, despite it being quite busy. Was in a party of 3, and everyone was happy with their meals. Drinks were refilled with perfect timing. Extensive menu options. Very nice portions for the price and good quality. Have not read any other reviews so I don't know if others have had complaints or not, but I have none whatsoever. 
The only tiny mistake they made was that our appetizer came very shortly before our entrées. I will not let that take away a star however, because that too was delicious, and I simply used it to complement my main dish. Very satisfied experience overall. :)
Thank you.
- Ken"}
{"text":"The honeymoon is over at this newly opened BJ'S.  Our last 2 visits were disappointing. I don't drink so, in fairness, maybe it's better to get liquored up before eating the food. 

 The jambalaya seemed as if it had been cooked hours before we ordered it. Everything in it was soft and mid-evolution into an eventual gray gelatinous mass. I wasn't duped by the shovel full  of dry seasoning heaped on the top of it all at the last minute. 

Tonight I ordered the kale and mushy, grey roasted brussel sprout salad with a previously frozen, now burnt salmon jerkey plank. I ordered the grilled rather than the blackened salmon, but it was charred and was like eating  salmon  taxidermy. My wife's burger too was well done a few minutes before they removed it from the grill. 

I did savor my drink of water though --- I had to as refills were scarce. Sorry BJ's"}
{"text":"We just left the restaurant because I lost my appetite. We've been waiting for our table for 20-25 minutes. When I got the text saying the our \"table was ready,\" we stood up and the girl at the desk told us to give them a few minutes because our table was being cleaned. So they made us stand there and wait. Two minutes after, they call a party of 5 and they immediately took them back. Then they call another party of 2 and take them back. Take note that we came in ahead of these two parties. So they make us stand there behind the desk while they get our table ready. So once they sat us, I asked if we could get seated in a booth instead, and this dude tells us that they were going to put us back in the waitlist!! My husband got so hot and so we spoke to their manager and told him how unprofessional their service was. Take note also that there were several empty tables, thus, I am not understanding why there was even a need to wait. Even with the offer of the manager that he was going to take care of our food, we left the restaurant. This happened tonight, Saturday, 1/20/18 at 8:30pm."}
{"text":"Much better that I expected from a \"brewhouse\".

Although kind of a loud place, the great food at a great price (and of course great beers) while being family-friendly makes it a hit. A great price for Summerlin as well, I expected to pay much more. The casual contemporary decor is also done well, if you like that kind of style."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our dinner. The restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away. Our server Kym was absolutely great. Hands down some of the best service in town and I have been a local for 22 years. If you are in the Northwest sode of town stop in. You will not be disappointed. The menu has a lot of different options."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place BUT  we came in specifically for the pumpkin ale,and were told they'd run out the week before.  We've missed it two years in a row now because not enough was made.  Make more!!! We'll drink it!!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service here!  The rewards program is awesome.  Kitchen a little slow when they're slammed but worth the wait.  Don't go to a big national chain for average fare, head in here and eat like a king!  Nancy is my favorite server, always takes great care of us!!"}
{"text":"All you California peeps out there stop in for a little taste of home. Great casual dining and microbrews."}
{"text":"Food (pizza) was good... but got charged full price for half-off item. It's been brought to my attention that I should've mentioned it before I left to give them a chance to redeem themselves, so I'll give it another try. 
* pending update"}
{"text":"The food here rocks, the service here rocks. The menu is very large and has many choices my wife settled on pizza and I got a burger. Top notch burger just a tad of pink like I like it super moist and seasoned perfectly. The pizza was great thin crispy crust and great toppings. The only thing that I would say and, is the reason for the 4 starts and not 5 it's pretty pricey but they have this cool app where you can download and order/pay for your food. The first time I used it I think I got $15 gift certificate. That was cool"}
{"text":"Hmm, I can't say too much about this place because I came in a bit tipsy ;P
Other than the good atmosphere and good seating area, this place is great for watching the games.
I've tried a sip of black velvet from a friend, and I must say, it's the best I've tried by far..."}
{"text":"I love this place! food was great and the service was good. Pizookie is aaamazing! def  a good date night place, or even just to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Average chain restaurant trying to be disgusted as a micro brew pub!  Service was very slow and although I wanted to like our waitress Amber, she did a mediocre job at best.  My beer should not stay empty for over ten minutes before asking if I want another.  Several tables seated after us received their food before we did.  There are carpet runners throughout entire place because the tile floor is so slippery.  Menu is large and my Mahi Mahi tacos were extremely good, unfortunately the chips that came with were swimming in grease and a big let down.  What really put me over the edge of not wanting to go back was the wannabe hipster manager with the beard that walked out from the kitchen chewing on food and wiping his mouth while carrying some customers food, very gross and borderline disgusting!  The decor at first glance looks great but after you sit for a few minutes you notice everything is so fake and a really cheaply done.  The fake brick wall paper, is well, fake brick wall paper.  Very cheesy!  I am really let down because I was so looking forward to going.  Pricing was reasonable, although I'd rather pay a few dollars more and go to a real micro brew pub."}

{"text":"Interesting place directly across the street from the Red Rock casino. We like to avoid eating in casinos are hotels when  possible as the quality and the pricing usually isn't good so we sought this place out and we weren't disappointed.

we ate there twice in the last two days. Beer and appetizers were great as was the food, it has a pleasant atmosphere highly recommend."}

During world cup game i ask 3 times and i barely can hear ... Angela is a manager and she never take care of the situation and to be honest that makes me to not come back at Bjs anymore.... Service and food is great... Manager is poor"}
{"text":"The chicken tastes like rubber. It's not just this location. Their food aside from the pizza has just really gone down hill. My husband and I shared the Santa Fe salad and the Alfredo chicken pasta. Both plates had gross chicken. The salad was bearable at best. The pasta I sent back because I asked for the chicken well done and it wasn't at all. It was rubbery and veiny. When they brought it back they chopped up the same chicken and tossed more sauce on it. Annoying but not worth the battle obviously. I ate around it. The service was good. I just won't be back because of the food. I haven't had good food here in a while."}
{"text":"Manager Shilo and server Dominic you guys are amazing. Last night was our first time ever there and you took care of us. Shilo thank you for taking the time to congratulate my son on his accomplishments. You will see the Quintero's soon!
Muchas gracias"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying out Bj's Restaurant Brewhouse this afternoon. I ordered the gluten-free Santa Fe Salad. It was delicious, but I suggest ordering it with the dressing on the side. The salad was big enough for two meals. 

Our server was great. She checked in on us many times. We were a party of three and after ordering it only took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive (the restaurant was packed). 

I wasn't able to try one of their famous pizookies. The table near ours had one and it looked fantastic! I will save room next time."}
{"text":"Normally I love this restaurant but I recently ordered from them through grub hub.  I received my Brussel sprouts 3/4 burnt!  I couldn't eat them! THEY WERE BURNT BURNT!  When I called BJs, they told me they couldn't do anything for me cuz I ordered through Grubhub.  Really?  I would have to call Grubhub to get a refund.  REALLY?"}
{"text":"Visited BJ's for the first time recently with a group of friends for a birthday celebration and overall experience was good. Our server I believe Heidi was her name was great as well as another server/busser that was working with her, they were great with our large party. My burger was ok, nothing great. I'd definitely go back for the service and try something else next time. Thank you."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Love all the tv's especially on weekends to watch sports. Recommend the deep dish pizza.....fantastic."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant but tasty and lots of variety."}
{"text":"Not worth the effort.

The beer here is pretty bad. And they charge for tasters, so to try a beer to see how bad it is before committing to a full pint will cost you money.  It really irks me that they do not brew their beer at each location, yet have it shipped in... not very mirco brew of them.

I have been to a couple of their locations, including this one.. It took me 4 tries of this company before I realized I was never going to leave thrilled and to just give up on BJ's.  The service on average is slow and at times moody (with the customers that is, with other staff members they goof around and snap each others exposed thongs-that was a bad dining experience). The food is bland and boring.  On my final visit my boyfriend's entree came out to the table and mine was nowhere in site.  Five minutes later our server finally came by to tell me that my chicken had been burnt and it was the last one they had, he was oh so kinda as to ask me if I wanted to order something else.  WTF? Really?!? Are you serious with me kid, no I want to sit here and watch my boyfriend eat.. what kind of question was that?  So 20 minutes after my boyfriends meal came, I got my meal.. some pasta thing.. should have just ate my napkin, might have had more flavor.

The only MILD saving grace of BJ's is their pizza, its decent, not amazing, but decent.  But one decent pizza will not bring me back to this joke of a brewery.. and btw..what's with the garage doors on the wall?!"}
{"text":"AWFUL! Had to wait 40 mins on a week night, but that was fine (the hostess was very nice and apologetic). We were seated and the table was still dirty, the hostess had to clean it off and the table was left wet and gross. We then waited over 15 mins and still no waiter came over, finally flagged one down (pretty bad that I have to try to track someone down when at least 4 waiters walked by us in the 15-20 mins we were sitting there) and he said this was not his table, but he would place our order. My daughter's milk did not come out with the rest of the drinks (explain this to a 4 year old who has already been sitting at a table for 20 mins). Our waiter said he would send a manager over, the manager never came. I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for a manager and about my daughter's milk. Meanwhile we have been sitting now for 25 mins. 

We ordered an appetizer that came out with our food, which took forever. Then we had our food and no silverware. A manager finally came over, but at that point it was just ridiculous. I would have gotten better service at a fast food place. At least we would have gotten our drinks. They took 25% off the bill, but that was insulting because it was not even worth it. Thanks for saving me a few dollars and having a terrible experience and a grouchy 4 year old. Overall terrible and will not be going back. If I ran a business like this, I would be out of business."}
{"text":"Good beer and the food is surprisingly good for bar food. I'd say upscale bar food. Broccoli soup wand tomato and feta salad where good"}
{"text":"Pretty consistent with their food,  great lunch specials and happy hour specials.   Love their pizookie dessert,  it's the absolute best but don't count on vanilla ice cream being available on Sunday nights because their delivery comes on Monday :-(  
If you tend to get chilly like me, make sure to bring a sweater because the AC is always on blast.  :-)"}
{"text":"Pros: We were seated quickly. Practically no wait time. we ordered the 4 beer sampler. I liked the house beers. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the oasis amber and the house blonde. When we asked for lemon for our water the waitress brought a lot of lemon.

Cons: We were starving when we arrived and waited 30min just to order drinks. The waitress rushed off before we had a chance to order food. Another 30min went by before she brought our beers and we were so frustrated from waiting an hour we just asked for our check. It took the waitress another 10min to bring us our check 20 to pick up the check and 20 to bring it back to us. after about an 1 hour and 45min of waiting  I was so disappointed in the service. I might come back and give it another chance. Hopefully it will be better next time."}
{"text":"I first tried this place when they did a \"test\" meal prior to opening.  I wasn't impressed then and I'm not now.  The food is mediocre at best, the service not even that good.  Even the iced tea is awful.  And you could perish of thirst waiting for a drink refill.  I got a cobb salad, and it didn't even come with a roll, bread or cracker.  There are plenty of other places in the Desert Ridge area that deserve patronage.  Skip this one!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Yes, it's still a chain, and I typically don't go to chain restaurants. Why would you with all the other choices in Pittsburgh? I was so pleasantly surprised when I went for the first time though. Their pizza is awesome, tacos are great and my fiancé even had a pasta dish that was really good! Their beer is good and I like the other crafts they have on tap too. Someone is making good selections to have on draft. I was shocked to see such a low rating for this place! If you hate waiting for a table, make a reservation like you would have to do anywhere else in pittsburgh! Or get the app and get in line when you leave your house. Definitely try it if you haven't been! Only thing I would change is a little better service. It's not bad, but it isn't stellar either."}
{"text":"Food-Great
Service-sucks

We have been here 4 times since they opened recently. The very first time, Service was wonderful, everything was A-okay. Second time, we called ahead since they offer that. We asked for a table for 4. We get there and check in to be told its a 35 minutes wait. Um, Ok. Why call ahead....? So then after the wait they lead us to a booth. I said we have to have a table...They explain that the take out employees take the call aheads and dont take any requests down. Um ok...well we wait in line again another 25 minutes. Finally get a table and guess what....No waiter was assigned to our table. Finally I flag a gentleman down after sitting for over 10 minutes and turns out he is a trainer in town to train this location since their so new....Well, He was wonderful. OF COURSE. Food was still a plus. Third and fourth visits...Pretty much same shit. Forget the food...I will go where they have there shit together !!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try some place new for my birthday lunch so we came here. Vere Very Bad idea!! The food (with the exception of the burger) was disgusting bar food. The worst tasting item was the $20 med pizza. Immagine pizza hut only 10 times worse with only a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. I asked for extra mozzarella. The spinach dip had no flavor and the fried items tasted like grease. I wanted to say something to the manager but I hate causing a scene, especially on my b-day. I ended up paying an $88 bill for a bunch of gross food that the waitress helped us bag up. Very obvious we didn't eat, and left hungry. (this bill did include 1 drink which was very tasty)
This experience was bothering me so after I arrived home I called and spoke to the manager. I wanted to give him a rundown of how I felt about the food. I could have went to the Keg and gotten 2 steaks leaving full and satisfied for nearly the same amount of money.
The manager was very kind and apologised for the experience. I did affirm that the service was outstanding so I definitely have no complaints there. 
The manager offered to mail me a gift card to come back and try the food again, which I accepted. I still have NOT received the gift card in the mail. Very unfortunate experience all around."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping at Chandler Fashion we decided to stop in, watch the Cardinals game and relax with good food and exceptional beer. Just prior to arriving at BJ's our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other \"restaurants\" into \"her\" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our \"contraband\" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit."}
{"text":"Our first visit to a BJs.  Several friends had said \"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS   PLACE\" and believe me, if I could make the caps bigger I would!  This is the third and newest location to the Vegas valley, and all I can say is, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE lol.  My wife and I went on a Monday afternoon, typically a slow time for a restaurant but not this time, the joint was packed, so we knew something good was happening.  

We started with the Avocado eggrolls which simply melted in our mouths. I had the Tatonka stout, their darkest beer, and for those who like stouts, this was the richest, creamiest, chocolatiest stout I've ever had, a party in my mouth.  We shared the deep dish Mediterranean pizza, and it was fantastic, took half of it home.  Shared a chocolate chunk pizookie for dessert, but honestly, the rest of the meal was so fantastic that the famous pizookie was simply a pleasant afterthought at that point.  

Can't tell you how happy we are, as former east coast residents, to finally find pizza THIS good in Las Vegas, because let me tell you, it's been a long search!

Edited 3/8/16:  My first review was five stars, this one is two; Maybe BJs is a victim of its own success, but for whatever reason, it's not the place it used to be.

This downgrade is based on our two most recent visits, both were for \"Beer Dinners\" which are advertised well in advance, and require signing up to save seats because of their popularity.  The first beer dinner I speak of was at the Summerlin location about six months ago, so I apologize for mentioning it here, but I do so to make clear the problems we experience are chain-wide and not confined to one particular location. 

The Summerlin beer dinner was supposed to begin at 7 pm.  My wife and I arrived early (about 6:30) and checked in at the desk, and were told the room wasn't ready yet.  About ten minutes later, as others around us waited for same beer dinner, they started seating people, but not in the order they arrived, but in some unrecognizable system only they knew.  So our arriving early did NOTHING to help us get seated sooner, and in fact, we were one of the last couples to be seated, despite people arriving later being called before us.  Bad start BJs.  I think this beer dinner featured Stone Brewery, one of our favorite beer brands.  But somehow, they managed to pick some of the least pleasing Stone varieties, so strike two.

Fast forward to last night, at the Centennial location, where we had signed up for a beer dinner featuring Lagunitas brewery.  We arrived at 6:45 for the 7 pm event, and the lobby area was PACKED with others also waiting for the beer dinner.  The desk said \"Oh the room is almost ready, just a few more minutes.\"  Finally, at 6:50, the huge throng of people starts moving towards the room reserved for the beer dinner.  My wife and I didn't hear any announcement, but we tacked on to the end of the line as it appeared to be heading in the correct direction.  They were checking people in at the entrance to the room; which slowed the line dramatically, and we saw the room was almost at capacity before we even reached the entrance, and it was now 7 pm, and they hadn't even finished seating.  My wife and I looked at each other and said \"Let's leave\" and we did.  

I do admit, I'm not a fan of crowds, and 7 pm is LATE for dinner for me.  These factors certainly played into our decision to leave.  But BJs you need to do better; perhaps consider opening the room up 30 minutes before the event, so you don't have sardine-canned patrons in your lobby.  And if you know you have a popular event, as these beer dinners often sell out, perhaps consider not maxing out the room, so those not fond of crowds (like me) feel a little more comfortable.  These things would go a long way toward pleasing your customers."}
{"text":"BJs is an average chain restaurant. My spaghetti & meatballs were fairly good although a bit pricey ($15). It was dark in there & I really couldn't read the menu or see the pictures well. It looked like it said $11 for the spaghetti. My friend's spinach salad looked good."}
{"text":"Bj's is close to Cheesecake Factory in menu options. There are 20 pages. I finally opted for the lunch menu unlimited soup and salad. Decent sized portions and delicious options of 6 soups and 3 salads. Our server Korina was very knowledgeable about the menu and patient as we perused the menu trying to decide on the massive selection. My wife ended up going with the kale and roasted Brussels sprouts salad, which she had eaten before. Everything was made well, and arranged in a nice aesthetic. 
I love the menu variety and the food has been consistently good each time I have visited. It's nice to have a restaurant catering to a larger audience and palate. 
I will add that there are many vegan and gluten free options."}
{"text":"It's not a busy day, and I seated myself at the bar for a quick lunch. For the first 15 mins no one wiped the table I sat at, never got handed a menu or silverware. Ever!!!! I got it all myself and I still could have had an attitude.  But I didn't however I will never come here again."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a BJ's favorite pizza the crust is delicious...they also have their own root beer and don't forget a \"pazookie\""}
{"text":"I'll make this simple. Me and my girlfriend wanted to try something different and I've heard good things about Bj's, so we decided to eat there. We were seated and after we got our drinks, our server disappeared for a good 10 minutes before she showed up to take our order. The food... Oh man, my girlfriend ordered pasta(forgot the name), it was so undercooked and tasted like it was froze and microwaved. I wanted to return it back to the kitchen, but it was too much of a hassle to find the server since she disappeared again. I bought the bison burger, which was good. We tried the dessert and that was amazing.

Overall, I gave 2 stars for the decor and 1 star for the service and food."}
{"text":"Overall, I was happy that we went here for date night. Normally, not our typical spot we go but we had a gift card and wanted to use it. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, which were good but very spicy, which I was not expecting. If they weren't so spicy, they would be perfect.
My entree was the steak. Great flavor but a little tough. They did cook it perfect which was shocking. I did the updated side to the coucous mac and cheese. It was HORRIBLE. Absolutely inedible, the cheese was all wrong and didn't seem like it went well together. A definite disconnect in flavors. Our waitress was busy so we didn't see her as often as we would like but it was very busy so it was fine. When we were done, (the coucous  M&C was left uneaten) the waitress did notice we did not eat coucous even though we were done with everything else and offered to get a new side. I mentioned that we were full but she said we could take it to go, which was awesome. She did everything she could to make us happy and they did take the upcharge for the coucous off the bill. They had the to go side ready in minutes so we didn't lose any time waiting for replacement.
 My husband ordered a big burger and he was happy with it, no complaints. 

I would recommend this place as it was great (except the coucous, stay away from that mess) and the servers are willing to do make it right. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were seated as soon as possible, services started out great and she was quick to serve us our drinks. I ordered a rare burger, I rarely eat burgers but I like rare, she took all of our orders and left. We received our food and I was given a mid well burger. I asked her to remake my burger, she was very courteous and said she asked them if it was a rare. I get the second burger, again mid well. At this point I don't want anything else and send it back, to which she says there's a policy of cooking as close to rare, despite being mid well and the second time I've asked. The manager comes to talk to me and I explain her response and he says she was wasn't clear, and FLAT OUT tells me and my friends the kitchen crew isn't good enough to cook a rare burger. Like, blatantly says he has an incompetent staff. I work in food service and have never heard of any manager ever saying basically his staff isn't up to snuff to cook a 5 oz patty rare. He comped the burger and as soon as we got our checks, I paid cash. The waitress gives me change and shorts me 5 dollars. I ask for the manager and he comes by and is somewhat rude about his approach. I work in this industry, I know sometimes you have an off day, but I received bad food, bad service, and bad response. I will not be returning to this company, I had high hopes but left with a sour feeling of BJ's."}
{"text":"first time here, had the shrimp and arugula pita tacos and seasoned fries with there harvest hefeweizen wheat beer, awesomely good. good atmosphere. will come again."}
{"text":"Today I had the kale salad it was excellent that's probably the best salad that they have and get it with the blackened shrimp good stuff and great service"}
{"text":"Today I'm having the barbecue rib special with garlic mashed and onion strings and churro pizookie like always great service"}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Our server was in la-la land, late to greet us and was terrible and botched the order. The prices in my opinion for a like-kind joint where expensive. I saw no pride of ownership, and management was all but gone. The quality of the food lacked taste, and the presentation was horrific. Save your money and go find another pub that appreciates your hard earned money."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of BJ's for many years.....ha ha!  starting from So Cal and now in Vegas. Does not matter which state or city... the atmosphere, the customer service, and even the food are all amazing. I like this location since its across the street from Red Rock Casino and in the Summerlin neighborhood. 

Huge menu of appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, burgers, steaks, specialty entrees, etc.. I can go on and on. The menu is seriously like a book!  I am the type that if there is a lot to choose from, I tend to get overwhelmed and indecisive! Hmm what does Miriam feel in the mood for today. 

I have tried many different entrees during the years and majority of the appetizers, and there is not an item that I did not like. All very tasty. I was craving MEAT recently, and I ordered their new \"Black & Bleu burger\" and my friend got the \"Crispy Jalapeno burger.\"  The angus patty was SO JUICY! It hit the spot. 

A MUST order is BJ's Famous PIZOOKIE. Pure DELICIOUSNESS. 
Lots of flavors to choose from like red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate, and cookies n' cream. Well worth the calories! 

I. H E A R T. P. I. Z. O. O. K. I. E."}
{"text":"They have the best lunch specials.  There unlimited soup and salad is the best. Can't beat the price.  There  pazookie is yummy."}
{"text":"We took the kids here for dinner on a Thursday night at 7pm. It was packed, but we were seated rather quickly. Service was great, and the food was excellent! The waiters didn't seem to wear name tags, but our server Humberto did great, even though he seemed over worked."}
{"text":"I have to say we had the worst experience ever , we had a party of 12 go to dinner last night for my birthday and my friends birthday , we arrived and were sat at 745 pm and we did not get to eat until 9:00 .. 

Our server was nice and tried to do a great job , but the MANAGEMENT sucks , she was clearly over sat in her area and they came and stood by our table and watched then walked away.  Half of our group is in the food and beverage industry and they even felt as though management did not do there job .. 

All I can say is thanks for ruining my birthday dinner , I use to love eating and drinking at your restaurant but I will never recommend or eat at your restaurant again , and I will complain all the way up through your organization ."}
{"text":"Called ahead got on the list, and they said 50-60 minutes. Okay, so get there and wait an additional 30 minutes and still no table.  Eventually had to leave without a table.  It was busy BUT the staff was very unorganized!"}
{"text":"Eh. Walked in at 5 on a Sunday. 15 minute wait yet 10 open tables within sight of the host stand. We probably waited for less than 10. Waitress was nice, but wouldn't say the service was outstanding. We were probably there 30 min longer than we needed to be. Got pizza, shared it with my wife. It was average. Crust was limp. My daughter had fettuccini- she finished and liked it. The bazooki desserts are REALLY freaking good. We had the monkey bread one- highlight of the meal. They seemed to have a pretty nice beer selection but we're currently on the wagon. Because of that, our bill was $55. Pry wont go back if I don't have to."}
{"text":"Is what it is. Good beer selection. Food is... the food. Easy, safe, predictable, no surprises (like someone else mentioned). Not my first, or second choice, but certainly not my last. Not bad, or anything but just.. is what it is."}
{"text":"Please turn up the AC!!! The food was ok, just not very excited about this place. Best thing about it is the Light switch beer."}
{"text":"Best brewery in Akron.. love the wheat beer here and pizza .. it's a nice place. Mondays they even have good offer on"}
{"text":"BJs, overall, is a very average restaurant.  I like the variety on their menu, and the food is usually good, but it often takes a long time to get it.  The service is generally good (although we've had a couple of bad experiences), and the atmosphere is pleasant overall.  It really doesn't stand out to me in any way; it's a good place to visit when the mood strikes but not necessarily one of the top restaurants in Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good good size portions and we enjoy coming here. Unfortunately the service is not always on point. We will be back I just make sure we have a different server."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great customer seervice, nice selection of beer. This place is always consistent. They always greet you with smiles at the door. The food is delicious.  I like their pizzas and burgers. The menu has something for everyone- sandwiches, meatloaf, chicken, lettuce wraps, ribs, fish, etc. Everything comes in large portions too. You must save room for dessert! Try a pizookie! It's a fresh baked cookie with ice cream.  They come in different flavors-chocolate chip, cookies n cream, oatmeal, chocolate, and white chocolate macadamia. For drinks, try a snake bite (guiness+pear cider), berry burst cider, or any of their own brews.  Their root beear and cream sodas are really tasty too.  You won't be disappointed.  Its a great place to have dinner with a group of friends. This place is in the strip mall across the street from Red Rock casino/hotel."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have a quick lunch. We ordered chicken quesadilla and pizza. Both were lunch specials. They were both delicious. Yeah, we'll be back. Perhaps for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Whew. Ever feel like you've been sucked into a black hole where no waitstaff can find you?

I and others in my party must have worn our server-repellent tonight. We weren't on her radar AT ALL. 

Spoke to the manager, and she was apologetic, which was good. She comped our desserts.

Speaking of which, I found a chunk of chicken in my pizzooki. Chicken. I could not stop laughing! This meal was like the Charlie Brown of meals. Nothing went right!

Good grief!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends after work. Our waitress was pretty good, friendly. I really only care about food. I ordered the wings. They tasted fine - not great by any means. Not nearly as good as BWWs, which is pretty much next door, or Applebees. I think what I didn't like about them was that they were a little more expensive than getting wings elsewhere ($9.50 for 10 wings) but they were TINY! One of my friends had a pizza, which looked delicious. If I went back I'd probably try something else. If you're craving wings, head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love BJ's there is so much on the menu to pick from. I have been to two of their locations and every time, the staff is so friendly, the portions are big and the price is right. The honey sriracha brussel sprouts are AMAZING! Great place to go with your significant other or even a big group!"}
{"text":"LUNCH FOR TWO.

First off our server forgot to give us straws with our water, but when he brought water to an older couple next to us he did not forget to give them straws or a cup of water filled with new ice. Our water looked like it's been sitting out for a while because the ice was almost melted.

 & when they brought out our clam chowder they forgot to bring out crackers with it & it took forever to flag someone down for it.

Did I mention it was my boyfriend's birthday? It was a nice that they brought out a dessert for him, but they brought it out when I was in the bathroom. I mean, couldn't you wait a little bit until I came back out? He was sitting by himself with the damn dessert & a lit candle on it! (he didn't want to blow it out until I came back.)

Lastly, I usually get the jambalaya because it's one of the best I've had but today I tried the grilled chicken pasta & to my disappointment, it was totally bland.

I understand my boyfriend & I are young but that's no excuse to give us poor service. We still left the waiter 20%, undeservingly.

I only bumped it up an extra star because I usually come here & I never had a bad experience until today...on my boyfriends birthday. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Oh BJ's... your manager saved you from getting a 2 star review. We came here to watch the Sharks during the NHL playoffs which was also during the NBA playoffs. Not even exaggerating, EVERY single TV had basketball on... so we asked our server if they could turn ONE TV to the sharks game. So they did and some douche bag at the bar gets upset because the TV in front of him was changed even when there were tons of seats at the bar right in front of the other TVs. Anyways, long story short guy complains, bartender agrees it was stupid to change it, and they change it back to basketball. We were pissed but thankfully, the manager did his rounds to make sure everything was okay and ended up changing another TV for us where we had a good view. Thank you!

We come here very often during football and hockey season. Happy Hour is great, but make sure you sit in the bar area to get HH prices. The great white pizza is amazing, and so is the pizookie! I like it here because it's a great place to come with the family and have a beer!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of like Granite City and Gordon Biersch type places.   They Brew their own beer and have a good variety.  I really enjoy the Hefeweizen.   They have quite a few taps with other beers and will let you sample before you commit.  The menu is very big and also has a wide variety.  It's a good place to pick if you have a group of people with different tastes.  They even have healthier menu options too.  The service has always been good when I've gone as well.  I've had the Mahi and shrimp bowl as well as the Mahi tacos.  Both were good with nicely cooked and flaky Mahi."}
{"text":"There are a lot of bar and grill restaurants, so what makes BJ's stand out?

Service: The hostesses and servers are always friendly and willing to answer questions about the extensive menu. They always make me feel like a welcome guest.

Beer: They brew their own beer, and each type I have tried has been pretty good. They also have a respectable selection of other beers, as well as wines and cocktails.

Food: I am always impressed at how consistently good the menu items are. They serve lots of different types of food, and I have yet to find a weak link. The jambalaya I had yesterday was extremely delicious. It had meat or vegetable in every bite, and it was large enough for me to spread over lunch and dinner. Other hits include the calzones, pizza, burgers, pasta, and sandwiches.

They seem to be everywhere nowadays, but don't miss BJ's assortment of Pizookies. Get the original, or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate.

Ambiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling, so it's never that loud. The decor is modern and classy, making it a suitable place for just about any occasion.

Value: The portion sizes range from large to huge. Lunch specials start at $6, and regular prices are very fair.

This location is right next to the Harkins movie theater, and it makes a great place to stop after seeing a flick."}
{"text":"Really bad food!  The mini pizzas were nasty!  Had the barbecue and it was LOADED with BBQ sauce!  Basically a 6\" round pizza deep dish with a load of BBQ sauce squirted in top!

Provolone sticks were dry and they had a bad texture.  Really just not great food!

Highly disappointed and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Awful service and boring tasteless food.
They actually asked us to finish and leave so they could seat more people on a busy night.
Never back"}
{"text":"Slid into BJ's for dinner.  The wait was quick and the restaurant was nice enough.  I ordered the root beer cause it's supposedly made by them or something fancy idk the waiter suggested it so I went with it.  The menu was diverse to say the least. I thought about getting a pizza but just couldn't do it.  Then I noticed the spaghetti and thought \"it's time to get my olive garden on.\"  The spaghetti was actually pretty good.  The waiter refilled my root beer on the reg and it wasn't expensive at all...like a dollar or two more than chilis."}
{"text":"The food is good, but nothing that draws me to go there, besides the nice reward system they have. Also I love that every time we come they bring my daughter a garlic knot and some fruit! So smart considering kids are more behaved if they are not starving."}
{"text":"We need never to return. 1) One could not design a restaurant out in the middle of a parking lot where the cars are farther from the door than this place...in Ohio where winter happens.  2) Once inside (if you just HAVE to go) - insist on an inside table because the walls are not insulated - It's freezing in there. 3)Mammoth menu of no substance - they went for serving a vast amount of items rather than trying to make good food,  Service was good - just nothing in there that ever would make me want to return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner with my daughter. Food was excellent, we had the pineapple pizza, service was good. All in all a really nice experience."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant many times the food is great beer is good. so I went to pick up the order that I called in to go and a salad that they make that is really scrumptious with brussels sprouts and had before. I get all the way home and realized I left all the brussels sprouts off the salad. Well I called the restaurant of course I was upset this is my birthday dinner to myself and I got the manager and he was so kind he said I'll send someone out to deliver the salad the way it should be and a $25 gift card. Well I think that is a stellar restaurant I would always go back there I had liked them before but now I will always patronize this  restaurant check it out good food good drinks"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  From the pizza to the southern fried chicken you can't beat BJ's."}
{"text":"I've been to this BJ's many times and I have gotten great service & food every time.  They often have a wait to get a seat which is never a problem because it is never really long, they get you sat pretty quickly.  Clean restrooms and restaurant overall very sanitary (one little pet peeve).  The management team is also very helpful to their employees and are constantly walking around to make sure everything is going well.  The bussers are right on taking plates and breaking down the tables and the food runners are quick and like assisting"}
{"text":"I wasn't even aware of this restaurant opening until my friend told me about it, but I'm so glad she did. First off, the atmosphere is very nice and it has a nice casual feel to it. They have a huge menu of food options! I got the Mediterranean chicken pita and it was delicious. The potato skins are so good! Usually, I just take the cheese, bacon, scallions, etc off the top and skip the potato. At BJ's they double crisp the potatoes....AMAZING! The pizookie is incredible! If you're on a diet, it's totally worth breaking it for day! The staff is very friendly and it's a very clean establishment! I definitely will be returning! I love how close it is as well! It's right in the parking lot of South Hills Village mall."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of BJ's. Their pizzas are very flavorful, come in many varieties, and they have plenty other choices if you're not in the mood for that. My personal favorite is the barbecue chicken pizza."}
{"text":"Most of the time the service at the bar is good.  Food is alright.  I enjoy a few of their beer selections.  Attitudes of the management could be a bit better though.  

I also wish they had more selections on their small-plate menu."}
{"text":"I took my family here on Valentine's Day & the food/service was fantastic!!  The wait was only 5 minutes. Our waitress was warm, friendly & very helpful with beer & food selection. She had the patience of a saint with 2 seniors. My dad had the baked ziti which was absolutely delicious, my mom the spaghetti with jumbo meatballs also very flavorful & I had the chicken with vegetables from their light & fit section which was delicious! For dessert we ordered their signature freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. Total crowd pleaser. 
  As this restaurant is a brewery I must mention that their selection was vast with great variety. They offer 3 free 1ounce samples which our waitress helped select (but you can choose any on the menu) & the one my dad selected was delicious! He was very happy. 
  We can't wait to go back & try more selections from their huge menu. Awesome restaurant!!! 
Great decor inside too... huge space! 
Ya gotta go check it out ;-))"}
{"text":"I visit BJ's frequently for both dine-in and take-out. I'm always very happy with the quality of food, especially the California Chicken Sandwich, and the Salmon! The unique cocktails make happy hour a delight and the selection of beers is extensive and always evolving.

The only thing I've had an issue with is a medium-well burger, it always come out WELL done. Other than that, the staff is quick, friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place had below average customer  service. Plus took a long time for our food to arrive. After waiting for a long time before we even recieved drinks. Never received refills or even silverware or napkins. I had to go find some from another waiter. The food was good and that's the reason for the rating."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night for my husbands birthday. The wait wasn't bad at all but our service was horrible. We were not checked on until about 30 plus minutes into our meal, our water was empty, we didn't get our ketchup or sauces or anything. My husband had a free pizookie and that didn't come for another 40 min!!! And we asked ahead of time to get it started!! Then we waited another 20 min for someone (who was not our sever) get our check so we can pay. & my husband actually had to physically get up and ask for our bill so we can leave!!!! He didn't even give us our bill!!!! We were here for a total of 2 hours and 30 min!!! Almost 3 freakin hours!!!!!! This was ridiculous & on all days my husbands birthday."}
{"text":"This place is great. First time here had a great time and excellent food. The pulled pork sandwich was seriously awesome! The calamari was fried to perfection actually it was the best calamari I've had on the west side. The beers were delicious couldn't have had a better dinner I will definitely make this my go to spot :)"}
{"text":"They have nice drafts, decent food, really horrible service.  On our last visit the check was on the table while I still had the plate half full and a full glass of beer.  I thought it was a restaurant not a fast food joint.

There is a continuous pressure on selling more even while you're still eating, yet never enough time to bring water or even refill glasses.
I don't remember a time I was able to relax and enjoy a meal here.
On several occasions our server made us feel like we should have been grateful she was serving us.  Most of them have some sort of off-putting attitude as if they'd rather not be there serving guests.

Used to come frequently, even had the app but can't be bothered any more. 
Restrooms can get really gross looks like no one cares.
Luckily the area has no shortage of better places that make sure customers have time to enjoy their meals and drinks."}
{"text":"I have been to the  McCandless restaurant in the past with my first visit to the Upper Saint Clair location yesterday. They have a large varied menu and if your a craft beer drinker, they have a nice selection. We went at an off time and it was not busy.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful and when  she left to go on break, was followed by someone with the same level of attention and friendliness. We both agreed it was good chain restaurant food! Everything was cooked perfectly with good size portions  I struggled with a rating of 3-4 but will say as chains go, we both will return!"}
{"text":"The food is always great, no matter what I get.  The wait staff is attentive and their service is top-notch.  I always go during lunch it seems a lot busier at night.  I plan on going at least once every couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Stopped in after going to the casino. Was highly impressed. Burgers were awesome fries were good and there in house beer was great. Not a one complaint will go back and try something else! Also ambiance and service was spot on! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"As chain restaurants go, this one is pretty good. Nice beer selection, huge food menu, and pretty reasonable prices.

My husband and I each had a beer (IPA for him, pale ale for me), and they were both really good. We split an appetizer of mini bruschetta, which I thought was pretty tasty. (Too much bread-to-topping ratio for my spouse, but he's not really a bread person like me!) He had the pulled pork sandwich, and I had the Asian chopped salad. Yummy fried onions on the sandwich, and the meat was nicely smoked. He was quite pleased! My salad was fine, nothing special, but the portion size was reasonable and thankfully the salad itself was not overdressed.

Our waitress was a little overeager, and the back room was a little cold, but otherwise there's not much to complain about. The food was good; the beer was great; and I'm sure we'll be back when we're on that side of town."}
{"text":"Good beers and service. I love the stuffed mushroom appetizer so dee-lish. They have a gluten sensitive menu you too. The California chicken sandwich is my so good!! Grilled chicken with avocado and green chilies with pepper jack on sour dough. I know it's a chain but this location has a locals feel. Good eats with TV's everywhere. So no one will miss the game."}
{"text":"Awesome deal $19.95 dinner for two!!

The salads were good, the pizza was ok, and the dessert good too!

My husband went to picked up the food and he told me the people at the take out, weren't very kind."}
{"text":"We absolutely love BJ's Restaurant in Summerland. The staff & food is spot on. It's one of our favorite places. Parking can be a little crowded, but there a quite a few restaurants in the area so that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Whoda thunk that a chain restaurant would serve some of the best chowder I've ever had.

We decided to take a drive to Akron on an unusually warm November day to check out the newest brew pub in the area.  As a national chain, I didn't expect much...I was wrong.

The place was hopping and they told us to expect a 20-minute wait.  No problem we planned to enjoy one of their branded brews while waiting.  But we didn't have a chance as we were paged in less that five minutes.

Our server, Matt, appeared immediately and gave us a rundown of their own beers plus several from local breweries.  I ordered their Piranha Pale Ale and my wife had the Harvest Hefeweizen.  Both were tasty.

I've had a tease for clam chowder for months so I decided to try theirs along with their pepperoni personal pizza (don't tell the trainer).  My wife ordered the Back and Bleu Burger.

The chowder was the best I've had in years and the pizza was excellent.  My wife's burger was also first-rate.  You can't go wrong with any of these.

The service was excellent.  Although the place was packed we didn't have to wait for anything.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BJs. The service is always outstanding.  The food and beer is standard for a BJs which is pretty good. But the service here has always been a notch above"}
{"text":"My husband had a stroke which damaged his voice but otherwise you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Went to BJS on  eastern tonight for daughters birthday...waitress Nicole served us all one beer and appetizers,...after what was to be our second and last /only had had one /she arrived at the table and rudely and loudly announced we could have another but husband couldn't. Never asked if he possibly had drank too much! He was humiliated. Manager was just as rude as he said she wasn't rude(he never heard it) this was the most unprofessional manager in a restaurant, ever -way over his head and horrible people skills. Needless to say our night was  ruined no one offered any apologies. The waitress and manager shiwed total disrespect  and we will never return. Horrible horrible customer service ."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have visited BJ'a few times now without disappointment! The menue is certainly not lacking and the service is outstanding! Perfect location for a concert at the stsdium or a day out on the West side. The french dip sandwich is a lunch must!"}
{"text":"BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu.  The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be, Avocado Spring Rolls!  Delicious, warm, a joy to eat.  I swear to god, the 2nd time I had these was better then the first.  

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5??  Well, the first time I went with a friend, we tried one of the microbrews.  It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion.  Anyway, I stick to the beers I know and love, same with the food :-)"}
{"text":"Hopefully not a sign to come as my second visit was a major step down from my first trip. A buddy of mine was in town and thought this would be a good spot to take him to dinner.

Pretty busy for a Thursday night which in turn meant a pretty long wait before our first beer arrived. Host and waitress were both pleasant but the food this time out was just OK.

Brussel sprouts weren't crispy like they were during our first trip. My buddy ordered the Chicago style pizza and it looked good as that's what I had the first time around.

My meal however was pretty forgettable, and I knew I shouldn't have ordered it. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Considering you can get a comparable meal at most chain restaurants this was the most bland version I've ever had.

Everything was just a bit dry. Chicken was saved only by the toppings but I barely touched the mash potatoes. My side salad I started with was fine albeit I hate when they load up on croutons.

I'll certainly be back but I think I'll stick to pizza or bar food in the future and avoid the entrees."}
{"text":"As I walked up through the back. On 12-28-16 The employees were out by the dumpster yelling and screaming at each other..  It was busy got a table for two right away. Our server was awful. As soon as he walked up and greeted us all you smelled was cigarette smoke all over him!!!!! Nasty. I ordered the Thai chicken bowl ask for sauce on the  side and it came out wrong. There was hair in my girlfriend soup..  Our waiter never came and asked us how are food was or refilled our drinks.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow. The yelpers had this place down. Tried to hit this place for a quick bite and wait for a friend.  Sat at bar. Wobbly silly high back chair was a bit uncomfortable.  Menu and bar top was dirty. Bartender was way busy chatting with workers at end. Tables needed clearing. The front desk wait staff..three of them talking to each other. No service. Waited 10 mins. All the staff in the place were completely wrapped up with themselves. Joke.  Left bar walked to staff at front an politely chatted with them of my lack of help and dirty sitting area. And I asked that if front of house is this uncaring...what about the kitchen? They did not say their kitchen staff was on it. Lol. I tried to help.  They were so apathetic and...I told them that I say it with love and Yelpers had their number. Texted my friend. Got in car and ate and drank at Buffalo Wild Wings across the parking lot. Clueless. Never going here again. Afraid of what they do in the kitchen if they are that clueless front of house."}
{"text":"Great food poor service my step mom fell and broke her finger here on my birthday and not one employee offered to help"}
{"text":"Beer and desserts are great.  Food is hit and miss and the servers are very nice but if they are busy you will definitely be pressured to order quickly and then get the heck out.  Pork chop looked amazing but was significantly underdone and underseasoned as well.  Steak on my left ordered medium rare was blood rare, sent back twice and gave up.  Stick with the burgers and you will be much happier."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is delicious. Every time I come here I try something new and so far have not been disappointed yet. I had the ribs and let me tell you! It will be a travesty if you go there and not treat yourself.  It's worth it. Trust me. Thumbs up for BJ's."}
{"text":"Dinner on 3/2016 with friends.  Five(5)  different entrees. No one raved about their meals. They were \"OK\".  I personally had the \"new\" dish soba noodles with some peanut sauce.  It was soupy, weak tasting and definitely not something I would ever order again. I did not finish the meal.  Another party ordered a pizza. Nothing that warrants $15 charge.  Basic and plain.  Another party ordered a salmon dish, didn't finish the meal.  The steak dinner was rated \"ok\". And the salad entree was not finished.   We passed on dessert. Not the upside, waitstaff was excellent.  Given there are so many restaurants in the area to chose, I will continue to seek out better food."}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service bad choice in restaurant our waitress Brandi lacked in customer service skills, I myself working with the public know it doesn't matter if your having a bad day or you're just too tired to be at work there is no excuse customers pay for good service you need to put a big smile on your face and get the job done right because without customers you don't have a job."}
{"text":"This was a great place for a date night. We had a pretty long wait, but who can blame them! It was the second week open and the food was amazing.

Service was fantastic. They even text you when your table is ready. The greeters were welcoming; the servers were helpful and timely; the other staff checked on our table occasionally too! 

Try the avocado rolls for an appetizer! I also got the bison burger which was the best \"healthy\" burger I've had in a while. 

Great food. Great atmosphere. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp had negative reviews. Last week, I was in a party of 8 including my husband and 2 year old. BJ's was running busy and we had to wait a good while for our table-about 30-40 min but it is what it is, I didn't mind that. We finally got to our table and waited about 20 minutes before a waiter showed up.  We placed drink orders and about 20 minutes later, someone comes and delivers drinks to 7 of the 8 people.  We finally track down someone to tell them we are missing a drink.  OK fine whatever. 

So we place our food orders.We get the food for everyone but the pregnant lady (me) and the 2 year old. Just as with the drinks, NO ONE stops and even checks to see if we all have our food, it's literally dump and run with the waiters.  So I'm thinking surely it will come soon, and wait, and wait, along with a toddler who is getting ticked because he has no food.  Because I haven't seen our waiter in forever, I get up and go track him down where of course, he's clueless.  I tell him to cancel my order and I take my son and leave because at this point, everyone else has pretty much finished their food.  I understand busy, but at least check and make sure everyone at the table has their order!  

I told a manager on the way out what had happened and he told me that how we were treated was unacceptable.  Well, duh.  So I took my hungry, grumpy 2 year old and left. 

I have been here before and the service has always been so-so, but they just took a nosedive off a cliff for me here."}
{"text":"This place is always Busy but usually can get a seat with on 30 minutes. We have eat there quite a few times and the food and beer has always been great. The wait staff has always been friendly and spot on. Large menu with lots to pick from for all types of tastes."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was impressed with how they kept everything moving during this busy hour. 

I had the Salmon Quinoa bowl (lunch menu) and it was the perfect size. I asked for the [Ginger Soy] sauce on the side and I'm glad I did, otherwise I think it may have been too salty. 

The service was great for us as well. Next time I want to try one of their many pizookies!!

I don't know that it stands out too much (beside the pizookies) from other bar-restaurant chains but if you need a good solid place to go for different palates, this Eastern location can do the trick."}
{"text":"Amanda R is THE most amazing waitress I have ever had.  Super attentive, timing perfect.
I had a million different diet restrictions and she listened and handled it with ease.  
BJ's is very lucky to have her as an employee.
Food was fabulous too."}
{"text":"Definitely the new \"It\" place in Akron/Montrose. Dropping by for a Friday lunch with a friend, we found the Summit Mall parking lot and restaurant full. Big space with a variety of seating options. We liked the small two-seater booth. 
I enjoyed the clam chowder/chicken avocado sandwich lunch special. It was a bountiful taste treat, although the chowder was a bit too thick and lumpy. 
The waitress was friendly, fast, and very busy. 
I will be back to try out some of the large options of beer and other entrees. Nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of BJ's in California...and I like consistency. I was looking forward to a gluten free pizza and a gluten free pizzookie and that's exactly what I got...the best part was the service with a smile from Jennifer. I would definitely return to this location. Great gluten free pizza and dessert...yum yum...oh and the house-made root beer is not to be missed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. They offer a wide variety on their menu, but are mainly known for the pizza and brew. I went with a friend, we ordered onion strings to start off with and they were ridiculously tasty. For the main course my friend had the small barbecue pizza, and I ordered the California sandwich (think thats what it was called). Anyways the pizza was kinda deep dish style and cooked perfectly. The sandwich consist of grilled chicken, avocado, chipotle sauce, mayo, and peppers on garlic bread, and it was fantastic. 

We were stuffed, big portions, and top notch customer service, I couldn't walk by one employee without them greeting me. I will come back here again and again.

Oh and are bill with generous tip came to $40"}
{"text":"Had the calamari and it was super greasy and did not taste good at all, had to send it back. Ordered the mahi-mahi with a shrimp. The server Kenneth is awesome"}
{"text":"Some of the food was very tasty. The check, however, arrived when we were still eating our main course. We weren't being slow and there were only a few of us. Half the restaurant was empty too."}
{"text":"I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because the food is pretty darn good when they get the order right. I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order, in writing, right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?!

The wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept."}
{"text":"This is our \"Thurs - Happy hour joint\"
The flatbreads are awesome as are the sticky rootbeer ribs !
We like racking up the points for future discounts! 
Staff is attentive & courteous! 
Keep up the stellar work!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich  was really good.  Wife got California chicken sandwich and tomatoe bisque soup which she really enjoyed.  We are here for lunch on a Friday and they are very busy.  

All in all, a good place.  They also have a big drink selection. Would be a good place to come for happy hour. They new their own beer and have a huge selection."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant 3 chances and they have struck out all 3 times. I'm not one to write reviews, but I feel that a review is necessary for BJ's. Never have I been so disappointed on multiple occasions by a restaurant, and I don't understand how they are still getting business. My 3 encounters are below: 

1st visit: I and 2 friends went on a Saturday evening (around 9 o'clock, so the dinner rush was gone and we sat immediately). The waitress was initially nice, but when she found out that we were only ordering dessert she quickly lost her charm. She was rude and repeatedly gave us dirty looks throughout the night. Then when our food arrived, she returned with the check before we reached our 2nd bite. 

2nd visit: Returned with a group of 8 for a birthday lunch. The drink orders were repeatedly wrong, the waiter had few manners when it came to reaching across the table and mixing up orders, and to top it off one of our guests was elbowed in the head by a passing staff member. 

3rd visit: Five of us sat in the bar area to avoid the 2 hr wait to sit on a Monday night. The waitress (who I feel bad for) had to repeatedly apologize to us because she was the only staff member working the entire bar area. Meanwhile, there were 2 or 3 staff members just standing around by the kitchen door. It took a minimum of 15-20 minutes for her to make it back to our table. After the 20 minute wait to receive our drinks and get our orders in, we waited an hour for our food to come. We then had to request our checks when we ordered dessert because we had a movie to get to. When our checks finally came, they were all wrong. We also never had our waters refilled. And to top it off after the 2 hour ordeal we were late to get to the movie theater and it was sold out by that point. You'd think getting to a restaurant by 4:45 on a Monday would be plenty of time to make it to a 6:45 movie showing...clearly not. 

I am very disappointed by this restaurant. They are now reaching the point where they can no longer use being a 'new' restaurant as an excuse. The service is horrendous and slow, and the food is mediocre at best. 

The only reason I am giving them a 2 stars is because the beer is pretty good. Unfortunately, a good beer will only get you so far, and good beer paired with good food and staff can be found in MANY other places within a 15 minute radius."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cobb salad, it looked like a nice salad but the lettuce had that old, nasty taste,  I  won't go back!"}
{"text":"BJs is a favorite for our family. There is always something for everyone when it comes to food and beer selection. Depending on the time of day you arrive, you will probably wait and have to park in the adjacent lot. One trick we used to do growing up that we still do, is drop one person off at the door to put our name down while the other parks. It saves time! 

At BJs, they have a skinny menu that tells you the calories for the items. For those who don't care, there plenty of higher calorie tasty menu items as well- Burgers, Pizza flatbreads, etc

BJs has also jumped on the Sriracha band wagon, a favorite hot sauce to us Asians. They have created a Mac and cheese with Sriracha sauce... Amazing! My daughter likes this dish and I have taken several bites off her plate, I do like it. If you want something spicy or have kids that have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon, this is a GoTo.

I really enjoy their lower calorie items like the seared Ahi tuna salad or their quinoa bowls. The ahi tuna salad is just fantastic. A large bowl of greens, with dabs of wasabi sauce on the sides of the dish. The ahi tuna is nicely seared and adds a fab protein. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have been there many time and have always had great service, warm food, and cooked way that I ordered. Not to mention location very clean."}
{"text":"We had guests visiting from California, so we decided to take them out to BJ's for dessert for their famous pizookie! What a horrible idea. Each one of us had it, and each one of us got sick. I mean sick like vomiting and diarrhea! Will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, really nice assortment of menu items, and big group friendly.  I had a few too many beers to recall much other than a happy feeling about the place, especially since my jambalaya dish was tasty.  And they had avocado egg rolls that I really liked, that was while I was still on my first beer."}
{"text":"The food and service were good when we stopped by here recently at the bar.

Here's what we shared:

- Bowl Of Piranna Pale Ale Chili *big enough for two people
- Piranna Pale Ale
- Vegetable Shrimp Penne Primavera

For everything, we spent only $39.15, not including tip.

If you are looking for a good place to grab drinks and food relatively late at night, this BJ's location is a good choice."}
{"text":"The cooks and cashiers really need to start reading the orders, THE SIDES ARE ON ALL LABELS. We do not have the any sides at work. When we order food we would like to have everything. Our time during break is very limited on when to eat."}
{"text":"Andrew was a great server! Even introduced us to the rewards card! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Pizza is bland. We tried it for a second time still nope. We wont be back."}
{"text":"I was craving the chicken parmigiana, which evidently had been taken off of the menu for some unknown reason. I asked the waiter about it and they made it anyway. It was awesome. We also had the gluten free pizza which is evidently one of the best around. Even a gluten free pizookie, which was amazing! Very busy, but they do take call a heads with parties of six or less. Conveniently placed sports so that you can converse and not miss the action. A great experience. Thanks, BJ's!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at BJ'S but this time the food was different compared to other times we've ate there.. but service is very good!"}
{"text":"Came in around 5pm and sat at the bar. Greeted by Courtney, the bartender. She was super friendly. She made sure to point out the happy hour specials, and brought our drinks right away. Ordered a shot, which was very generous in size, and food. My husband and I split the California burger and the avocado egg rolls. Both were delicious!! Courtney kept checking on us the entire time and was quick with anything we asked for. We, most definitely, will be back bc of her service."}
{"text":"This is up there in one of my top 5 restaurants. I get excited every time we go here, like a little kid would get excited for Disneyland, lol. Their menu selection is never ending. A part of me wishes their menu was smaller, because I never know what to get! I feel like I am always missing out on something! But, no matter what I have ordered I have never been let down. Their Avocado egg rolls are so good I can barely stand it! I am not a beer drinker, but I order beer here cause it's so delicious. Their seasonal pumpkin beer is amazing. My boyfriend raves about the pazookie dessert, but we are always too full by the time we are done I just can't do it. I told him one of these days we will just come in for beers and dessert and skip the meal, ha! 

Give the place a go if you haven't yet. I doubt you would be disappointed, unless you are looking to woo your date with some romantic meal, then go somewhere else. No, it doesn't have ambiance as I saw one person complain about... but this is not that kind of restaurant. It's a busy loud restaurant with sports on the TV's, what do you expect? Go to a classy joint for a romantic night, this is a low to moderately priced brewery people! And a wonderful place to grab a bite of great food and a good beer!"}
{"text":"this is our after work spot they are open till midnight on Sunday's the food is consistent and they have 10 different salades prices are what you pay for way better then applebees the service is average witch isn't a bad thing there drinks are to expensive for me and they are the inventors of the pieookie"}
{"text":"I visited BJ's last night and was SO impressed! The employees spoiled my one-year-old son with a plate of fruit and friendly service. And even just thinking about the pizza makes my mouth water. Thank you BJ's!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. .. loved the service.  I only gave 4 stars because they forgot to give us silverware even when they brought my husband's salad. So the salad sat there until they brought our food about 5 minutes later. The manager apologized and asked how long the salad sat there but my husband told them not to worry about it. We will definitely be back. The chicken parm was soooo good. The mashed potatoes too. Mozzarella sticks could have come with more marinara but they were crispy and gooey. Yummy! My husband had a steak and really enjoyed it. He asked for a 1 sauce before he got it but after the first bite said it didn't need sauce. Overall....yum!!!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered their curbside service. Just another reason to love this restraunt!"}
{"text":"Deep Dish Pizza .. BJ's Classic is my usual.  The first time I tried this was on Eastern & since then I've only been able to order this lol!  You know when you know what you want, but still you look at the menu?  

Love love love this pizza & it melts in your mouth.  Preferably, I sit in a bar booth, but have sat at the bar once & in the restaurant.  Always had good service & when I didn't once the person told me he was new, which I can appreciate."}
{"text":"Taylor, our server is taylor-made for excellent customer service, knowledge over beers/beverages, the menu & overall is the perfect person you'd want to get when taking your parents out for dinner.  

Mom only likes thin crust pizza & dad loves beer, neither have been to BJ's cause where they used to live doesn't have one so trusted me to order for them.  Taylor helped w/ the beer & since it's Oktoberfest, brought us a sample.  Mom & I decided on the four-beer tasting & dad got the Oktoberfest Lager.  Paired perfectly w/ our pizza & the Cardinal's baseball game as we sat in a large lounge booth.  

(Mom & I's ratings of our Four-Beer Tasting .. Harvest Hef & Oktoberfest were our fav!  Jeremiah Red was Tangy & the Brewette was heavy.)

I ordered them my fav's & the best of both worlds, savory & sweet!  The BJ's Classic Combo 9' Deep Dish Pizza & the mini Salted Caramel Pizookie to share!  They loved it & mom said it wa the best deep dish ever!  

I ordered off the salad & pizza off of the lunch menu.  The seasonal Watermelon & Feta Salad, was lite, delish & the watermelon was sweet!  Also a 6' Deep Dish Pepperoni Pizza.  We arrived earlier than the happy hour, which starts at 3pm, but they have an excellent lunch menu & portion size is filling!  

Overall, an A+ experience & I have dined at this BJ's about five times before.  I have sat twice in the dining area & the rest at the bar/lounge area.  I love the beers & food, but mostly Taylor stood out enough for me to want to leave a five star review.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We went to BJ's every once in a while because it was close and the food was decent. 

However recently service quality has seriously slipped. The waitress was cocky (not in a funny way - rather in an obnoxious way). 
The beer took forever. I mean they have beer on tap why does it take like 20 minutes to get one even though the store was barely half-full? 
The food is ok, but not great. A little overpriced too. 

Probably not going here again any time soon. They need to up their game."}
{"text":"Service was very poor :( food was ok. I wouldn't recommend this location. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love BJ's!  We really like the happy hour - tonight we had boneless wings & flatbread pizza. Great combo!  Our server Alan was fabulous!  Very attentive & but not bothersome!  Pazookis are the best!  Traditional chocolate chip cookie-can't go wrong!  Sweet warm goodness!"}
{"text":"Place was ok. The food wasn't all that great. Few things we ordered.

Half rack ribs with mash potatoes and fries. 
Stuff mushrooms
Calamari 
Ribeye steak with asparagus and mash potatoes 
Ahi tuna and chips
Pizza
Pazookie ( chocolate cookie with ice cream)

The service was great and towards the end of the meal the manager came to serve us, which I thought was weird but whatever. Overall I would only come back if I had too. I wouldn't personally pick this place if I wanted to go eat."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible.  I've been to so many BJs across US from Ca to Tx, this one was by far the worst one.  Service was great and my waitress was sweet but my chicken in Mediterranean deep dish pizza was old and had a funny taste to it.  Can't believe they use old chicken, as a shareholder im definitely going to file a complaint with management."}
{"text":"Went here because that's where a date wanted to go.....I must say our server Haley was outstanding.  She redeemed BJ's.  The food was actually good and I loved the corn fritters with bacon aioli.  
Thank you Haley!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Not even 24 hours after my previous review, the manager for this particular BJ's eached out to me via phone and asked me about my experience. As a courtesy, they provided me with a gift card for my next visit in lieu of the not-so-great previous experience.  I honestly did not expect them to even care enough to read through their reviews and make contact either. This is a clear sign of business that knows what it is doing and knows how to handle themselves. I have always loved BJ's and will continue to visit in the future! Great food and even better staff!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was very unattentive! She ignored us most of the time of us being at the restaurant. We constantly had to repeat ourselves. Super annoying! She kept trying to push dessert on us even after we said no multiple times. I don't appreciate having to try and find my waitress because she can't keep our waters full. Not only was the waitress unattentive but we also had 8 other staff members bringing our items and when we requested something they would relay the message to her and we would wait FOREVER for our drinks. Food was great.... Bonefish Grill is better!"}
{"text":"I'm really not a fan of this place or their food.  However, my husband loves BJ's and it is right down the street.

We come here a couple times a month.  I've tried a bunch of things on their menu, trying to find something I like.

Appetizer-wise I've had their: sliders, fried asparagus, calamari, and fried artichokes.  The artichokes are my favorite out of these.

I've also tried a variety of other things: burger, pizza, grilled cheese, soups, salads, chicken flatbread, etc.  The grilled cheese is terrible.  Not sure how you mess up a grilled cheese?  The bread was so hard I could feel it cutting my throat.  The burgers are bland.  I've had a soggy pizza here twice.  

You can't go wrong with a soup in a bread bowl or a salad.  Also, you have to get the Pizookie.  Sometimes that's all I order.  The original chocolate chip Pizookie is the best.  They're $3 on Tuesdays!

The last time we came here was actually for brunch (first time- meeting some friends).  Brunch was terrible.  I had their eggs and bacon breakfast.  We were a party of 4, and half of our order was missing.  Pancakes, toast, potatoes, etc.  Something was missing from each person's order.

Not impressed.  If it weren't for my husband loving this place, I would not return."}
{"text":"BJ's makes due when you're with a group of people who are all craving something different. Although the food is mediocre, there's something for everyone.

I've been here several times, but my most recent visit was Saturday after the Spartan Race. We were a group of 6. We started with nachos, potato skins, and wings. Potato skins and wings were pretty good. The nachos were okay..

I was craving pizza so I got an individual 5 cheese pizza with pepperoni. Half of the pizza was good. The reason I say that is because the whole inner half was soggy. A complete mush, so I was only able to eat half.

Had a chocolate chip pazookie for dinner. Yum! Service was really good."}
{"text":"I've been going to BJ's Restaurant since i was a little girl and i'm really glad that it is still around.  My husband daughter and i were in the area and decided to stop by and eat some good pizza while watching some Sunday Football.  The.y have several screens, so we were able to watch several games at once and were were lucky enough that there was one booth left at the bar.  We ordered half pepperoni and half buffalo which is one of my favorites and of course the artichoke and spinach dip.  Our pizza arrive and it was perfectly fine but our server thought it was overcooked and surprised us with a whole new pizza without warning.  We had originally ordered a large and we think he misunderstood and brought us a medium, but he ended up bringing a whole other one without even asking.  We left with our stomach's full otherwise we would have ordered a pazzooki...darn."}
{"text":"Love this place! The menu as a nice variety of items and at good prices. My whole family enjoys going there. And I love that they add a rewards card."}
{"text":"After coming from the bjs across in summerlin because of terrible service it felt good coming to this bjs and being taken care of without asking, our server ericka was so on point, and the other waiters were helpful as well"}
{"text":"This location should have a \"no coloreds\" sign in the window so i know not to enter next time. I walk in was seated fairly quick and so after 20minutes of sitting and no acknowledgement from anyone on a half busy night, i go tell the hostess about the situation, she tells me \"oh im sorry about that\" and acts like she goes to look for help, i go back to sit down thinkin someone is coming to take care of us, WRONG, what i see is the people who were seated 10/15 minutes after me being served, meanwhile i still havent even been acknowledged, that was my cue to leave. I would love to think race wasnt the case but theres no proof of that, there was about 5 black people total there including me & my gf, sadly enough the \"manager\" was black one busser and one bar tender. The manager excuse was that shes sorry and that \"they know better\" very insincere and uncaring. After barely giving two fucks and doing nothing about the situation she said she would love us to stay and eat, i declined w no hesitation. Me and my gf are very polite good people we didnt deserve that kindve treatment, &even during this whole thing were never rude spoke loud at anyone or anything of that magnitude. Sad i had to find out this way"}
{"text":"Love this place. Large menu. Something for everyone. We're here every Friday night. Friendly professional staff. Great atmosphere. New menu items regularly."}
{"text":"It was ok enjoyed the root beer ribs , calamari and jambalaya... I've been eating here for years and starting to notice portions getting ridiculously smaller especially when it comes to the calamari which is something I enjoyed here . Time to find a new fav"}
{"text":"There were a massive number of empty tables both inside and on the patio, yet we were told there would be an hour wait.  The hostess claimed that she didn't have enough servers to seat anyone.  We took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came for lunch Saturday before Christmas.  The place was packed, we sat at a high top at the bar.  Great service by Ashley! Loved the Bison burger and Piranha Pale ale. Wife had shrimp and asparagus penne which she liked but very saucy.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.  I got steak house one. It was so delicious best steak dinner I ever had. I ate it all and usually when I eat steak out I save half for later. Well I didn't with this one. It was that good. If you go there you have to try it. You'll love it like I did."}
{"text":"Chandler Chamber of Commerce Event hosted by BJ's ...

Food was really good!  There were probably over 100 of us at the event and the service was surprisingly good as well."}
{"text":"The wait was CRAZY, but it was the weekend and several prom dates were there so I  can over look that, the pizza was great, the drinks were awesome, the service was amazing, the pizookie was wayyyyy too sweet.  I would opt for a different dessert."}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying I had a pretty bad experience about 2 weeks ago, in which a manager contacted me about my experience..Thank You for that! but I've yet to receive my e-gift card. So just because I had one bad experience didn't mean I wasn't going to give them another try! Returned and OMG I had an AMAZING experience! Thanks to server Ruben.A! Server was on top of everything and food was great!! Best service I received EVER and we travel a lot cruises and everything. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Kelly our server was awesome.  On top of every thing & this location reminds me of our Vegas location.  Usually, I stay away from chains & want to try what the area has to offers that's different from Vegas, such as the ma & pa's, but two new places for me ended up making me ill & unhappy so here I am at a place that my tummy can trust.  

Being a chain restaurant, I felt like I was in our neighborhood BJ's. The medium BJ's Deep Dish pizza was the same yummy pizza that I get w/ no bell peppers or tomatoes, side of ranch.  Clean restaurant, quick service & friendly server Kelly equals a happy customer."}
{"text":"No no no-   Always good service and food......till now! After waiting 15 minutes to be offered a beer- it is a brew house- yes?? Waiter slides us 2 menus and says- \"I'll be back.....no,no, no I said and he looked right at me and gone! When he came back I said that I never wait more than 10 minutes to be offered a cold beer and that it had been more than 20- asked if it would be another 15-20 before beers came - his response- probably! Huh!? You said probably? Yes I did. Requested manager and reported that and she apologized- said she would take our drink orders and handle it-----oh but not to be- another 15 min. wait........Cmon folks.....someone has $millions$ wrapped up in this operation- don't p--s it away!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at Bjs for the first time last week, overall good experience but the hostess Mulan was so disrespectful and I truly do not understand how she has a costumer service job with the way she rolls her eyes. I watched her backtalk her other hostess who was being so kind and then she treated us very poorly when we asked if our name was next. When I asked her name she gave it to us with a lot of attitude. Bjs would be better without her"}
{"text":"I love BJS! The bartenders are awesome and the beer is the best! I highly recommend the Lightswitch.  Their mini pizzas are just the perfect size for happy hour.  If you're at the bar and have a game you'd like to watch, the bartenders are great about getting it on one of the TVs for you."}
{"text":"It wasn't the same as the chandler restaurant... the food was good, but the beer just wasn't the same."}
{"text":"we got there and the place looked good, we were seated right away. we had the most amazing waitress! Heather last name started with H.  she knew the menu well and answered all my husband's dumb questions with polite patience. she  kept us entertained during courses and made sure we had everything. spectacular service even though she had alot of tables and was treating them the same from what we could see. we will be back to this location because of her. we would recommended our friends to go see Heather. thanks"}
{"text":"Bar tables are good to see TV and mingle.  Love the happy hour prices

Every time we come, we try something different on the menu and are usually pleased with the taste and temperature.  Staff and manager seem to care about making sure things are right.  So if you don't like something, they are usually willing to help make it a better experience for you."}
{"text":"Truely hurts my feelings to do this to one of my favorite eateries since claimjumpers but it is what it is ..... My lady friend and i went here especially for pizookie day .ordered appetizers stuff mushrooms calamari and some kind of new hot wings she ordered ... She says her wings were bland and didnt have enough rub on them they brought more rub thee calamari was bland as well even drizzles of lemon juice did not help or assist . No problem mushrooms were fine ..... So now we're awaiting our main course which we both decided on jambalaya , to our surprise both our meals came mines with extra chicken but missing shrimps on both . So waiter gets manager which i believe his name was ,kevin, !he comes out and tries to sooth us and to make things better , i guess he had thee kitchen prepare our shrimp which came out 5 minutes  later on the side so now we have to toss our shrimp in our meal . At tht time we were kinda done with this establishment so we ask for to go boxes and our dessert  , where the waiter informed us we could only get one pizookie per table which prompts me to look at the flyer ..... Which states with a purchase of 9.95 u get a pizookie no where on it does it state one per table i mean did yawl want us to split our party up and sit at the bar to make more of a mess to clean i suppose .at the ens of the day we got 2 but the experience at this location is not worth me coming back all bjs are already miles away from me but i think ill stick with thee one on charleston instead i mean on a 70 dollar bill didnt get  a appetizer taken off are anything like seriously bring my shrimp on the side and think that would make thee issue better i seriously doubt it"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. Service was  good and  food was excellent! The light beer on tap actually had some flavor."}
{"text":"Every time I go the food is great and the wait staff is always amazing and so patient and attentive. The shrimp tacos, French dip sandwich and deep dish pizzas are so good!"}
{"text":"We are on an excursion from the beautiful city of San Diego to the breathtaking Majesty of the Grand Canyon, and on our journey we found sustenance at BJ's Restaurant in Peoria off of Northern Ave. Once you get there it looks like any other BJ's, but in this particular location lies a hidden gem. Her name is Crystal, the waitress of your dreams. She was attentive, kind, funny, and knew her stuff. She simply looked around the table once and had an idea of what we may want. She noticed there was a gluten-free menu in front of my sister in law and immediately recommended gluten free treats, drinks and meals. My father in law is Spanish speaking and she was able to take his order and give him suggestions in Español. While taking your order, all of her attention is on you and nothing else, maximizing accuracy and ease of communication. After the orders were placed, she repeated all of the orders to each guest with clarity and precision. There was a mix up in the kitchen with our order and she caught it as soon as the order came out, she brought it to us as a complimentary dish to apologize for the mix up and begged our forgiveness for the mistake. Even in the face of adversity Crystal kept her head on a swivel and her eye on the prize. She conducted herself with poise and class. Everything was delicious, the drinks were cold and refreshing, and we had a great time laughing and conversing with not just each other, but with our gracious server, and new friend, Crystal. We will surely stop at this BJ's again on the way back to our beloved San Diego, and if fate will allow it, we will be granted the privilege of being served by Peoria's diamond in the rough; Crystal: The waitress of our dreams. 
Ps. Try the Mediterranean Pita wrap..."}
{"text":"Who knows how many stars it would get if we were able to actually try the menu.  I'm assuming that based on the number of people waiting for a table, he food should be pretty good.  So you're probably wondering why I'm giving it 2 stars if we apparently didn't eat here.  This review is solely based on service, or lack thereof.  We walked in and there were 5 people ahead of us at the check-in desk.  When we walked out more than 5 minutes later, the same 5 people were still in line.  There were 3 people behind the desk.  One was on the phone, and I'm not really sure what the other 2 were doing.  I thought one was talking to the first guest in line, but then she turned and was doing who knows what and the line still wasn't moving.  If a place is that busy and has a long line of people wanting to check-in, they need to make it a priority to address their guests - don't ignore them."}
{"text":"Hosts were rude and short upon arrival.   We were dismissed at first then given instructions to stand and wait. Hostess that seated us sprinted to the table and seemed irritated we were behind.  Zero engagement.  Dining room was empty as well as the bar area. Dining room was dark, even my 14 yr old needed a flashlight to see the menu.
Server was prompt and got our order accurately but again there was zero engagement.  No suggestions just took our order. Food was ok nothing exciting. If you are just looking to run in and run out maybe this is the place to you. We've been a few times and it has progressively gotten worse, although the hostess seem to be consistently rude.
Won't be back for a while if at all, I can get good food at home, I go out for the whole experience."}
{"text":"BJ's is a good choice for craft brews as well as having a large menu to chose from if u are indecisive. The small BBQ chicken pizza is excellent along with the watermelon salad!! Great spot for a business lunch!"}
{"text":"Great service, Bill the bartender makes a mean drink and is friendly, but not annoying, while we sat for a couple of hours. Good beer too!"}
{"text":"First time I've ever NOT left a tip. This place is absolutely ran like the manager is screwing the female staff and everyone knows about it. Know what I mean? From the hostess seating us and may as well been flipping us off at the same time to the server who couldn't be bothered to come to our table to see if we needed drinks, put in the order for the appetizer, or anything that would describe any kind of service......ALL the staff were either on their tablets (I mean the whole time) or sitting in booths to the side. No one was getting service. I saw one red-headed manager come out one time to appease some new parents who were leaving but looked more accusatory than helpful....then disappeared back into the back. And a bald man who appeared to be a manager only came out once and realized everyone was angry and disappeared into the back. The problem is the managers and 20-somethings who don't realize they have to EARN a living. FML."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We sat at the bar and even tho the server was busy she took good care of us"}
{"text":"BJs is always a safe place to take friends or family for dinner. They offer everything from salads, to pizza, to pasta, to burgers, etc. They are known for the pizzas and pizookie desserts, so definitely give those a shot."}
{"text":"DOWNLOAD THE APP ...it has call ahead seating.  The food (salmon, shrimp, ribs, steak, pizza) is always very good.  

The hostesses and management need to get a better seating system. I put in for 2 people for a 4 person booth  (the 2 seat booths are tiny) OR a 4 person table.  Got there 15 minutes prior to planned arrival, checked in .... and waited 45 min for a table.  We watched multiple tables of 4 be seated ... I spoke to hostess multiple times ... couldn't grasp the problem ...

Getting past the front door is the only hurtle ..."}
{"text":"So excited to have a BJ's in the Cleveland area. First tried them in Columbus, lived the pizza, beers and pizookies. Welcome to the Land.

Located off mentor avenue inside mentor mall, this BJ's is huge and gorgeous. From the instant you walk in, you are in awe. It is the very similar to the cheesecake factory in terms of decor and menu size. I prefer a smaller, simpler menu but with the large menu there is something for anybody at any time of the day. They have great appetizer and small plates options, slads, burgers, sandwiches and of course pizzas.

We came in on a weeknight around 8pm, sat at the colorful bar, and ordered 2 house beer, the hopstorm ipa and Jeremiah red, both were tasty and a dollar off on Wednesday even at 8pm. For food, we went for the siracha brussel sprouts and the shishito peppers with pepperoni. Both apps were fine but I was disappointed in the taste and overall flavor. The shishito peppers were buried in pepperoni, very dry and really flavorless. The sprouts were much better but didn't have much going on outside of the siracha honey sauce drizzled on top.

We doubled down on pepperoni with a small deep dish pepperoni lover pizza and that was as delicious as I remembered it being in Columbus. We were too stiffed to order a pizookie but they look as good as ever, don't skip out on them if you can.  Also, join the BJ's rewards program to get discounts and free pizookies, they add up."}
{"text":"This was my second time at BJs Restaurant and I cannot explain how great our experience was. We came with a group of 8 for a birthday party. We are all servers and bartenders so we are pretty picky about our service. Kayla was our server and she was beyond great!! Not only did we have great service but our food, drinks, and desserts were all amazing. We are always looking to go somewhere and have great service- this was the best service and meal combo we've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"My husband I came to Summerlin location on the 4th of July for early dinner. When we arrived it was slow, the hostess asked me to wait by the steps to be seated. The person who was sitting us had absolutely no urgency he was taking his time to grab the menus and utensil then finally we got seated next to a ditty table and it stayed dirty the entire time we were eating. 
We always go to the Henderson location because to close to our house, but today we were on the other side of town and decided stop and have a quick dinner and it was disappointing experience. 
Now our waiter was great and the food."}
{"text":"I'd recommend appetizers and drinks for this place. The burger was alright, the appetizers were top notch, and the beer was delicious. I'd also recommend double checking your bank statement. (Don't panic, the problem fixed itself.) The staff gave us really really great service and the manager handled my over billing issue promptly. Thanks BJs!"}
{"text":"No one could decide what we wanted to eat so we decided on BJs. It was....ok, we started with the calamari which okay but kind of bland. I think BJs charges by the size of the plate because it really long and the squid was in a small pile at one end. Ever regret ordering an appetizer because it fills you up so much you don't even want to eat the main course? Well it's definitely not a problem with BJs calamari, not much for 11 buckaroos. I had the pulled pork sandwich, it was good. 

The highlight of the evening was our server. It took quite awhile to get our food but we didn't complain. The server took it upon himself to talk to his manager and we ended up with a free salted caramel pizzookie  (I don't know how to spell that). It was tasty!

Not a bad dinner but not a memorable one either."}
{"text":"Terrible from start to finish.  Don't waste your money or time!  We had dinner here last Saturday, chose to sit at the bar, first mistake.  The service was painfully slow, the bartender, an older guy, was not interested in waiting on us, he was more interested in washing glasses.  We ordered the deep dish pizza, gourmet 5 meat pizza, wings and boneless wings.  Both wings were terrible, cold, hardly any flavor or sauce.  I failed to mention we also ordered Mediterranean chicken tacos which never came.  We all had belly aches on the way home.  This place sucks, TGIFridays is better and that's not saying much!"}
{"text":"BJ's is a nice place to meet friends for lunch. The staff are efficient so you can eat within a limited timeframe. The food is generally good as is the service, but neither are much to cheer about.

I ordered the all-you-can-eat soup/salad lunch combo. The Caprese salad was great! [I didn't get the wedge salad because I don't see the point of eating 1/4 of a head of lettuce with a drizzle of dressing.] The Caesar was good, but the croutons weren't great and there was too much dressing. Also, the house salad was swimming in dressing; I couldn't even eat it. There is only one vegetarian soup option and, fortunately, I liked it.

The ambiance is fun and casual so it's a nice place to meet friends, but I wouldn't go there again for a meal. It's a nice place for happy hour drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"I eat here often but last Friday was the worst experience I have had since eating here. I am giving 3 stars because this is the first time I experienced this and I never got passed the host. We came in and asked for a table for three. We were told 25 mins, 30 minutes max. That wasn't the case. We watched the host tell people the same thing over and over after us yet they kept seating call ahead people on a Friday night. One group said they were waiting for 1 hour and 20 mins. After 45 mins we left but I was able to snap a picture of the text they sent to us confirming our wait and the one they sent when our table was ready. It was an hour. The waiting area was over capacity and the manager should have controlled the situation way better. Disappointed. Went home hungry."}
{"text":"Ok first off, it was very awkward having the Manager seat us and then take away the drink menu because I didn't look 21. Luckily I already knew what alcoholic drink I wanted to order but really? At least ID me especially if you are the darn manager. Second, Francisco was our food runner but I tipped him and not our waitress because that's how great his customer service is! BJ's could be better but I'll come back if Francisco is working because he will do his job and the waiter's job!! ha"}
{"text":"Only getting 3 stars because of the food !!! 
Horrible service , took about atleast 10 minutes to be greeted. Server looked like they didnt care much. Ordered my sons food, waited a bit to order mine thinking i would get his quick so he can eat first. funny to say my food STILL came out before his. What a joke!! Awesome food but man get some new staff!"}
{"text":"Overall service was ok. Hostess that sat us had to question if we were certain we gave the right party amount number. They tried to sit us in a booth where only 4 Adults sit. We were a party of 6 with one child. A Manager came out and saw how cramped we were and moved us. Other then that overall experience could have definately been better. I had Tortillia Soup- which had a very thick consistency. Flavor was just ok. Sampler tray was delicious.  Server was good."}
{"text":"I really dig this bar. But I am not about expensive. So I usually only come here for happy hour or for special ocassions. I want to re-phrase the expensive comment. It isnt expensive per-se. But I wouldnt pay their regular bar prices.

My favorite dish is their grilled chicken pasta. I am not a HUGE pasta fan, but I love this. I also really like their Pazookies (specifically the oreo)

The place is a good size, good amount of TVs (for the sports fans), and a good place for birthday parties and such. 

I havent had a problem with staff, and they are usually pretty nice. Nothing really that separates them from other bars I have been to (other than the pazookie), but I wouldnt drive out of my way for it"}
{"text":"One star for the beer. The food was just average. The service was horrible. Our server came to our table three times to tell us she would be back right after she put in other table's orders. When she finally did take our order, we ordered an appetizer and meals. It took forever for the food to come and the meals came out before the appetizer. We ended up canceling the appetizer because there was no point in eating it. It would have been nice to have it while we waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. After eating, we then waited forever for her to bring us our check. We will not be going back because there are other restaurants with just average food but excellent service."}
{"text":"This BJ's location never disappoints! My boyfriend and I both work as servers elsewhere and get off from work at late hours, making BJ's a great place to have dinner after work. We've had Jeff as our server a few times now, and it's always a pleasure! He makes great recommendations based on his personal favorite items (as opposed to just trying to up-sell us). The food here is always delicious and the atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. We always leave BJ's very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I think our server was trying to do side work and get out of there, she maybe came over to our table twice. We got there at 10:30 (they close at 12  and people were still walking in after us)  We had regular Pepsi's at the table and she kept coming to our table and saying \"another diet right?\" When someone would say no, she would look at the other person and say \"ohhh you need another diet huh?\" Everyone at the table had regular sodas. After each refill it was annoying everyone at the table had to remind her what we had when she clearly did not have a lot of other tables. When the food came out the pizza had very little sauce, we asked to remake it with more sauce, it came back with the same amount. We just asked for an extra side of sauce which we used up. The Mariana sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks was ice cold. I don't know what is going on with the pizza sauce situation in this restaurant but the manager on duty was nice enough to comp the pizza."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I come here pretty often. The service is hit or miss. However, our most recent server, James, was phenomenal! He went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our meals. Refills without asking, extra ranch and sauce, split our entree onto two plates, gave us to go drinks, & packed up our leftovers! Awesome service. I wish we knew his regular section!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! We came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago & have been back like two or three times already! The first time we were there we had great service & the second time we had a very strange composing older lady as our server & that made it kind of awkward for us at times. Definitely recommend pretty much everything there! I love there pazookie original cookie dessert! You also can't go wrong with their burgers, salads, ribs, or appetizers! & THERE PORK IS TO DIE FOR! I can't wait to bring my coupon and go back! Also don't forget to sign up for there rewards system, it's awesome!!! Yay!"}
{"text":"I always forget about this place, but it's always good. We started with the carnitas fries... One of the best appetizers for my money. I had the New Orleans jambalaya, it's good but it gets a little over whelmed with the spices so it's a little hard to taste the shrimp and chicken, my girlfriend had the flat bread pizza which I had a \"taste\" of for the review. Solid choice for dinner, you really can't go wrong with all the choices. Best part of the night was that I left my wallet on the table and the server ran it out to me with all my cash intact. Definitely going back. Thanks"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. This was my second time dining at BJ's and first time at this specific location. I went with my tried and true favorite- Ahi Tuna Poké, served with these amazing crisp chips and avocado. Honestly, the Poké here is worth making the drive for alone. It very closely mirrors the quality of what I've experienced in Maui. After sharing that, I order the Cherry Glazed Salmon to go. Both were amazing.

The restaurant is in between casual and formal. The bar is well-stocked, and the ambience is really nice. The place is fairly dimly lit, but just enough so you can still see your dining mates and your plate. 

We only had to wait 15-20 minutes for a booth, but once we were seated, we didn't have any servers checking on us for another 20 minutes, which we weren't thrilled about. I think that other than being pretty short-staffed, it's a pretty great place."}
{"text":"Now this is a \"hit or miss\" place!  If you have plenty of time to spare then you are OK; but if you try to go there and then a movie - forget about it!  We have had good experiences and not so great!  My hubby does like some of their brews though so a thumbs up for that.  I hate to send negative reviews but sometimes you just have to be honest and tell it like it is!  (-:"}
{"text":"Tried the gluten-free pizza. Crust was way better than Sammie's Woodfired, but needed to ask for a side of sauce. They don't carry vegan cheese so without the cheese the gf pizza is just a crust with 1 tablespoon? of sauce spread on it. First time the sauce the server brought was fresh out of the fridge- really? To put on a hot pizza? Then she came back with some warm sauce per our request- in the bowls they probably serve ketchup in but I only had 1 piece of pizza left after waiting for the sauce.  Luckily we had ordered 3 toppings ($1 each) or it would have been extremely sad. They really should have all their signature pizzas available to order & just charge extra for the gluten-free crust. It was still good but I can make this at home buying the gf crust from Whole Foods deli (tastes & looks the same). Not sure we'll be back again. This is not a real gf pizza like Picazzo's in Arizona or Fresh Brothers in LA. So still looking for a good vegan gluten-free pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here today with my buddy for lunch. Food was good, beer was excellent. Then, got home, felt not that good. Ended up vomiting about 4 hours after eating there. My buddy felt a little sick, but not as bad as me. Been super gassy since. You guys have great beer you can't get anywhere else, but make sure you have kitchen staff who know what the hell they are doing."}
{"text":"I'ts been awhile since I've been to this location, but I have always remembered that they have great service and food - which is all that you really want out of a dining experience, right? :) Try the pizookies there, too (or it called something else? Can't remember...) because they are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I usually always order the Ahi salad which is fabulous.   I ordered the shrimp with soba noodles.   It's a cold dish and was really good.   They have a rewards program."}
{"text":"The parking here is very odd and scattered. The location is prime being right next to the mall.   

The restaurant is large and a bit overwhelming. The bar was well stocked and very well organized. Though this was lunch so I could not partake in the beverages. 

Our waitress was slow to get our orders but attentive otherwise. I had the seared Ahi Tuna salad. The cost was steep for the small amount of tuna...quite frankly disappointing. My salad was drenched in dressing...very soggy. I didn't really even eat half. 

I checked out the happy hour menu and it wasn't overly impressive."}
{"text":"My husbands favorite place. Food is consistently good, the menu is big and we haven't had anything we didn't like yet. Our pizza took a long time and came out with onions when we had asked for none so they comped our bill and gave us a second pizza for free."}
{"text":"It was our first time here last night and I really liked the food and service. We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and my boys loved it. It wasn't over cooked so the texture was just perfect. We tried the Bj's deluxe burger and it was so big! My husband and I barely ate half of it. My kids also liked their kids meal and received it pretty quick considering it was a full house there. For dessert they tried the mini pizookie with chocolate chunk ice cream. It was so cute and perfect for their appetites. I would say the strawberry lemonade was my favorite :) I would definitely go back and try other stuff there..."}
{"text":"Came here of my Birthday dinner with my girlfriend. I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision.
There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one.
I ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here.
Overall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time.
There will definitely be a next time. This was a great Birthday dinner capping off a great day."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian pizza and delicious fries. A top notch spot to watch the games and had pizza."}
{"text":"They have good service here. Definitely love the food. My go to place to watch sports. They have dishes from kids to adults."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was thinking BJ's was, but not what it is. I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse, and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference, you might ask - and yes it does. 

So, as this will not become a stable of mine, my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah, I can see that happen.

OK, so the service is standard, and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's, every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer, nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud/Miller/Corrs/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited, but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit.

I started with the Jeremiah Red, and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased. 

So where does this leave me? Nah, it's all right I guess.. and I will come back when the time is right."}
{"text":"Most of the time the food and service is good. The last time I found some type of plastic wrapping in my salad, the shrimp were not hot as asked and the forgot to return my credit card. Thus prompting to cancel it and the domino effect that comes with your very connected credit card used for everything. Make sure you get your card back, and don't let them get away with saying we're sorry it was really hectic. Come on, there are so many better ways to handle it. So I just don't go there anymore. Sad because I went there for 18 years and it lost my respect after that major incident."}
{"text":"We asked for extra sauce on the Pan Pizza. We are from Chicago. Waitress never mentioned there is NO SAUCE! 

IT IS ONLY CHOPPED TOMATOES!   Then to get charged extra for tomatoes when there weren't many to begin with. 

Pizza was cold when we got it. 

Pizza put put through oven again and that made it hot.  

Your pizza is really a shame. That wasn't a pizza. 
It was bread with toppings. If you aren't accustomed to REAL PIZZA then maybe it's pizza good enough for you, but never again if I'm in Vegas will I stop here for pizza. 

Half price?  It was more than a Deep Dish from Lou Malanati's in Chicago. 
Now that's a pizza."}
{"text":"I have came to this place a few times. It's very spacious and seems like a nice place to hang out. The food is amazing. The menu is very big which gives you so many options. I like to try different things every time I come here. My favorite drink is the pink Cadillac. It's so good, not too fruity but still pretty awesome. I live pretty close so if I ever want to grab a quick meal and hang out this is the place. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who like a great meal, a great drink and able to just relax and be at a place where you can just be yourself and not have to over dress."}
{"text":"BJ's is your typical mall, chain restaurant but with their own beer. There is typically a wait since most shoppers are stopping in on their way through the mall. There is an extensive menu so the good news is that you'll find something for even the pickiest of eaters. Best part - kids get a cup of fruit and garlic roll for free.

We have gone 2-3 times and, each time, I feel my sodium intake has gone through the roof. The food is incredibly salty! If you're used to food cooked with a lot of salt, you probably won't mind. But if you're someone who steers away from a high-sodium diet, you'll probably feel it. 

I probably won't actively go to BJs again, and if I do I'll stick to a salad."}
{"text":"Went to BJ's for my daughter's birthday and had a great time!  Food was great and the service was wonderful. Manager Jon brought over dessert for my daughter. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here again since I thought I could watch the game with some close friends... Well the waitress didn't even smile.... I stopped thanking her for bringing things out since she wouldn't even acknowledge me. She seemed pretty angry about us not ordering drinks. There was a disgusting stench in the restaurant and it really made me lose my appetite. The guy at the host stand said we couldn't sit in the dining room... Everybody was cramped in the bar section and the smell was Terrible in this one section... Stay away. Manager is rude and doesn't even care about the lousy service."}
{"text":"Solid experience from a typical brewery. I have been to BJ's several times now, usually after eating somewhere else in the Desert Ridge area. The typical visit usually includes drinking their blonde concoction, and watching sportscenter. The food i have eaten there was really good, including a chicken pasta meal that is one of the best i have ever had. Its 3/4 restaurant, 1/4 bar with tall ceilings and no smoking. Other than good food and drink there is not much else that separates BJs from other breweries, but thats ok. You will find a mix of adults and families before 10, with mostly adults in the bar after 10. Not much on the singles scene, so bring a crew with you!"}
{"text":"We love this place! I've never been disappointed with the food and with so many choices we are always trying something different. Good atmosphere and good wait service. Would definitely recommend this place - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a big fan of BJ's Restaurant, but tonight... Slow and somewhat inattentive staff.  After a 45 minute wait, we were seated, but it took another 10 minutes just to get our waters, which Michael (our waiter) spilled on the table.  We walked out after that."}
{"text":"One of my favorites for \"deep dish\" pizza. This location is smaller than some but my favorite in the valley. Great staff and  food is always cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this place for date night, family night, b-days or celebrations, watching the game or just getting a rich and tasty local brew. This place is always a win. Moderately priced. Reasonable portions. Any appetizer is a tasty start. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Food is great but we ONLY eat at the bar as the table service is not the best.  Happy Hour and special events will get you great prices on appetizers and discounts on beer/liquor but not wine - boo. Mini Deep Dish Pizzas are $5 on happy hour and are pretty good.  Ahi Poke is one of my favorites as are the salads.  Good crowd for happy hour."}
{"text":"Their parmesan crusted chicken is the best thing in this world!!! Soooooooo good! And then they have those DELICIOUS cookies with ice cream, they are to die for. Soooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Had the avocado roll..   discussing I couldn't finish it the avocado was so mushy and tasted old like over ripened avocado... pizza cookie was really good though but thats about it"}
{"text":"Always have a great meal at BJ's. We were there the other night and my husband was very disappointed they no longer served their skinny French fries"}
{"text":"I've usually had good experiences w/BJ's - but recently each visit has been worse and worse. Last night was the topper making me log on and write this 2 star review. 
We ordered curbside to go b/c we wanted just an easy dinner. The curbside process was easy and fast which is the only reason for the extra star. However, the food last night was awful, and had I been dining in 2 of my 3 items ordered would have been sent back. 
We started with the potato crisp appetizer (basically potato skins). These aren't hard to mess up, but they were so burnt they were not even edible. Literally, fried to a crisp and I couldn't even eat it. Trash, $10.15 out the door - overpriced to begin with now that I'm thinking of it. 
My wife ordered sliders with cheese which we were charged $1.25 or something for cheese, which didn't get put on the burger. Since we paid already, nothing we can do. Stupid - I'm sure they do that on purpose to get more $ on to-go orders. Who's going to check for cheese in the car? 
I had some shrimp taco thing which was bland as can be. Literally no flavor...so I mean it was the only non-messed up item in our order but yuck. I had asked for sauce on the side, they put it right on the tacos, so actually 3/3 items messed up. I should be giving a 1-star but the gal who helped w/curbside was very nice. 
So many other places to eat - I said to my wife last night: OKAY - we're DONE with BJ's."}
{"text":"i've frequented this place several times.  love the beer selection and the service was fantastic this time.  however, my girlfriend and husband had never been here and ordered the poke bowl and steak.  the poke bowl was extremely small to begin with and more than at the yard house in $$$.  i ordered the white pizza personal and it was delicious!!  i wish they had an outside patio :)  good idea to call ahead and we were seated very promptly.  very busy last night with prom but still a warm, pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"The stout is my favorite here... great place for happy hour. Cheap beer and the mini pizzas are half off. The pizookie alone should get 5 stars. My only complaint? Too many choices. You would think that is a good thing... well its not. I get so overwhelmed with choices I end up getting the same thing every time. Food prices are a bit high. They could certainly tone down the portions a bit, nobody should ever finish an entire serving here... its always way too much food."}
{"text":"Best happy hour on this side of town. The bartenders are very friendly and service is always prompt. I've never had a bad drink or a bad meal here. I only go in if Jennifer is working though! The bar has plenty of TVs too."}
{"text":"I think BJ's is a Cheese Cake Factory wanna be but the food (quality & portion) is just no comparison to Cheese Cake Factory which is also by Chandler Fashion mall. So I say unless you are there for the happy hours or 9 dollars specialty drink. For the best of both world, go to Cheese Cake factory!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and the prices are very reasonable.  They actually have carry out too.  They don't advertise the carry out much at all because it is a huge costs savings.  I went into the restaurant and ordered food to go and waited for it.  What would have cost me roughly $120.00 in the restaurant plus the tip only cost me about $55.00 out the door.   I couldn't believe it.  Their pizza is the best that I have had in las vegas and it takes a little bit of time if you order one but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food was good not great. I had the black and blue Burger which was good but smaller than expected. Bloody Mary was good not great. Coffee was good too. The reason why it went from a standard 3 stars to 4 stars was our server Cassie. She was great. Fast, prompt, professional, and just made us feel at home. BJs needs to hire more of her kind."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place last night and I was disappointed. First, the menu reads like Chili's or an Appleebee's, in which this place offers everything under the sun. Experience tells me this is not a good sign. Second, as suggested, the food was sub par. I tried their specialty deep dish pizza and it just tasted like a pizza from Pizza Hut. My daughter ordered the Mac and Cheese and it just average. 

As for the beer, it was actually good. I wouldn't mind hitting up this place for Happy Hour, but if you are looking for a quality brewery to eat at, try Four Peaks or San Tan."}
{"text":"If I had written a review 6 months ago I'm sure I would have given BJ's 5 stars, however, my last few visits have left somewhat of a bitter taste in my mouth. The food and drinks here are always more than great, but the service which used to be just as good no longer lives up to my expectations. Both of my last visits were on slow nights where we were one of only a handful of tables in the restaurant. 

Now I work in the service industry so I can understand certain situations but being that our server only had a couple other tables I cannot grasp the fact that he kept disappearing for lengthy periods at a time. When we first arrived he greeted us in a timely manner and brought us our waters. We then ordered an appetizer to share while deciding on our entrees. Almost 20 minutes went by before we saw our appetizer or our server again. He dropped off the appetizer in a hurry, didn't ask if we were ready to order (which we were) and proceeded to disappear again. We were done with our appetizer for 5 minutes before he finally reappeared and took our order. The food was great but we just couldn't understand where he kept disappearing off to. We even had to flag down other servers to get things we needed, like refills for our constantly empty waters (biggest pet peeve). 
 
This experience won't necessarily stop me from returning because as I've mentioned I love the food, but I certainly hope they do something to improve their lacking service."}
{"text":"Bj's restaurants are awesome! Every time i've gone I haven't been disappointed. My personal favorite are the pizzas. However, you cannot go wrong with anything. Their homemade root beers are incredible."}
{"text":"We went to Bj's this past weekend we enjoyed our experience. First off I ordered a cream soda and I am now convinced that Bj's has the best cream soda out there, you gotta try it when you go. Our group shared a pizza it was very good, i would defiantly order it again. Our service was good, nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either. We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"They discriminated against my 19 year old sons with mild autism. They told them it would be a 25 minute wait, and when they asked 40 minutes later how much longer, they were told an indefinite wait, they would get a text when their table was ready, and they NEVER contacted them. I know because I watched it all unfold from a distance so my sons and the discriminating \"hostesses\" didn't know anyone was watching. Despicable."}
{"text":"The service and food is always great here! I especially like that they always remember my name and what I like to order. If you are looking for a neighborhood bar/restaurant that treats you like family, come to bj's on centennial."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the food was great as usual. I was in a couple weeks back and we had this server a male. Very difficult name to spell when looking at the bill. Anyway he was exceptional even ran after us outside when my girlfriend and I forgot our food."}
{"text":"This review is just about the food at BJ's as we got it to go. I have eaten inside as well and the service was normal in attention and speed. 

We got the avocado egg rolls for appetizer and that tasted strange to me - not off but just having avocado in a dish that was warmer seemed strange to me like it needed to be eaten chilled. The taste of the avocado egg rolls was not to my liking, either, not being able to make out the avocado and chicken components. I also got the in-house root beer which I rate at 6 our of 10 on my scale, and it had a strong licorice flavor.

For entrees, my husband got the baked ziti and that is just as you'd expect with a nice flavor to the tomato sauce and a nice bite to the pasta. I ordered the fish and chips and it came with string fries which were very good. The breading was light and the fish had a great flavor. I will be ordering that again. 

Finally, for dessert we ordered the peanut butter pizookie as I've had it before and it's always delicious."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday around 7pm. There was no wait to be seated but it was pretty busy in general. They had a lot of specials going on including half off bottle wine, happy hour and 3$ pizookies. They are also doing buy one entree get one entree free with purchase of two beverages. We ended up with two entrees, an appetizer, and two glasses of wine for 42$! Our server was great too. Portion sizes are good and there is a good variety on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great place to dine on your lunch break from work or happy hour.Great food and a casual atmosphere.Mostly everything on there menu is a A+.I eat here for lunch,at least three times a week.Pretty Crowded around noon hours."}
{"text":"This place is like the girlfriend you wish you kept from high school. 
It is so comfortable
It is consistently good.
High value.
No surprises. 
I'm happy with every experience. 
( been to 3 locations)"}
{"text":"Hmmmmm
I wish I had taken a picture of the fish tacos I ordered. 

They were really vegetable tacos.  
I had to dig deep to find the insignificant piece of fish at the bottom. 

It was the smallest portion of fish I've 
EVER had in a fish taco. 
To add to that.... 
it was the least inventive boring fish taco I've ever had. And I eat a lot of em on my travels. 

NOT. The bj standard for sure 


Salmon was good
Salad was good
Beer was good 
Server forgot a beer.  No biggie. 

Not the usual  5 star experience I'm  used to here 

------

Note. 
I was at the Henderson location yesterday. 

5 star experience
Had pizza and beer"}
{"text":"If you love avocado .. The avocado egg rolls are yummy. The lunch specials are also worth it - flatbread with salad or deep dish with salad! Top off with the crazy dessert that you just can't believe it pizzi- something awesome!"}
{"text":"We had the best service ever!!!!!!!!  We sat on the patio and our waitress was Taylor.  She was so attentive, we got our food right away and of course it was delicious!!

One thing that was very odd was that we wanted to speak to her manager to tell her what great service we had, then the manager came out and acted like we were wasting her time.  It was the strangiest thing?????  Just not sure if she wasen't interested in what we were saying, or she had other things that she was doing.

So I would give Taylor 5 STARS, and the manger 1 STAR!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. Service has always been fast and friendly. They have a large selection of craft, imported, and domestic beers as well as fully stocked bar. While the dishes I've tried are not \"out of this world\". They're tasty, fresh and hot. Make sure to save room for desert. The cookie and ice cream thingies are to die for."}
{"text":"BJ's Always Rocks!  Absolutely Delicious Food!!  All the entrees and their Chicago Style Pizza are Terrific!!  Ommegang and other Great Beers on Tap!  Great, Open Atmosphere with Sports on TV's on the walls so you don't miss the action!
Get Shawn and Audrey to cap off the experience!  Shawn is So Fantastic and always gets the order right, along with all the extras you might want!  We always look for Shawn anytime we are there!  And Audrey is absolutely smart, savvy, and very perceptive.  She's truly great!  Love Audrey and Shawn!"}
{"text":"Generous portions of food that taste great, they accommodated for our party of 9 in no time and the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, would recommend this place to friends and family with small or large parties...the ahi poke and rib eye was excellent!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. The decor and space was amazing..very spacious  and very nice design.  The staff was friendly- but our server was a little flighty- I don't think she had been working there very long as she wasn't very familiar with the menu and had to ask us what the menu said. I am a restaurant manager and I would never put someone on the floor who wasn't familiar with the menu- it looks bad on the serve and on management. We ordered 2 ribeye dinners and 1 chili cheeseburger. My brother requested his steak to be rare and when it came to our table it was more on the well side and when he asked  to have it sent back and cooked the way he wanted the man- who I am assuming was the manager- acted like it was a hassle. My steak was slightly overdone but still edible and tasty. My husbands chili cheeseburger was amazing! The chili was very tasty and it was a huge meal! He left very satisfied! One thing I absolutely loved was the horseradish mashed potatoes- they were amazing! I had never had horseradish m.potatoes but I am glad I tried them- I even started making some at home.  The  mixed drinks were amazing too!  My brother ordered a glass of their dark beer and he loved it- he has always loved dark beers and this beer was right up his alley. Oh! Almost forgot- we also ordered the mini bruschetta for our appetizer- and WOW! I could have eaten 5 plates of that stuff - the best bruschetta I have ever had! Overall this place was really good! The food tasted amazing- I am glad because they are kind of pricey but no complaints on the price because it was worth it :)"}
{"text":"Just checked out for 1st time... I got ribs and she got classic burger with calamari as appetizer. Calamari didn't blow me away but better than most. Really no complaints.. Wait staff is really friendly and attentive. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very good service and food , manager was awesome:) it's a must go to place !!!! They took the chicken parmigiana off the menu, but they made it for me anyway:)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight! Our waiter tonight Joshua was so attentive one of the best waiters we have had lately  (he had no idea we had a bad experience here 3 days ago) food was good and the dessert was to die for. Glad we came back"}
{"text":"Wow. Really impressed. This is a chain restaurant? My dad and step mom took myself and kids here after a long day of planes, walking and driving. I was famished and would have devoured anything put in front of me.

First of all, very nice space. Cozy, yet spacious. Modern, but comfortable. Our server was Xavier and he was delightful. We were taken care of at precisely the right pace. The flow of our meal was perfect, even for my overly-impatient father!

Drinks came out quickly, my son ordered the house-made root beer and I stole a sip. Very good! My iced tea was fine and everyone else enjoyed theirs. Xavier made sure to refill my kids' drinks, and asking first if they could have more soda! Much appreciated. My step mom had a coupon for a free app so we chose the avocado egg rolls. We all enjoyed them. 3 whole egg rolls cut into 6 pieces. Just enough to kick off the meal.

The menu is huge! It takes a minute to navigate. There is another chain restaurant that has a dessert gimmick (ahem CHEESECAKE) and a very large menu as well. I had a very sub par experience there so the large menu scared me. Glad to see my apprehension was misplaced!

Kids meals were modestly priced at 5.99. Both of mine went for the mini corndogs, 8 of them! Fries were yummy too!

I ordered the tomato bisque and the seared tuna salad. Wow. I have not one criticism and that is quite hard to do! I would eat these things every day if I could. The bowl of soup and the salad were the perfect amount of food, satisfying to the last bite. I usually ask for the dressing on the side, since almost always they drench it down, but theirs was done perfectly. Ingredients were well balanced and fresh. I was also pleased with the price point. $15.99!? I didn't pay, but I was surprised that it wasn't a $19.99 dish.

Easy five stars. I wish I was this satisfied with the value, quality of food & service, as well as the overall experience every time I dined out."}
{"text":"I ordered the roast beef dip, very good.  However, no one came back to refill water or soda, or to check if we needed anything else.  Still love the place, great atmosphere, wonderful food."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we got such a great service.  Amber took care of us. Always with a smile,  never felt rushed and the order was spot on.  Food was great and the pizza was half off!?  What?!  Monday half off large pizza."}
{"text":"We love the food here and keep coming back for that Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, and my Wife likes the Gluten Free pizza. The waiting staff are always nice, cordial and a definite reversal of the trauma their receptionists inflict upon their customers. It seems this is the 4th or 5th time in the last 2 years we have gone there that something awkward occurs. We are early people, so we arrive far before the place fills up and there always has to be some sort of controlling event at the front of this place served up with an attitude. Where are the owners or Managers of this place? Why are they not watching? 
Do these owners even care what the 1st impression is for their guests? 
Will they even ever see this and wonder?

Update: I was impressed that as you can see below, a Manager invited me to call and perhaps listen to any deeper insight I could provide to help them, which as someone involved professionally in service, I am always happy to do. I called in today and just missed Cory. The gal that answered the phone was rather impatient with me that I suggested I leave Cory a message. She didn't inquire if another manager could help. I had thought I had called in at a time that was before the dinner hour even begins. It is common that businesses will respond positively in social media settings like this because, well they better, even if they are not always sincere beyond that. Let's see if they return my call tomorrow, Be blessed all!"}
{"text":"I like the selection of beers on tap, it's a huge selection. I had their grilled salmon for dinner. It tasted great.  Unfortunately, after dinner and a couple of beers, I was sick in my bathroom for the next two and a half days. 
They got the extra star for the beer selection."}
{"text":"Always the right choice......

Because Feast Buffet at the tony and electric Red Rock Resort & Casino had a line out the door, I went to one of my reliable favorites. But in beautiful Summerlin!

Because it was a late lunch, it was not very crowded and I was seated immediately in a plush booth.

What a relief. No crowds and a restful and restorative dining area with the myriad of flat screen TV's kept at just the right volume for conversation when making new friends.

The lunch special of a deep dish meat extravaganza pizza and salad were an ideal choice. The pizza was so hot I had to wait for it to cool. Still, an abundance of stretchy cheese with every slice.

The salad was not a wimpy small afterthought. It was a dinner-plate of fresh tomato's, black olives, field greens, sweet red onion, hot-house cucumbers and field greens topped with a refreshing vinaigrette. 

Service was five star. My handsome young waiter had just moved from Colorado and was a delight to talk with. He recommended sampling the root-beer. Had no idea it was made in-house, but I had three frosty mugs of it plus a to-go glass.

Just a small cat here, so was not able to finish all the food and there was no refrigerator in my suite at The Palazzo. Bygones.

Going back to my second home of Summerlin/Henderson/Las Vegas about seven times a year I always put this BJ's on my food \"bucket-list\". So very Summerlin!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brew pub in Olmsted. Great beer and great food.  They offer their own beer (they make a killer hefeweissen) as well as other popular microbrews and national brands. The food menu is extensive - with everything from pub grub to salads to Asian dishes to ribs to sandwiches to steak...and the list goes on. During my recent visits I enjoyed the fish tacos and the spicy Asian peanut noodle dish with chicken. Both were outstanding and paired perfectly with my hefe. 
The decor is classy, the bar area is large with plenty of seating, and there are a bunch of wide screen TVs showing whatever sporting event is on at the time. The dining area can fill up quickly, so expect a bit of a wait for a table on the weekends. Seating in the bar area is open."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service fantastic! I've been to the Centennial Hills location and it is very good, yet it pales in comparison to the experience I've had today at this location. I'm so pleased that I would consider going out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"I really like BJs brewhouse. They have a good menu with a ton of options so you are sure to find something you like. I went with a big group and it took quite a while to be seated, although we expected it being 6pm on a Saturday night. They have a nice bar so you can pass the time there until your table is ready, this is always a plus when we go out. It is a bit loud, but it's such a large space, I wouldn't say that it was detrimental to the conversations. 

They have a huge beer menu, and a great cocktail menu as well. 

The servers are all very friendly and helpful and it was a good experience over all."}
{"text":"It is date night with my wife. We have never been to this restaurant. We were seated promptly and that's where any service (I mean none) went out the window. We waited patiently for 15 minutes while we watch people entering after us get starved drinks. Our waiter/waitress was non existent. So after 15 minutes we threw in the towel and went down the walk to a different restaurant. This was my first and last visit to Bj's. 
*(No star actually)"}
{"text":"Service was decent but the place was super busy so it's understandable that the waiter wasn't better. Spinach dip was yummy!"}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here recently! The waiter was very nice and prompt ! I had the triple decker and it was very tasty ! My wife had the pepperoni flat bread and unfortunately was a little on the greasy side !!

We love eating here because of all the choices and atmosphere is nice !!"}
{"text":"Good Bar food  good crowd, the home brews are good, service is good."}
{"text":"Hello all my Arizona Chaps... BJ beet and arugula salad is a great way to jump start your lunch !!! Very fresh with lots a popping flavor . My husband and I then split the Grilled Chicken club . This tasty place is awarded Analynn's 
Affordable prices , great services  and atmosphere!. Until next time ... Bon appetite ."}
{"text":"Ok, so when we first went, we did not have a good experience, but the Manager reached out to us and went out of her way to invite us back, and we had a really good time.  I would now recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Love their burgers and the pazookie is to die for.  Wish the wait was shorter, but I am definitely come back again, again."}
{"text":"I am only giving three stars today. The food was very good. The service was very bad. The waitress didn't seem to care that. she had customers."}
{"text":"Crowded night, lots of kiddies (with lots of screeching).. not the best ambiance, to say the least.

However, my pork chops were absolutely fantastic.. I was amazed at how perfectly prepared they were.  The rest of the plate, meh.. but the pork chop I ate was incredible.  

The one that hubby ate was also incredible, but not the reason why... his ribs were terrible.  The potato was enormous, ridiculously so.. and his \"smoked\" ribs weren't smoked, they were boiled then some sauce was slapped on and they were finished on a grill.  It was obvious, and their menu was a lie.

Will I return?  Possibly... but not for the ribs.  They get a bonus point for removing it from the tab, but they lost a point for him having to resort to eating half of my meal because no server came around to find out how the food was, thus giving him a chance to order something else."}
{"text":"As much as I want to say I love BJ's it is just an average place. Been here twice now and both times I would say just average. I had Mahi Mahi tacos and they were frankly below average. Stale shells and the fish was eh. Wife had a salad and some pizza.  The pizza was average too. Decent beer selection. Location at Great Northern is decent and convenient."}
{"text":"BJ's customer service has catapulted to the next level!! Our server Debbie was so friendly and amazing and spectacular and awesome and outstanding and phenomenal and on and on! From the minute we sat down her smiling and warm demeanor was so pleasant. The food was good and the drinks made by Kim at the bar were delicious and strong. As good as the overall experience was, everything paled in comparison to Debbie's attention to detail and positive attitude. If ever you're in Centennial Hills do yourself a favor and stop in at BJ's. Make sure to ask for Debbie for superior customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot when ever where in the area shopping. We even travel to this one instead of the one by red rock which is actually a little closer to where we live. Staff is always friendly and servers are amazing! I don't think we have come across anything on the menu we didn't enjoy. I love the members reward program and how when they scan our card they have little notes like get a child's menu or they can make a note of any known allergies for future reference."}
{"text":"Love this place!! We always get their wings (traditional with hot sauce) and pizza.. so yummy!! Usually have great service as well!!"}
{"text":"The thing I liked most about this place was the choice of beers.  Other than that it was nothing special.  My boyfriend and I shared a mushroom and sausage pizza and each of us got a side salad as well.  The salad tasted like the ones that you buy in the pre-mixed bags, flavorless and too wet.  The pizza was very comparable to Pizza Hut.  Its a shame they compare it to Chicago style deep dish pizza because it doesnt even come close to that!!
I liked the atmosphere and size of the restaurant.  The service was pretty bad.  We called while in the parking lot because it looked really busy but the hostess tells us theres no wait for 2 people.  So we walk in and she says it'll be about 5 minutes.  We could clearly see theres several open tables but whatever.  We stand there and 5 minutes later she decides to tell us \"oh, you can just go seat yourself over there\"  Ummm okay.  Our server was very nice but I could tell he had more tables then he could handle because after he took our order we didnt see him again for 20 minutes.  We finished our beer and never got asked if we wanted another.  My glass of water remained empty for about 20 minutes.  If he was a bit more attentive I would've enjoyed my experience a lot more.  Medium pizza, 2 side salads, one pint of beer, and the sampler of 4 beers ($6.00) was $40.  All in all, it was nothing special. It tasted like Pizza Hut on a good night but tripple the price!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a family meal and it was pretty good. It's a nice atmosphere, dark in the restaurant. Our waiter was really nice. She answered all my questions and asked in the kitchen to check that the bread bowl was vegan. They had a vegan option labeled on the menu, a lentil soup. They also had other plates that could be made vegan. I ordered guacamole and the soup. The appetizer came out quickly and was great. Our food came out really late and they mixed up my order but the manager came out and apologized and checked in with us. The food was really good, pretty filling. It's a good place to go for big groups and for a nice dinner. Everyone in our group found something they liked on the menu and everyone ended up happy with their meal. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"BS over priced chain.  Beer is good but over priced.  No samples allowed, a mouthful will cost you just to try before you commit to a full.  I'm not impressed.  It's just a copy of Yard house or other chains."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and the food is decent.  Not great, but about average for what you would expect from a chain \"brewpub.\"  I do enjoy the loaded baked potatoes that they offer and their beers are pretty good."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great black cherry soda im addicted to it and the restaurant is in my list everytime i have a soda craving"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. First one of the pizzas was made incorrectly then my brother's pizza ended up having a piece of metal in it... never coming back here ever again"}

{"text":"Our family had a wonderful experience this evening. We had a group of 7 1/2 who were celebrating our daughter's body building competition. Her and her boyfriend from Montana, myself, my partner, and mother-in-law from Atlanta, GA and Aunt and cousin from Vegas. We can't say enough about Kyle Fri. who was our server. He was great from start to finish. The food was also great. Great atmosphere and very accommodating. Thanks to Kyle for a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I like the beer, love their mixed drinks, and the food and location are great as well.  Try their roast beef dip w/ fries!"}
{"text":"Love the food here and huge selection of beers.  Its hard to find a bar/restaurant with good food but u will definitely find both at BJs. I recommend their flatbreads, burgers,  and for an appetizer I would go with bruchetta... so good!"}
{"text":"We've been going to BJ's for years. Since the first on opened in AZ. This one just happens to be a little closer to where we live now so we go to this one more often than not.

There is some good and some bad here. Good: The food is usually pretty solid. Havent really had anything here that I was unhappy with. The menu is huge so if you come with a med-large party, theres going to be something for everyone. They have a good selection of beer and a full bar. They have a great Raspberry Cider that my wife loves! The bar area is great for happy hour and a game.

Bad: They call this a brewery...and it isnt. Its a restaurant that serves beer that the OTHER BJ's makes. This might not matter to you but it does to me. Weak! Because they're not an actual brewery, their liquor license is different and they cant fill the BJ's growler that I bought. Oh well, I'll use it to hold my change and I'll get my other growlers filled at real breweries. We've also experienced \"Dirty Lines\" here before. They should have their beer lines cleaned more often or more thoroughly or both. 

Best part of the menu: Do not leave without having the Pizookie for dessert. It is one of the best things you can put in your mouth!"}
{"text":"A little behind on my reviews.... 

Went here for lunch on 5/5/10. This was a lunch with family/friends. 

We were there at about 11:30. Only a few other tables were occupied. We were seated pretty quickly. Then had to wait about 5-10 minutes before waitress showed up. Another 5 minutes to return with simple soda and lemonade orders. 

Lunch orders included two salads, chicken tenders and fries, chicken sandwich and fries, angel hair pasta dish, and personal deep dish pizza. 

Salads are a Little hard to screw up. Pizza was only warm. Some bites tasted like not yet cooked yet. Both orders with fries, the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish. 

Of course, waitress never came back to check on our orders after a few minutes. So probably 10-15 minutes went by before she came visible to waiver her over. When we told her food was cold, she was clearly confused and unsure what to do. She said she would be back in a minute. 

Manager too sounded confused and surprised... \"Don't know why food would be cold?\" He offered to bring out new order of fries, which he did fairly quickly.. No offer to discount meal ticket, no offer of free dessert, just apology and fresh basket of fries... 

Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers. Being a huge beer drinker, would love to try the different brews. The appetizer menu looked pretty good too. 

I realize that any place can have a bad day. But first impressions are critical. Especially for food and restaurants. This will not be a place I would consider again unless the timing for Happy Hour presents itself..."}
{"text":"Great Service nice atmosphere good food good variety of beer definitely will be going back again"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch it was pretty busy being a holiday but the staff was still nice the service still great . The food was very good. I always have great experience eating at BJ's this was no exception"}
{"text":"We eat here so often, it's only fair that I write a review.  When we can't decide where to have dinner, we go to BJ's.  They seem to have something to please almost everyone.  I usually get the Broccoli Alfredo potato with extra sauce... yum!   Good service, good value.  Great place to bump into your Summerlin neighbors. I appreciate that you can call ahead & be placed on the seating list - sometimes the wait can be upwards of 45 minutes, so calling ahead really saves time, especially when I'm with the 10-year old (or if my guy is hungry... and cranky!)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Well I went here tonight and service was amazing and the food was also just superb. I started tonight's experience by sampling 2 beers and deciding on the hefferveisen it was very good and I asked for an orange to complement the flavor.
 
Here we go into the meal, For starters we got mozzarella and tomato salad that I totally recommend it was only 3 dollars and it has an amazing balsamic dressing on it. YUM

Main course I ordered the Portobello pizza and the chicken pot stickers for my wife and I and they were both amazing the pizza is a must try and the pot stickers were good BUT im just not so much of a fan of them anyway so they must have been amazing for me to finish my plate of them."}
{"text":"Came here for a work luncheon.  Nice staff.  OK food.  I had the \"under 600\" meal so maybe that's why the flavor wasn't all there but it was still OK."}
{"text":"The server was friendly, the food was great and the cocktails were amazing!  Mac & Cheese Couscous and the strawberry mojitos are a must!"}
{"text":"Food was good but my 5 stars goes out to HOLLY! You'd the best! 

Never in my life have I had such exceptional service! Most serves don't like children and sometimes they must forget that kids love to touch everything...not Holly! She knew exactly how to work around our two boys and brought out extra bread and fruit to keep them occupied. She always let us know about the events they do on Mondays for beer tasting. Definitely will be requesting her (if I can) to be our server the next time! Thanks Holly!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of BJ's but the quality of food can only go so far.  It seems that every time I dine there the service is passable at best.  There have been times that the waiters(waitresses) take over 10 minutes to check on us. I can understand to an extent if it is very busy as it usually is, but I raise my hand for all those minutes and even if my server is not around there are multiple others that can clearly see me looking for some help that do not come."}
{"text":"We went here early on a Sunday evening. Luckily we didn't have to wait since there were only two of us. We ordered the avocado egg rolls. Yummy. The pepperoni Pizza was ok. The wings were ok. The salted caramel pizzookie was delicious and with the coupon for signing up to be a member it was free! 

We had a really good server named Lindsay. She was very helpful and making sure we were able to use all coupons and sign up for member rewards. It saved us around $20."}
{"text":"I've been to BJ's restaurants in Eugene and San Diego and this is far and away the best.  It's casual dining but in a very nice setting.  This BJ's is new to the area (border of Vegas and Henderson in Silverado Ranch) and has a split level dining hall.  The upper level has the bar which has a bitchin' hd video screen tuned to all kinds of sports including the glorious MLB Network.

Service is friendly and the staff is well educated on the huge menu.  Seriously, you'll really find just about anything when it comes to standard American food.  There's also a huge beer list of domestics, imports and special brews exclusive to BJ's.

Here's my gluttonous rundown:

Oktoberfest beer: I was talked into starting off with the limited edition house beer called Oktoberfest.  Good choice.

Tomato basil soup: fresh and warm topped with bread pieces.  Tasty and simple.

Fettucini Alfredo with Blackened Chicken: This entrée off the lunch menu was the low point.  The pasta was undercooked and a little tough.  Garlic bread was too hard.  At least the chicken was cooked well.

Peanut Butter Piezookie:  Im not a religious man but if there's a heaven, this must be what they serve.  Freshly baked peanut butter cookie topped with two big scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Death row inmates should request this for a last meal.  Go to BJ's for this item alone and you'll leave happy.

The service was very good.  Maybe a little too good.  There could have been a few less \"how is everything?\" moments in mid-bite.  Maybe they thought I was a critic or something since I took pics of everything. I will hand it to my server who followed me to the parking lot with the keys I forgot at my table.

I will definitely be back.  This review would be five stars if not for the issues with my entrée."}
{"text":"Just signed up for the new BJs rewards card. Try their own beers and the Lunch specials are bar none amazing! Had an amazing server and everything about the place was very good!"}
{"text":"Been here countless times for birthdays and lunch. All their portion sizes are big enough to share since I never ever finish my entree. It's a great place to bring a group if you're treating cuz you'll be saving money. Large entrees that are shareable are probably the deep dish pizzas (yum) and their pastas. I also think their lunch special runs from 11am - 3pm. It is also really nice to just come here and sit at the bar with a beer and watch some games on their tvs. 

Service: I'm really surprised at all the negative comments about service. I went during lunch this past Friday and my server was more than beyond courteous and very attentive. He came back to check on us 2-3 times and also made sure to let us know that the food was on its way. I guess you just have to get lucky?"}
{"text":"I had a bison burger sauce was really runny like the added Lotta water to it to stretch it very sticky. My wife had the pulled pork the pork tastes like it was going bad It had a Texter like Jell-O almost made me puke. I told the waitress the manager came out with all kind of attitude he told me when they get it it has a lot of fat. he told me how they cooked it I guess I just ate fat the waitress was the bomb so nice. Would I go there again never ever there was nobody in the restaurant now I know why need to get rid of the manager put somebody who cares about the food."}
{"text":"Just got back from a late lunch here. NOT HAPPY. First off it took our server 5 minutes to even come by our table to ask for our drink order. We got side salads, which had brown lettuce. Didn't get silverware, and had to stop a host to get silverware. Once we got our entrees, we didn't get ketchup, had to actually get up and ask another table to take the one from their table. Also didn't see our server once we got our entrees for about 15 min after we had our food to stop and ask how it was. My burger was NOT cooked to medium. The server didn't add cheese to another burger. Had to ask to get a refill. Just all around bad food and bad service. And, our server only had three tables, so it's not like she was swamped. I've worked in the restaurant business for 7 years, that was the worst service I've had in a long time. Skip this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"BJs is pretty good. I've been here now twice. the first time was for lunch  and i had some chicken fingers and fries w/ a pumpkin ale. 
Las night Danielle and i went for dinner. 
She had the barbacoa chicken and i had the jambalaya. i used their Mobile app which made the whole process very convenient. i ordered, set my arrival time and paid (and received my royalty points) all from my app. very cool we were in and out in a half hour. 
While our meals were good, the Honey, Sriracha Brussell Sprouts may have been the best appetizer I've ever had anywhere. so delicious."}
{"text":"Pricey for a weekend lunch but worth every penny!! (Did look like they offer some weekday lunch specials).
They were extremely busy.  Our server, Molly, was still in training with Deanna. Even with that combination,  the service and speed to get orders was incredible! Both the salmon and prime rib were wonderful, and the handcrafted sodas are worth the nominal price difference."}
{"text":"This a local favorite for good food and drinks, a great atmosphere and the service is awesome. Norris and Emily are our favorite bartenders because they are always so welcoming and nice with huge smiles on their faces. It's always nice to stop in after a hard days work and enjoy good company over great drinks :)"}
{"text":"The portions here are surprisingly large. For a chain restaurant, the food quality is quite good. A very, very easy 4-star review. Have no fear about ordering here, you may not be totally wowed by your experience but you'll definitely not be disappointed. 

My wife and I both ended up ordering the same thing: Santa Fe Salad. She got chicken, I got chicken and in addition the salmon (typically it's a substitution, I ordered double meat). I ordered mine without bell peppers as well.

A bad restaurant would reply to removing bell peppers with \"Sorry the salad is pre-made we can't do subtractions.\" BJ's just said \"okay\". That's a great first sight.

As appetizers we had Chicken Potstickers and Potato Skins. 

Let me just review all the food at once: for the price, I got larger portions than expected; the flavor was great, the food was cooked well, the variety of ingredients in the dishes was as-expected for potato skins, and was a pleasant surprise for the salads.

I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5-star review. 4 seems like the right answer. While everything was good -- really good, just what I was looking for and up to my standards -- it is still a chain restaurant, and nothing really *pops* about it in a unique or outstanding way. 

BJ's is definitely one of my go-to restaurants for classic, totally solid American-style food (even though I ordered a mexican-inspired entree salad and an asian-inspired appetizer)."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place i did . And it had its good points . But average is the best i can say for 10 dollar sandwiches and more. My first trip and my food did not arrive as ordered. Management came to table didnt care just said \" it's not the waiters falt. Ill breing you cheese and yhe like so you can fix it\". And the came back to say he wanted to let me know he was not going to charge me for the missing items. Well thank you. The fries are good and the beer fair ."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the cooks because the food was good. The restaurant manager and condition of the restaurant were terrible. 
We were greeted and seemed normal but then noticed most ppl had their coats on eating and it was freezing. 
The server was not great but ok and said the furnace was not operating correctly. Um ok?  And why didn't they warn us before we were seated. It was obvious they were trying to hide this issue until you got into your meal!!!
We decided to stay and ordered appetizers before our lunch. 
All of the meals came out with the apps! 
I requested the manager. He was the worst thing about this place. Came to the table to debate and question my position on my complaints. 
I quickly realized the jerk I was dealing with and told him just forget it. 
No apology or offer of desert or discount or nothing. 
I travel and eat out all of the time. I will never eat at a BJ's ago. 
Eat anywhere else around the mall. 
Don't eat at BJ's because of the manager!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pomegranate margarita and porter beer.  The margarita came in a water glass, was extremely sour and tasted like pink grapefruit juice.  We requested a well done burger that was at most medium and the blackened salmon looked as if it had hit a frying pan with some butter and finished in the salamander.  Definitely not blackened.  The sauce on the plate tasted like water downed ranch dressing.  The clam chowder was over salted which took away from any taste it might have had.  They did comp us for the food and we paid for the drinks but in hindsight, should have also sent back the $10 margarita also.  We did tip the waitress appropriately since it was not her fault the food was lacking but we had to ask for silverware and napkins after the main course arrived."}
{"text":"BJ's has an extensive menu with something for everyone.  When you can't decide where to dine it will always work in a pinch."}
{"text":"Went in last night with a group of friends, Matt was our server. That guy was awesome! We had a great meal, and a few rounds of drinks from the tap. Matt asked a few questions and told us to leave it up to him. We were blown away by that guy's service! Every beer was perfect especially with our meal! No doubt next time we visit Vegas he'll be running the joint!"}
{"text":"I have been to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse many times this location is my favorite. Food is wonderful has a very wide spread selection to choose from. The beer they brew is awesome very tasty love that they give sample flights to taste from in decent size glasses. I was a bit shocked when I found out that they don't offer growlers ( take home beer ) for taking your beer home. They only have growlers for their sodas I hope this will change. The beer dinners are very fun and educational you get to sample different beers not just the beer they brew. The beer dinners often have decorations and good dinner that includes appetizer and desert from their menu. Staff and customer service has always been good and wait time can vary based on the time you get their."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here after eating a pasta dish with shrimp. I had to pull over and vomit to make the sick feeling go away. Everyone else in my party liked the place so I hate to knock it but when you puke your guts out before you get home it sours your opinion on a place ya know."}
{"text":"OK so I love beer and I love pizza, both things that BJ's has and, I think, does well. However, I've been here a few times and every time the service was slow and a bit scattered. Let me explain what happened this last time:

I came here with one of my friends to have lunch before we went shopping at the mall one Sunday afternoon. The place was kind of busy but they had a lot of servers on the floor...it looked to me like each server maybe had 3 or 4 tables (I could very well be wrong here though). My friend was already waiting at our table with waters when I got there, and explained to me that our server would come back and take our drink orders once I was ready. I really don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that we waited for at least 10 minutes before she came back. When she came around, I asked her about this beer they had on special and asked if I could try it while my friend ordered a Fathead's Holly Jolly. Our server was more than happy to bring me a tasting of the special and I ordered it since it was delish! I really don't think i'm exaggerating again when I say that it was at least another 10 minutes until she came back with my drink, and at this point my friend had already finished hers. The downside to all of this is that we hadn't even ordered our food yet and we'd already been there at least 20+ minutes. 

By the time we were able to order our food, we were starving and opted to each get a side salad and split a flatbread pizza...pepperoni on all of it and banana peppers on just half. BJ's is fancy and the servers are able to put in the orders on these touchscreen pads at the table so they go straight to the bar/kitchen. Now I don't know if our server put in the pizza wrong or if the kitchen just messed up but there was only pepperoni on half and banana peppers on half. Not a huge deal since I could've done without the pepperoni anyway. Now the salads: mine was a delicious garden salad that had an abundance of different veggies, while my friend ordered the caesar...it ended up being probably half the size of what mine was. 

I know I could've given BJ's a 3-star rating for this experience, but I really do like their food (when it comes out right). The service is definitely on the slower side, even when they're slow (I know because I've been there when it's slow...and they're slow). I love the space of the place, especially in the summer time when the patio is open. I will definitely go back and enjoy something from their huge menu, but I will make sure to bring a little patience with me next time. :)"}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. Terrible EVERYTHING.I would rather have eaten rocks from a homeless persons shopping cart. California apparently means bread + burnt party. On the upside it was precut making its terribleness much more apparent. After numerous terrible talks with the waitress I finally obtained items which were listed on the menu. 

It was rewarding to build my burger to my taste as I felt a sense of accomplishment but I digress. Luckilly planes fly over constantly and it gave me hope one might by chance crash into the restaurant and end my dinner early, proper."}
{"text":"Went in and told 1.5 hrs wait after hearing then tell people 45 min. ! Ridiculous! Take reservations then!"}
{"text":"My husband loves to eat at this place. They have something on the menu for everybody. They are super busy though so our orders have gotten mixed up a few times. Overall, still a good restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"Just no. 
I've tried the salads, pizza, hamburgers... The only thing that miiiight be worth it is the salmon. But other than that... Just don't. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"They have a good tuna poke appetizer and the turkey burger is awesome. The service is always good. Prices are reasonable and the beers are exceptional. The pazookies are definitely worth a try. They have a trio that you can pick three different types for. It makes everyone in the family happy to get to choose their own dessert."}
{"text":"I love BJ's, but I just had a terrible experience here and I hate to bring up race. 

I asked to watch the soccer game and it took 10 minutes to switch the Channel. After they switched the channel, a couple of folks, that happen to be white, that barely arrived, complained about the soccer game and wanted to see baseball. The staff immediately changed the channel to the baseball. 

Honestly this is beneath me and BJ's, it's the the fact that it happen. The server should have kindly told the couple that there was a request before them, and should have given them alternative accommodations."}
{"text":"The wings here are excellent.  I rate them at the top now that VooDoo Daddy's is no longer in business.  

Their other food items are good as well.  Nothing too special, but very above average.

The wait staff has always performed to my expectations.

If you are a fan of rootbeer, this is the place for you.  They brew their own, and it is magnificent.  It's got a good bite to it.

This place is able to accommodate different types of customers.  They have an outdoor seating area, they have a large bar equipped with flat screen TV's and surrounding bar tables, bar stools, & booths, they have their general dining area wrapped around the middle of those two areas.  

I'd come here for the wings alone."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. Family of 5, 5+ visits and yet to eat a meal together (at the same time). Started off with ordering take out. One or two items would  never make it home(always jokingly saying \"hey, let's make sure everything is here\"!).  I Would have to drive back (8miles) for the ribs or whatever else wasn't packed. 
  Finally went and Dined in. All went pretty smooth until my wife's order came in with raw and frozen chicken. Pretty busy place so it took a few minutes (felt like ten) before we were able to wave someone down. Of course, they would have to re-do the meal so while we all ate, my wife had to wait another 10+minutes to eat. Manager did come and apologize, and it's not the end of the world I told him. Nothing a beer on the house wouldn't smooth out. That wasn't happening I was told. Okay!! The dish was covered though. Another meal we didn't eat together. 
Last visit was Father's Day 2018. Busy of course. 30-40 minute table wait turned into 1 hour. (Still no problem at this point). Ordered food and drinks right away since we had plans afterwards. A salad came in minutes. We didn't get our drinks yet, and we got a salad, drinks came in probably 10-15 minutes after the salad. Again, very busy day with somewhat extremely packed tables throughout( understable). I kinda felt squeezed in my chair because the servers walk in between you and whoever sits behind you (not a booth). Got our food and it's good, really good. Where are the sides? One came in a few minutes later, one came in after I was almost done with my dinner. 
Food is good. Service, Very inconsistent. Every. Single. Time. Simple things can make this place right. Our server was great. A little over 2 hours later, we left. 
On the way out, kids and I waved goodnight to the hosts...all 3 of them had their noses in their phones with no response. 
Whatayougonnado....
Like I said, we really wanted to like this place..."}
{"text":"Food tastes good.....once we got some silverware.  I had to ask twice after the food was served.  I ordered the shrimp and asparagus pene.  There is very little asparagus and a half dozen shrimp.  My friend's  spaghetti and meatballs looks good.  Server is friendly."}
{"text":"This is a reliable spot near my house, but it certainly isn't anything special. The prices are a great value, but the wait on the weekends is beyond ridiculous and the parking situation is a deterrent. My favorite thing is the Gourmet Mac and Cheese on the small appetizer menu. Food tastes a little processed and unhealthy, but it is basically all bar food."}
{"text":"It was our first night out to dinner in quite a while so it took sometime before we finally decided on a place. BJ's on centennial did not let us down. The service was quick and friendly, the jambalaya and seared ahi salad were absolutely amazing. I would definitely go back again and again"}
{"text":"I usually love BJs restaurants but this location is horrible. First off we got there around 3:30 pm with our toddler son. We asked if we could sit in a booth and the hostess rolled her eyes at us and told us with attitude we can't have a high chair at the booth, which is fine with us because our kid uses a booster seat. We get our booth and there aren't too many customers here but somehow it takes 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order and another 15 minutes to actually get the drinks and order our food. Now onto the food. I usually order a Cesar salad but this one looked like they gave me old salad. A lot of the salad was brown and didn't taste the same. The pizza takes forever to get to us which is surprising because there is no one at the restaurant. We finally get our pizza and it hardly has any cheese on it. It tasted like we were just eating bread with chunks of tomato on it. And to top it off our drinks were never refilled. Worst experience at a BJs ever. Will not be coming back to this location. I would rather spend the extra time to drive to the Chandler location."}
{"text":"BJ's always has good food but the service is usually sub-par. This place would get 5 stars if they could just improve in that area. I like their salads, burgers, pizzas and they also have some pretty good lemonades."}
{"text":"The staff Is friendly and the beers are good, but today is not their day for food. We have tried the \"new\" deep fried portobello mushrooms, which looked amazing. Unfortunately they taste like grease.  Then we moved on to the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts...(picture enclosed)...they were burnt, bitter and unappetizing. Very disappointed.

Now to the Nacho Flat Bread...looks good, but the crust is burnt.  Whoever is the chef today (July 17th 2016) needs to be fired...or think of a new profession. It is taking everything I have  not to personally walk this back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and fun vibe.  This is one of my favorite places to bring guests because of the large menu selection.  They offer a little bit of everything that caters to even the pickiest eater.  Service is always friendly and courteous.  Only complaint is that it's often chilly so just go prepared and bring a light weight jacket."}
{"text":"Always a solid option!  You looking for this and that?  BJ's provides a little bit of this and a little of that for whatever you are looking for.  I have been coming here pretty much since it opened.  Never a negative experience.  From the service to the constant evolving menu, you can find your favorites and new additions to boot.

I am a true fan!  The difference is split between this location and another in the immediate are.  It would seem....I always choose this location.  The parking is in not F$%^@! up and the quality is solid!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food at BJs is just  ok. Definitely not a place for dinner. I recommend you go here for beer  and finger foods"}
{"text":"I've never been here but my parents had while in Alabama. I tried the Barbadoa chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The fire-roasted tomatoes were a nice touch. The rice and beans were decent, although I did not taste any feta cheese. My mom tried the shrimp tacos which she enjoyed. 

It seemed like the wait staff was tired and running low on energy. Mind you it was only 12:30. Our waitress was nice but was hard to find. I'll like to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"The wife & I had our 28th anniversary here last year, and loved it! Nice menu selections, everything we tried was yummy! Going back for our 29th this month!"}
{"text":"Bjs in Henderson is right near the 215. The Santa fe salad is awesome. The chips add a crunch to the old that makes it super good. I had to take a break from shoveling the entire thing in my face. It's huge, so be prepared."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here Friday night.  I go because my better half likes two particular things here.  The good is good.  I ordered the salmon with rice and broccoli.  It was really good.  I decided to try their root beer (maybe) ribs.  They were not bad at all.  I liked them.  The next time I go back I might try a rib entrée.  I do not drink anymore so can not comment on their beers."}
{"text":"It has been 2 years since my initial review and I still faithfully visit here. My current favorites are the jalapeno burger (they fry the jalapenos and they are amazing), the 5 meat pizza, and the oreo pazookie. They also added some new pazookies to the menu and the white chocolate raspberry is amazing. The service is always fantastic, love the atmosphere, and they always have a new list of seasonal brews.

They just started a loyalty card and I am saving up for the free $25 gift card. It is easy to use and I can check my balance on line. I am halfway there!"}
{"text":"Super bad service. Starts with the hostess who could care less if you want a table and doesn't even greet you. Then it got worse after we were seated. The service was slow and we ordered a hamburger cooked medium and it arrived rare, practically raw. They took it back and sent out another one. This one was cooked medium. But service was slow. The manager came out and mumbled something that I could not understand . None of the staff speaks very clearly here. When we got the bill, NOTHING was comped. Most restaurants will comp a meal that was poorly cooked or at least give a free desert. But they comped NOTHING. So the waitress got ZERO tip. The waitress should have requested that meal be comped. They lost a customer
tonight. This is not the first time I've had bad service but it will be the last as I won't return. There are tons of other restaurants to spend my money at and that provide much better service."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain restaurant but the food quality is great I love coming here never disappointed they have the best wings and amazing avocado egg rolls I love the pozzikies (I think that's how you spell it) this place is def my guilty pleasure and the service is great"}
{"text":"My Dad recently moved into a new place.  After a full day of my sister and I helping to get him settled in, we decided a nice warm meal was needed on this very, very cold day (last weekend).

I decided to go \"old school\" with the chicken tenders served with skinny fries and a strawberry lemonade.  Dad had the roast beef with au jus, and my sister went for a burger.

The chicken tenders were tender with a generous amount of breading.  The strawberry lemonade was unfortunately just too sweet.  The fries were cooked perfectly!  All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"I haven't been here before, but it was an interesting first experience. I had a great waitress who was very friendly and helpful. We had two problems with our food, but the manager took one off of our bill and fixed the other one. Overall, I was very pleased and would recommend this restaurant. I will go back again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've never reviewed BJ's because pizza is one of my favorite things, and I love going there! I've been to this BJs and also the one at South Hills Village many times. Only once did I order something other than pizza (I believe it was tacos!). My boyfriend and I loveeee the pizza. I usually get a small (for myself) because I like to take a few pieces for leftovers! My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza, my boyfriend's is the classic combo. The chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken are also good contenders. Tonight I tried the Great White, which had Alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. So good!! We've always had really friendly service at both locations and the beer they have on tap is pretty excellent too!"}
{"text":"So I decided to go to this place today and why I was not happy at all good was cold and let me tell you the food took forever and for it to come cold was not good I don't know if the kitchen was backed up or what but it sure showed with the slow past on how the food came and to be cold was the worst my kids hated there food my son Mac and cheese was cold daughter burger they forgot the cheese and my niece didn't even eat her mini corndogs I give it a 2 due to that my server was great and atmosphere is cool but the kitchen suck I wanted to order dessert but that made had took a long time and my be over cooked so I didn't probably will not be back"}
{"text":"We have been to this Mentor location several times and have always been greeted promptly to be seated.  Service and food has always been top rated!

You will find no other menu as extensive as BJ's!  There's something for everyone!  Our favorites are the Ahi Tuna Poke or Nashville Hot Wings for an appetizer.  For dinners we love the Ribeye, the Ahi Tuna Salad, New Shrimp and Arugula Tacos, and the New Orleans Jambalaya!  Their burgers are great, too!

You cannot leave without a Pizookie!  The Salted Caramel is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"BJ's never disappoints. After the amazing service from our last visit we came back this past week and wow! Same 5-star service and delicious food. This time we had Jackie as our server. She made excellent recommendations and was just gracious from beginning to end. This restaurant is now our weekly go-to spot. Thank you!!! And the Extreme Pepperoni is my new heaven."}
{"text":"Having some under-cooked chicken at BJs....sitting next to another guest with a complaint as well...manager putting out fires tonight...at least the beer is cold....avoid this place if you can...hopefully I don't get salmonella"}
{"text":"Ill admit it we continue to eat here every now and then.. the food is okay but mostly because they are open late. The customer service here is just so god awful. That being said not all the servers are bad w4eve maybe had 2 that were awesome. But the hosts are rude and dont seem to care when you walk in the door. The plates, silverware,  and glassware is DISGUSTING.  I once found some nasty gooey something in my water and when we told the server her response was ill come back for it later, so my advice to you bring your own water/ drink. Check your silverware before eating with it. And lastly make sure you dont have hair in your food because i found a nice long one in the caprese app. Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"We always get seated right away whenever we come to this place. The service here has always been fast and friendly. My only complaint is that the menu is so overwhelming!!! There's always so much to choose from and it's hard to make a decision. Regardless, we always save room for their pizookie."}
{"text":"One of our suppliers insists on taking us here for lunch about once a quarter.  It kinda sucks.  Not offensive, but awfully boring.  Things on the broad menu look like they should be better than they are.  Blah.

Plus we can't booze at lunch.  What I've had for booze here (nothing recent) has not been at all noteworthy.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Kudos to this BJs! Food is always excellent and the service great! Love the huge choice of menu items too! Have never had a bad meal here.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Front host was great super friendly. Didn't wait for a table at all. Quick to sit us. (Party of 6) The sever we had was such a nice lady. However the quality of the food was terrible. First we ask for cokes and they kept giving us diet ones for some reason. We order poke bowl - don't get it, it never gets brought out but of course it's on the bill. Then my sister and I order the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich and mine is great, but they brought out the classic chicken sandwich instead for my sister. Instead of making her the correct sandwich they brought out some microwaved hot sauce to put on it. My nephew never got his side of fries (yet again it was on the bill.) finally the booth and the wall behind us was so gross and dirty. Didn't look like it was wiped at all for maybe days?! A spider bit my fiancé. I can't believe this happened to us especially while in summerlin! We spoke to Allen he was very nice and actually cared what was going on. Then the GM Paul came over and blamed all the errors on the waitress. And that wasn't the case. She took our order correctly and the people in the kitchen and servers where the ones messing things up. Along with the bus boys who clearly don't clean properly. He was so unprofessional and quick to place blame and had the nerve to say that we were \"complaining\" I let him know that customer service is his job and placing blame on someone won't solve the issue of the food being poorly prepared and the kitchen not making the food in the back. I let him know it's a difference between complaining vs facts. Facts was, the food wasn't good, the place was dirty and we didn't get our complete orders, yet was charged for them. Paul, as a GM please work on ownership and customer service skills. We will not be back. EVER. #bye!"}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to write a review on BJ's. I've been to many of their locations in the past, but it was never really anything memorable. Perhaps I wasn't paying attention.

Recently, a friend and I came to this location for dinner. I like the beer selection (both in-house and other craft brews). 

The food was awesome! I had a steak that was cooked to my liking. The best part is my friend got the Jambalaya. She raved about it before we arrived, but I didn't really pay much attention. I tried a bite and was floored at how savory, spicy and perfect this dish tasted.

The menu is quite diverse. You'll find something for everyone. Service is good.

This is a great \"go to\" spot if you are in the area.

Don't miss the jambalaya."}
{"text":"Was taken here by client.

Chips and salsa were a decent standard appetizer.

Hopstorm IPA was a pretty solid IPA, not overly hoppy.

Had the grilled pork chops, very well cooked, decent portion size, sides (salad, green beans, mashed tatos) were relatively uninteresting but no real negatives.

The individual pizzas looked really good, prices seemed very fair. Good choice for solid food + beer."}
{"text":"It was my birthday dinner. I was so excited to eat my yummy meal. I sat at at a table and ordered my drink. The waiter came by MY TABLE and had the AUDACITY to ask if any of us had ordered Sierra Mist. Who the hell does he think he is? Why on earth would I have Sierra Mist ON MY BIRTHDAY. I was so upset I cried. The tears rolled down my cheek into my pepsi, adding a salty and sad flavor. Then a waiter came over and hit on my sister. I was livid. He touched her shoulder and even gave her a kiss. Shortly after I realized it was my sisters boyfriend, so it was all good. The food was tasty. I had chicken Alfredo that had broccoli in it. My taste buds rejoiced after every bite. It was incredible. I thought of all the good drinks that go with Alfredo, and Sierra Mist isn't one of them. It's just a shitty version of Sprite. The restroom was very nice and sanitary. I went in there to get away from my mom yelling about politics. She screamed \"FUCK TRUMP\" as she downed her 9th glass of wine. I would recommend going here, but only if you will be VERY CLEAR about what drink you will be ordering."}
{"text":"we going to go to On the Border Mexican Restaurant in the same center,  but the wait was so long we just went over here to BJ's.   I'm glad we did.   The waitress was very nice and service was good.  the food was very good.  My wife ordered the chicken with balsamic vinegar and caramelized onions.  This was just outright Delicious and amazing.  My Daughter ordered a steak cooked medium rare.   most of the time they get that wrong in restaurants,  here it was perfect med. rare.  I also ordered steak and asked for just medium.   it was perfect.   I'm so glad we did not go to the Mexican restaurant now.  I've found a new place to eat in Mesa!  the food was just great."}
{"text":"One word, Pazookies. Their Ghirardelli Pazookies is the best, so much chocolate. They are known for their deep dish pizzas are draft root beer, both of which are excellent. I am never disappointed when I go."}
{"text":"We've had highs and lows here (and the lows have been REALLY bad). But tonight, great meal, attentive service from our server Rob, who was wonderful! However, it's UNACCEPTABLE that BJs has now switched to a noname crappy  ketchup and removed Heinz from the tables. Pittsburgh is the home of Heinz, and our stadium is named after it. I'll be avoiding this location until It is replaced!"}
{"text":"Okay been here a few times now, however today the service was so bad.  We liked the deep dish pizza but I ordered a wedge salad with ranch instead of blue cheese but alas it came with blue cheese.  Not that it really mattered as our pizza came within THREE minutes after our salad was delivered.  I needed a refill and my hubby wanted another beverage  but again getting service was impossible!  If you don't mind lousy service and are NOT going to a movie they do have a wide variety of of brews, but overall not a recommendation in my book.  Sorry as this is a new place but too many visits with really lousy servers!"}
{"text":"Nathan is legit the best server in the world. Typical bar/restaurant atmosphere, solid American food."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday afternoon and it was very busy as i suspected it would be. Seated fairly promptly. Waitress was Nicole. Very pleasant and friendly. I had the new quacamole burger. Huge. Tasty but hot. It was loaded with jalapeños. Had to open the whole thing and discard some of them and i do like spicy. It was good but not 13 dollars good. Will go back but not for that burger."}
{"text":"I'm not a giant fan of chains, especially places like this where it is always busy and everyone is either frazzled or waiting for food. But the staff at the SHV BJ's Brewhouse keep things under control with ease and calmness. We've been to the location countless times before and there is rarely an issue. My favorite is the California chicken club sandwich, but the deep-dish pizza is always quite good, especially when it's half off on Mondays. But this place has a giant menu. Very little of it is health food, but you sort of know that when you walk in. They have lots of great beer on tap and even house-made sodas. Their signature dessert, the pizookie is also worth a look. I got a free one for signing up for their loyalty program and haven't looked back since.

The reason I chose to leave a review today is because there was a problem with our order. A friend and I had some substitutions. Manager Audrey  came out and immediately made things right and held a conversation with us like we'd all been friends for years. The bill was properly adjusted and our replacement food was out in no time. Because of Audrey's friendly and professional attitude, we didn't even mind waiting a little longer. Props also go out to waitress Tawnya, who handled the situation calmly and professionally too. 

It's a 5-star review because I've been to many restaurants where when a problem occurs, the staff handles everything in a lousy way. But the people at this BJ's want you to walk out happy. And you do."}
{"text":"My family of 7 came here last night when the wait next door at Burgatory was 90 minutes. BJs was full as well, but they did a great job getting us seated inside 15 minutes. The food was very good, and the service was decent though not without a few issues. A few individual thoughts:

Deep dish pizza got rave reviews. Really top notch and a spot on the favorite pizza list.

New Orleans Jambalaya was excellent. Just the right amount of spicy.

Burgers were quite good. One was over cooked so only got an average review. The bacon cheeseburger was excellent.

Shoestring fries are great if that's your thing. If you like your fries more potatoey, these won't be your favorite.

Service was quite fast overall, though they did get a couple things wrong. No cheese on a burger, fries instead of salad as a side, etc. But not a huge deal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped this evening since we were both hungry and wanted to catch the football game.
My other half was a bit disappointed since we missed the first game and had a training session instead for Super Bowl volunteers, since I thought this would help with the football withdrawal and it did.
Bad part: We were seated in an area that had several large parties that left and  being cleaned up and ready set for two more large parties.  
Waited for 10-15 minutes trying ALL the wait staff in our area to get something to drink. Of course they all walked by as if I wasn't seen. The one server that was supposed to have our table wouldn't acknowledge we were there even if I was naked. Too bad she was the same girl complaining to her boss when we got there about too much work. She wasn't very quiet about it.
Good part: Jessica saw me trying to get attention and greeted us and asked if she could get the drinks since the other girl was busy.  
Apparently she was assigned or agreed to serve us since after she brought drinks and she let us know she was taking out table. She was friendly and attentive.  Kept the refills coming on the mock tail tea I decided to try. The pizza was smaller than I expected but on second thought was a blessing since it left room for dessert.. Can we say Beignet time?
The hubs had the bacon cheeseburger and a Light Switch beer. Almost finished it too but it was well not medium as ordered, cold bun and not skinny fries but the wedges as he wanted but he was too hungry to send it back.
The Beignet was yum...I love those things.  Someday  I hope to visit New Orleans for one there.
I rate this location a 3 because we have always had great service and food in prior visits but a 2 for this evening and Jessica was a 10."}
{"text":"A bunch of us got together for dinner last week to get caught up.  I've eaten at the Chandler location and really enjoyed it.  This time was different:

First of all...the service was exemplary.  The decor is cute and the restaurant was actually so cold we all carried sweaters.

The food, however, was only ok.  I had the ahi salad and substited poke.  There was a really strong dressing that made it  inedible.  2 of my dining companions also had salads, which were prononounced \"adequate\".  Our other dining companion had pasta, which she liked.

Ultimately, the experience was not horrible but was not exemplary either.  For those who live in the area and know the menu, it's a safe choice

As for me, I'm not inclined to go back."}
{"text":"Ok. So one of the lunch companions in our
\"foodie club\" is actually THE Duke at this 
very establishment. Yup. THAT many check-ins.
I'm not really sure exactly what benefits a 
title like \"Duke Of BJ's\" would get you. 
Perhaps it might get you out of a speeding 
ticket or get you backstage at a classic rock 
dinosaur reunion show but you might end up
having to \"prove\" your credentials. So anyway
this place is never my first choice but it
gets voted in our rotation so I'm a regular 
here. The lunch special tacos are light and
make for a decent lunch. The miso salmon is
also good although a bit pricey. And I must
say the Chicken Parmigiana is also quite 
doable. Came here once for a happy hour and
appetizers were meh. Also, you never know
what level of service you'll get. We've got
some very professional and courteous waitresses
and we also have had our share of either totally
clueless or just plain rude waitresses. We
never have seen the latter a second time so 
that's a good thing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant on a Friday evening.  I was disappointed that the \"Happy Hour\" was just in the bar, we seat in the main dinning room.  I would have ordered a drink, it just rubbed me wrong that they advertise Happy Hour, thinking it's for the entire restaurant.  We ordered a salad and a main entry.  We waited and waited, then the entire came.  Halfway into our meal, the salads arrived.  We turned them back.  The manager came to us and apologized and offered us a free desert.  The food was very good, the desert was nice."}
{"text":"Visiting a friend in Vegas and they suggested that we go to BJ's for a drink and a bite to eat. I was a little skeptical since I prefer a less commercial environment. We arrived during happy hour and Roy, my bartender for the evening made this a very pleasurable experience. There was really good energy and we even met some cool people that I'm sure we'll hang out with again. Good food too. Avocado rolls, Santa Fe salad and salmon we're all good choices!"}
{"text":"I put my name in at 606pm on the app and checked in at 630. The app said I had a 60 minute wait. Once I got to the restaurant they quoted me at 1.5 hours for a total of 2 hours. When I asked the manager he said I haven't waited that long. Overall it's not his fault but it was handled poorly. This is my second bad experience. I planned to use a gift card the company sent me because of my previous bad experience. I'll give them another chance since it's still new and the people are nice."}
{"text":"been to this location about 5 times now.  and it is consistently DECENT.  service is always very robotic and lacks personality, and beer refills take forever unless your at the bar/lounge.
they have a good selection of beers, but i stick my boddingtons pub ale!! last nite had a small pizza and wedge salad, the others had grilled shrimp tacos and a classic turkey club. all were good, but not stellar. was there at 6:30, and the place was half full and staff standing around everywhere.
i give 3 stars because its so consistent, and what else ya gonna get in henderson if your not in the mood for one particualr thing,  they have a big menu so everyone can find something.
3 of us for dinner with a few beers was 60 bucks"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. The food is great.  The avocado rolls are delicious.  The Santa Feel salad with the blackened salmon is the best. They have tropical tea unsweetened which is nice for a change. Great customer service and comfortable booths."}
{"text":"BJ' restaurant is such a fun place to go for a casual lunch or dinner. I really do love the location as well and my children can not get enough of their pizzookies if I being honest neither can I! it is a diffident item to get!"}
{"text":"Really wish i had something good to say about this place. I definitely had high hopes. 

Unfortunately the service was slow. The appetizers were delivered nearly the same time as the meal. And to top it off, my burger was so burnt it was impossible to eat. 

No apologies. No caring. No return."}
{"text":"Kym At the bar was super nice. Best service and really knowledgeable ! Great place for Sunday football. Recommend the jerryburst or the jerimah red beer . Good vibes"}
{"text":"Just finished one of the lunch specials called Baracoa Taco's. The tag-line for these was low calories. There was a picture of the plate on a table tent, looked good, went for it. And then, it was served...and luckily I have good vision, or I am afraid I would not have seen them. Tere are three tiny tacos and a bowl of black beens. The tacos were maybe 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the beans in the picture number likely  around 200, and I got maybe 30, covered in bean sauce. They should have placed a quarter on the plate in the picture to give some sense of scale. They could have served an eighth of a hamburger and got away with the same lo-cal claim. Anything reduced to micro size will be lo-cal. As for taste, OK, no better. Ate there a week ago with a friend and had a burger, Average at best."}
{"text":"Our server was great-bummed I can't remember his name. But our food was good. We got the fried portobello mushrooms and I got a peach margarita: $9.50 for the margarita- can't say it was worth that much. I got a burger which was good and my husband got a steak which he loved, but it was a little burnt on the outside for me. Overall decent place to go."}
{"text":"Bj's is great! Always have great food and great service! Always love going with a group of friends cause they are always really accomodating!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to home... Excellent food quality and consistently good service.  It is larger than it looks from the outside and has a completely open feel with high ceilings and a huge bar area.  Seems like it would be a fun place to hang with friends and it's also family-friendly; our kids love the menu!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend BJs for families even though it is a brewhouse. They bring out a small cup of fruit and a roll for young children. This really helps the parents! The menu is very large and hard to get through, but they definitely have a large selection. My husband was very pleased with his burger. I had the ahi tuna salad. Our servers have really helped to make the experience go well offering beer and food specials. Our drinks and then food came out quickly. We look forward to having this as a reliable restaurant for the family."}
{"text":"It was Mother's Day, and after being dumped at the crepe shop, our group was feeling stood up and a touch angry- but were able to get a table at BJ's with a bearable wait time. 

I was surprised with how good the service was on such a busy day. The service was slow, but everything made it's way out within 40 minutes of when our food order was placed, and amazingly there was not a single thing wrong with any of our food. Is it sad that I expect something to go wrong with someone's order in a large group? 

This is a generic BJs, and the food is rarely ever anything that wows me so I was slightly disappointed that we had driven from NoLaVe to Hendertucky to get a pizza at BJs (huh.. hello.. we live around the corner from Old School Pizzeria!) but what really was outstanding was the service provided my the manager on duty. He was great in making sure our large group had enough room to dine comfortably, and even came back around to check up on us again. BRAVO! Finally, after a dry spell of awful service we have a day of good service, I had even started to feel like I was jaded about service.

Will I be back? Probably not to this one since it's so far, but I have no problems visiting another BJs- we probably frequent the chain twice a year when I'm feeling too lazy to cook and we can't decide on anything."}
{"text":"I've been to BJs two different times now and each time nothing has really stuck out to me. I love the different variety of beers but food seems to be so-so and overpriced. I got the black and blue burger, which was only 5 oz, kind of small for a burger and I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well. my boyfriend ordered the baked ziti which was $15 and he said it was very good but the portion was SMALL. and we all know how cheap it is to make pasta. the pizookie are awesome! I doubt I would seek out BJs, the food is decent though. but if you want a good burger, go to the rail!"}
{"text":"Great Spot whether you're looking to grab lunch or dinner. They have a little of everything from simple appetizers to pastas/salads/pizzas/ burgers and more. 

They offer a large variety of beers including a lot of locally brewed beers. They have booths and tables that you can wait to be seated as well as a bar area that is first come first serve. I've been here a handful of times and have never had to wait longer than 15 minutes.

The environment is nice for a date after a movie or just a place to hang with friends to catch a game. They have a decent amount of TV's by the bar. 

Make sure you save room for dessert as they have some amazing pizookies! Also if you want to try something different try their Avocado Egg rolls one of my favorite!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. Waitress Crystal is always so friendly we now ask for her section. We eat here at least once a week. Always fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Service was bad but Manager made up for it with free dessert.  Food was ok.  I have had better ar other locations.  I may give them another chance."}
{"text":"So I met up with a buddy today for a leisurely lunch and had a great time!  This is important because I had low expectations based on the Yelp feedback I've read.  We got seated outside to take advantage of the great weather and I was pleasantly surprised by attentive and prompt service.  We chatted for a while before ordering and got some great suggestions from our server.

I've been craving a burger in the worst way.  I only have a couple a year and expect a lot from them.  BJ's burger came with parmesan toasted buns, tomato, pickles, lettuce, bacon, cheese, and a really delicious homemade.1000-Island dressing!  The meat was hi-quality and perfectly cooked..  It came with some yummy wedge fries.....I cleaned my plate!

My friend had a wedge salad and a bread bowl with clam chowder.  She loved every bite!  I was pretty stuffed but she talked me into sharing a trio of pizzookies with ice cream.  They were delicious too, especially the peanut butter with vanilla.

I was impressed overall and will be back.  I think the folks who have rated this place negatively should try it again.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Server could've been more attentive.  Sat in dining area instead of bar.  My steak too done."}
{"text":"Love BJ's (in more ways than one ). Seriously though - always great food and service. Hand crafted black cherry soda is to die for - and don't forget a pazooki for dessert. Oh, and their Brussel sprout appetizer - seems like it would not be good but it is great."}
{"text":"So, I ran out of gift ideas for Christmas.  I found myself at Fry's at the gift card section.  I decided to buy my wife a couple of gift cards (cheaper than jewelry).  I picked up a Carrabas and one to BJ's since we had never been there.  Our friends did tell us that they liked it so I thought, why not.  

We stopped in for lunch yesterday and sat at the bar.  We were greeted as soon as we sat down by the bartender who took his time to go over the menu and the beer selections.  We did sample a few different beers and they were good.

The menu is very complete and looked good.  We decided to try a sampler plate and a couple of side salads.  The food was fresh and prepared perfectly.  

I am sure we will return again.   It was a great experience and total cost for \"lunch\" and \"some\" adult beverages was under $40.00"}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night , Sarah, our waitress was amazing. We are at one of the BJ's restaurants weekly and we found Sarah to be the best waitress in our 4 year experience. Friendly, always keeping the drinks flowing, asked if we wanted our tea''s to go, understood their rewards program.  And as always the food was great. Always a great place you can count on for great food and always consistent."}
{"text":"We celebrated Grandpa's 88th birthday and had a delightful time. Our server Garrett was attentive without rushing us. We'll visit again."}
{"text":"Ordered Ribs and rice bowl. Ribs were burnt and very dry. Asparagus was way over salted. Rice bowl tasted like a dry bran muffin. Service was good, decor good, but over prices for the poor quality of food we received."}
{"text":"I love their food and I've gone to quite a few BJ's around Las Vegas and this was my first time here and wow our service was so slow, i mean the waiter just brings the food so the kitchen was probably behind but we waited over 30 min for our food, although our server Maggie was amazing, she was friendly and was nice to update on the food status. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"Went to Bj's, had wine, drinks, salad and dinner.

My bill had a mistake which I caught later.  Was charged for two wines instead of one.   After waiting on hold for a very long time, manager said she would call me back with a resolution.  No call back."}
{"text":"Best of the Best. Never had a bad experience, recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone! I have a lot of items on there menu and must say i have never had a bad meal. Great Kids menu as well. Always a line out the door, but never have a problem getting a table"}
{"text":"Hit this place about once a month...always sit at bar. They have a couple of regular bartenders who really know the beers and are great for recommendations and service. However, if they are not there or go off-shift during your stay (like last night), bar service is terrible. Food is always good - whether you are ordering healthier stuff or splurging on that pork chop, ribs or pizza. All restaurants should have calories listed for each dish (like BJ's does).  Easy place to go based on size of menu, full bar service and huge beer selection...but bad service happening right in front of you (at bar) happens too often"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come here all the time but we just went for her 21st birthday and it was amazing. Our server Ruben was playing along with everything we threw at him and bringing her drinks he thought she would like. The pizza is incredible. I recommend  the Jeremiah red if you like beer and don't forget to have a pizookie at the end! Bjs has never failed me. Always a joy"}
{"text":"Food totally rocks!  We have eatten here, as well as, have done carry out.  It's almost always crowded on the weekend, but the wait is manageable.  The waitstaff is friendly and always able to give great recommendations!  Wonderful Fish Tacos!  Great portion size too...so you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Ahh BJ's... 6 months ago you were one of my favorites in the East Valley. Now, not so much. In fact, I may never go back. 
Always enjoyed the atmosphere which has not changed, usually the wait staff is competant, but the food was always great.  Good portions and quality ingredients, but not anymore. 
Server was very mechanical and short. Since others bring the food, what else dies she have to do except check on us and keep our drinks filled? Sad.
We ordered the Italian Market Salad which we usually split. It used to be a very finely chopped mountain of lettuce with great veggies, Garbanzo beans, cheese, meat etc. Now it has a small handful of white, droopy iceberg lettuce, tons of dressing and lots of white cheese balls. I could not finish my half (I was starving buy it was too gross) so we quickly paid and left. At this point even Taco Bell or Chipotle sounded good!  
So sad.."}
{"text":"This location used to be our favorite...they were always 5 out of 5 in everything. The last 6 months though - after second chance, third chance etc. of hoping they'd get it together - I'm afraid we will never go back to this location. The service over the last 6 months is terrible...the waiters are moody, the orders aren't accurate and you have to ask repeatedly for anything. The food has been perfect the last 2 times but prior to that the food was inconsistent and not accurate according to the menu (ex. the tomato mozzarella salad comes with balsamic reduction, olive oil, purple onion, garlic and basil...sometimes the onion would be left off completely other times there would be tarragon on it instead of basil!). It's more aggravating to go there then to just cook at home and clean up myself. Dinner there recently has sometimes taken an hour and half because they're so slow. On a weekend night we used to wait about 45 mins for a table for 4 and now we maybe wait 5-10 mins if at all...I think that says it all. Everyone is seeing the dip in quality and the poor service and are choosing to go elsewhere. Even the managers sometimes seem frazzled with what they're dealing with. The bathrooms are rarely clean and the restaurant isn't as clean as it used to be (I slipped on a grape on our last visit AND stepped in a puddle of melting ice in a separate part of the restaurant). Check your silverware - the last few times we've had to ask for new silverware as ours was still dirty. Your money would be well spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"We planned a girls lunch and here I'm so glad we did!  I had the enLightened Thai Chicken Salad.  It was really good and under 575 calories!   Courtney was our waitress and she was excellent!  Our drinks never went empty even during the busy lunch hour! 

Thank you for a great lunch!

Tip: Sign up for BJ's Premier Rewards Membership before you go.  You get seated much faster and they immediately email you a coupon for a free mini Pazooki!"}
{"text":"I love BJs! They have so many options in their menu, but the deep dish pizza is the best. My absolute favorite pizza! They do put tomatoes on every pizza, so if you don't like them make sure you request it without. Great service at this location. It was a busy Friday night, but our waitress didn't make us feel rushed at all and was very kind. Tried the corn fritters for an app which were very tasty too!"}
{"text":"GREAT DINNER! GOOD SERVICE! Consistent. 

My boyfriend and I came in for dinner the other night and sat at the bar. The bartender was so nice and so accommodating. We hope they will add \"sweet potato fries\" to the menu soon just because we think it would make a great addition! Who doesn't love sweet potato fries? Anyhow, the beers were good and the Black and Bleu Burgers were to die for! Happy with our choice to go to BJ's on Eastern. It was a great dinner. 

PS. Add Sweet Potato Fries to the menu pleasssssse! :)"}
{"text":"Our first and second time here was an awesome experience!      

The food was on par, the service was excellent and we even got the manager to come to our table and take a pic with us and a friend we had brought in with us to try their famous Pazookie dessert.

I tried the deep dish Pepperoni and 5 cheese pizza and my ex had a BBQ Brisket sandwich.  We practice Dicing 2 eat so the die each made us try a different drink, I had a Black cherry handcrafted soda which I didnt think was that great and he had a soda.    

Super crowded but that is usually a good sign and wait time was very minimal.   oh and they have a revolving door to get in and out which I love!

The second time we came here, I tried the Paella.   Delicious, not as spicy as they claim it to be but most of the food that people say is spicy doesnt really seem so much so to me, I am so used to eating really spicy food I guess  :/      

My friend had a steak which was excellent of course.

Our Third experience here which was tonight was not that great as far as service goes.   It started off alright and of course the food was excellent as always, The die made me try a flatbread pizza which for me was new as I usually prefer deep dish when we come here, I have had a mini deep dish in the past which was awesome!     

My ex who was with me had to try a cocktail called The Strawberry Smash which he said he liked.   

And he ordered the bbq Brisket sandwich again which was just as good as the first time he ordered it.    Great thing about Bj's seems to be the food is always consistantly good!

When we finished eating though, service became slow and they werent that busy, our waiter disappeared and we waited a full 15 minutes before we finally asked a random server if he could bring us to go boxes for the leftover pizza, some for me, some for him to take.   

We waited another 10 mins and never saw our server again, we asked if someone else could take the check for us so we could get going and the man told us that our server was in the back and he would make sure he was told we were ready to go.    Another 10 mins and we were still waiting so we asked a 3rd server if we could pay and he took the credit card and came back a few minutes later.

We never saw our server again, no goodbye, sayonara, adios, nothing!    No worries though, we are 20%++ tippers when we are happy and we just were not this time, next time we will ask for a different server."}
{"text":"I don't know what needs to be said specifically about BJ's. It's a classic American restaurant/brewery chain. The menu is solid all around, the service is outstanding, and the root beer is amazing.

If classic American cuisine is what you're craving and you're in the area, BJ's is not a bad choice by any means. Although the chicken fried steak was a bit chewy compared to my liking."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Love their locally-brewed root beer. Fun for the kids too."}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for us because it's consistent and near our house. They offer very filling food with good flavors & it's good to have a chilled glass of beer once in a while. We always order the BBQ chicken pizza & a small favorite starter are the corn fritters. 
It's a very busy location so be prepared to wait if you come during peak hours. There are tv's everywhere so ladies don't come for romance reasons :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the tortilla soup was , thick like pudding. I left a review with the restaurants auto feedback email, next morning the manager called. I explained to him the terrible experience and his only response.... i'm so sorry,(insert all the excuses) i hope you will come back  NOPE never again, not even with your stupid free pazookie on my birthday"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and the food was very good both times. Second time, there was a long wait so someone came around offering bites of pizza. It was good enough we were second-thinking what to have for dinner. Definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"The food is good and there are plenty of choices. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu items.  I will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Generous portions and a large menu selection.  Pazookies are delish!  Ribs are sticky yummy!"}
{"text":"My two small kids and I met my husband for lunch here on a Tuesday afternoon at 12:30 p.m. My husband was on his lunch hour. Our experience was disappointing from the moment we stepped in the door. I asked for a table for four with two high chairs. I asked to please make sure it's a four top and not a smaller table because the kids will be eating also. She pointed a table for four people and said, \"Sooo... that won't work, right?\" It took well over 25 minutes to order and get our food. This isn't lunch hour-friendly at all. The server who brought our food tried to give me every dish, rather than giving each plate to the correct person. He didn't even ask, he just kept putting plates in front of me. We ended up having about 10 minutes to eat before my husband had to leave. Our server seemed confused the entire time and we had to ask for refills on our drinks. I then had to flag down another server to ask for a box for my daughter's leftovers. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love the fried artichokes and Parmesan crusted chicken! It's all I order!"}
{"text":"Candace and Amber are the beat servers. Ryan was tops until he left for Oregon."}
{"text":"I wanted a steak and my fiance , who is a vegetarian wanted a salad or flatbread pizza. Our server, Rhonda came over and I could clearly see she was slammed, being in the business myself. She was very pleasant, friendly and sweet. We ordered and I decided on the rib eye. I asked for rare- medium rare, Brussels sprouts and their mashed potatoes. When I got my steak it was clearly med, medwell and she immediately said, let me fix this, I said no worries and thank you! I ate up all my Brussels sprouts and half my mashed while my fiance finished her pizza. Then the manager, Romel came by with my steak, waited till I cut into it, which it was perfectly done and even gave me more mashed!! It was delicious!! When we got the bill they even removed the steak charge AND, we had ordered dessert and removed that too. I did not expect anything to be removed at all!! The service was impeccable!! Thank you again Rhonda and Romel!! You both have great customer service and we will be back! Thank you again!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit and meal at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  Service was definitely excellent, and the food tasted great.  I tried one of their blonde beers, and was delighted with the taste.  I did notice my mouth was really dry about an hour after eating, so I kinda think they must use flavor enhancers like MSG.  MSG doesn't sit well with me - makes me tired and thirsty.  I also had a glass of tea which was very strong and nice to drink.  They offer various flavors of tea, but I just had mine \"plain\".  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends, only had their appetizers, and they were very good, we had a little of everything. The fried artichokes were the best. We were there during happy hour and they were hopping. Service was excellent, our waitress was very friendly. It was pretty loud, so you found yourself yelling a lot, but other than that we enjoyed our visit, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Went there for a team lunch.  The staff and service was amazing! The food was great as well!  We will definitely return or recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have heard good things but unfortunately, after waiting for an hour we left hungry.  I did call ahead seating and arrived 10 minutes later to let the hostess know we arrived.  She said it would be 15 minutes.  After a half hour, I was told 15 more minutes, 20 minutes later I was told another 15 minutes.  At this point we had a one year old and a four year old that needed dinner and left for Primanti's.  

The frustrating part is that it was not overly crowded and everyone else was getting seated.  I am convinced the hostess did not mark us down as having arrived until the second time I talked to her. 

It was nice that they brought around samples (which were amazing), but there are definitely some bugs to be worked out of the process."}
{"text":"I like going to BJ's one for the atmosphere and two for the beer. They brew their own beer and occasionally have specialty/seasonal beers. Also their burgers are delicious. Just wish they had more variety of dinners. Seems like they want to specialize in pizza."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service! Our waiter got all our orders correct and was quick to get our food out. The food was awesome and was well worth our night! The BBQ burger and white pizza are great choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good food. Service is good overall, but inconsistent at times. We've experienced this during when they are and aren't busy. It's seems to be a popular place, and I'm sure it has a lot to do with the food ;)"}
{"text":"Where I'm from, BJ's is a fallback dining choice, not the primary choice...which is why I'm so surprised at how crowded it always is here. The first time i showed up at this BJ's location, my husband and i were looking for a semi-quick dinner. Well, this wasn't for us because it was a 35 minute wait..and how happpyyy i was that we did not wait. We did eventually receive a text that our table was ready over an hour after we had placed our name on the list. So, the second time I came in was because I had to be in attendance at an office meeting...which was decided to take place at BJ's. My coworker and i called in that morning to make reservations. When we arrived at the restaurant, the crowd waiting was literally spilling out the front door (mind you, this was at 3 PM on a weekday) and they said they don't have a reservation for our table of ten people. According to the hostess, their system had been failing to keep scheduled reservations all day and we were the 4th party that had been victims of their crappy reservation system (or maybe crappy employee? who knows). So after about 20 minutes they seat us and we order. The food was terrible. All of it. I'll spare you the gorey details of how many plates were returned, then returned again, then finally made correctly. The waitress was awkward and honestly, the wait is so bad, and their wait times are so misinformed that I won't waste my time returning."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a large beer selection, including some they make themselves, this place will do. The food, on the other hand, is not so great. The menu is like that of many chain restaurants in that its huge and covers various types of cuisine. Everything sounds delicious but rarely seems to be. 

Deep dish pizza's - 5/10 - more like a standard pizza hut pizza and nothing like a real deep dish pizza
Wings - 6/10 - not bad, but would be much better with more sauce"}
{"text":"I visited a couple weeks ago with my family. We went on a Sunday around 5:30, the wait was about 20 minutes for a party of 7. After we got seated, around 6:16/6:30, the crowd REALLY started showing up!

The service was pretty good, I cannot remember our servers name, but she was pretty attentive with drinks and quickly taking our order. When my salad arrived, I did have to go to the hostess to get silverware for myself and my family. When we did receive our silverware, I'm assuming they were waiting on them to get out of the dryer/dishwasher because all of our napkins were damp. 

BUT the food was awesome. I had the California Chicken Club and LOVED it. A couple of my family members had the salmon quinoa bowl & really enjoyed it, and another couple had the bacon burger! The BEST food were hands down the French Fries. In mine and my husbands opinion...the best fries we've EVER had!

Can't wait to be back, just for the fries! 

Food was a 5 star, only giving a 4 star due to all 7 bundles of napkins being damp, just wasn't a great feeling!"}
{"text":"So, I walked in with my elderly mother who I'm helping carry her Oxgyen tank. The hostess greeted us I said my father is already here she said he is over there. Now mine you when you walk in from the bright sun light it's dark inside bjs I said to her I can't see where? She was to lazy to move out from behind the counter to take me to my father!!! Than a waitress walked by heard me and she was kind enough to walk us over like wow!!! So I sat down I didn't know my dad ordered his ice tea we where sitting at the table for at lease 4 minutes which isn't long. But a waitress came up to the table and ask if we had been help I said no we haven't with her smart comment said than why is there napkins on your table? I couldn't believe she was so nasty!!! I said I haven't ordered she walked away started talking and laughing at our table. Which was so rude!!! I asked to speak with a manager and never showed at our table!!!"}
{"text":"Sooooo....if I'm feeling saditty this is where I go for too loud music and a lot of sports on multiple tvs throughout! Clean and spacious and the food is yummy despite the occassional grumpy server. Its pricey but that is expected from a 'higher end' sports bar! I don't have any major complaints and I do have a compliment on the great desserts! I am a sweets whore and they fulfill me needs quite well! Great place for a group meet and eat!"}
{"text":"I like this place but when it comes to football, you should play what the customer wants... You just lost my business for today..... All because you can't change the channels for one hour...that's pretty much all the time that was left on the game we wanted to see so we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great service.  Food was excellent.  Kyle was our server with this beingoir first time there he helped me pick and entree and beer.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something different than the usual food court fare and we found it here. My first impression was that the place was clean and well kept. It had a nice atmosphere too. The wait staff was professional, friendly and quick to refill empty beverages and waters. The food was good, not out of this world but good. To put it another way I wouldn't tell someone they had to go out of their way to try it but if they're in the area and were looking for a decent place to eat I would definitely recommend it. My wife had the avocado bacon and cheese sandwich. She enjoyed it I tried a bite myself and thought it was good too. I ordered the black and blue burger. The flavor was good and the portions were exactly what you'd expect at a place like that. All in all a great experience and a great place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone down in quality over our visits in the past year. We visited this location a total of 4 times. If I rated this place after my first trip I would have easily given it 5 stars. On the first trip our service by Courtney was amazing, the beer selection was great (and still is), and the chicken dinner and pizza was really good. We enjoyed it so much we came back. Every trip we waited over an hour for a table for 3. The \"online check in\" never worked for us. It would say 45 minute wait and we'd arrive 45 mins later and still wait 45 more mins. This actually happened all 4 times. Our second trip my salad was forgotten. A person brought my daughter's salad and said mine would \"be right out\". Our dinners arrived and still no salad. Our pizza was served with very little toppings for the cost and we were disappointed. We decided it could have been a fluke so we returned for trip 3. This trip our server carried out the mug of root beer grasping it with her hand over the top of the mug instead of using the handle. When our pizza arrived it was served by another person and not our server. Our server came to our table and said she couldn't believe how lazy the staff was. She said the person who brought our food was supposed to serve us our first piece of pizza. I said I didn't care and it was ok but she continued to rant about her lazy co-workers. She said she would serve it to us (Which I insisted she didn't need to do). She proceeds to cut a piece with the utensil and actually lifted up the pizza with her bare hand and placed it on my plate. I was so grossed out by this that we asked for a box and took our remaining pizza home to eat..and obviously left the pizza she served with her bare hands behind. It took us 6 months to decide to give this place ONE more chance (stupid us, I know, but we kept hoping for a trip like our first visit). We returned as long as as we didn't get the same server that clearly had never attended a food handling training. Our final visit started by being seated at a dirty table. Then my husband got a salad with a giant hair (looked to be about 10 inches long) tangled all through it. He told the server and she lifted it up and said \"where, I don't see it?\" Then she goes \"oh wait, there it is! Wow that's really gross!\" .....umm yes it was. My chicken dinner was served on a plate with red crusty sauce stains and my chicken had white sauce in it so the crusty marks were due to using a dirty dish. At this point I was fed up and angry at myself for giving this place so many chances. The server didn't bring out my husband his \"hair free salad\" until our dinners were served, and the salad remained on our bill and a manager never came to talk to us. It was all very unfortunate because the place had a lot of potential with a prime location, excellent beer choices, and a gigantic menu. However, poor service and lack of cleanliness has caused this place to be on our never return list. The beer quality and quantity is the only reason I was willing to give this place a few stars. The only way I would recommend this place is to stop in and get a growler of beer to go."}

{"text":"Get 4 finicky female foodies together and you better find a place that has something for everyone.  BJ's usually provides a good fix.  Since we're usually starving by the time we meet up, appetizers are a big deal.  Because there's a BBQ thing going on, we tried the corn fritters with a special aioli (light textured fritters, with just enough corn...not so much that it makes it too dense and chewy).  The calamari was flash fried and tender, with a barely-there seasoned batter.  At first, the chicken lettuce wraps didn't look like it would be enough to share, but we all had at least two wraps each, doused with the hot mustard for some bite.  Good experience, so glad it's in our neighborhood.  Tip:  Send someone in to sign up for a table while you find parking; get a head start."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, sat for what seemed too long when they were not even that busy. Food was brought out, well just my wife's. She was courteous and waited for my food to arrive before eating. Ten minutes pass, waiter says nothing and doesn't even make an attempt to notify me my food was coming out. I've eaten here before and love the food, but the service is less than sub par. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"We went here to watch my college team and have some snacks. 

We asked to have the game put onto one of the screens and put in an order for some food. They came back saying the game was blacked out. I said no, it is on ESPN. 

They finally put it on over at the screen at the other side of the bar. We made a few trips back and forth with our drinks and food, and sat at our new table. We look up and they have switched it again back to the other side. 

We had to again move our drinks and food across the whole bar to our original table. 

They kept turning the game off, and we had to keep making them switch it back. 

During the game we ordered $34 worth of food, and it was all pretty tasteless.  Nothing I would order again. 

Finally with 2 minutes left, they switched from our game to a hockey game.   We gave up and left. 

I would not go back there for the food, and certainly not to watch a game.

Wanted to update this review. After posting, someone contacted me from the restaurant. They invited me to give them another try and said they would email a gift certificate within a few hours. It has been days and no certificate. 

I think this is a further reflection of a disorganized bad place. 

Keep your coupon!  There are lots of better places in town. Why waste your time and money here!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Friday night for drinks and appetizers.  Our server was great.  I ordered a glass of Chianti and choked on the first sip.  It had turned; restaurants need to do a better job of keeping track of when their red wine bottles are open. I ordered a porter instead and that was much better.  We had 2 apps and the srirachi honey glazed Brussels sprouts were awesome!  The ambience was good for a larger restaurant.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my 90 & 88 yr old parents and husband.  What a great experience.  They seated us immediately and per very patient on the pace of my parents.  David was our waiter and he was fabulous.  Very patient with us and kind to all of us.  Dad wanted sliders but in no way could he eat all 4, David suggested we order him the children's portion which was 2 sliders and perfect size. Dad even go the wedge fries which are his favorite kind. Mom had shrimp tacos and swears there were atleast 7 shrimp per taco.  Hubby and I shared tomato/basil flat bread pizza and it was great, plenty to take home.  We were planning on a cookie/ice cream dessert but we were all so full we couldn't eat any more.  We decided next time we are starting with dessert!!!!  David was a great waiter in all aspects, kind, courteous, helpful,, suggestive etc. Great Job, David!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! The food is great especially the avocado egg rolls!!!Of course the pizookies are awesome. Dont count on great customer service. The hostess are almost never nice but I guess it's so busy that they just don't care. Asked about there happy hour and the sever told me that she didn't know. She didnt even try to find out... Awesome.... They have two different type of fries and they almost always bring my bf the wrong one and he usually doesn't say anything but the last time it happened I politely said they were the wrong ones and the food runner jut picked up the plate without saying anything and walked away. Very awkward. So I usually just try to order to go now since it's usually not a pleasant experience. Maybe it's too busy and the staff is just overworked? Not sure and don't really car."}
{"text":"Nasty place to eat, bad service, hair in my food, forgot appetizers, use to eat here a lot, it is bad now. Sickening hygeine."}
{"text":"I am totally disappointed in this restaurant. I will never ever ever ever patronize this business again. Just be quiet OK I ordered curb side pick up a large deep dish pepperoni sausage mushroom pizza. That's exactly what I got no friggin sauce on it. Who makes a pizza without sauce they should stick to other things and leave the pizza making to an Italian place. But I'm also pissed because the girl that came out to bring my pizza told me since it was half off on Monday when you order any large pizza my bill was 12 and some change. She asked me if I would like hot peppers or Parmesan cheese I said no then you would have to go back inside then she says I have to go inside anyway to get your change so I said that's OK she says oh thank you very much and walks in thinking I may keep the change when I met I did not want any hot peppers or Parmesan. This was just a fail all the way around I will never patronize this business again never. The pizza tasted horrible now I'm eating a Stouffers frozen lasagna which tastes way better than that crap I wasted $20 and my time. Hell will freeze over before I go to this business again."}
{"text":"Walked in tonight after 8pm and hostess asked how many in our party, how many children's menus and if we were Premier Rewards members. I advised we were Rewards members and she took my phone number right away to start our points earnings without delay. I love that! Sometimes I forget to scan receipts later to earn points. ? We we're seated within a couple minutes and greeted by our server, Josh. We started off with our drink order and kids cheese pizza. Our drinks were brought by minus an ice water. Josh brought the second ice water, after I reminded him, right away.  We ordered the Ribeye 12oz (medium rare) with two sides (Caesar salad & loaded baked potato). The Ribeye was grilled to perfection! The center was a nice juicy red and I always eat mine with a side of Worcestershire. The baked potato was fresh and soft on the inside topped with butter, real bacon, cheddar cheese and sour cream with green onions on the side. The Caesar salad came out first and had the right amount of Parmesan and croutons to romaine lettuce ratio. The creamy dressing was mixed in the salad well. All in all a great meal!  #ilovesteak My daughter had the kids: mini deep dish cheese pizza which was light and fluffy and she ate almost all of it! #accomplishment  

After dinner we of course ordered their famous Pizookie's for dessert. If you don't know, now you know.  A pizookie is a nice warm cookie fresh out of the oven in its own personal round pan topped with glorious mounds of ice cream!  Need I say more? They have several flavors and my husband actually tried a new one. It was Monkey Bread (dough baked with butter, cinnamon and sugar) topped with vanilla ice cream. AMAZING! I had my usual chocolate chunk cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. If you go on your birthday you get a pizookie Free! The prices are great here and I would say in the medium range. For example his burger was $13 and my steak was $23. They have one of the biggest menus I've ever seen. I asked a server once and they told me three guys who used to be with Cheesecake Factory opened up BJ's Brewhouse and that's why the menus compare with lots of variety. Our service and food were both great tonight. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the wood flooring surrounding the hosts desk which leads to restrooms was so oily or greasy I almost fell. Also when I went inside the women's restroom there were paper towels all over the sink, floors by trash cans and inside the bathroom stall. There was also lots of toilet paper on the floor. The bathroom was in shambles!"}
{"text":"worst BJ'Sever.. i've been to bj's many times but this was the worst.. we ordered 2 beer and 1 single malt. waitress took the order and came back after 10 minutes and said they do not have one of the beer and asked to change the order (and she didn't bring the other2 drinks!). came back after 10 minutes with 2 beers but not the single malt saying they don't have that one! i changed the selection and it took another 10 minutes to come back with same answer  (they don't have that one either!!) i asked her to bring any single malt they have but to make it quick..she came with chevas regal (not a single malt!!! c'mon bar tender suppose to know it!!) i took it since it was almost 30 minutes wait for the first drink. we decided to order all the appetizers n food at once so we don't have to wait.. food came fast, but no silver wear and no napkins! ! we had to remind that we don't have anything on the table.. food was worst..highly disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant will always be a favorite of mine. Before my father passed away, we used to come in at least once per week and would be greeted by three or more staff members before we were even seated. Seldom did we have inadequate service and the food always tasted great. After he retired, the highlight of his day would be to go to lunch and chat it up with his favorite waiters and hosts while enjoying some soup and salad. Your staff was so friendly and courteous to him, and I thank you for that. 

 I recently went back with my brother to catch up and, despite many new staff members, it was still an incredibly friendly environment with great service and delicious food. This BJs has a customer for life."}
{"text":"We go to this BJs pretty frequently. Each member in my family can find something they like and the beer is good too (they even make their own root beer which is really good). I would agree with most posts that their wait staff is substandard; until today. We met Anthony (our server) and he exceeded our expectations. He was extremely attentive, polite and genuinely interested in making our dining experience enjoyable. If you go, request Anthony. Maybe the management will create a training program around his commitment to serving guests."}
{"text":"We have been to several BJ's restaurants (Summerlin-Washington State, California, etc.)  This was our first trip to this BJ's.  The parking lot was pretty full at 2:45 pm which surprised us.  Were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  We were meeting friends at 3 so no problem so far. We were actually seated after a 30 minute wait.  Once we were seated we were not approached or acknowledged in any way until we finally tracked someone down after 25 minutes!  We ordered as soon as our flustered waitress came over.
The manager came over and offered us complimentary chips & salsa, which we gladly accepted since we were starving and said he put a rush on our food order.  Don't know what difference it made, the entree salads my friend and I ordered came out after 30 minutes and our hubby's entrees 10 minutes after that.  Over an hour 1/2 spent at this location, not worth our time.  We received a ho hum apology from our server and didn't see the manager again.  Will stick with BJ's which has always provided exceptional service elsewhere, however we will avoid this Centennial Hills location as I suggest you do:-("}
{"text":"Ordered avocado egg rolls and a meat pizza. Something was off with the egg rolls. I couldn't place it, but they didn't taste like they usually do. I wouldn't order them again from this BJ's. They should be consistent, but something from this BJ's was off.  The pizza was decent. Had no sauce on it, which made it dry, more like a breadstick, but the flavor was ok. I ordered without bacon, and it was made correctly, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"I've had two negative experiences here all due to service. Food is decent but not good enough to make me want to come back. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"It's odd coming from CA, service at restaurants in Vegas is WAY SUPERIOR.  It's not suzy moron college student serving you, it's people that have spouses and families trying to make a decent living.

So yeah excellent service. Layout and seating great at this location. Lettuce wraps were off the hook!  And they now have a child sized pizzooki HELL YEAH!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at BJ's many times. Mostly I've been here for dinner and once for brunch. This was the first time I came here for lunch. I chose the seared ahi salad off of their lunch menu. The salad was listed as having only 540 calories which made it very attractive in regards to being diet compliant. The salad was quite large in size. It had a lot of what I would call \"foo foo\" lettuce. But it also had avocado, tomato, and other tasty add ins ( including a small dollop of wasabi on each side of the plate). In addition there was a fairly generous amount ahi tuna. Overall, a relatively healthy, fairly dietetic, enjoyable luncheon salad. Combine that with pleasant ambience and excellent service (kudos to Shenna). A good choice for a midweek lunch."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at this BJ's. There's great atmosphere, many tasty food and dessert options, as well as a wide drink selection, all for decent prices! 

This particular visit I had the Calimari and Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The Calimari was delicious, came both in the round and typical squid pieces, and was accompanied with marinara and a creamy, white dipping sauce. 

The tacos tasted just like a typical chicken pita and came with a side of quinoa mixed with rice. The waiter suggested cholula hot sauce which definitely kicked the tacos up a knotch.

Overall, very satisfied with the food and even more satisfied with the attentive and personable waiter."}
{"text":"We went to BJ's again tonight for the clam chowder. This is one the best clam chowder's in the whole city of Las Vegas, believe me it's that good. The staff is courteous and helpful and the manager even came over and said hello. They offer a military discount which is good for us veterans and military people.If you're in the Centennial Hills area they're looking for a good meal or a good beer stop in at BJ's."}
{"text":"AWESOME selection of beer!!!!.. Check it out....  In addition, I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and it was BOMB!!"}
{"text":"Miriam was great. My service was so great. My boys loved the food. Just the right amount of noise that i didnt feel guilty when the little one got riled up!! A go to spot. Thanks again Miriam!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to visit this location, my first ever to a BJ's, on a Wednesday afternoon.  We had a short wait for a table and when we were walked to the table by a friendly hostess, I was surprised to see a tray of dirty glasses sitting on the booth bench seat.  It was quickly cleared away, but was still tacky to start things off.

Our server was very mechanical and could have been a lot more attentive.  I sat with an empty glass for over 20 minutes after she stated she'd be \"right back\" with my refill.  We were her only table, so I know her attention wasn't focused on her guests at that point.

The food was definitely better than what I expected and I enjoyed my Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich a great deal.  The wedge-cut fries left a LOT to be desired, however.  They were barely warm and lacked any sort of seasoning whatsoever.  

I'd give the restaurant another chance, but not for a while."}
{"text":"We ate a late lunch around 2PM in the bar.  The bar was almost empty that time of day.  The restaurant dining area wasn't crowded either.  I ordered a salad with shrimp and quinoa.  My husband got a crispy chicken salad.  The service was slow.  When we finally got our food, they brought out my salad with salmon on it....not the shrimp which I ordered.  So then I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The salad was good.  I like the large menu.  Plenty of choices.  Even with as little people there, the place is noisy.  Kind of hit and miss there as I ate there awhile back and they got my order right."}
{"text":"Well, I have been to this location twice now and both times the food has been excellent! I'm a Chicago pizza snob and I really did enjoy the thin crust with pepperoni & sausage - simple & delicious!

My only rub on this place is the service. 

Our first visit was horrible!! The place was more than half empty yet we still had to wait for 15 minutes for them to \"clear a table\" and then we had one server take our drink orders, then another shows up ten minutes after we got our drinks and proceeds to welcome us again & asks if we wants any drinks. WTF? Then we had a third server take our food order! It just made us dizzy and each one seemed more confused then the last.

The second visit was better however, I overheard the table next to us complain because they didn't get the extra garlic bread they ordered until the meal was done. It cracked me up when a server finally brings the bread when they are paying the bill and says \"Do you still want this?\"

So, good food - spotty service....place was packed on Friday night though.

Oh, I forgot to mention - a glass of house wine - house wine - I did say house wine right? 10.25!! Yikes! house wine!???!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great beer. Must try the sampler if it's your first time. I love the Jeremiah red. The avocado egg rolls are another must have. Yum. The menu is quite extensive with a new lower calorie fare as well. I had the salmon with couscous. Desserts ...The pazooki is a must. It's a fresh baked cookie the size of a personal pizza with a scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"This was our first time visit, never heard of BJ'S before. Sunday visit around 1pm, the place was about half full.

The menu is HUGE!!!  We saw allot that looked appealing but my wife ordered the Crusted Chicken Parmesan and I ordered the special, Prime Rib. We both got the same sides- White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli. My meal came with a salad, I picked a Caesar Salad. The salad was decent, I've had a few better but it was good and I enjoyed it, it was just a salad.

Meals came quickly, hot and large portions, large enough for us to have leftovers! Both were VERY tasty.  The Chicken was tender and flavorful.  The Prime Rib was equally tender, well seasoned and excellent cut with little fat. 

Saving room for dessert, we got the Triple Chocolate Pizookie...fancy word for a large baked cookie, topped with chocolate ice cream.  It was also very good and we like the dessert. 

Prices were decent, nothing outrageous, so wet felt we got our monies worth.  The place was clean and in good shape.  Service was good, people were mostly friendly, with our server being pretty attentive. The Greeter could've been a little more friendly or positive when we walked thru the door. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and food and will be back to try something else on their large menu."}
{"text":"First off, the service was excellent.   The server kept my beer glass full and recommended some good choices.
I had the house steak, horseradish mashed potatoes, and asparagus.  Also a order of Crispy Calamari.
The steak was cooked correctly and was very tasty.  The mashed potatoes were very good.
The Calamari was kind of tasteless and stringy.  I won't order these again.
The asparagus was barely edible.  Dried out and tough to eat.  
So, some good things and some not so good."}
{"text":"I ordered BJ's for takeout, and was very impressed with the customer service from Julio and Jackson. I will definitey be returning in the future."}
{"text":"This place was great. Wait time was only about 20 minutes on a Friday night. Our waiter Steve was a friggin rock star. Always came by to check on us, offered his opinion on some of the foods we were curious about. Steve was amazing at his j.o.b. I highly recommended this place to friends that live near. 
The appetizers were great, we had the avocado spring rolls and the calamari.
The drinks were amazing; I had a strawberry blast and the little lady had a bahama mama.
The main course! We both had different styles of fish tacos but they were fantastic.
And then a little dessert, man that thing was tasty, a little on the small side but that's ok. It was great. 
We will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for catching the game or for a meetup. The pizookie is amazing just like everyone says. Nachos are bomb with some Jeremiah Red. Menu has a ton of options."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood restaurant /bar. Like an upscale version of Applebee's / Benigans.
Food is great my family's favorites are the jambalaya, fried chicken breast, barbecue ranch chopped salad. 
I haven't tried the pizza yet but they sure look yummy.
 My favorite soup is chicken tortilla soup. 
Crafted beer and soda are also wonderful."}
{"text":"This place has everything, and you will not be disappointed....that is, after you finally get to sit down!  Unfortunately for those of us who don't want to wait to be seated, this place has been discovered by many, and there is often a good crowd waiting outside on the weekends. The good news is, it is worth the wait.

I have been to this place several times, as it is close to my home. If you are the indecisive type, the good news is you can close your eyes and point to something on the menu and it WILL be good. Fresh salad greens and tomato/mozzarella salads are a welcome retreat from the romaine fare at other places. The fish and chips here is reminiscent of the traditional Wisconsin fish fry I sometimes miss. The burgers are great, the sandwiches never disappoint. A full bar with a great beer selection will leave you wondering at the end of the night how your bill ended up so high (oops).  Our last visit, we just sat at the bar and munched stuffed mushrooms with a pesto sauce - a steal at $4.50 off the \"small bites\" menu - and thai style wontons dipped in sesame. Supposedly the deep dish pizza is good, but I have yet to try it, since it looks like a meal that would feed four people minimally.

One observation I've made is that this place, being next to Fleming's (a more pricey restaurant), leaves people confused in terms of attire. You'll see people their Friday-night-out attire, but there will also be a family coming straight from a baseball game, the kids still dusty in their little league uniforms. To me, BJ's has a dim, refined, date-night atmosphere that invites couples but is a great meet-up for business associates. Now, I'm a mom, but if you're going to bring the kids, please have them in decent clothes and on their best behavior.

This isn't where you would choose to go for a \"food adventure,\" but it is the place you would take friends with diverse tastes in food and booze, or maybe the in-laws from out of town."}
{"text":"Every time I've tried to eat here, there has been an extremely long wait. I finally came here with a few of my girlfriends and we were lucky to score a table at the bar when the wait for a table in the dining room was over an hour long. 

The space is pretty nice. They have so many options (both food and drinks) to choose from so it can be a little overwhelming if you've never been here before. And that's exactly how I felt. At the end of the day, I ordered a flight of beer to sample their beer selection and our table shared a large deep dish pizza. I really liked everything I tried! The beers were good and went really well with the pizza. The crust on the pizza was crispy and buttery, which was perfect to me. 

There is a long wait here for a reason. The atmosphere is fun, the food and drinks are good, and the menu is huge so there is something for everyone to like!"}
{"text":"The one in Columbus is awesome! So we were excited that they were opening one here! Quality was great at first, but has gone downhill.  Food isn't quite as tasty and much to my disappointment, they changed their fries.  They used to be thin and crispy and were a must have every time I ate there. Now they are thicker and mushy.  They are fine but nothing amazing about them.  They also changed their point system, causing us to lose 300+ points.  They never followed up after we complained."}
{"text":"I don't come here often, but when I do, my friends or family and I enjoy sitting in the bar area. Justin, our server, was absolutely phenomenal. He was super friendly, knowledgeable, and on top of everything. Aside from excellent service, the food was delicious. Can't ever go wrong with the deep dish pizza. Next time I'm in, I hope we have Justin as our server again because I know we won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here on three different occasions. I usually enjoy in-house, micro-brew so that was the draw for me. However, I'd rate their beer better then an average tap bar but for a micro-brewery, it has pretty low points. In fact I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for the beer again. 

This place is kinda a bar/restaurant, trying to appeal to beer drinkers and family diners at the same time.It's a large, high ceiling dining area that does not distinguish restaurant from bar.  The result is a large, noisy, brightly lit cavern that I found too busy and over-stimulating. 

While there, my friend and I ordered drinks but we were coerced into a meal, mostly because the staff was constantly on us to order some food. On our last visit, the waiter asked us every 5 minutes if we wanted something to eat, no joke. When we finally ordered, he let up just until we finished our food. Then it was a constant interruption from him asking if we want anything else, sort of making us feel like we should not take up a table any longer if we're done eating. This was not one time, this is every time I've been there. Even sitting at the bar we got continually pestered into getting something more. The staff seems to be very high strung, sort of  like they drank 5 cups of coffee. 

As for the food, I found it highly forgettable, in fact, I don't even remember what I ate. It's just as all well because I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Service is prompt and precise! We've been to this location twice and have been over satisfied if that is possible. Price is very reasonable and the food was excellent. We will definitely return again. Highly recommended for lunch!"}
{"text":"This has always been a 5 star restaurant for us but last night when we brought friends to BJ'S the service was awful. We waited excessively long for everything!  The worst part of the experience  occured when the waitress pouring beer from our pitcher overflowed the glass then raised the glass over the pitcher and let the overflow run off her hand back into our pitcher contaminating our beer! We had to insist on having the pitcher replaced and the manager did come over to talk to us.  He gave us a new waiter and things improved but were still slow.  For example,  we asked for condiments and another drink, and had to ask again 10 minutes later. Food was lukewarm by the time we received condiments.   We were not offered any compensation for our troubles either.  Sadly, this won't be a regular stop for us anymore!"}
{"text":"Food here is great. The service is always exceptional! I've dined here twice with my family and each time was impressed with the service. I will definitely be back. Thank you and keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Came here after a horrible experience at a different restaurant in Chandler Fashion. We were immediately greeted at the bar by the assistant manager who listened to our troubled story and gave us a strong stiff drink. Beautiful place atmosphere is low-key definitely somewhere appropriate for a first date as you can continue to engage in conversation with minimal interruption, though be wary of the bar lurkers listening to your conversation... clam chowder looked off the chain! I only drink the blonde and it was quite tasty 2 and I was done"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing cherry chipotle glazed salmon! Flavor & texture are perfect everytime! This is one of the few places that never overcooks salmon... perfect. every time. Fantastic service from our waitress, Brianna!"}
{"text":"I previously had 4 stars for this, but my opinion has changed.  The past 3 times we were here we waited over an hour for our food.  Our stupid fault for going back, but I like the Oasis, which they are also consistently out of...so I don't know why we return.  Last night we sat at our table for 15 minutes before we got up and left.  Went to Longhorn, got a delicious burger, 2 cocktails all in 30 minutes and made our movie on time!"}
{"text":"I love BJ's, the service is always good.  Great food and drinks."}
{"text":"We come here atleast once a week. Rachel at the bar is the best! She's quite the busy bee too. We love her.  We walk-in she already knows what we want. She has our drinks right as we sit. We came yesterday and Rachel was off another employee Justin took care of us. He was really worried about meeting our expectations which he successfully did. He knew we were regulars of Rachel and wanted to take good care of us. We order a somewhat confusing dish but Rachel and now Justin  always seem to get it right. There's another bartender that has taken care of us and i can't remember her name but she is just as good. Her smile is contagious. Thanks guys for always treating us like were VIP!"}
{"text":"Let's just say that the employees need to go through a re-training.  We get our food, and most of us are out of the water that we initially received.  We ask the server (not the waitress) for water, but it never comes.  Now we are completely out.  We grab another waitress - not ours because why would ours come back - and ask her for water.  10 minutes later she comes back - with one glass - for a party of 4!!!  We finally get our waitress to bring water.  She finally does - but no lemons this time.  I guess we are being punished.  Seriously, if employees have time to stand around talking, then they have time to grab pitchers of water and refill glasses.  

I know there is no money in water, but it's all about customer service.  We were all obviously done with eating, and had been for a while, and I catch our waitresses eye.  She says \"oh, do you need something\".  Yeah, like how about your take our plates, offer us dessert and our checks??!"}
{"text":"We discovered BJ's about a year ago and have been many times. My wife and kids love it here. Very family friendly or the perfect place to go on a date for happy hour! The staff is always friendly and the service is fast and the best part is the food is amazing! Will be back many times more in the future."}
{"text":"Placed an online to go order. Ordered a half sandwich and a house salad and a grilled BBQ pasta with a house salad. The total was $24. Yes, $24 for two lunch specials. Specials are typically discounted hence the \"special\" label. They obviously don't get that part or that's why they don't advertise the prices online. Went to pick up my order and found all of the to go order parking spots taken with no one in their cars and no one inside waiting for their orders.  The food was good but not great.  I suggest skipping their online ordering set up all together. It's not worth it"}
{"text":"First time being at this location in a few years, and must say I picked the perfect evening to come in. Our server Crystal was super friendly and helpful. The food was excellent, particularly the Parmesan-Crust Chicken, and their own brewed beers were especially tasty. Definitely plan to return in the near future."}
{"text":"My 1st order was placed through Grub Hub, which I don't recommend, they have unprofessional skirt wearing men that deliver and my order was not accurate. It do not reflect on BJ's but rather grubhub. I will go direct to the BJ's website and order delivery from now on.
I talked with Andy on the evening of 9-21-17 and he offered the most amazing customer service and solution. I am so pleased, the food is excellent and this is now my favorite delivery restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited BJ's today and enjoyed their Happy Hour and dinner menu. Food was great and our server Arin was wonderful. She took great care of us and if we lived in town we would go back just to have her as my server along with the great food."}
{"text":"Every time I have ever visited a BJ's the experience has been a wonderful one.  Their beer is awesome, the food is well prepared, and the service is always friendly and prompt.  When I want to just step out of the world for a few, have a few beers, and enjoy a good meal .... I come here ....."}
{"text":"Several of my friends have raved about BJ's and it has been on my list to try for an extended amount of time. Finally, I had the opportunity and I would say for the food and experience I had, it was literally \"A-OK\". Why? 

My friends were waiting for me when I arrived. The waiter was quick to notice my arrival and instantly came over to ask for my drink order. He proceeded to ask if we were ready to order and of course, I needed some time to decide what my dinner was going to be. Well, it took him another 20-25 minutes to return and ask a second time. This was the case all night. The waiter was very nice but the service was slow and the place wasn't as busy (especially with a Pens game on) as my friends are used to (who are regulars). 

Despite being advised to try the Chicken Tortilla Soup from a friend, I took the advice of the waiter and tried the Broccoli Cheddar Soup, pairing it with a Caesar Salad for the soup/salad combo. I can say that this soup is not something I will order again. The color alone was off-putting and it was lacking broccoli and excessive with cheese. The salad was heavily dressed but for a Caesar, I am satisfied with that. My friend offered me a slice of the pepperoni supreme and I took him up on it - thick, bubbly, and tasty! I would definitely try pizza again (especially with their Monday night deal).

This place contains adequate seating with booths, tables, and a nice sized bar. TVs are located on every wall, making it easy to check the score of the game at any point. I thought that the atmosphere was quite loud, especially if it wasn't as full as it typically is. There is adequate parking in front of the restaurant and more can be found in the shopping center if need be. 

I truly believe I can have a better experience when I return to BJ's. There are so many options on the menu, including beer that they brew themselves, and I am willing to try other items they offer. I believe this place has the capability to redeem itself in the future."}
{"text":"Second review I've ever posted on yelp... this place was terrible. We had a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night with 4 adults and a couple kids. When we were finally seated, it took about 10 minutes to get waters, them another 20 to get chips and guacamole. The oil the chips were fried in was rancid, and the chips were extremely salty. We weren't given any plates for appetizers, so we all had to balance the salsa and guacamole on the chip a full arm's length every time we are one. Our food was brought out after another 20 minutes, but half the food was missing.  Another 15 minutes went by (we're now over an hour of sitting at the table) before the server told us he didn't know what was taking so long and the manager was going to come by... the manager just asked if everything was alright. Obviously if she had to come talk to us, everything was not alright. We were at a business dinner, so we tried to be nice about, and because we didn't make a big fuss, nothing was done beyond that... another 10 minutes went by after the manager left before the remainder of the food was finally brought out. By this time, the first food was getting cold, and our waters had only been refilled once during this time. The guacamole burger was also extremely salty, but the fries were good... Too bad we had to ask for ketchup three times before it was finally brought out. The waiter only stopped by our table twice on his own, the rest of the time we had to flag him down. We got the pizookie sampler for the table, and once again no plates were brought out to use until we had to wait another 5 minutes to flag down the waiter for plates (by this time the ice cream was of course melted). So after almost 3 hours total, we finally survived dinner. If you're looking for over-priced, mediocre food and terrible service in an overcrowded restaurant, this is the place for you! Needless to say we will never be back."}

{"text":"So, I want to like this place, the food wasn't bad, the beer wasn't bad, but nothing I ordered came out correctly. Nothing! I got salad without bacon, came out with bacon. Veggie burger on lettuce, came out a turkey burger on a bun. Not only that, but 5 of the 8 orders at our table were incorrect in one way or another. Then the manager comes over and jokes about the fact that me and one other person don't have any food because they made it wrong. Everyone was done eating by the time we got our food, and bedside joking about it he didn't formally apologize, take money off of the bill, or check to make sure that the food that came out was correct. Really really bad management and possible service?? Or the cooks don't follow directions??? Who knows..."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that BJs is absolutely fantastic. 
The roast beef au jous dip is orgasmic. It is literally an explosion of endorphins in your mouth. The meat is tender, med rare, and the au jous is overflowing with herbs and spices. Ladies, bring a towel with you, because the chair WILL be wet. I hope your men aren't jealous, because believe me, THIS meat will be the best meat you have ever put in your mouth. Each bite of this mouth-pleaser will go straight to your pants area. 
Seriously. Roast beef dip. Do it"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Love the food and desserts! I have had great and fast service every time I've been here, from group events to family dinners. It can be a little bit pricey though. But still a great place to go."}
{"text":"We've seen this place back home in Houston, Tx but had never been. Our daughter took us while in town and I absolutely loved the home brew. Had the Maui pork chop and it was very tasty but the red potatoes that it came with so very dry, but the fresh green beans definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"...I remember going to BJ's a few years back (Summerlin location) and that I ordered a baked potato, not sure which one, but I remember enjoying it...

This time around I went because I was craving fish and chips, we saw BJs and decided to give them a try.

Service:
We were seated in a timely matter, but after reading over the menu a few times and finally deciding, we still hadn't seen a person to take our drink orders.  Finally a young lady takes our drink and food orders and tell us she will find our server for us. What?? She wasn't our server?? Where the heck is our chick at?  Anyways, after a little bit more time our server comes out and asks, shyly, if we would like malt vinegar with our fish and chips....I say yes, and she goes.  With the way she spoke, I figured she was new and decided not to get worked up about it. She was a sweet girl and so was the other lady who helped us. I'm taking a star off for her not being around much after, and watching other people at her tables have to get up and grab silverware off of other tables and what not...

Food:
I ordered a strawberry lemonade...and I think something went wrong...it didn't taste like anything...usually strawberry lemonades....have flavor. I think I may have made a mistake by asking if their lemonades are \"home made.\"   (..i hate being picky about lemonade....)

Fish and chips: Good. Not great. But I ate them. My fries were cold, but I still ate them... and even if I wanted to complain, my server wasn't around.

My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he enjoyed it. I took a tiny bite and it tasted good.

Not old enough to drink so I can't review on the beers. Sorry kiddos.

I probably wouldn't go here again. It has a huge selection of good food, and could please a lot of people. Its not terrible, but not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"So stooped for something to eat and a cold beer. I ordered a Coors Light it tasted so good I ordered another and was told my first one was the last one they had, huh?!?  I'll update after I eat::  food was great had flatbread and wings the root beer glaze was fantastic"}
{"text":"Love it! The fries are awesome, I've been 4 or 5 times and when ever I'm passing through Vegas I try to go, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service I go out of my way to find this restaurant. Every dish I've tried has been tasty"}
{"text":"Comfortable and stress-free bar to sit at for a quick bite and watch sports. Attentive service staff. Love the ambiance, low key and conversational."}
{"text":"beer selection is good but the menu seems to be all over the place.  Their waitstaff tries very hard.  Bartender at the Peoria location is outstanding. Some of the small bites on the menu are good but the pizza is \"over-Americanized\", too fluffy, grease, too many toppings, a mouthful of yeast."}
{"text":"Really good brewhouse and quality food.

It is a wide spread chain but they have it down well. They have above average beers (Tatonka Stout) and their seasonal are usually awesome (especial the Belgian based ones).

All the food seems to be really good, sides, pizzas, deserts (pazookie)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, extremely broad menu selection, fast service, limited parking, very reasonable prices. Accepts call ahead reservations."}
{"text":"BJ's is a regular haunt for my husband and I.  They have great selections of beer.  My favorite is the PM Porter.  The food is consistently good and they have an extensive menu.  My favorite is the shrimp tacos and my husband loves the french dip, their pizzas are also very good.  We always sit in the bar section, that eliminates the children, which can be noisy if you end up getting a table next to them.  The atmosphere is great, and the bar area has TV's with current sporting events playing.

The only downside is that the service isn't always great.  Also, I've witness the staff using the parking spots in the front for themselves.  This says to me the restaurant is poorly managed.  Fix that and you'd probably have a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Their wine here is sooo good! Pizookies, deep dish pizza, salmon with potatoes and asparagus is to die for. Always love coming here staff and service is great as well. Place gets really busy on weekends though"}
{"text":"This place has the best salad by far. I am so not a salad person :) but the Santa fe salad is to die for. I love coming here with the family or on a date night. It is very hard to find places where the kiddos can eat and enjoy being themselves ....you know just kids and this place is on my top for both. Oh and the service is outstanding. On a date night my husband and I had some drinks and where chatting along when we didn't realize that the food was taking a little longer than usual (mind you the place was pact) well the manager came over and apologized for the inconvenience and gave us a huge discount! !!! Way to feel welcome :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! I organized a Bachelorette Party and called a ton of places trying to find somewhere we could go without having to rent a party room, require a minimum purchase per attendee, allow separate checks, etc. BJs was the perfect fit. We had a party of 20 and they were smart to assign two waiters to us. This was a huge help! They even allowed us to decorate the table and bring in a cake. The waiters could not have been more polite or provided better service. It was a very busy night for them, but you couldn't tell. The entire staff was so courteous that it was a wonderful experience for everyone there. Other attendees even mentioned how great the restaurant was throughout the night. 

I HIGHLY recommend this place for small or large functions. They don't make you feel like you're a burden having so many people. The even did separate checks for each girl there and they didn't add gratuity. This was very smart because me and some of the other bridesmaids tipped over 50% because we were so happy with our experience."}
{"text":"I was out and about in the McCandless area and truthfully just stumbled upon this place not knowing much about it! And I was definitely pleasantly surprised! 

I started with a their own blend brew of BJ's red ale and angry orchard which I really enjoyed! When deciding what to order in a HUGE menu with options under every category, I was craving a salad. I considered myself somewhat of a BBQ chicken salad officienato so I decided to give theirs a try and it was one of the best I've ever had! Definitely recommend. My friend had the brisket bacon burger and said it was delicious. We finished by indulging in their specialty dessert known as the pizookie. Basically, a cookie of whatever flavor with ice cream on top! YUM! We kept it classic with a chocolate chip cookie. 

Our service was mediocre and it took a really long time to get our dessert which was a bummer. But the atmosphere is nice, it's big inside, and has tons of TVs so it's a great place to hang out 

*I'm updating my review because my service on my last visit was exceptional. We ordered wings as an appetizer and our meals came out first. Our waitress, the food runner, and the manager apologized and the wings were comped from our bill. Everyone makes mistakes, I just look for them to be acknowledged and made right and they went above and beyond to do that!*"}
{"text":"This place was OK. My boyfriend raved about it because he is a beer lovin' maniac but I did not have the same strong feelings about it. We went here for dinner one night but I'd say you'd be better off going here to watch some sports and have a good beer. I don't think I'd come back here if I had a choice in the matter."}
{"text":"Wide food and drink selection.  friendly staff.  Relaxing place to unwind with a nice happy hour and rewards program."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but that's not the big takeaway.  This is NOT a good place for kids, and by kids I mean anyone who needs a highchair.  They do not have functioning highchairs at this restaurants. They have about a half dozen broken chairs, which of course serve no purpose.  This has been for about a year now.

The food though is quite good.  Tuscan Chicken Limone is solid, and should be ordered if it appeals to you.  Also, don't leave without dessert.  The pizzas though are overrated.  

Enjoy, but leave the kiddos at home."}
{"text":"We love this place, I am surprised there aren't more of them in the Phoenix area. Best fried chicken meal I've ever eaten at a restaurant. Cool atmosphere. One of my goto dinner spots. The wait can get a little heavy on weekends, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We haven't been in a while. I had the fish and chips. Mostly for the fish and not the French fries. The fish was so crunchy and the tarter sauce has some spice to it now which is a yummy surprise. I would definitely recommend the fish for sure!"}
{"text":"It was the bf's birthday celebration... My friend William suggested that we go here. The homemade root beer is DELICIOUS! They have potato skins and really good ranch... But their bacon is not very good...
The place was packed... Usually a good sign... The menu is HUGE... The food that is presented is beautiful to the eyes and the stomach... 
I ordered the calzone... It had artichokes and mushrooms and cheese... They need to use just the heart I kept running into the \"leaves\" of the artichoke and they were pithy.. but it was soo good I ate around them... The marinara sauce that goes with the calzone is mmmmm good!  
The bf ordered the jambalaya... We were told by at least 3 different servers and a manager that it was \"spicy\" and that made the bf happy!  It had chicken...shrimp...and andouille sausage... He loved it! I thought it was too spicy! 
PORTIONS ARE HUGE! Definitely share meals..."}
{"text":"I love the Nutty Brewnette, it's a great beer. The food is pretty decent, but not always amazing. I have good food and I've had OK food. If you're in the area it's worth a try."}
{"text":"BJ's Tavern Brewhouse is a good all around chain restaurant style pub offering both in-house brewed and local craft beers. The stores are always clean, the service is always good, and the food is always tasty. They offer specials each night of the week, and despite the large menu, the food always provides a quality dining experience."}
{"text":"I like this place , the pasta's are good and the cheeseburgers are the bomb  and dessert  are the bomb . Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Met friends last night. Seasonal peach beer was good. The california flatbread was excellent. Only complaint, watched bartender open the plastic lid to the juice with her teeth and she touched my friend's ice with her finger."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Don't even waste your time!  I have NEVER been treated so poorly!  This restaurant needs to close and send the management to training to Learn the basics of customer service!  It really is that bad!"}
{"text":"August gave us a great experience here. Really superb  person, asked us a lot of questions and after a few samples we made some great beer choices. Very friendly and great BJ's staff.  The food is wonderful here and really a slick efficient place. We highly recommend , Tracy is serving us tonight, I think we're going on 14 years of her serving us, first class bartender!"}
{"text":"Usually I have nothing but good things to say about Bj's, however, tonight's experience was anything but that. The first thing I would like to point out is that on the website where you can add \"Special Instructions\" is pointless because clearly the cooks or chefs do not follow it! I specifically typed \"No Cheese on the pasta and salad\" but the salad definitely had cheese on it. Then the next thing that is absurd is the the fact that the \"Special Instructions\" has a limit of 25 characters including spaces so it's difficult to express what you'd like to change or mention about the selected dish. Next, on the website that is ridiculous is when you have to select the time in which you will be picking up the order. Well, our order was suppose to be ready 8:30, so if that's the selected time then it should be ready by then. Now, I know some restaurants get behind on orders, but we had to wait an additional what felt like 20 minutes. On top off the inconvenient website (where none of the employees pay attention to the time of pick-up and special instructions), and long wait time, they got got the order wrong! We ordered no cheese on the Caesar Salad, and chocolate ice cream with our Pizookies and got vanilla ice cream instead. Oh, and I wanted chocolate chips and didn't get it at all! But I guess it's my fault for putting it in \"Special Instructions\". For the amount of money I spent I would hope to get what I paid for! #UnsatisfiedCustomer #Ishouldgetmymoneyback #Whyorderonlineifyoustillhavetowait #ChocolateLovergonMAD #NOcharacterLIMITS"}
{"text":"The service is the reason why I almost never dine in and grab curbside. I can avoid the tip that they don't deserve so that's what I usually do. Food is always better fresh so I decided to stop in today. There was a party by us - that had already finished eating by the way, but they also had a different server. My boyfriend and I took about 10-15 minutes deciding what to eat and we had at least 5 servers walk by (including the one who ended up being ours.) Our host came by and asked if we had been helped, and we said no. Our server finally came by and wanted to take just drink orders after 20 minutes? I said no, we're ready to order.. hello lady my menu is hanging off the side of the table. Anyways, I got my salad before my drinks! The manager dropped my salad off and didn't say a word. Not thirsty or anything! Then our food came but was run by someone else (signs this server SUCKED if she can't run any of her food), and no ranch. Can't have fries without ranch, and our server didn't come by for at least 10 more minutes to check on us when she didn't even run our food. I like this place, but not this location. I work in the industry and I just wish I could do the job for these people, it's pathetic. I wish the Centennial location wasn't so far - seems like people actually care about service, timing, and their tips!"}
{"text":"Food and beer were good but the atmosphere sucked. I was there watching the NFC Championship game and we were cheering (not obnoxiously mind you) during the game and kept being asked to keep it down. Are you kidding me? Needless to say they were a bit full of themselves there. I won't be going back to that hoidy toidy place again. Went across the walkway to Buffalo Wild Wings and had a much better time there."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I have been here.  This time I tried some new Garlic Chicken, Bacon Ranch pizza.  The pizza was fabulous.  You can get it deep dish or hand tossed.  Everything about the pizza was good, no complaints on the food whatsoever.  I did think the server was a bit slow.  We had an older lady and she took a long time to come around to get our orders.  Also, the prices can be a bit high for some but it's for good quality foods.  This place also has some of the best desserts too, but again you have to pay a pretty penny for any of the desserts.  I wish I could do 1/2 stars because I would probably go 3.5 on this one just because the prices and service weren't good enough, but the food is great and that's reason enough for me to stick with 4 stars here."}
{"text":"Our one night out with the kids and we get seated near the Point of Sale system. For 45 minutes, I hear the same 4 employees bickering and complaining about tables, their manager, bickering between each other who has what table and the customers at each table. I wanted to enjoy my meal and ignore the talk but it was difficult. If you don't like your job, get another job. Very simple. We're your clients. Act like it. Thanks waiters/waitresses for ruining our experience. Our waiter was friendly and nice so this review is not about him.

Our poor friend at the table had to send his burger back because it was burnt to a crisp and sent out to him. There is no quality control with the food? Gave him my fries while he waited, and waited, and waited for another burger. 

What kind of place is this? Not sure if I'd be back."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection. They carry some of the best Belgians like Chimay and delirium. They have their own beers (they are a national brew House chain) which are decently priced even if not happy hour and taste good. There is an extensive selection of food and it is pretty good. Is the food amazing, no but it is a 5 star experience between the beer selection, food selection, open super late, and good service. I usually just get pizza and beer."}
{"text":"My complaint with BJ's Brewhouse has little to do with this local restaurant in Mesa; it has everything to do with the Rewards Program and the corporate offices and policies.  In short I lost the equivalent to $150 of Reward Points that I had acquired.  We frequented BJ's quite often and had decided to save up the Rewards Points for a special occasion that happen to be my wife's birthday.  While the waitress wrote down my Rewards number I noted that I had zero points where at the last visit I had something over 350 points. I immediately went to talk to the front desk folks. I was informed that the points expire without much of any explanation as to when or why. I wasn't aware of that nor was it ever mentioned on our visits.  I basically told the front desk folks I was really ticked off at this situation and didn't receive an apology or an acknowledgement of my dissatisfaction; and I walked away. I'm a frequent enough patron at that restaurant that the wait staff remembers what our drink order is most visits.  
I've talked to the manager on more than one occasion personally.  I did expect to have the front desk staff inform the manager; and I more or less expected the manager to at least come and talk to us, but nothing of that nature happened. When we left the restaurant; obviously the front desk recognized me as the complainant and wisely said nothing to me, not even a thank you, or have a good evening.
At home I emailed the corporate office my complaint and haven't ever received a reply.  I can only assume no one cares about this; not the local restaurant nor the corporate offices.
As I mentioned, we frequented the local BJ's quite often. I have no intention of patronizing this restaurant in the future due to this situation and the lack of response. Be aware that your BJ's points expire at some point during the year; a fact I wasn't aware of nor ever warned against."}
{"text":"Buy one get one?!? Good enough deal to get me to go eat at a sit down chain. 

The visit was pretty much as expected. The staff was awesome and nice. Our server was really busy but did an excellent job.  

The food is what it is. Most everything taste like it was frozen and all the soups have the same consistency like they came from the same base and then had different ingredients added.

It's a little pricey for what it is but I would go back just for the buy one entree and get one free that yelp kicked down."}
{"text":"I felt like I was being punk'd. My friend wanted to take me to her favorite restaurant. Now I think it will be a long time before either of us returns. Granted it was busy Sat. night. They  brought her drink 5 mins before mine. The runners brought her salad but totally the wrong the for me and I had to wait for them to bring out my salad and fries. Fries were borderline warm and hard and I had to wait for the mayo I asked for, By the time I got that they were a loss.  The waitress had a good excuse for not bringing the mayo tho as she was so busy fixing our salad orders. 

I ordered a santa-fe salad with dressing on the side as I have food allergies. The salad came an unlisted seasoning powder all over the salad. I had to send it back. It was also missing the avocado and had very little cheese.  I was already a little peeved as I could not eat any of meat add ons and they insisted on charging full price. I had them bring the meat separate so that my friend could add it to her salad and it's a good thing they did.

Her salad was missing the chicken that was to be on it. She ordered the asian chopped salad that was not chopped. Along with missing chicken, it also was missing almonds, mandarin oranges and dressing!

Close to 2 hrs and a talk with the manager resulted in new salads, (mine still had very little cheese or avocado) and new fries which were not much better hot as they were greasy and had a funny coating on them. 

As a side note: I disliked the ambiance. It was loud loud loud and so crowded that the twice I had people knock into be trying to pass."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a beer after work. The service was fast, the atmosphere just right! I'll be back later for more beer!"}
{"text":"Had the crispy jalapenos Burger and wedge fries with a few Oasis beers. Devoured and ravaged this burger. Love this place and its pizookie!!!! Service was good just took awhile to get our drink orders."}
{"text":"Had a great experience on a Sunday night with Lo at the bar, had dinner, soba noodles chicken and the man had a ahi salad. Great service only thing super distracting was the crazy loud beeping coming from the hostess area. I asked about it bc I thought I might be going crazy, turns out it's the firearm system. Might want to get that checked out. :/ super distracting and loud. We love coming here but it's annoying."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I called ahead to make reservations and the host was very informative and friendly. The waitress was wonderful and attentive. A little expensive but yummy overall."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere here is wonder, I love their spinach dip and their calizones. I would definitely recommend eating here you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Like every other brew house chain. Been to Gorden Bierch, Hops or the Yard House? Then you've been here. Constant food quality, $1 off happy hour drinks 3-7pm Monday to Friday and late night happy hour 10:30 pm to close. Nicely executed chain food."}
{"text":"I had called to make a reservation and the girl took my information, she said a manager would call me back to confirm.  One day later and no phone call- I call back only to be told they are fully booked on the day I wanted.  It would have been nice if they told me when I called that they were booked instead of getting my hopes up.

I was really looking forward to trying this place out but I will be taking my wedding party elsewhere- and most likely never going there.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, service was impeccable and the atmosphere is great. Our server James, I believe his name was, gave us amazing service as well as one of the best burgers I have ever had. I had the Brisket Bacon Burger. Will certainly be returning here in the future!"}
{"text":"I love BJ's it is an amazing place to have good food at a decent price. This restaurant has so many options so all it does is make you want to come back to try new things because you can't ever go wrong. Very big servings easily shareable. I haven't tried their desserts but they look so awesome i don't know how long i will last before trying one...or many!!!"}
{"text":"I have two words for you: pi-zookie

In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .


All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key. 

In closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO"}
{"text":"Went here after an Elite event via the recommendation of Ken M. 

Wow Beers and Booze took up most of the menu.

Great happy hour prices, half of on mini sized pizzas both in the deep dish and flat bread types.

Quite impressed with their buffalo pizza, had large chunks of chicken, enough heat to be satisfying but not too much to leave your mouth blazing. 

The Mediterranean pizza was equally as satisfying. 

Wide selection of beers. Lots of beers. Beers everywhere. Enough of a selection to shame myself as i have almost no knowledge of these other brews and stick to main stream replicas. For shame i know..."}
{"text":"So yummy, I had the California chicken sandwich and it was delicious. And my husband had the country fried chicken, and it was pretty good too. So juicy! And the crafted cream soda was really tasty, I just wish the drinks were colder"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Food is mediocre despite nice ambience and service

Food lacks flavor. It's as simple as that. There is nothing about the food that makes you want to come back...even for bar food. All of the dishes lack flavor. They look pretty on the plate but the flavors are not there. The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to \"toss the wings in sauce\" to  get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don't ask that, they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces, sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor. The beer was mediocre. The menu is entirely too large.

This place is a hit because of it's location and it's  atmosphere. It's an upscale sports bar resembling the Yard House  so a lot of people like to come here to have comfortable seating, nice service and nice tv's. But the food was very disappointing and if you care about what you eat, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Jambalaya is overpriced for what you receive. Flavor is bland as well. I did not have any beer so I cannot rate that aspect. The menu is expensive for average sports bar fare."}
{"text":"The only thing on their menu that is outstanding are the Avocado Eggrolls. These are a must. All of their food is okay, I guess I'd say good, but it's a bit boring. Something I can't describe. Eat here 10 times (including takeout) and you're burnt out. Takeout is usually ready on time, but there's usually a wait on the weekend which is scary bc this place is scary big. So imagine how long it usually takes to get your food. I much more prefer this place for lunch. They have lunch specials and there isn't usually a wait. Service can be spotty, depends on who you get and wether they're hungover. If you are unfortunate enough to go on the weekend try to grab a seat in the bar if you don't want to wait close to an hour for mediocre food. But make sure you flag a server down or you won't get service for a while (we've waited a half an hour for a server in the bar before)."}
{"text":"Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options"}
{"text":"This place is fine when everything goes well.  However, when there is an issue or problem, this BJ's location is absolutely the worst.  
My wife, son, and I ordered BJ's to go and received the salmon caesar salad, boneless wings, and a grilled chicken sandwich.  What happened when we got the food home started the ordeal.  The salmon in the salad was severely undercooked.  It was so undercooked, it would have made a sensitive person sick.  The grilled chicken was cold and rubbery (no way it got that cold during the drive to our house.  When alerted about the problem, BJ's manager Norine would not even get on the phone with me to discuss the problem.  I emailed a complaint to BJ's corporate and Paul the higher manager called me and left a message that he would call back.  That was 2 months ago.  We have never returned."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 15. Yeah it's big but hey business is business. They made us a table and we sat down. The waitress didn't wanna do her job. Seemed like we made her night a nightmare. She came around a few times before the food came out but when they passed the food she didn't come back till everyone was done and she brought the checks. So for a good 25 minutes she didn't come or anyone asking if the food was good or if we wanted any refills I was stuck eating a chicken sandwich with no drink. Food is okay nothing to go crazy for."}
{"text":"We've gone here several times since it opened late last year. Food is a 6 out of 10, food prices are a little steep as well, service is a 4-1/2 out of 10. No management visible, walking through the restaurant to check on your dining experience. Noise level and music too loud for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Lots of variety! Giving 4 stars because it's a little pricey and I used grub hub and food wasn't fresh but I live right down the street. Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"We we're pleasantly surprised, thinking it was going to be a brew pub environment. But instead, it was nicely laid out and beautiful Decour. The food and service was great. We have eaten there on several occasions, and tried several items. All was very flavorful. And the prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Love the Henderson location.  Always friendly staff and great food! Lots of choices! One of our favorite places for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Seared Ahi Tuna Salad is awesome! 
This place is very busy on the weekends but if you can make it before 530pm the wait isn't too bad. 

Lots of great beer options! One of the few places you can find Ballast Point in Phoenix. 

Good service and pretty good food. This is a good go to spot when you can't decide where to go. Lots of options on the menu."}
{"text":"I judge every sports bar by its burger. Bjs earned its place at the bottom of the heap. I had a bacon avocado burger and it should had been named the lime juicebuger. I understand they add the citrus so the avocado doesn't turn brown in 4 hours while they leave it out, but the amount of lime was overpowering. My second burger without the avocado was unseasoned dry and had frigid cheese. Not good value."}
{"text":"Food here was totally worth the wait. I must admit the line was quite long. They do not take phone reservations. So i suggest you plan for an off night if your doing a bigger party of 5+. The service here once seated is definitely fast and so is the food. The prices were super reasonable for the amount and the quality of food served. Absolutely one of my new fav. places to eat here in Las Vegas. Dress at your own comfort but i suggest casual as it is not someplace you wana come to in your pajamas. Parking is also very abundant. There alcohol selection is definitely great as well especially if you are a beer fan."}
{"text":"I really do love this place..but now I'm pretty disappointed . I had a take out order for a honey crispy salad and I asked for various things to be added to it and I didn't receive anything  .i called a few days after and talking to someone that took down my name and number and then said they would give me some type of information that will let me redeem my salad .. Anyways when I was ready to
Come get it because I live so far from this location   Come to find out I didn't talk to a manager because no one remembers or wrote down my information for the general manager . Then after talking to the manager frank he was suppose to give me a call back . I didn't receive any call . I called the following days after untill I reached him again and he blamed the system being down and my information was lost ... But I gave my name and number out to another employee the day before . It just doesn't make any sense and I'm pretty much giving up . I just won't be going to this location anymore ."}
{"text":"Service is always fantastic & food has fantastic taste and variety. Great place for date night or the family."}
{"text":"Just wasn't as good as before.  Reception was great, smell outside was bad, waiter was good, food average, person bringing food had a bad attitude.  Not as good an experience as before."}
{"text":"Great food little. pricey but great service. Desserts are amazing it real nice place."}
{"text":"2nd Time here. The beers are great. We had the BJ's thin pizza--it was delicious. Just a note that this place is almost always busy and you will have to wait, unless you get lucky and get a table by the bar. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a couple of weeks ago and it was good. Service was fine, food portions were huge, nice selection of drinks and food! My friend ordered a side salad that she returned because it tasted like the refrigerator.  Overall, the place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Beware those with allergies. My wife and I use to frequent BJ'S, we've never had an issue. However, this location made my wife extremely ill, and it happened at the Cardinal's stadium right before a game. We ordered takeout and noted her extreme allergy to dairy - she even ordered a salad that contained no dairy, yet about half way through the salad she noticed a slice of shredded cheese - and then more. My wife spent the game we were supposed to enjoy violently ill and very far away from home. You have ruined BJ'S for us. I called that day, my wife emailed, we were apologized to and told the staff would be re-education on the severity of allergies and cross contamination. A giftcard was mentioned, but never delivered. It's the principle of the matter, if you don't follow up on what you say, my wife will never be safe to eat at your concept. If you have an allergy STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Had some random troubles doing online delivery. Called the store and spoke to the gm! April did completely everything she could to resolve the issue. Super sweet! Offered to deliver the food herself! Zero of the gms I know would never do this! Shows a lot of character! Super happy with the way everything was taken care of!"}
{"text":"We had the most delightful server John I believe his name is.. we were seated right away and everything came out as ordered perfectly .. we enjoyed fish n chips and a bread bowl of broccoli cheddar then a scrumptious monkey bread and ice cream dish.. very yummy and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Menu has a ton of options from appetizers and drinks all the way to dessert. The avocado egg rolls are awesome and the new deep dish appetizers are good too. Had the BBQ chicken chopped salad and it's great and huge. The pizza cookies are always good. The Oreo one is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday for the knights game and ordered potato skins and they served us a rotten potato. My husband bit into it and spit it out very gross. The waitress and manager apologized but it wasn't their fault. If there staff in the kitchen knowingly serve that, what else do they do? I can't eat at a place where I cannot trust the kitchen. Unfortunately that was the last time I will be going to BJs"}
{"text":"It was good. I went to my friend's birthday dinner and I liked their pizza. I didn't order anything because that's what we had."}
{"text":"OMG! My new favorite place to go. A very diverse menu and the service is outstanding. GREAT drinks too. Good atmosphere. We just love, love this place.!"}
{"text":"Non-priced mix drink menu, said it was a corporate decision to leave off prices. But the server thought they went up from 6.95 to 11.00. I don't buy any product with an unknown price until you see the bill. Warm Root Beer in a chilled glass doesn't make for a cold Root Beer on a hot day, it's still warm. Pizza was good, but can do much better food for less price elsewhere. Lots of wait staff running around, not busy, but not very good attention to us at the tables. Slow to acknowledge the table and in a hurry to leave it when you try to order. Never mentioned any specials that I hear they always have. Another typical young crowd hangout who don't care about experience and quality. Too many other choices around to frequent this place. No more for me."}
{"text":"The service was very quick and my ice tea never found the bottom of the glass (very quick on the refills).  I had the slow roasted turkey club sandwich which was very good except (imho) the turkey should have had some flavor to it (the rest of the sandwich lmade up for taste) plus I decided to have the clam chowder which was good but had more potato than chowder."}
{"text":"I used to work here and I have to say, for that year that I was employed.. I could've turned into an avocado egg roll I ate SK many of them!! So good! Really awesome spot for a date, which is what I was doing the first time I ever went there, or a big family dinner. The food is some of the best I've had in Vegas!! Get the root beer! I promise it'll change your life. =P"}
{"text":"Pizookie, pizookie, pizookie! Oh, and barbeque chicken salad and California chicken sandwich. Love to meet my husband here for a quick bite and dessert!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience tonight.  Pizza was extraordinarily delicious. Good-looking staff in smart outfits were efficient & attentive service. Deco & ambience were outstanding.    Will come again for family outings & staff happy hours."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the Henderson, NV restaurant on July 20, 2017. 

I ordered a chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. My friend had the bison burger. 

First the sandwich. I come from NY. A club sandwich, aka Triple-Decker has FRESH turkey, bacon, lettuce/tomato with 3 slices of bread and mayo. THAT is a REAL club sandwich. A sliced chicken sandwich from processed chicken as you'd get in a deli on 2 slices of bread is NOT a club sandwich, not now, not ever. I didn't eat it and turned it back, then didn't order anything else. The fries were sparse. The coleslaw.... large chunks of cabbage in a tiny bowl. I make awesome coleslaw at home and have had some of the best coleslaw outside. But this... surely needs to be changed. NEVER use large pieces of cabbage... just as you wouldn't put a thick piece of tomato on a sandwich. This was about the worst I've had.

My friend's burger... dried, nothing special. 

The waitress was great.

Personally, I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant, where everything is tasteless and way over-salted. My fault.

We are very disappointed and will not return. 

America... Chain restaurants, ala Red Lobster and Olive Garden, use loads of sodium. We all know that no matter how old we are, salt is bad for your heart. If not as a teen, then when you get older. It's a fact. Why chains do this is beyond me. Red Lobster packs their fish in frozen ice salt. Their sauces are way oversalted. This is what they told me. Same for Olive Garden. Salt does not bring out the taste... it eventually hurts your organs. Better to find a mom 'n pop shop, not a corporate chain restaurant.

There is no shortage of restaurants. Be wise when you choose. I do not suggest BJ's as your place of choice to eat.. 2 times there and I'm done."}
{"text":"There is always a wait here on game nights but worth it for the Pazookis!  We shared the chicken garlic pizza and the bbq chicken salad which were okay.  We mainly come for dessert. My drink was also really good. Our server was nice and polite but forgot to refill our waters a few times."}
{"text":"Join the email club for good offers. We got a large pie for half price the other day. The deep dish crust is light and airy. Plenty of toppings and free drink refils also."}
{"text":"The service was atrocious.  I can only say two good things about my experience here.  1. The Resturant was clean. 2. The waiter was nice.  Having said that, he brought me an order with shrimp, when I ordered salmon.  When I pointed out the error (respectfully and nicely), I waited 10 minutes for him to return to the table, so everyone was well into their meal),he sent it back and said it would be out in 5 minutes.  It arrived in 15 minutes.  By then everyone at my table Had about finished their meal.  I asked for a box, and a setup, (still no fork), and it took another 5 minutes.  By then, I was hungry, fed up with the poor service, and VERY disappointed that I had not eaten.  The waiter was profusely apologetic, and had a nice demeanor, but he simply did not get the job done.   He took it off my bill. I returned home at 10 pm, which is a little late to eat and avoid a night of heartburn.  I threw out the warm lettuce and hoped the salmon might taste good the next morning in an omelette or such.  This chain needs to either train their staff better or hire more staff to get the Friday night crowd handled efficiently.  Just get the job done right the first time! I realize mistakes happen, but this was just a case of carelessness and not taking proper care of the customer.  No excuses, just own up and take corrective measures, or lose customers..your choice."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here probably once a week.  Where do I begin?!
Below is what we LOVE:
1. Apps:
-Potato Skins
-Chicken Pot Stickers
-Avocado Egg Rolls
-Chicken Wings
-Chips & Salsa (yes, their salsa is good!)
2. Salads:
-Caesar Salad (with chicken)
-Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad
-Santa Fe Salad
3. Pasta:
-Angel Hair Toscana
-Grilled Chicken Pasta
4. Entrees:
-Parmesan Crusted Chicken Breast (SO GOOD!  My husband get's this almost everytime!)
5. Sandwiches:
-Angus Roast Beef Dip
-Crispy Chicken

We actually haven't had their pizza, but all our friends say they are delicious!  We always love what we get, so its hard to try new things.

If you have room for desert (servings are VERY generous) then you gotta try the Pizookie.  Huge cookie with ice cream.

Great Beer & Drink Menu.  Casual, so you can come in your jeans.

They have something for everyone... I'm sure we will be there again this week!"}
{"text":"One of our best places to go.  Friendly bartenders!   Avocado Spring Rolls to start - delish!  Spicey Meatball pizza - the best!  Black & Blue Burger - on the money.  And love the santa fe chicken salad.  Bar seating - which we wanted and liked....love seating at the bar too - because of the TV's...always sports going on and you get to chat with people.    Great service, high energy, super nice...great food, great home brews. This is our favorite local spot!

Since my first review this place is just a-ok.  Staff is different every time we go.  Such a turnover!  Some are friendly, some not so much.  Food is still good."}
{"text":"It was Monday at 10:30pm...we were so happy they were open. Pleasant server, fast service...calamari was very fresh"}
{"text":"BJ's is a standard fall back restaurant when we cannot decide as a family on some other place.  We all love BJ's but I just cannot give this type of restaurant 5 stars.  It would be hard pressed for me to give any bar restaurant a 5 star rating so 4 is really good.  My kids love the deep dish pizza and I love several items on their menu.  The balsamic chicken is awesome, but make sure you order it with extra fried onions.  The French dip is also very good.  

It's a must to order their pizookie .  This is a fresh baked cookie (warm) in a circular metal tin with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Several cookies to choose from.  They are all amazing.    

Great place to go to and watch a sporting event as they have TV's throughout the restaurant.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are amazing, love the deep dish pizza. They also have thin and flatbread. They have a good selection of their own craft beers but the Pazooky is the bomb.   Thank you BJ's for appreciating teachers, truly appreciate it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre is putting it nicely. I went for lunch with my sister and mom to watch some college football. It was busy but we stayed wanting to catch the end of the noon games. I ordered a yuengling draft and was surprised to see that cost almost $7. For a draft!? Anyways. We wanted pizzas as that seemed like the popular item to the folks around us but found out they were out of dough. After an expensive beer and no chance for pizza we weren't off to a great start. We ordered the potato skins, wings and 2 of the salads to share. The food was just o.k. Some of the potato skins were burnt and others seemed not cooked long enough. I also like mine with tons of cheese and bacon. These barely had any. The wings were pretty awful. Chicken was tough and chewy, not enough sauce on the wings which made it bland. The atmosphere is cool and our waiter was nice but overall I was disappointed."}
{"text":"We were pretty pleased with the food, drinks & service at BJ's. Typically when me & the hubster are in Vegas we're visiting family so we tend to stay away from the Strip and just relax... which is sometime hard in Vegas. BJ's is so chill it's easy to feel comfortable. Though its a chain restaurant, they've hit the nail on the head with stellar service and strong drinks.  

Lots of beer choices and like Ken. M said, they're one seasonal beer on tap is a killer hit (at least with my hubby!) I had one of the strongest cosmos Id gotten in a long time and that was perfectly fine with me considering we were there with the in-laws ;)

Nonetheless, when you're in Vegas and either want a break from the Strip or just someplace to feel comfortable, watch the game and put a few back, BJ's should be just perfect!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch , our waitress DEBBIE was amazing and courteous, would recommend everyone to come have a beer and hang out. I had the bacon avocado and tomato sandwich, it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE BJ's! The food is amazing, and my only complaint is the wait time...but that's a good indicator of how good the place is!"}
{"text":"Definitely not going to visit any time soon again.  I called ahead to get in the wait list since the lady time we tried to get in the door it was a 2 hr wait.  Tonight,  I called was quoted 50 minutes.   We arrive 45 minutes into the 50 minutes wait and was told it was going to be another 50 minute wait.   

Needless to say,  we left.   With a toddler,  that is not good.  This is not what call ahead means.   I don't think my family will go back.   

On another note,  my husband went to go look at the beer wall to get an idea of what we were going to get.   As I walked over to him,  I about fell in my butt!  The floor was so slippery.   This is  not good for any body.   

They need to utilize no wait."}
{"text":"Wow! Came here on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm. Place was full but no waiting! Our waitress was friendly and kind.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and my friend ordered Jambalaya. Food got.to our table in less than 10 minutes.  Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Although we were full, we couldn't leave without trying the baked beignet."}
{"text":"The food as always was good, (extra star for this) but this location has terrible service. 

Our party of 4 arrived and we ordered 4 drinks and one appetizer.  It was about 20 minutes for 3 of us to get our first order of soft drinks... 30 minutes had gone by the time we got our appetizer.  We tried to get our waiter flagged down but he was either no where or at other tables quite a way from our section.  

We caught a passing waitress and complained, She was great, she took stock of what we were missing, and promptly brought us our refills and the beer that was ordered. 

1 hour had past and now we had long eaten our appetizer and drank our drinks.  Our food arrived and was good.   Our waiter came over and apologized for the mix up, their computers had crashed.  2 of us ordered 3rd refills.   They didn't turn up, just the bill with the manager who apologized for the late food, late drinks, slow service.. but offered nothing in compensation.   

The bills were wrongly split but we just exchanged cash between us and left vowing never to return. 

I have been to BJs in 3 states and I have been to this location before, the service was never this bad."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is wonderful. Drinks even better, and service is always good! We just discovered this location, so close to home. We will be regular customers for sure.  Our server, Steve, was awesome. Pleasant, funny, attentive, (but not too attentive)."}
{"text":"Really - this should have 1.5 stars, but I can't figure out how to make that happen. 

Wow, I thought this place had a ton of potential, but it didn't deliver at all. Almost everything that could go wrong did. Orders were wrong or missing altogether, completely inattentive servers, non-existent manager, long wait for everything! 

They don't take reservations. So our very large table (family event) had to wait a while (hour). No big deal. We got drinks at the bar and all was well.  The wait was the most pleasant portion of the meal. I liked the cider - crisp and just a little sweet, but very drinkable.  It is the only thing that would round this up to 1.5...

When we were finally seated, someone came over and got our drinks.  We waited a while longer and finally were able to place our orders for appetizers and the rest of our food - and a request for napkins & silverware.  Following another long wait, the apps came.  Our \"queso\" dip (really just nacho cheese) wasn't very warm and neither were the chips, but it was fine and at this point, we were so hungry it didn't matter (it had been about an hour wait to sit down).  We still didn't have napkins or silverware and had to flag down multiple servers in our attempts to get these essentials. They finally bring those out after the salads (and our 4 request/reminder). 

Now came another long wait (hour)... eventually, runners started bringing out our food, one by one.  Almost everyone had their food (except for one of my cousins - more about that later) and had started eating.  I flipped open my veggie burger.  And there is bacon on it.  I've been a vegetarian for about 3 years now and definitely didn't order bacon with my veggie burger.  I did however order avocado, which I never received. 

I decided to eat a fry since I obviously was going to need to talk to someone about my burger - the fries are cold. My cousin next to me had ordered fries as well, but didn't get them at all - so I shared my giant portion of fries with him.  I never received any condiments (ketchup, mustard, etc) nor was I able to ask for these as the servers appeared to be actively avoiding our table. 

After waiting and being ignored by multiple members of the wait staff, I decide to make a bad decision and try to remove the bacon from my burger - so off goes the cheese as it has melted together - and I hope that's enough to keep me from getting sick (I'm a vegetarian for health reasons).  

Across the table from me, my cousin (who I mention before) ended up waiting 40 minutes for his food after the rest of the table received theirs.  That only appeared because we finally were able to flag down our waitress. 

I was able to mention my issue with the bacon to her - her reaction was that it wasn't that big of a deal (vague \"oh, I'm sorry\" was all I originally got), but eventually decided the right thing to do would be to comp my meal.  They did offer to make me another one, but I just didn't want to wait another 45 minutes or so, since the first one took so long!   I never was able to speak with a manager nor was one offered (to be fair, I didn't explicitly ask for one either). I just wanted to be done.

It's a shame - my family only gets together about once a month and we spent most of the time talking about how bad the service was at this location of BJ's."}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5 if I could. The service was good. I had the ahi tuna salad and it was good, not great. My wife had the soup and salad. Soup was tomato bisque, good. Salad was wedge, ok. I sampled a few of their own beers and found it difficult to find one I really liked. What was outstanding were the wings with the root beer glaze! I would return again just for them and order a bottled beer that I already like. There seemed to be a lot of tasty looking selections on the menu, would try dining there again."}
{"text":"Service is good, beers are good but $5 for a small draft beer is a total rip off!  The thin crust pizzas are very good, ribs were just OK, Dave's BBQ ribs are far better.  Good 80s music selection.  Very cool and hip atmosphere.

Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"I love BJ's. The menu is a little too big, but everything I have tried is great! The beers are good, if you like good beer, i.e. something other than Coors or Bud. The wings are awesome, they just drizzle a bit of sauce and then give you more on the side so they don't get soggy. The bruschetta is delicious. The thin crust pizzas look great, but I haven't had one yet. The avocado egg rolls are yummy and the grilled shrimp tacos are one of my favorite dishes. Perfect end to a day of shopping at Chandler Mall."}
{"text":"We have nothing bad to say about BJ's Brewhouse. We did not order the Brussels sprouts appetizer though it took all our might not to! Hubby had the Jalapeño Burger medium rare and I had the BBQ Brisket Burger medium rare. We both loved, loved, loved our meals. Our fries were smoking hot. Our burgers perfectly done. The brioche Burger buns were soft and fresh.  The White Chocolate Macadamia pizookie was warm and delicious! Our waitress was friendly and on point. We will most certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is our go-to place when I'm too lazy/busy to make dinner.  We used to go once or twice a week either eating in the restaurant or to-go, but we recently stopped going because the service isn't so great anymore.  We love the variety of food and most specially the pizookies that they offer.  Maybe we just need a little break from BJs and hopefully we regain back our love for the place soon."}
{"text":"BJ's is very casual. It's a very convenient spot to meet up with friends here since they are open until midnight. 

I almost never order dessert when eating out because I get so full - but I feel like you HAVE to save room for a pazookie if you're coming to BJ's! 

Tip: Tuesday is pazookie day; $3 all pazookies!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for a while but my kid would always choose Olive Garden for their soup. This place was family friendly and seemed like a nice place to come at night with friends. Pizza was delicious, drinks were good. The staff greeted us and sat us immediately. Excellent service and staff."}
{"text":"I stopped here after reading other yelp reviews saying that this chain gets real busy around the standard eating times and the service gets real slow.  So we stopped in on a Saturday at 3:30 and everything was running smoothly.  I got tasters for all the beer I thought looked interesting.  It's sort of my hobby trying out breweries and sampling a lot of different kinds of beer, and these seemed very basic/safe.  If you are new to the beer world these would be the low key flavors you are looking for. But I really enjoyed the food.  I started with the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts and they have awesome big flavor.  For my meal I got the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos which were tasty.  The meal came with a quinoa salad but I had no room for that after stuffing my face with everything else.  I would give a 3.5 if I could but am sad about the beer."}
{"text":"Great comfort food with a lot of healthy options as well. This establishment takes pride in having the best craft beer, make sure to sit at the bar to get the best service!"}
{"text":"Always reliably good.  Great beer selection as well as fabulous \"bitch fizz\" (ciders, etc.) and cocktails.  Their pizza is outstanding AND they have a healthy menu.  I generally steer clear of chains but this is an exception."}
{"text":"I probably come here 3-4 times a year and tonight the food was really good. We started with the guacamole and chips. It was $4.95! I couldn't make my own guacamole for that price. That's definitely a good priced appetizer. I ordered the Enlightened turkey burger and it was delicious. It said it had Dijon mustard, but it was just regular yellow mustard. I didn't mind though, it was pretty good. It came with a side salad. I'll definitely get this meal again. 
Our server was a little slow. We asked for a few minutes to look over the menu and then she just kept passing by us to take care of other tables. It took her about 10 minutes to get our order taken. Then when she dropped off the check she kept passing by us again and again."}
{"text":"Quick friendly seating.  Enjoyed tropical tea.  Waited about 20 min for sandwich and a salad.  Huge tasty BBQ chicken salad and they split it for me to take half with me.  Husband liked club sandwich.  Fries were cold though.  Salad was great."}
{"text":"We have dined at BJ's several times and have always been pleased with the food.  Our favorite is their Happy Hour 1/2 off pizzas in the bar area.  The portion sizes are large and are great to share or take some home!  It is kid friendly whcih is a bonus for us.  We also really like the new smaller bites menu, it makes it easy to get several different dishes to share!"}
{"text":"I shy away from negative reviews as much as possible but this place has been a disappointment on more than 1 occasion. I'm giving 2 stars and if the service wasn't so terrible I'd give more because the food is good. 
1st time I went I was greeted and sat by hostess (on the patio). A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given. 

Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food, the order was wrong. When we addressed her, she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday, so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us, I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more. Just seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. I'm huge on customer service, as much as I like good food, I pay a premium when going out to have good service and this place just doesn't fit the mold...unfortunately."}
{"text":"Holy crap, the mac n cheese. My friend Syd had the Club which she gave me a bite of and it was amazing. We each had a different kind of beer, I had the blonde which I hadn't tried before. Delicious. Also- I love the atmosphere, it's open space and seating makes it so you aren't IN someone else's conversation. 

We sat in the bar area at a table before we saw a movie, and the only negative was how long everything took. They were really packed and only had one server on, so it wasn't surprising but we were really hungry."}
{"text":"First time here. The BJ's PM Porter is outstanding. The BJ's Pumpkin Ale is outstanding as well!!!! So glad it is the last of the season that was still available to try! Food was extremely good. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were exceedingly good. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were the BEST baby back ribs I have ever had in a restaurant. The Chicken Pot Stickers totally met our expectations. Service was SUPERB!!!!  Brook and Erin were our bar tenders/servers who took AWESOME care of our needs!!!! I would highly recommend BJ's Brewhouse which is new to the Fairlawn area."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Luved the bar atmosphere. Enjoyed watching the ball game. The wines and the food selections were amazing. Very friendly staff. Ryan was simply awesome and took special care of me and my friends. Jill at the bar is great. Will definately come back. Would highly recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"Packed Friday nite. Cool server dude. My turkey dip was kinda plain.. still enjoyed it.  Tomato mozzarella salad is De-ludicrous! ..That good.  Wife's tacos Ok, and mystery side dish was tasty.. I crushed it.  Moms small plate of creamy couscous mac n cheese was indeed small!! And kinda burnt (I woulda sent it back) -she liked it. 
Broccoli cheese soup not appetizing.  Special teas were just fair.  Not great but 'Owl be Bock!'"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Our server was very attentive and helpful. The only thing I didn't like is that the floor was slick everywhere as if it was oiled. Dangerous! I have the bison burger which I would certainly have again. My companions also enjoyed their meals and remarked that they liked this as a future option to meet up as well. The bar was nice and even with the high ceiling and warehouse feel, it wasn't overly loud like Yardhouse gets."}
{"text":"Although wait time can be a little long, They always have amazing service! I have tried numerous things on the menu, but somehow always resort back to their famous cheese and tomato pizza! Love it and will continue to come here. Always gotta have their pazookie!!! You're missing out if you haven't had one"}
{"text":"The only things that don't make this place get the 5 stars are the margaritas and the the wait times to be seated. 

Other than that the food is great and so is the service! I always have a great server and the hostess are always helpful. 

I still have yet to try the pizza but so far all the other things have been great. Especially the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"I've worked in restaurants my whole life, so I'm a very easy going diner.  I understand that things get busy, people make mistakes, all of that. Even if the service sucks on a particular night, I understand. Just because a server is backed up or running behind, I tip well. 

My server tonight did not deserve anything.  I was dead set on giving her $0 for her unpleasant b***h attitude but when she came with the check, I chickened out and gave her a few dollars because I still felt bad that servers don't make much. 

My wife and I were sat at 7:12.  At 7:27, our server came to our table and said she'd be right with us.  At 7:36, she said she was dealing with a large party and that's why we had to wait so long.  I thought that was a crappy excuse, but whatever.  I'm cool, no worries, all that.

We each ordered a soda and burgers, and I got a side salad. That was the last we saw of our server until she gave us the check.

At 7:52, we got our sodas.  At 7:56, I got my side salad.  At 7:59, I got tired of waiting for someone who worked there to pass by, so I went to the front counter to get the silverware we were never given.

I didn't check the time when we got our food but it was around 8:10.  The burgers were super good. Their burger sauce they had is ridiculously delicious.

Then we waited for the check until 8:20.  We had assumed our server had gone home and we were just a forgotten table that food runners were taking care of but then our server we hadn't seen for half an hour showed up and asked if we wanted dessert. We sure did! The reason I wanted to go there tonight was specifically for those Pizookie things.

Unfortunately, the service was so slow, we didn't have time to order them. We had already been there for over an hour and didn't have an hour to waste on waiting for dessert. When we told her we didn't have time for dessert she said \"Are you suuuure\" in a super condescending tone.  What the hell did we do to you, lady?


It's a shame but my wife and I both agreed that we weren't coming back.  I know that's what customers say when they are annoyed and trying to make the manager or owner feel bad, knowing full well that they are going to come back in the future.  I'm not just saying that for attention.  This is the second time we've been to BJ's and the second time we've received poor service.  


Bye bye, BJ's Brewhouse."}
{"text":"Made an advanced seating request which got messed up because they don't read the comments then had to wait an additional 40 minutes to get seated. We waited for an hour once seated to get our food... great experience with a hungry 2 year old. Food was okay but not worth waiting for from 530 - 715. The Zany Zitrus IPA was very good. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday had reservations for 8pm for 2 people. Still waited 30 mins for a table. Got the Brussels sprouts for appetizer. Tasted pretty good but were kind of over cooked. Alex was our server and he was great. Answered all of our questions etc. I had the Jalapeño Burger it was cooked to my liking and tasted very good. Girl had the tacos she liked them. Dessert was a pizookie a cookie w ice cream on top. It's was really good."}
{"text":"The mini burgers here will be the death of me."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I love this restaurant and frequently eat there! My son always gets the chicken fingers and I always get the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. We usually avoid going at the busy lunch and dinner times because the wait can be quite long, but if you go a little later around 2-3pm there typically isn't a wait. Appetizers are great, salads are great, service is usually friendly and fast, I don't have anything bad to say and always recommend BJ's Restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza at this place. Pan crust BJs favorite is the best. The wings are good. Just tried the root beer  glaze wings. They were really tasty just the right flavor. My family and I have had some of the pasta plate which are good but we always come back for the pan crust pizza.
My husband loves the selection of beer and enough TVs to watch whatever game is playing.
The service is good. So far all the staff has been great each and every time we come in. 
Don't forget dessert! PIZOOKIES"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to a BJs in Arizona, it was okay. The food was pretty good, I had the avocado rolls and the Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa Bowl. Oh let me just state, the water is disgusting it's tastes like dirt therefore I would recommend a Pellegrino.  The service was good, our servers name was Steve and he was a delight making our experience better."}
{"text":"I will totally admit I am usually not a chain restaurant person.  In fact for years I abhorred chains; there are some now though that I think actively know that and work to set themselves apart.  For me BJ's was one of those. 

The hubs and I went on a Friday afternoon we were off from work and took the lil McDuo... now most servers see one kid and freak out let alone two toddlers our server didn't do that she was amazing.  Sabrina immediately said \"can I get you a starter for them?\" which was a garlic knot and fruit - keep them occupied stop the screaming and let us look at the menu.  We had come in for the soup and salad lunch special - different soups different salads and you can swap each round. Totally awesome idea and lets you try more of their signature dishes.  

The wedge salad possibly one of the best wedge salads I've ever had.  House salad OK not remarkable need some kick; I don't know cheese bacon egg something... The soups the chicken tortilla it was delicious and garnished awesomely with sliced avocado.  The cheddar broccoli delicious very cheesy not a lot of broccoli.  My husband loved the clam chowder in fact he had two bowls said it was delicious creamy & lots of clams. The tomato bisque was good very tomato he needed a grilled cheese dip in! Lol. 

Also they have a kids menu and a bigger kids menu - perfect for two littles to split! The grilled chicken and mashed potatoes was a hit! 

Their beers that we sampled were good - the brown ale, the Belgian, the fruity cider - all delicious. We didn't try the pizza but we will be back and we will ask for Sabrina! To be sure. 

Thank you BJs crew!"}
{"text":"This mall restaurant had a wide and well thought out selection of beers on tap and a menu that would accommodate any meal, whether you were just wanting a small lunch or a hearty dinner. We sat at the bar so we could have a prime view of the large screen to watch the game, and were met with excellent bar tending service and quick eats. Great spot that I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"The service here is great. At least while sitting at the bar it is. The food is good and the beers are good. The have a very nice selection of drafts which is great. I usually try a different house beer every time I'm there. So far the best is their seasonal Pumpkin Ale they have during October. This place is overall great, but it's expensive."}
{"text":"Caution! Servers autograt parties of 6 or more and don't display the gratuity on your signed copy. We were a party of 6 with 2 kids so we were in a bit of a hurry and didn't look until we got home. We intended to tip 30 percent and our slick server walked with 48! Bad taste by the management."}
{"text":"I've been going to BJ's for lunch since they opened.  The food is 5/6 on a scale of 10, but what brings me back is the atmosphere.  It's very comfortable and inviting whether a party of two or twelve.  It's a \"must lunch\" for out of town guests due to the handcrafted beer selection.  Always a hit and now a \"tradition.\"  First BJ's - then bowling.  After a few Ales, Blondes, Stouts, and Reds, no one cares how many pins they knock down (hee, hee, hee)!  If you haven't been, you should go!  I prefer lunch.  Dinner is crowded."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix for a week of spring training with March Madness thrown in.  We were here three times, mostly glued to a TV watching UNC.

Good happy hour food and deals.  Pot stickers tasty, flavorful and just the right amount of crunch.  Flatbread, invent your own pizzas were very good.  I had the portobello with balsamic and motzarella.  Hubby  had the sausage and olive.  Crunchy crust, much preferred over the deep dish.  

Bartender Shiloh ( dunno, maybe his mom was a Neil Diamond fan). Spotted us the second time we came in, knew our drink preference and offered up other spots to check out games.  Very nice, considering we'd never seen him.

Looking forward to next year's cactus league, for sure."}
{"text":"We're so lucky here in Lake County - we have just about every kind of restaurant. And BJ's is an okay addition. If you're a beer drinker with a group of friends and want something better than Fridays... then you found the spot. Atmosphere is benign if not boring. Seating and decor are nothing special and will feel like every other restaurant on the planet.

Let's remember, before we rip them a new one, that the place is new and the staff is too. So yes... there was a little slowness even at 4:30pm. And when our waitress asked if we were ready my husband said simply, \"Yes\" and she smiled at him and walked away. There were definite hold ups at the POS stations. Which is expected at this stage of the game - people are learning.

BIG alcohol selection. And I do not drink. So I tried their \"Botanical Blend\" Peach Sunrise. Not bad. Hubby had black cherry root beer- GREAT flavor. Appetizer was spinach stuff mushrooms. MUCH better than Olive Gardens version of same. Not served dripping in oil and grease, with a little bit of cream sauce finish. But holy crap... let's talk menu size. Gordon Ramsey would marinara his pants... waaaaay too many options.

Dinner was Jambalaya for me with a cup of chilli (my weakness) and hubby had deep dish ziti. Chilli was thick, meaty with a great flavor from the beer that's in it. LOVE IT. Jambalaya was one note... and would not stand up to anyone's creole Gram's recipe. It was well cooked. Just no biggie. Hubby said ziti was 4 stars out of 5. He actually ate the whole thing which never happens. With tip we spent  $60.

In the end, we'd go back. I'd seriously get take out of just that chilli to be honest... in a bread bowl... score! Give them time to grow. They'll put Max and Erma's under for sure."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with my boyfriend and sister. We got seated just before the dinner rush. This place is huge and can house plenty of people. Our order of cheese sticks were great and very tasty. We also shared an order of tomato, basil and mozzarella salad. It was extremely fresh.  Their club sandwich and fries that I got was just what I was craving. Really happy with our choice of going to BJ's. We'll be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I'm NOT a huge fan of BJ's food, but this place gets 5 out of 5 stars because of the amazing service we had here! I forgot our waiter's name, but he was effin' AMAZING! Very friendly, funny, attentive to our needs, and gave excellent recommendations in regards to food choices and drinks. Despite being busy, our food was brought out to us rather quickly. After paying for our meal, we spent a little while just chatting with our waiter (yeah, he was that cool)."}
{"text":"Disappointed...
I mean, I expected much more out of this place.  

Service - not very attentive.

Food - average if not slightly below. (should you have to ask for WHAT the menu says it COMES WITH?)

Atmosphere - nice, but rather sterile and cold (along with the seats under the A/C)

Pricey - yes, for what we got and the rather bland taste (Fish & Chips / French Dip).

Will we be back? - maybe - but not anytime soon.  

The Yardhouse is hands-down a far superior place, service, food, quality and just all around better than BJ's.

As Simon Cowell would say... Sorry!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Food was horrible. I am an avid BJ's lover. I've always love their food. For some reason this time was just a horrible experience. The server ignored us most of the time. The food was barely lukewarm when it came out. I got a jalapeño burger that was soggy and wayyyy over cooked. Very unhappy with my experience.  I understand it's lunch time but jeez. Hopefully next time -if there is one - I will have more positive things to say."}
{"text":"Took my kids here for dinner, they ordered Chicken Alfredo and I ordered the Sirloin Steak w/Garlic green beans.  The beans tasted more like lemon, seemed like they mixed old n new veggies plus there were 2 asparagus mixed in it.  Server never once check on us as a matter of fact my daughter had to catch his attention to have my sons drink refilled which sat there empty for 10-15 min.  Check comes and my bill is $69.33, I expect my EXACT change back so I can tip you ACCORDINGLY to your poor service but I guess he felt the need to pocket my .67¢ .... You wanna pocket my chump change at least round off to the nearest dollar!!!  Must be hard times for him!  Oh and BTW the restaurant wasn't busy so his poor customer service is inexcusable!!! AND I went home with an upset stomach which I'm pretty sure it was the green beans!  Not returning for sure!!"}
{"text":"The main reason for the four stars is for their Angus Roast Beef Dip -- it is delicious!  It is up there on my list of favorite French Dips. The meat is super tender and juicy, and the horseradish spread really compliments the sandwich. Plus, it is a great condiment to dip your french fries in.  

The portions are huge -- my sister ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad and she barely ate half of it. I, of course, devoured my sandwich. They have a huge menu, with a lot to choose from. They seem to be known for their pizzas, which look really yummy too.

The atmosphere is similar to most sports bars, although I'd say this place is more of a \"high-end\" sports bar with chandeliers and mood lighting instead of ripped vinyl and dirty blinds.  There is a massive flat screen TV. above the bar, and little ones interspersed throughout the restaurant. The wait can be a bit long on Friday nights and weekends, but you can call ahead to get your name on the wait list.  And, they are nice enough to offer you some small pizza bites while you wait.

Overall, BJ's is your standard chain restaurant/sports bar, but with a few extra niceties to make it stand out above the rest.  I'll be back for sure, and maybe next time I'll venture outside my love-for-the-french-dip and try some of their other goodies."}
{"text":"Go to place for dinner. Since I don't cook! Lol. Great service and amazing food and drinks."}
{"text":"BJ's is an overpriced chain restaurant. It's not bad, but it's not great. They have a vast selection of craft beers as well as a plethora of cocktails. They have a huge menu with about 20 different pages which makes deciding what to order difficult. It took me and my 5 other family members at least 20 minutes to look through the menu and figure out what to eat.

We decided to order the chips and sriracha queso while we perused the menu. The app came out quickly, but the dip was lukewarm and the chips had no flavor. Surprisingly the dip was tasty, I just wish it were hotter. For my lunch I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. It was nothing to write home about. My mom ordered a small great white pizza which I tasted and it was sooo dry. It was the dryest pizza I had ever tasted and it was almost $17 for a small! The prices are way too steep for just mediocre food. I don't think I will ever dine at BJ's again."}
{"text":"Yummy is all I have to say. A very unique dining experience with unique appetizers, entries and desserts. Very pleasant calm space with perfect lighting. Great craft beer and tuna poke was delicious. This is a great place for couples or friends to dine."}
{"text":"The service wasn't that good, and there were crumbs still on the table. We asked to be seated some where else and they said no so we dealt with it but I would never go to this location again. The only thing I liked about this place was the dessert, I had the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie and  vanilla ice cream, it was good."}
{"text":"love this place!! Justin hands down is the best server. whenever i go there i always have my girls with me (8 teenage girls total) and we know we're a lot to handle. he was very patient with us and obliged to everything we asked for without complaint! would definitely recommend this place especially for birthday dinners!"}
{"text":"We like taking the fam here because there's something for everyone. Recently had visitors in town who've never been to a BJ's.   Someone wanted chicken wings, someone wanted pasta, someone wanted to drink, someone wanted a good steak.  BJ's came through for everyone.  My go-to meal is the rib eye--cooked perfectly. And the pizookies are always a crowd pleaser. Not to mention their beers as well as cocktails and mocktails are delish!"}
{"text":"Got to BJ's with a group of 10. We're from out of town and we go to BJ's because of the gluten free menu. We have really good service where we live so we naturally thought lets do this. 

We were seated in a timely manner for a party of ten at 1:25pmish.

It took the waitress 30 minutes to take our DRINK order and get us drinks. It then took another 15 minutes to come take our order. There were 3 tables where people are sat at different times around us (30 minutes later) and they had their food and left before we even were served our food. 

THE SERVICE, THE MANAGER were the WORST. The server avoided our table and another server brought us a water refill no soda refills (guess they want to save money).

Anyways, I don't recommend this location. Find a different location."}
{"text":"BJs is a solid consistent casual place to dine.  It's always crowded for dinner and you can either get a pager and wait it out or try your luck scoping out one of the open bar or bar area table seats which are all first come first serve.  They have a nice selection of draft beer to choose from and brew some of their own tasty concoctions as well as featuring many mainstream local and national favorites. 

We have one favorite dish on the menu that is hard to pass up.  It's the North Beach Mahi Mahi and Shrimp and it is so delicious.  It features black olive pieces, tomatoes, and pearl cous cous in the most delightful broth featuring an anise licorice flavor.  The fish is moist and meaty in texture and flakes easily.  It is just the right amount to fill you up but leave enough room for one of their delicious peanut butter and jelly pizookies.  

This last visit we tried something new: golden asparagus with lemon aioli sauce.  It was good and fried.  I mean, who doesn't like fried, right?  This is a tempura-like batter that was a little thick in certain spots but very tasty. 

The service is always good and efficient.  We often stop by for a late meal."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Winking Lizard.  Long wait time, bad service, low quality of food, and noisy atmosphere.   I don't understand how places like this attract such large crowds, unless it's because of the beer.  10 minute wait became 39 minutes.  Very little attention from waitress.  Appetizer came out at same time as food, but there were 20 minutes of waiting without food.  Food was bland and flavorless.  Water glasses never refilled.  Waitress was devoid of personality, and it seems like she disliked us.  I begrudgingly tipped 15%, the minimum.  I can't think of why I would want to go back.  Hooley House is a better choice."}
{"text":"I ordered the brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese and im pretty sure the cook got the meat from the grease trap and threw it on two burnt pieces of bread. Meat was inconsistent, burnt chunks with raw pieces and a ton of orange grease that puddled on the plate. Explained to waitress who was very nice, however, after getting it replaced, charged me for the more expensive bacon cheeseburger. And didnt get the replacement till way after my wife was finished eating."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here from time to time - usually when we want to get a burger and beer.  Happy hour pricing is not a great deal, but they have a decent beer selection and serve excellent veggie burgers which my wife loves.  

Their menu is overwhelming.  It reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory - where you sit down and they give you a novel to read.  So many items!

This time I tried a new item - the Late Night Burger.  Here's the description: Open-faced burger | housemade pork chile verde | Applewood smoked bacon | jack + cheddar cheese | fresh fried egg 

I really should have taken a picture.  When I think of an open-faced burger I don't think of both buns laid out with a patty covering the middle.  If that were the case, I'd hope that the buns were smothered in the pork chile verde.  Unfortunately there was a good 2\" on either side of the burger + toppings of plain bun, rendering the open-faced concept quite questionable.  I'd happily eat it with a closed bun because this presentation did nothing for it.

I ordered it medium (pink) with a sunny side egg.  They weren't extremely busy at the time, however my burger was well done with a fried egg that was practically over-hard. Overall the dish was a disappointment, having so much unused bread and it not cooked properly.

The service is always pretty great, I'll give that to our waitress.  I had a question about a beer and she proactively gave me a sample.  If their service dropped in quality I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"BJ's is a great restaurant with fantastic lemonade. The food is great and has incredible salads that are fresh unlike other restaurants. The service is usually good but can be slow at times depending on the occupancy.
Perfect place for catching up with friends or looking for a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Our server, Brian, provided the best service we've ever had at a restaurant. He went above & beyond and was excellent!"}
{"text":"Was feeling hungry so I stopped in for a brew and some pizza. I had heard that this chain's claim to fame was its deep dish pizza, but the restaurant was so busy I decided to try a flatbread appetizer instead to save time. While waiting for the food I had a flight of 4 house beers. Interestingly, the beer is not brewed on premises; rather, it is trucked in from out-of-state in kegs. The Lightswitch Lager, Piranha Pale, Oasis Amber & Hopstorm IPA were all very good indeed. The pizza arrived in about 10 minutes and was fresh, hot & tasty. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the house brews as well as the guest taps and was very friendly and engaging considering how busy the bar was. The menu is extensive and offers something for everyone; moreover,  there is a full bar if beer is not for you. One final note is that I did approve that the bar & restaurant area are well-separated, kids don't need to see people at the bar drinking. Overall a very good visit....cheers!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places for lunch and dinner with the big, crazy family I have. Tips: Call ahead of time to put your name down on the call list and sign up for their loyalty program, you will not regret it. 

I walked in at 8 PM and it was packed. Every single table was filled and there were at least 3 families ahead of mine, but we only waited for six minutes to be seated. It was awesome. Reminder: Call ahead of time. 

The server I got was awesome. Juan was attentive towards myself and my family. He always refilled our waters before it hit the \"half-way\" line and always checked to make sure everything was going well. 

The food was absolutely delicious. I never have any complaints about their food. The environment was also great. They have huge tv screens for sport fans like myself. I highly recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with BJ's. I absolutely love the pizookie, especially the cookies & cream one. It will blow your mind. I also love their brussel sprouts-soo good, and their lettuce wraps are delicious. I've never had a bad meal here. 

I want to love the BJ's app. You can get in line ahead of time and you can order online or access special deals through the app. Theoretically, you can also close out your bill through the app, but the last few times we've visited, our bill didn't show up on my app. 

Unfortunately, the service is poor. I haven't had a good service experience here yet. Our food has always been slow, and I usually have to track the sever down for a drink refill. One time, my husband and I drove separately because we met there, and we waited so long for our check that he left, and I sat for another 20 minutes waiting to close out our bill. 

Hopefully things improve in this area. If they do, I'll sing BJ's praises because their food is delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely a better experience this time.  I had a RibEye Steak w Spinach Dip for an appetizer and enjoyed both of them.  They were pretty busy but my food came quick and the waiter Dan was very attentive."}
{"text":"Great place awesome menu portions could be bigger but quality is perfect. Reviews are only a tool and i never base where i go off what others say but this is worth giving it a shot, we will be back many times"}
{"text":"my pregnant cousin and pregnant me have been wanting to try their pizookie for a looong time until finally we got the chance to do it today! and lucky they have $3 pizookie specials on tuesdays! we drove 15miles across town just to get here and we were sooo excited! we wanted to try a variety of flavors so we decided to order the 3 mini flavors for $10something... it took foreverrr for this mini trio to arrive, about 40mins! good thing we were full from dinner we just really came for dessert. it was surprisingly small so we ordered 1 more mini triple chocolate which was priced at $2.75 on the kids menu, and told the server we just want vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate, and of course he said yes! after 20 mins, only the check came which included our mini pizookie priced at $4something WITHOUT our pizookie served... when he came back we asked him about the price and he said they could fix it.. so he came back another 20 mins later with the check fixed and still WITHOUT our mini pizookie until another 5mins after!! and guess what, it wasnt even vanilla ice cream! ugh... so disappointing. i couldnt even say our cravings were satisfied...never coming back"}
{"text":"Back again because I like the food choices.  I must say service is still terrible.  It wasn't busy it was 11:00 pm. Bartenders last night 12/9 can't get any worse.  I'm speechless...well maybe not let me elaborate.  Before we sat down I told them there was a mess (food, etc) under bar stools but they did nothing about it. The guy started off ok but disappeared for a half hour after taking my drink order & half my food order and not my friends...the other bartender didn't bother to check on us she stayed at the other end of the bar.  Had to call her down to finish getting waited on.  When he finally returned he stayed at the other end of the bar talking to people and never checked on us for more drinks till last call so you know what...no more drinks and no tip!  Tips are earned and should not be expected!  Polite is good but inattentive when not busy is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We frequent BJ's on girl's nights. They have good food, a casual atmosphere and great beer. I would give it a higher rating if their prices were a little lower for the type of cuisine you get. Can't go wrong with the crispy artichoke hearts, the pizzas or a baked potato."}
{"text":"One star is generous for this place. It was new and clean. That's where it ends. Our waitress was not familiar with the menu and left mid meal. I had to ask 2 other waiters to find my soup order. Even though menu is extensive we had the basics. Caesar salad was made with ice burg (who does that?) the clam chowder was pastie and overly salted. The signature \"new sandwich\" was simply a variety of meat on soggy bread. No flavor and dry. Very underwhelmed. Lastly, after our original waitress left, we were pretty much on our own & even had to request to pay our check. I probably won't be back because in addition to the service and poor quality food it was overpriced."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the food here. Our favorites are BJ's favorite deep dish pizza, BBQ chicken salad and tonight we tried mozzarella sticks & calamari! They were both great and quickly gobbled up.

The service tonight was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ok food. My steak came way overcooked, dry and rough, but the manager fixed it. Our server was a bit too chatty, to a point where she'd interrupt a conversation to try upselling alcohol and dessert, and then hung out around the table behind us taking loudly. Delicious brussel sprouts. The menu looked extensive, probably will be back to try other things"}
{"text":"Great new place. Great food and friendly service. Baby back ribs were excellent.  My wife's steak was perfect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up with this restaurant. This was my neighborhood restaurant from middle school even until now, and man, am I lucky to have such a great neighborhood restaurant! I'm a frequent visitor, and I've never tasted anything I didn't like here! 

There's the pizookie, which is a given. Red Velvet is my fave! All of the salads are great. Just had the turkey burger which was bomb! The waiters are always accommodating and it's just a great casual place to hang out and visit whenever!"}
{"text":"I must say this is one of the nicest  bj I have ever been in the service  is better than all the others I have been in my waitress was at our table every five minutes to check on us. BJ'S IN SUMMERLIN AWESOME"}
{"text":"If they had a negative star review I'd give it!!!  We have tried this location many many many times sadly always the same bad experience!!!  We keep \"giving it another shot\" because our son loves their pazookie.  The only time we ever have a semi decent experience is when we sit at the bar which sadly then our son doesn't come along obviously.  The food is always off and either is somehow not what we ordered or has a hair, plastic or some other questionable item in it.  They have been served our son raw sliders.  The only thing they have going is they have Racer 5 IPA other than that we avoid going whenever we can!!!"}
{"text":"So someone did contact me about this and left me a message and when I called back, almost immediately afterwards, apparently that person was gone. They said they'd leave my name and number for her and I haven't heard a thing since. I get that the restaurant business is busy, I work in the business so I understand, but I'm still disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Are you serious? Placed a order for pick up at 6:45. Got there at 6:43 and called to let them know I was there. At 6:58 a server came outside walking from car to car (there were 4 cars) asking if the order was theirs. I told her no and she walked away. I waited another 6 minutes and called and they asked me if anyone came outside to get my payment or bring my order. I told them no, and then just said \"oh\".  Told them to cancel my order and I left. Now I understand it is a busy night (Friday) but this is the 3rd time this has happened. However this is the first time I got fed up and left. BJ's your food is not that good ok. Never again."}
{"text":"Had take out , and although the avocado rolls are very good I think they had a recipe change because they use to be very sweet and now they are kind spicy. They have very good salads and pizza !"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but after this current scenario I just had to. I visit this location very often. I rarely have a bad experience. About 1 year ago, I was there and ordered an appetizer, salad and dinner. The appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold. We told the waiter (bartender) and they took care of removing it from the bill and brought a new \"hot\" one. When my salad was served, I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead, it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic. The manager now had to come over for the second time and agreed something was wrong and again replaced the item. My main course (pasta and chicken) was excellent. The manager removed all the defective items from our bill along with a discount and I was happy with that. Now about 6 weeks ago, I returned and ordered a new item that the waitress recommended. It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized. He stated that he meant to take the lasagna off the bill but got busy talking to some people and forgot. He told me to provide my address which I did so he could mail me a gift card to try an entree on them next time.

That was 6 weeks ago !!! I'm guessing he may no longer be managing there anymore....."}
{"text":"Forgive me Dr. Robert Atkins, for I have sinned...again.  It's a temporary setback, but I simply couldn't help myself.  You see, I just went to the new BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Mentor, OH.  

My wife and I attempted to visit the new BJ's on a Friday but were greeted with the 'ol \"thanks for coming we can seat you in about 3 days\" nugget.   Given it was already about 2 hours since my last beer, we had to move on...stat.  

On Labor Day my wife offered to take me to lunch if I'd go shopping with her.  In a moment of weakness I succumbed to the Siren Song of a free meal.  \"Let's try that salad place!\" she exclaimed.  The childlike look of dejection on my face was enough for her to suggest we try BJ's again.  I love this woman.

Ambiance - Although it's a brand new building it has the air of an old open brick warehouse converted to a restaurant.  When you walk in the entire eating area is visible.  To left is the lengthy, stylish and well-stocked bar.  The back lit display of top shelf bourbons and a bar's length craft beer handles was particularly appealing. To the right is seating featuring what I can only describe as \"The Garage Doors to Nowhere\".  You'll see what I mean.  The seating is ample, but not crowded, and the faux oversized crown molding on the back wall above the Fenway Park Green Monster sized beer list make for cozy atmosphere.  Vertically the place opens all the way up to the roof with all the supports and mechanicals stylishly exposed to the patrons.  All in all a very good venue to strap on the feedbag..!

Service - The service peeps were very friendly and enthusiastic if not a tad inexperienced (to be expected).  Once they get their sea legs they'll be just fine.  They were overstaffed which I attribute to training but it wasn't overwhelming.  There were some awkward moments when I had specific questions about the food prep and menu, but no biggie.  It would have been nice to be made aware the Monday special was  1/2 priced large pizza.  I ordered the mini but discovered on my own that the large would have cost the same.  I was able to change the order in time to take advantage (and have leftovers for 3 days).  We were well attended to throughout the meal.  The service certainly shouldn't be a deterrent to trying BJ's.  I expect it to be well above average in a few weeks.

Food & Beverage - Sometimes craft beer places let their kegs get a little stale.  However, my GLB Dortmunder and my wife's Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale tasted very fresh and were perfectly chilled and carbonated.  We started with the Calamari appetizer.  It wasn't bad but maybe lacked a little taste.  I liked that it was fried a little crispier... my wife not so much.  I ordered the large Spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza.  This, and the beer, is where I fell off the low carb wagon...hard.  The large is \"large\" and the deep dish is \"deep\"!  The dough/crust is very thick and bready like a deep dish should be.  The crust was perfectly crispy on the edges and had a distinct buttery taste. The toppings were fresh, tasty and plentiful.  It could easily feed 3-4 adults to their gluttonous satisfaction.  I have no idea what my wife ate I was too busy with my head buried in the trough.  

Value - When I mean value I mean when the quality/enjoyment of the experience meets with the cost of the experience.  My impression was the cost was a tad high. I'd say 15% to 20% more than a comparable eating experience.  However, I think it's a good value considering all the factors.  

Bottom Line - Go to BJ's!  It may be hard to get in during peak times for while but give it go.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  It's definitely a place I'd take out of town guest to show off Mentor, OH a little or to celebrate any special occasion."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch. I had the flat bread and soup. It was really good. Took awhile to get our food but other than that everything was good. Decided to get dessert and holy moly!!! This was crazy good. Be sure to get a dessert if you go!"}
{"text":"horrible service. mediocre at best food. there was a wait for a table last night at 9:30 at night and 3/4 of the restaurant was empty. our server completely didn't ask us if we wanted beer. I ended up going to the bar to get my friend his drink. avoid this location at all costs.  wish I could get a refund."}
{"text":"This was the first time trying the restaraunt.  We were seated promptly the waitress took our drink order and appetizers we tried the avocado eggrolls which were highly recommended but they  were bland and the  dipping sauce did not have much flavor. I tild the waitress that we were there to celebrate my daughter's bday.we ordered dinner but it took about 30 minutes before our meals got there. My steak was  overcooked and I was not offered steak sauce till I have done with dinner.we did order their cookies and ice cream. We still would have liked our free desert.overall I rate the restaraunt as average .disappointed"}
{"text":"BJ's has some great beer, and the food is not bad either. I know it's a chain, but it does exceedingly well for a chain. Probably one of the best out there. The Jerimiah Red beer is excellent, as well as the Piranah something or other.

If you go, try their thin crust appetizer pizza. But try it as a meal. It should be more than enough. If not, you can then fill up on beer."}
{"text":"We came out for dinner for a birthday.... Had to wait 50min to get seated and the after getting seated no waiter came for like 15min or so .... Waiter after wait pass and not nothing .... This place blows ... Should have just went to Applebee's..."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant a lot and the service is always fantastic. They have a server Marlee who always goes above and beyond to make sure we have a nice experience!! She is why we come back each week!"}
{"text":"This place usually never lets us down, it have great food, good ambiance and friendly staff! This last visit we waited quite a bit to get in probably 30 min, but I really like how they have the text option to let you know when your table is ready I think that's convenient. Service was great we have a very nice waiter, and you have to try the avocado egg rolls they are so delicious and that's honestly why we came we were totally craving them! But me and my boyfriend decided to get a tavern cut pizza as well it was called the crazy pig I believe, it was a pretty good size to share, the middle pieces where a bit soggy but we still enjoyed it, we also got a side of sweet potatoe fries which where good and crispy! We opted out on the pizookie because we were full but I totally recommend you try it all the way! My favorite is the salted caramel one and it's so delicious you will be addicted."}
{"text":"Very large menu, food is very good, prices are reasonable, service is excellent, had French Dip sandwich, very large sandwich and very good."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.....

I've been to BJ's many times in Northern California and it's a pretty good restaurant. Anyhow my sis and I were staying at Red Rock and wanted something other than a buffet/fastfood/$$$restaurant so we decided to come here. The food is pretty much the same across the board which is great because I hate inconsistency when it comes to chain restaurants. This restaurant has PHENOMENAL service. The hostess that sat us was very sweet and our server [whose name I'm unsure of] was AMAZING. She was attentive, sweet, and just a great server. We ended up getting a pitcher of beer, artichoke dip/bruschetta, nachos, and a parmesan crusted chicken entree all for under $60! 

Note: On the check it said our server was Cinnamon. Not sure if that's a birth-given name or a nickname... Cinnamon was the shit!"}
{"text":"I love the pizookie!!!! The cookies and cream is my favorite. 
I've been so sick and at midnight I start getting some appetite back, I really wanted a soup but where can I get one at midnight?  Luckily I don't live too far from this lovely restaurante and it was open till 1 am to order. I always have to have their tortilla soup. So I was glad I was able to get to go at 1am. What isn't there to love about this place?"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I had never been to a BJ's until I moved to Vegas last year and now I realize that they are not only on the west coast but spreading back east. Everything I've tried in the 6 or so visits has been delicious. From the deep dish pizza to the jambalaya, to the ribs, Pazookies... All very tasty! 

In the past, Cheesecake Factory would be my go to place for a large menu with a lot of great choices but BJ's has certainly replaced CF for me. Every time I leave, I cannot wait to go again. 

During my last visit, I was introduced to their mobile app which I can use to pay and earn rewards. I love user friendly tech additions so BJ's really won me over with this one. 

If you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price, definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"If I could give it less I would, huge alcohol order, waited 20+ minuets, brought half the food out, 30+ minutes for the rest, service sucks"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at BJ's Restaurant. We had a group of six and decided on BJs because  of the variety of entrees for everyone. I went online and put us on waitlist so when we got there the wait was only 10 minutes. 
Our waiter was great and had a lot of fun with our group. The food came out fast and was delicious. We had calamari and spinach dip for our appetizers and both was seasoned well. I had the double pork chop, Brussels sprouts, and mashed potatoes. The pork chop was huge so I split it and took some home. The chop was cooked perfectly but the sauce was just honey Dijon. Also if your not a beer drinker get the Libemans Fambroise it is sweet and light. Overall wonderful dinner with family and friends."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch here (I'd been here before for drinks and also for a work dinner), and BJ's did not disappoint. Every experience I've had at BJ's has been perfectly pleasant. 

They were very busy at lunchtime, but we were seated promptly. Our server was very friendly and attentive as well. I really appreciated the variety of lunch specials! There were lots of choices, from pizza to salads, to entrees. I got the BBQ platter, which came with a BBQ pork slider, a BBQ chicken breast, cole slaw and fries. The chicken was juicy and tasty. The slider was also pretty tasty, just messy. 

BJ's is a great Summerlin option for lunch. Casual and low key!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dinning at Bj's for my 1st time. A great place, excellent service, every member of the staff were all team player's helping each other out! The food was great and the desert was amazing, the strawberries were real fresh, not frozen!!!! As were finishing our desert which 1 came to our table late due to the people behind us claiming it was their's which we let that go, not their waitresses fault at all, (those people were a bunch of picky complaining folks to start with) We then had to listen to the wife who was sitting behind me ask for the manager, who came promptly to see what they needed, as this woman complained and complained and continued to complain about the service, food etc, I got sick to my stomach. Their waitress, just like the rest of the staff I saw working were busting butt to get everyone what they wanted or needed!!! That family left, I am sure they stiffed the waitress who in my option went above and beyond for this family of complainers!!!! It was the family that sat behind me that put a damper on the evening with my family! I will be going back again!!! Again the staff was amazing!!!!! Thank you all so much for a great dinner and desert."}
{"text":"It's like a new version of Fridays. Pick a few things and do then well instead of a lot of options where you do nothing well."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience in a long time. Ordered a Diet Coke while waiting for a friend. The soda was flat easy to see no carbonation why would the waitress even bring it out. She was not surprised when I told her. She said I'll get it from the bar.  Food was not good. We both order clam chowder only got one.  Had to wait 5 more minutes for the other soup and then got no crackers. Flatbread was crispy on the edges and the rest very soggy. Never had a soggy flatbread anywhere. My freind ordered a regular  salad  was wilted and looked like it was sitting around for hours.  She was not happy with it. Three different food runners stoped at are table trying to deliver food that was not ours. All of the staff were very unfriendly with the exception of the hostess who was very sweet.  Both my friend had GI distress after eating, we both had the same soup. I had downloaded the BJs app and asked the waitress about it and she don't ask me I don't know anything about it. I have since deleted it.  Will not be going back to BJ's. The other thing specials Monday thru Thursday why not on Friday??"}
{"text":"I don't personally love chain restaurants, but at least it's always consistent. Tonight we had avocado egg rolls (not as good as Cheesecake Factory) and an individual sized hand tossed pizza. They let us do half BBQ chicken and half spicy meatball. Some places don't let you do half and half if there are two different sauce bases (which is ridiculous, but I appreciate it even more when they do it).  Both were good, but the best thing is that we got Happy Hour prices even though we showed up at around 7:15! Our waitress told us that if the game is still on (its Thursday night football), the HH prices continue. Sweet!"}
{"text":"The beer was good. Wife's pizza was good. But they couldn't cook my burger mid well...twice. Manager comped mine and my wife's. Because of him we will be back to give it a round 2."}
{"text":"Came here around 8:30pm.....hardly wait for 10-15 min..server name Anthony helped us out....we were not so hungry so order just an appetizer one of my favorite \"avacado roll\" and \"mohito\"......service was good and food was good. ...will come back..."}
{"text":"Though chain restaurants are not much of my thing, I like this one because of the friendly service, the well-stocked bar and the wide beer selection from which you can order flights, and good food (tip: if you can't decide what to order and you like pizza, get the BJ's favorite!) served in generous portions. For sports buffs, the big screens are a big draw as well. The restaurant is one of the establishments on the periphery of the Chandler Mall, so location is convenient and parking is never a problem."}
{"text":"I had luncheon bleu cheese flatbread pizza and salad. Loved the flatbread and salad was tasty with variety lettuce not head lettuce.  Three of us shared a chocolate pizzooky and it was scrumptious. Nice environment and friendly waitress. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Even though the fine print on my coupon says I get a free appetizer if my check is $9.95 or higher my waiter stated that my personal total needed to be that high, not me and my boyfriends together. Which is insane. Obviously we are going to share the appetizer - just like we are going to share the check. 
He went in the back to check with the manager and came out less then a minute later with the same answer. 
Funny how the management/the waiter contradict the fine print in the coupon that Yelp puts out (that's right, I got the coupon from Yelp!)
So whatever, we will have some happy hour and go home. Really the only person that suffers is the waiter. We tip on what the bill would have been BEFORE discounts. Duh."}
{"text":"This maybe my favorite restaurant when it comes to chains. No matter what city I'm in, Bj's is consistent when it comes to quality in my experience. The Summerlin location is no different. We always have great service and drinks. I also love the fact that no matter what you're in the mood for, they're a something on the menu to satiate

I love the kale and Brussels sprout salad. I always add shrimp and although they're not generous with the shrimp it's an adequate serving. The vegetables in the salad are always fresh. I also like the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. Bite sized full of flavor and yumminess."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here  after walking  around  the  mall and having a beer and a bison  burger this place is really  done right good food and the beer is really  good, The ale is better  than pretty much all beer place's  around here."}
{"text":"Great service! My mom took my boyfriend and I here the other night to celebrate his birthday. We sat in a booth at the bar. Venue was very clean and had a cool industrial look to it. William \"bill\" was our server. He was very cool and professional. He took our drink orders first. I ordered the blood orange sangria, which was very tart until I put the cinnamon stick garnish into it, after that it tasted great! It was happy hour at the bar, so we ordered the California flatbread as an appetizer, which was delicious and portioned big enough for us to share! For dinner I ordered the \"super salad\" with flame broiled salmon which was AMAZING! The salmon had wonderful flavor and I loved all the different fruits and veggies in my salad. My boyfriend ordered a burger and my mom had the roasted Brussels and kale salad. They both enjoyed their meals as well! For dessert, my boyfriend had a mini chocolate chip pazookie, free for his birthday. Came with a birthday candle and smile from our server, thanks bill! And my mom and I shared half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip pazookie which was delicious! I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. Nothing special. The half-price appetizers weren't even worth half price five little ribs they look like they were made from a pigeon . The ahi tuna was lame . The salad didn't even look close to the picture. The pictures look great on the menu but don't be fooled by them. Taste was fine but very light and very thin on the tuna . I would not order it again.
Then when the bill came the half-price appetizer was naturally listed as full price"}
{"text":"Stopped in and got the two for special. We got two drinks, then ordered the ultimate pepperoni pizza with peppers, and the cookie dessert. 
All while getting to watch some sports at the bar. 

Although this place is just becoming as normal as a Chilli's or Applebee's the upside is there is no hipsters hanging out here."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was my first time here and I will definitely be back soon. Everything was great. Avocado egg rolls and spinach stuffed mushrooms were both a hit. I had to stop eating them to have room for my entree. The shrimp scampi was amazing! My sisters had the jambalaya and the baked ziti and they loved it too."}
{"text":"I love ordering from their small bites menu. I always order the Gourmet Mac & Cheese and the Fried Artichokes. The beer and cider drinks are really good as well.

The only disappointment would be the red velvet pizookie, to me it tasted like straight butterscotch. Red velvet is known to have chocolate inside."}
{"text":"I've had very bad luck at this location.  The most recent time I tried the \"call ahead\" reservation, gave my name, and time I'd be arriving.  They took my info an said they would see me soon.

I get to the restaurant, wait at the line to check-in.  The walk-up customer ahead of me was given a 50 minute wait time.  I give my name, they look up me, and tell me that I'd have a 45 minute wait time...whaaat????  I said I was on the call-ahead list, the girl says yes you are, 45 minute wait.  I ask what is the point of the call-ahead, she just shrugs and gives me a take-it-or-leave-it look, so we left.  Walked over to the blu-burger grill, walked in and was seated right away."}
{"text":"So bummed, when I got home after being away for work, the one place I wanted to go to for lunch was BJ's.  Our server Brian was awesome & helped us decide on a beer/cider mix for our celebratory cocktails.  Then we ordered 2 small pizzas.  The BBQ Chicken with extra cilantro & The BJ's Favorite, which comes with 3 meats, meatballs, pepperoni & Italian sausage.  I was most looking forward to the meatballs, we both love pepperoni but we're not big fans of the Italian sausage so we ordered it without that.  When we got the pizzas the BBQ Chicken was covered in celery, which to me is not complimentary to a bbq pizza, we were asked if we just wanted to eat it that way & I said no, since they weren't offering to make it the right way I just said take it off the menu.  After that pizza was taken away we went to eat our 2nd pizza  which my meatballs weren't on & we were told the chef decided not to put them on it because they might (or do) have Italian sausage in them.  This is so frustrating because there were 3 meats listed & we just didn't want one of them, if there were any questions we should have been asked, we never said we were allergic to sausage.  We weren't offered for this pizza to be redone properly either so we just said we'd eat it instead of sending it back to the kitchen & having it takoff our check.  The manager came by & apologized & gave us a free pizookie (which we already had an email for a free one) & our server ended up giving us a free one too.  In the end we were stuffed with dessert but left unfulfilled with a savory lunch.  Once we got home we wished we were just offered for both of our pizzas to be redone correctly & got one free pizookie for our troubles.  It's been a couple of days now & we're still bummed out that one of our favorite lunch places was such a disappointment.

2/15/18
We were contacted by Ray the General Manager & he's buying our next pizza, so happy he's making this right!"}
{"text":"Looooove bj's for many reasons, mainly the honey sriracha Brussel sprouts, happy hour will get you right, but their menu is so diverse and inexpensive that you can't deny yourself additional options that only a fool would miss out on! Can't wait till they bring back the carnita fries"}
{"text":"Came here for a cold beer and a small bite to eat.  The staff was friendly, beer ice cold and food was good.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the worst BJ's location I've ever been to, and I love BJ's food normally. The deep dish pizza was just not that good, and I normally think their deep dish pizza is a model of perfection. The crust wasn't really 'deep' and more like regular pizza crust. The toppings were pitiful - barely any sauce, practically no cheese, and very little of the toppings that were supposed to come with the pizza. I was so disappointed. The service is great but that doesn't really matter to me when the food they are bringing me is sub par. They have all day happy hour when games are on and the bar has a decent number of TV's with NFL Sunday Ticket but the food was too disapointing for me to go back."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and it was an excellent experience from entering to leaving. I had the Pot Roast sandwich and my wife, a Hamburger Patty Melt. Both were delicious, the service relaxed and a good value. Don't miss their brand of tap beer."}
{"text":"like all the  big corporate places there cutting costs so the food suffers the staffing suffers and in the end you suffer $$$$$ a lot more places to go too then this place"}
{"text":"so i went to BJs for a quick bite. i've never had it before. the first thing i noticed on their menu was something called a Pizzokie. a cookie in the shape of a pizza with ice cream as a topping. so i was intrigued. then i saw they had 120 items on the menu and started looking through what i wanted to eat. i settles for ribs because i had just had ribs at Virgil's and just knew i would have a bad rib experience twice in a row. so for a dollar and change more i could get a salad. so i got a caesar salad. the salad came... i had to ask fo plastic utensils because the silverware hey gave me was dirty. so i started on my salad.... all i could taste is Miricale whip..... IT WAS SOOOOO BAD !!!! 
then my ribs came ........ they literally cooked unseasoned ribs and just slapped some bbq sauce on them. they were sooooooo terrible. the customer service is AMAZING tho !!! that's why they got 2 stars ."}
{"text":"After a long day of work I decided take my family out for dinner. We decided to visit this location because even though there is a BJ's closer to my home this location offers better service. Our servers name was Heather and she ensured we received quality customer service. The restaurant was clean and our food was delivered promptly. I will continue to choose this location over Summerlin's as long as I continue to received outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very welcoming. I ordered a oasis amber beer that was perfect. I also ordered the top sirloin. The steak was just okay, I had to drown it in steak sauce to finish it. The one thing I found to be off putting was the tablet each waitress carries. I felt like I was giving my order to a fast food worker with no personality. I would return, but with lower expectations."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this location for the last several months since we moved over here. We won't be back. Walked into the restaurant around 9 PM (they don't close until midnight) to nobody on stand. After a few minutes, a host grabbed 2 menus & just sat us without saying anything. Our waitress seemed nice, took our order & the food came out about 20 min later. I didn't get the side of ranch I ordered, so I had to flag her down & didn't get it until my fries were cold. We also didn't get any silverware/napkins, so we had to flag her down again & then she brought ONE. She then came back about a minute later (after I took about 2 bites of my meal) & asked if we wanted dessert. I told her that we weren't sure since we just got our food. We didn't see her the rest of the time. Another waitress had to fill up my husbands water after he didn't have anything to drink for his whole meal. The different waitress then asked what we wanted for dessert & she seemed annoyed when I asked for a menu because we didn't know what there was. I'm shocked that the service was this horrible. The summerlin restaurant was PACKED (there was maybe 2-3 tables per waitress/waiter at this henderson one) & our service was way better at Summerlin. We were kind & didn't ask for much, so one star is all I can muster up for a $35 pasta & burger with all we dealt with. One star goes to the food that was actually really good. It's a shame that this is only a few minutes away, but we will go the distance so we don't leave angry again. It's not that hard to just be at least kind of nice & actually service basic needs when that's your job. Not sure what everyone's deal is here...they're all snoody or annoyed & it makes a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Went here today with the sis for a sit down lunch... service was quick & great, the atmosphere was clean & welcoming, and the food was superb! Started with a coconut refresher as we shared an order of crispy calamari and caesar salad.. then it was pasta for me and buffalo wings for her!  We even enjoyed a large piZOOKIE for dessert! Mmmm Aloha Friday to us!"}
{"text":"We came in just for dessert and coffee tonight. We Love the fact that you do individual cups of decaf coffee is fantastic! It was SO fresh and went really well with the Pizookie Sampler Desert! We chose the Salted Caramel Pizookie wth caramel cookie dough, almond toffee, pretzel bites and white and dark chocolate chips. Is is then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, caramel sauce and Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips. And then there was the amazing Triple Chocolate Pizookie. It was made with chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate. Topped with two scoops of Ghirardelli double chocolate chip ice cream and Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips. The Cookies and Cream Pizookie is made with a chocolate/Oreo flavored cookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream and a spot of mousse!! To-die-for good!! Love using our BJ's Rewards too! It's great having BJ's within walking distance from our condo! Then we can walk off those Pizookie's!"}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch and couple of beers at this popular chain restaurant in South Hills Village. I had stopped by there before once but it was packed, so I tried again at a non-peak hour and got a seat at the bar.

It's a large restaurant with high ceilings and just one big room. The bar area is at a side and the bar is against the wall, so there is just one row of bar stools as opposed to the layout where the bar has stools surrounding it on all sides. They have very nice quality screens behind the bar that were playing baseball. It's a good place for watching games if you get a seat at the bar. Screens, though, did not seem overly plentiful so I'm not sure I would characterize this as a sports bar. 

Service at the bar was very nice and the bartender gave me a couple of samples without my asking for it.  They have a selection of their own brews, about 10 or
so in different styles and I got an amber beer and then a double IPA. The beers were good but maybe not quite as distinctive as what I have got at some of the local breweries in this area. There's also a large number of taps for beers from other breweries if you don't want one of the in house beers. 

The menu is huge and I found a lunch section buried in it and decided to get a caprese sandwich, which had some different types of cheese and a basil flavor inside a rolled flatbread. It was decent for a light lunch. 

They have happy hour specials, but I didn't come at happy hour. Their happy hour has an early start, at 3:00, so it would be worth it to come in the late afternoon if you want a late lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"I love Bjs but both the waiters were snobby and not too friendly. When I asked for A small pizza she gave me a mini with four pieces that sounded alright and I thought these were big pieces but still I was not that hungry. Finally when we got our food My pizza looked like it came from the Pizza Hut inside of the target across the street. And it took them a good 20 minutes to get me my lemonade I've had better experiences with place. And you can never go wrong with their \"pozookies\"."}
{"text":"Pros
*The food was really delicious.  Everything we tasted was amazing.
*Their beer is pretty decent
*Their signature dessert is a giant cookie with ice cream.  And the cookie is still hot
*The staff was extremely friendly

Cons
*My entree was 1600 calories.  Even taking half of it home still resulted in a mega-portion of fat and sodium (I obviously didn't order from the skinny menu)
*The Pizookie (dessert cookie) had less fat and calories than my entree.  Since when is dessert the 'healthy' portion of the meal
*The timing of our meal was off completely - our appetizer came out just seconds before our entrees and our dessert took another 20 minutes after ordering

We went for a late dinner on a Sunday.  The place was busy but not swamped.  Our waitress was a trainee and she had her trusty \"pro\" shadowing her.  We've all been a trainee before, and I think she did pretty well for a newbie.  The issue here is that at a few points during the evening the \"pro\" came over by himself and spoke with us.  I think it would be beneficial for the trainee to handle all situations instead of confusing the diners with multiple servers.

Somewhere along the way our meal timing got messed up.  The appetizer (poke - absolutely delicious) came out less than a minute before our entrees.  This led to that awkward situation where you try and eat the app as fast as possible so your meal doesn't get cold.  The poke was amazing, so not an issue.

While we were shoveling tuna into our faces, the manager came over.  He profusely apologized for the timing issue and said if we wanted to have a dessert he would pick up the tab on that.  Very nice, we thought, but not needed.  The timing thing wasn't really an issue for us, but it was a really nice gesture on the manager's part.

Please be warned that it's really tough to pick an entree at BJ's.  Their menu is extensive and everything sounds delicious.  The entrees we picked were both fantastic (Chicken Marsala and Tuscan Chicken Limone).  If ever there was a restaurant to not be a fat American, BJ's is it.  Take half home.  Their portions are large and should definitely not be consumed in one sitting.

Since the manager went out of his way to offer us the dessert, we opted for the peanut butter pizookie.  It's a warm peanut butter cookie, about 8\" across, with ice cream on top.  Everyone has an inner fat girl, and she's drooling at the sound of this.  And yes, it's that good.  Ignore the diet, forget about the bathing suit body, just eat the pizookie and enjoy it.

Overall, we had a decent experience at BJ's.  The food is really good, the staff is really friendly, and they seem to genuinely care about making guests happy.  The portions are pretty big, and there was definitely some awkward moments created by the staff, but I think we'll likely return."}
{"text":"Went in Friday night, the wait was 25-30 minutes which we expected. It took about 40 to be seated. I know it was a guess but still it took a while. The waiter was nice and the food was good. I've been twice since we moved to this side of town and service and food has been good. We will be back."}
{"text":"On our way out the the mall we were trying to decide where to stop and eat when we spotted this place and decided to stop in and check it out. They were pretty busy but we found a both in the bar area with no problems. Nice open space in the restaurant but it does get pretty loud. 

I had the Parmesan crusted chicken which came with cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli and my boyfriend had the french dip with fries. His french dip was good, nothing special about it. My chicken was good although the mashed potatoes could have been creamier and I could have used some more of the lemon Chardonnay butter sauce with my chicken, but overall the meal was good. Didn't have enough room for dessert, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Terrific atmosphere, lots of room to sit. Portions are on the smaller size for what they charge. Overall I reccomend giving them a try. They brew their own root beer which is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Just like every other restaurant....The Monday $5 margaritas were pretty tasty and had a different kick that was a perfect blend of sweet & tart & from what I was told a pretty decent beer selection. I did love the ambiance with the circular booths and brick walls. The service was quick and the server was friendly and attentive. The only real downfall was the price. It was $40 for happy hour which, considering the neighborhood, there are cheaper options that are just as good. I do want to go back and try the California take on Chicago pizza... growing up close to Chicago I'd call myself a pretty big critic on how good a Chicago pizza is & if the place can live up to my Midwest tastebuds I may have to give it more stars."}
{"text":"BJ's is my Go-To restaurant for ALL occasions!  They have great food, great ambiance, great service and cater to the night owls!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the service is the worst in town! We have gone twice just to see if it was a bad night, and the same lousy service was had! If you expect a meal under 2 hours, go somewhere else! They barely refill drinks, the waiter took 25 minutes to even take our order, it was absolutely awful!"}
{"text":"the place is casual, but it looks clean and classy, good place for drinks or food , has craft beer if that is your thing, only had appetizers, but the food looked great."}
{"text":"Menu has a good selection. Love the chicken and tortilla soup. Ahi salad good but could use a little more ahi for $15. Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has some great food. I haven't yet found anything on the menu that I don't like instantly. The pizza, the sandwiches, the appetizers, the desserts... all good. Despite this, my favorite item on the menu is definitely the Berry Burst Cider. I haven't yet found any other decent cider in the valley.

Atmosphere: good
Service: good

My only beef: I did once have the jambalaya and that simply left me wanting authentic Cajun."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised by how good my food was here and how nice the servers were.  On previous visits, my food was lackluster and service matched that ambivalence.  Hubby and I wanted some calories NOW as we just finished a gnarly hike an hour prior.  He wanted a place to chill, enjoy a beer, and eat some comfort food.  Since BJ's was kinda sorta on our way home, we decided to check it out again.  I'm glad we did.  Hubby's steak salad was all that he wanted and my turkey burger and wedge fries hit the spot.  Service was nice and friendly.  I was amused to note that the staff who brought our food to our table assumed the \"chick\" ordered the salad.  HA HA.  NO.  I may be fun-sized, but I can put away a LOT of food, especially after a long day hike.  :)

We enjoyed our calorie-induced coma whilst watching the Super Bowl on the many TV's in the restaurant.  It wasn't too crowded at all; I think most people were watching the game at home.  Great way to end a great hike."}
{"text":"Well...... it's been two months since I last wrote a review about BJ's and I must say it was worth the wait. We stopped in Friday the 29th for dinner and I must say, everything was fantastic!  The greeters were pleasant and out preferred waitlist app worked well and out table was waiting when we arrived. Our server Nicole was one of the best I've ever had. Always there to refill a drink or remove a dish that was no longer needed and just a pleasant person that made you feel at home.  Everyone in our party was very pleased with their dinner selections and my roasted double pork chop was, without question, the best pork chop on earth!  We can't wait to return for another great dinner."}
{"text":"On 8/31/17, friends we hadn't seen in over 3 years wanted to take us out. We chose BJ's because even though they are a little pricey, the food has always been good. Not sure what happened but the experience was not what we anticipated. I ordered chicken cobb salad (how can salad get screwed up?). Not sure if it was the dressing, lettuce or cucumber but tasted like it had been doused with bad cologne. My gut still wrenches at the thought. Didn't complain because didn't want to embarrass friends, and they were buying. Just packed up what was left, took it home and threw it out. Husband ordered spaghetti which he said was extremely dry. He didn't want to complain for same reason as me. If I was paying that salad would've been sent back! I'll give you one more chance BJ's. Don't disappoint me."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The food was mediocre.  Ordered calamari appetizer, it was burnt. Tried the deep dish pizza, was okay, completely forgetable.  Tried the four beer flight, nothing stood out and the red ale is near undrinkable. The service was borderline bad. Stood in line, when I finally got to the front, somehow the hostess missed me and helped the party behind me instead. My best guess is she thought I was with their family. Our waitress was okay, she was always on the run, didn't have any recommendations. She was really just going through the motions

My whole experience was \"meh\". Much better choices in the area. Glad I tried it, probably will not go back."}
{"text":"BJ's is close to home so I go frequently. Always friendly staff and I've never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I tried their Pumpkin Ale Beer last night it was really good! Pizza was good!"}
{"text":"This place has a ton of positive vibe energy! We got there and the hostess's were very friendly; we got sat down right away even on a busy Friday night, and our servers were amazing! We started with the avocado egg rolls-delish! they had just the right crispiness.  We also had the BJ's mojito which was amazeballs. It wad a perfect mix of sweet and tart, and you could taste the feint strains of fresh basil in every sip. Then we had the tickled pink, and also a watermelon margarita, again perfect. Our main entrees were the jambalaya, and the fish and chips, the fish was perfectly battered, and tasty, the jambalaya was super delish with fresh roasted tomato, and fantastic seasoning. Overall a perfect dinner, one of the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now for lunch and both times have been great! Both in the dining room and seated at the bar we have had great friendly service. The memu selection is huge! I haven't stopped raving about the Tomato amd Mozzarella salad since I had it! Also, as strange as this may sound,  the Hot Ham and cheese sandwich is the best I've ever had! The alfredo sauce on it gives it a unique twist and it really works! 4 stars only because my friend was brought the wrong food but they fixed the problem immediately and efficiently. Mistakes happen and we understand that! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have found our new go to spot. I really enjoyed the quality of food and coo prices. Amber was our server, if you love great service request her section. She is on her job I love how she anticipates what you need before you have requested there was never a moment where I had to wait for her to come back she visited our table at least 10 times and it wasn't annoying it was perfect. I'm not the easiest to impress when eating out. I'm big on customer service and this girl was the cake's topping. Thanks Amber for making our experience wonderful"}
{"text":"BJ's is one of my favorite places to eat.  Their pizza, sandwiches, and pasta dishes are all awesome.  The drink selection is great.  I've never had bad service here."}
{"text":"Artichoke and spinach dip was amazing! The house hot wings perfect! The brisket bacon burger, wow! I could not save room for my piezookie however I have had one before and no words can describe the gumminess! App is awesome! Atmosphere just right! Staff is great! Joe never left us without a refill."}
{"text":"My friend is visiting town from Germany so we decided to try this place out, my roommate is quite a fan of bj's and it was my first time. As soon as we sit down the waitress brings our menu's, and my friend promptly asks for the beer menu when the server replies with an, \"Are you even old enough?\" I didn't pick up on any sarcastic humor there, and to me that is offensive to just assume that he is not of age. It is one thing to ask for id but to blatantly state that she does not think he is of age is another. He then provides for her his german identification card which she has to go approve with the manager. 

We proceed to order a bowl of soup and a few appetizers to start out with, both were very delicious. Actually one of the better bowls of clam chowder i've had in a while. We then place our order for our food I ordered a small 11\" hand tossed pizza, which i said exactly like that, my roommate orders a chicken club, and our friend orders just some shrimp tacos. 2 out of 3 of the orders come out wrong. My roommate has a very sensitive stomach and her sandwich (chicken club) some how has green chiles on it. Which is not noted on the menu so she promptly asks them to take it off. My order came out as a 9\" DEEP DISH pizza. Which was completely the wrong style of pizza i ordered. Our waitress comes out and says that \"I ordered a small and hand tossed doesn't come in small\" so she gave me a deep dish...? The hand tossed does come in an 11in size which is what I said when I ordered so I do not appreciate her trying to blame me for her mistake in the order. I told her I don't want it i'm no longer hungry at this point when she urges me to box the pizza up. The manager comes to the table, and In my experience managers are usually apologetic. However the first thing she says when she comes to our table is \"So whats the problem\". We explained our problem and she \"fixed it\" by taking our orders off the bill. Whatever. Probably won't be trying this place again anytime soon."}
{"text":"BJ's is one of those places that you go when you want something dependable, somewhat tasty and with something for everyone in your party.  This BJs hits all of those marks, AND manages to be the best one of the chain that I have been to.   Here's what put it over the top compared to its brethren. 

- Quick service.   I have never had my food out that quickly in a busy restaurant.  And everything was cooked correctly!  
- Awesome service!  Our waitress was extremely personable and professional.  

My personal favorite item is the chicken pita tacos, but the burgers are great as well!  Pizza is actually my least favorite item but is also still quite yummy.  A pizzokie  is a required desert item."}
{"text":"Went in there a couple days ago with my wife and 2 boys. Nick was our server. This guy was OUTSTANDING very attentive and his suggestion were spot on.  We go here about once a month but this is the first review I write for BJs because of Nick being a good guy and great server! Thank you for taking care of us we will be back. BBQ pizza is the best and Kids love the bazooka."}
{"text":"Always happy with their food when dining in. A couple of issues when ordering delivery online but management has always rectified it. Their prices are great, especially happy hour. Great selection of beers. We have had a bunch of different items off their menu and they've all been great."}
{"text":"5-star Happy Hour!  We had a bunch of beverages and a bunch of food for 35 bucks!  Can you believe that?  The bartender...I think his name is Geoffrey...took great care of us.  

Next time we need to leave room for a pizookie.  

That Harvest Hefeweizen is so good it took me back to old Bavaria AND made me blaspheme.  Now that's a great beer!  We always enjoy stopping in at BJ's."}
{"text":"Spontaneous unusual Tuesday dinner out for us tonight.  Surprised at prompt attention and EXCELLENT service from 'John'...
One bison burger for him and for me the fish tacos.  Way decent and found the cheese curds so good thanks to John...only 6.50 for delicious appetizer.  Left fat and happy after divulging on the Pizooki!  Half white macadamia white chocolate and the chocolate chip... yikes!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Although I was contacted by customer service and offered a gift card to return in hopes of a better experience - which of course I accepted - they never actually sent the gift card. It would have been better for them to never even offer, if they had no follow through plans. Now I not only had a less than impressive experience at the restaurant, but now I also have a poor impression of their corporate office as well."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh disappointed.  I gave an extra star for service.  They aren't really lacking there.  I would frequent a BJ's in the Bay Area, excellent!   I can't eat the food here.  There is nothing good about it.  Avocado egg rolls, very bland and could use a better sauce maybe?  He ordered a steak salad took a bite then did not eat it.  The only thing half edible was the margarita pizza, which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food.  I usually order the pazookie which is my favorite.  My food was so disappointing I decided to skip the dessert to go somewhere else. When you joke around about going to the closest fast food joint after dinner... It can't be good?  Try the restaurant most adjacent that place even is better than this."}
{"text":"Its lunchtime, I walk in with two other people and seated right away by the very gracious hostess.  We then to proceed to sit there for 15 minutes with no water, no drinks, no waitress.  I watched two of them stand by the booth they congregate at, then two waitresses walk by to other tables and take orders one of those being a couple who arrived after we did.  I am always more patient at lunch because I understand its busy but it was not busy at all.  We finally got up and walked out, went next door to PF Changs and had a really nice lunch.  Pathetic!"}
{"text":"I have been to the locations in Columbus, OH several times. I was very happy they opened in Mentor. Great atmosphere, Great Service, Great Food. The price point is right on target for the quality of the food..Fantastic"}
{"text":"Thanks for the fast, friendly service - clean and my table was bussed promptly. You're not sitting there having coffee after your meal staring at your lunch dishes on your table. Otherwise, it's your typical BJs."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely terrible .... bartender was \"deathly ill\" who was making our drinks ..  Yeah, because that's comforting to hear.. .. but despite whatever kept the kitchen so so long to make our appetizer and cause multiple waitress to check on us, Hope was the best. She was really kind and sweet and friendly. I'll come back only because of her.. . ."}
{"text":"Not impressed..  Have been here twice food is average service is horrible.  After downloading the app to sign in on the waiting list we got there about 25mins later check in with the desk and still had to wait an hour after watching several people being seated before us that walked in after us another bust for Mentor restaurants.."}
{"text":"This place is freaking great. Huge menu. Like 6-7 pages full. From pizzas, pastas, huge beautiful salads, fried calamari, steaks, sandwiches, any kind of beer wine or mixed drink you could want. I could go on and on. Very modern and fancy looking inside. Good day or night. Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"Very good food and very friendly staff.  Good service.  I had the Parmesan Chicken and it was delicious.  Very generous portions."}
{"text":"Here's a follow up review. My son and I went to see the USA Soccer Team at the stadium last month. Prior to the game, we had lunch again at BJ's. We kind of went in like secret shoppers with no mention of our previous visit. Our server was great, the food was awesome and more importantly, the general manager April is a text book example of excellent customer service. Well done."}
{"text":"Everyone is always so nice here and even better....THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PIZZA!  It's so delicious, I may or may not have eaten it twice in one week.  No judging.  They have a great drink menu and Tuesdays wine is 1/2 off at the bar.  I ordered food to go recently and the host on the phone was SO nice and had great manners.  I think his name was Dylan.  If I had a company, I would steal him away!  Bartenders, hostesses and waiters are always friendly and helpful.  Love this neighborhood spot!!!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a fun place, cool decor and great beer selection, but a few minutes into the enormous menu and the chain restaurant feel took over. The deep dish pizza tasted a bit like Pizza Hut which was disappointing, and they \"ran out\" of tomatoes for my wife's pizza, (no tomatoes at a pizza place, huh?) Consider it a classy Applebee's and check your expectations at the door.  There are better Pizza options in Henderson and drinking around a bunch of kids isn't cool.  Doubtful I'll return."}
{"text":"Huge menu with several different food categories to choose from. Great beer selection including BJ's exclusive, local favorites, and common options. All the prices are surprisingly reasonable. I've been to a BJ's in San Bruno, CA a few times and this one in the South Hills certainly stacks up to one of the originals."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las vegas from out of town and try to venture off strip. This was so enjoyable to us, we went twice in 6 days. We found the service very good on 1st trip, and adequate on 2nd trip,but the 2nd trip was very busy for them so I assume service level is dictated by how much the staff has to handle. Wife loved the free refills of house made sodas and I ejoyed the house porter & stout. Food quality above avg for a chain and we truly enjoyed the calif chicken sandwhiches and side salad upgrade was a nice feature. Surprisingly alot around us ordered Pizza- in a town full of pizza. I should think stick to bar style foods here. I would return if I`m in the area or find a BJs elsewhere would gladly stop"}
{"text":"I'm kind of in the middle with BJs Brewery I like to go here for lunch every once in a while. Overall the atmosphere is what tends to bring me back its very inviting and relaxing. The food is good I really enjoy their Santa Fe spring rolls as an appetizer, the pizzas are always up to par and lets not forget their skookie they have for dessert yumm!!!  I also love that they have pear cider on tap here where many other places I'm lucky if they serve it at all. Overall its worth stopping in and giving it a try."}
{"text":"The food was probably a 3 star, but the service and the price were definitely a one star deal.  I think if the server had deigned to crack a smile (Adam I think) his face would have broke.  And it was so overpriced it wasn't funny.  $9 for a mediocre margarita, are you kidding me?     We ended up spending like $50 for lunch, what a bunch of bs.  Would never go back unless unless someone else was paying."}
{"text":"I'm going to start frequenting BJ's more, because I had forgotten how delicious their beers were! Since moving to Vegas I haven't gone to BJ's much because there are so many other options when dining out. If you're a beer lover, this place is a must try because they are as much of a microbrewery, as they are a restaurant. Sometimes if they're promoting a certain beer, your server may even offer you a sample. Or if you're not sure what to get, opt for a flight of \"samples\".

When it comes to food, BJ's is comparable to Yardhouse or other mid-range bar/grill type places. I typically go for a couple of their small plates, which are tapas sized appetizers, to start off and my favorite is the mini-bruschetta. On my most recent visit, I also tried the new corn fritters w/ bacon aioli and an order of their traditional wings, which are pieces of fried chicken with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch. The food is always fresh...the only issue I've had is that sometimes they deliver food to the wrong table because your server is never the person who brings out the food...not sure why that is because that is typically why each table is assigned a server isn't it? 

The burgers, flatbreads, pizza, and appetizers here are all usually pretty tasty and sometimes I have no idea what I want to order. If you come Mon-Fri during lunch, there's a lunch specials menu you can order off of with pretty decent pricing...I think it starts at $6.95, but I've never tried it so I'm not sure what the portions are like.

The staff here at this location are nice and continuously stop by to check on you. If you're seated in an area where the server is busy, another server will often stop by and introduce themselves and put in your drink order so that you're not just sitting around like an idiot. I like that. They also have a rewards program but sadly you don't get points/credit for alcohol/beer! 

This BJ's is always packed when I'm here in the evenings and I can see why! The bar area is nice with both tables and barstools, and many large TVs, making it a good place to watch sports as well. I will be coming back a lot more in the future, even if it's only for beer!"}
{"text":"We've been looking forward to coming here for awhile and finally did with my mother in town from PA. Unfortunately,  it was a let down from the start. As the host was figuring out where to seat us another host comes up and said \"Seat them with.. oh he was cut?! What the fuck\" As a server & host for Cheesecake Factory I found it extremely inappropriate to say literally infront of 5 guests, 1 of which was my 10 year old daughter! I was extremely unimpressed with the food, especially the chicken lettuce wraps, calamari had to be recooked since it was soggy & the cheese bites were wayyyy too salty. Only positive was we had a nice,  large booth and the drinks were good. Server Jackie was slammed, over whelmed and did her best but forgot about my daughters dessert. At that point, I was just ready to leave. Would not recommend or return sadly. Save your money, there are much better options in Centennial or worth the drive to Cheesecake Factory"}
{"text":"Bry is awesome server!! 

Greeted us right away and even letbus move to a booth! (: 

Ordered our beers right off the bat and menu knowledge was strong. They got here quick and mmmmm berry cider brewed in house is to die for!!

Ordered stuffed mushrooms and they were the best stuffed mushrooms I'd ever eaten EVER!!! 

NEXT the tomato salad with yummi mozzarella balls and fresh tomatoes!! 

And to finish the ahi ahi salad was so great!! Only.problem was I some how managed to get the whole glob of wasabi in one bite and just about died hahah. Next time no wasabi!!

Over all bry was awesome and Justin another server also checked in on us(; they both rock. Thanks for an awesome time guys!!"}
{"text":"We're regulars here because the food and service are consistently fantastic. Everyone is helpful and friendly, and the restaurant is very clean. It's kid-friendly but not crazy. Great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first night at BJs and it was amazing. I had the grilled chicken stuffed potato.  My kids had the deep dish pizza.  Of course they loved the dessert. Who can resist ice with ice cream on top?!  I will def go back again."}
{"text":"I like to consider my family and I regulars at this place. My dad loves the brews here and I'm a sucker for their pizzas. The staff has always been really friendly and nice!

Don't get their entrees. They look nothing like the pictures and proportions are very deceiving.


If you ever do come with a coupon just always assume the worst. You're not going to get a good deal in fact you probably will spend a lot more. Came in with a buy one get one, and they state it has to be the cheapest one even though it says it nowhere on the coupon. \"Restaurant policy\"."}
{"text":"Not a fan of restaurants that try to deliver food to different tables three times (by different servers), can't get all the food out on time, or make food entrees without ingredients. I could forgive one of those things but when the back of the house AND front of the house can't get it together there are problems. I'm not from Pittsburgh but I won't go to the location that is near my house."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit today! Celebrated my daughters bday and grandkids like the food as well!!! 
Good service and food was great! We will be back. Thank you"}
{"text":"So I'm in Vegas trying to figure out where to eat with my brothers. So my brother Tim suggest BJ'S. I said sure we've never been there before let's try it out.  We drove to the place and low and behold we have one in Westminster but I've never been. 
  There menu is huge with a very wide variety.  My family tried the clam chowder bread bowl and the bowl was the best one I've ever eaten. Next we tried the baked Mac n cheese. Again so good, super cheesy packed with bacon bits. For our entree we had deep dish pizza which my wife like but I did not care for.
Pretty much enjoyed the whole experience and the food. Had a good time hanging out with family. 
If you get a chance check out Bj's I think you'll enjoy it very much.
  much. It's not the best but its not the worst. i cant wait to try the one in westminster,co after my trip."}
{"text":"BJ's is a surprising little gem in the world of big box restaurants. I've never had a bad meal there and the food is high quality, delicious and even (gasp!) healthy.

The first time my friends wanted to go there for dinner and drinks, I remember being unsure - after all, we live in a city with amazing local chef-inspired food options, and BJ's chain restaurant style seemed a little...boring for dinner. I mean, a name like BJ's does not inspire confidence that you'll be receiving a high-end meal. But boy was I wrong. There is a reason people from coast-to-coast rave about this place.

I ordered the Peruvian shrimp bowl the first time I went, and was amazed at how healthy and delicious it was. Filled with a generous amount of shrimp, sauteed spinach and mushrooms, the bowl was utterly satisfying. But what really blew me away was the appetizer I ordered - an ahi tuna poke. The tuna was perfectly  flavored and melted in my mouth. I had a couple friends who are non-sushi eaters try it and they were thrilled that they liked it as well. For them, BJ's was a safe place to try something new.

I've been back several times and I usually order something healthy like the Peruvian quinoa and salmon bowl or their Twisted BLT salad. But I confess to stealing a bite or two of their deep dish pizza (delicious) and trying a mini pazookie (divine). I can also recommend their burgers (cooked to perfection) and their wide variety of appetizers and sides.

I know that usually with a menu this broad and deep there are shortcuts made in the kitchen (like a lot of frozen stuff) but if they are taking any of these cuts I haven't tasted it yet at the dining table. Everything we've ordered has been fresh and flavorful. I highly recommend BJ's for a night (or afternoon) out."}
{"text":"Why give BJ's a Star? Other day went for lunch and I didn't like menu. Im not particularly picky but the prices and smallness of dishes wasn't worth it. So I stared at menu wondering ? I'll just try 1 thing& I had calamari . I love Calamari but BJ's was like they dipped gum bands in batter- tough & they must be frozen tasted that way. I never ate her before and won't be back! I left and had a great lunch at bonefish at least there it's fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow BJ's is better - *way* better than I remember. And their happy hour is pretty ridiculously good, too. You're even allowed to add up to 8-9 toppings to a happy hour personal pizza ($6-ish) or pick a specialty pizza to represent your pick. What a deal!

Super attentive service. Makes you want to invest in a franchise, but all of these are corporate-owned, just like Panda Express is. That must the secret to consistency and stellar, no-excuses service! Our drinks (iced tea, beer and more beer) were never down to a 1/3rd of a glass. :)

It's no wonder this is many people's \"favorite restaurant\" when asked to state one. I certainly wouldn't want to be the Olive Garden next door (which does well, too) or any other establishment sharing the same parking lot.

If you haven't tried BJ's in a long time, go. Certainly go instead of to Grimaldi's or to the Cheesecake Factory or even to Dom DeMarco's pizzeria for that matter. It's just so spot on it's hard not to compare. Everything that comes out of their kitchen is super solid, and they won't hesitate to make things right if they're not!"}
{"text":"The wait is way too long for everything. We went for Family Sunday dinner. The waitress Samantha had the worst rude attitude like she was bothered and irritated. She made us feel so uncomfortable. We never received our Caesar Salads. When we told her about it she said well she put the order in for it. Didn't receive the au jus for the prime rib had to ask twice and finally got it and the helper said she was just helping don't know anything about it. I had to ask for the manager and he apologized and didn't charge for dessert. Not once did Samantha apologize for all of the mishaps and only placed blame on others. We heard the table next to us verbally upset their orders were wrong. She brought us to go boxes in case our salads ever showed up. Really? Never going back. Going to FireRock from now on."}
{"text":"Salmon was excellent and so was the pizza cooked perfect and the service was amazing thank you bjs"}
{"text":"I like the Jeremiah Red beer at BJs. Just ordered the Sante Fe Spring Rolls. They are always good. Not too long of a wait to get in. Sit at the bar and get discounts on your beer and apitizers. Comfortable place. My wife loves the salad. Go to BJs. And of course the pizza is great."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 3 years now and the food is always amazing, service is great, and I leave feeling fat and happy. Never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Came here again after the line was too long at the buffet at red rock.

Ordered the AYCE soup and salad for 6.95. what a fantasic deal. There was choice of broccoli and cheese, clam chowder, tortilla soup and chicken noodle. 

Brocoli and cheese is the cheesiest soup i\"ve ever had, hands down. no joke. order it and youll see what i mean. The tortilla soup they do in this weird way but it works. They bring the chicken, and stuff in the soup bowl but with no sauce. they then at your table pour the sauce onto the dish which leaves the torilla chips in it super crunchy. its delicious. also, its a nice touch that they add avocado and a lime inside for a bit of a kick. The caesar salad is okay, nothing special. Its yummy but i ordered only one. Of the soups i ordered then both again. 

For our daughter we order chicken tenders and fries. The chicken was actually a great portion. three large golden crispy tenders that came with two dipping sauces. ranch and honey mustard. the honey mustard was delious but the waitress said its bottled. FYI she says the only sauce they make fresh themselves is the vinegarette. The fries were pretty good. They are super thin but it just meant they got cold uber fast. no bueno. My daughter really liked them.

The service was impeccable. Our waitress was named Brittney and she was one of the best waitesses Ive ever had. She made light conversation saying she had a one year old as well. She even asked if while we waited would Leilah like some oranges. She brought a little dish with them in it to keep her occupied while we waited. Awesome. Moms FTW!"}
{"text":"So yea, one star. First visit wasn't so bad. it's a typical bar that has okay food. Pizza is decent. Lots of beer to choose from. First time didn't quite count because we went opening week. Second experience however was horrendous. Worst waiter we've ever had. I've never had anyone give us attitude and judgmentally criticize everything we asked. If my wife wasn't starving and we didn't have a movie to catch we would have just gotten up and left. Hopefully you have a better experience but there's plenty of other bars that have better food with much better service out there. I also sent them a complaint through email and haven't had a response yet. So they must not care. If you're looking forward to being belittled by all means try this place out."}
{"text":"Make a reservation and still wait an hour past reservation time. Overpriced ordinary food. Drinks were overpriced. Everything is overpriced. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple of times, so this review is a summation of those visits. I have tried a couple of things from the light menu and a couple of salads not on the light menu. The light deep dish pizza is OK. It's an individual size pizza with grilled veggies. It's just OK. They don't smother the thing in cheese, which is probably the easiest way to keep the calories on this item under 600. I've also tried a chicken dish from the light menu. It was unremarkable. As far as regular salads go, the steak salad is OK, as is the seared ahi salad. The ahi salad is probably the best thing I've tried. My wife has been more diverse: she's had one of the baked potatoes (meh) and the spaghetti (also meh). It's not that the food is bad here, it's just unremarkable. We'll go back. My kid likes the place and there are plenty of things I haven't tried yet. One of these days I will actually try one of their beers (hard to mess that up)."}
{"text":"I've just come back from my second visit to BJ's and I'm STUFFED! I love the food and drink here-you just can't go wrong with this menu. The deep dish crust on the pizza is still amazing and this time we tried their chocolate chunk pazookie-nom nom nom!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in for happy hour for a drink and food. I was disappointed in the \"happy hour\" specials-only $1 off drafts and $2 off select appetizers. With appetizers averaging $9+ it wasn't much of a deal. Instead I ordered the ahi salad which was delicious however the ahi portion was also weak.  $15.50 for a salad and I expected a better ahi portion size. 
Service was great in the bar area which was appreciated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just went here today for the first time. We started off ordering drinks and appetizers. I had an Alabama Sunset and my boyfriend had a Jeremiah Red beer. They were both delicious! For appetizers I ordered us the crisp potato skins and he ordered the deep fried artichoke hearts for himself. Both appetizers were amazing. The potato skins had a wonderful crisp and tasted incredible with their ranch dip or sour cream. My boyfriend also thoroughly enjoyed his artichokes! They had a very nice texture, and tasted great! 

Since we hadn't been there before, our waiter offered my boyfriend a beer sampling. My boyfriend says all of their beers that he tried were fantastic, but the Jeremiah Red was his favorite.

For our entrees I had the chicken fettuccine alfredo and my boyfriend ordered the country fried steak burger. Both meals were delicious, although I could have used a tad more broccoli in my pasta.

Our waiter had told us about an offer on the restaurant's app where you can get a free pizookie when you create an account. My boyfriend and I both signed up, and each got a free dessert! The pizookies are so delicious and warm and taste amazing with the ice cream melting on them. I ordered the double chocolate (which also has chocolate ice cream, so more like triple chocolate) and I could not have been more satisfied. Tasted great with my Alabama Sunset as well! My boyfriend ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie and he loved it. He says it was the perfect dessert to go with dinner.

Overall the atmosphere was very nice. The lighting was perfect, and it wasn't loud despite the dining area being pretty full. 

Our waiter's name was Darin. He was SO SWEET and attentive! He made us feel very comfortable and we appreciated his opinions and suggestions very much, as we were new to the restaurant. He came around the perfect amount and was very caring and attentive to us, but not overly so. He was a real pleasure. 

Would totally recommend overall, and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place does not need to exist.

Period."}
{"text":"Yum! I love BJs! Their deep dish pizza is my absolute favorite. I'm always impressed with their food and how big their menu is."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to BJ's. The menu has a little something for everyone including wings, salads, pasta, burgers, and some \"lighter\" selections. Everything we ordered was good, although nothing to write home about. Overall it's a great place to grab some food and a beer for a quick date or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"When we walked into the restaurant we were never greeted. We waited almost 8 minutes until a very unfriendly host asked how many. Once we were seated, we were again not greeted by our waiter who threw menus down on the table before even saying a word. At that point we already knew we just wanted dessert. we ordered our food and the waiter very sarcastically corrected my order, which was entirely unnecessary since it was plain as day as to what I wanted. We waited nearly 30 minutes for our food, and as soon as it came out he handed the food to us with our check without even asking if we wanted anything else. We waited another 15 minutes after we were finished eating just for him to get done talking to his coworker and pick up our check. He didn't even acknowledged our presence, swiped our card and then thought it was be a great idea to be somewhat friendly to us just so he'd get a tip. As we left, we again saw the unfriendly host and another worker chatting, therefore, we also were never acknowledged on our way out either. These may seem like little details, but as a paying customer who also worked in the restaurant business those small details matter the most."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service, save yourself the aggravation and skip this place. The waitress never came back to see if we wanted anything else to drink nor did she check on us once our dinner was served. My husband had to leave our table and chase after her to get more drinks for us. I informed the manager and he said i should have told him earlier,  how could i get his attention, never saw him going around checking on his own customers, couldn't get the waitress to wait on me, how would i have got the managers attention. Place is not worth going to."}
{"text":"Bad!  Bad service, bad food.  Sucked up hair through the straw of my water! Ordered a beer with the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos.  Waiter disappeared and brought the warm draft beer 30 minutes later and still charged me for it!  The yogurt sauce in the pita tacos was curdled and sour!  Had the waiter take it off the bill.  Manager asked if I wanted another order?  ARE YOU KIDDING?!  Shove it in your Pizookie!!"}
{"text":"Cool. Nice selection of drinks and food. It's an ale house so take it with a grain of salt when you see others complaining about the menu. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Today was the standard 1st day of school dinner for my son and I. As usual most of the food was great (mahi/shrimp tacos, and stuffed mushroom appetizer) but my sons chicken tenders and fries were just ok. They literally came out 3 minutes after I ordered them but they weren't up to typical BJs standard. Shame on me for ordering from the kids menu. The berry cider was decent but I sure do miss the pear cider, I'll live. Amy was our server and she was great, she was fast, friendly and anyone would be lucky to have her as their server. Oh and unless the food is horrendous I don't complain I just don't order it next time or I don't go back. I'm not a \"talk to the manager\" kinda gal. I've been here a ton of times and I've just about filtered out what's good and what's not. Just remember that you can't go wrong on Mondays when a large pizza is half off!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you get. Some of the wait staff seems a bit flighty.. had to order my drink 3 times before she finally brought it over."}
{"text":"Exceptional menu. They have everything from soup to nuts. Be prepared to be amazed at the number of choices on the menu. It's a fun environment. Their homemade soda is fantastic.  A perfect gathering place for a family meal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and her mother brought me here for dessert one afternoon after stopping by the new casino nearby. Out server, Nadia, was excellent. She was friendly, took orders quickly, and brought us refills of our drinks periodically. 

The restaurant itself was crowded, but ordered and managed well by the staff. This is what set BJ's apart from other restaurants in my mind. They handled the chaos without becoming rude or having visible difficulties. 

Overall, my dessert was spectacular (I had the double chocolate cookie with Ghirardelli's chocolate ice cream) and the service was great. I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this BJ's location. 4-stars!"}
{"text":"Everything I eat here is good..Service is good kind friendly staff.. Always busy but thats why.. Clean bathrooms.. Great cheese curds my favorite dish is there Cherry Glazed Salmon.. Got to try it..love love there Chicken Tortilla Soup the bomb!!!! awesome waiter Curtis was on it all nite.."}
{"text":"All I can say is finally, finally I have found ribs I can just clean the bones. Great great baby back ribs. Love this place. Soooo much to choose from. Passed this place for years. Not anymore. Choose this place on Grub Hub. Ordered 3 times in the first week. Great food. With just take out. I can't wait to take my family. My husband works out of the  country, BJ's will be our 1st stop from the airport in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal this evening at Bj's. We make a point to go on Tuesdays for the wine specials. They have a good selection at half off. Our hostess greeted us warmly and really took time to seat us in an area that we preferred. Our server Ryan was top notch. Poured our wine with the skill of a sommelier. He was, accommodating. Checked on us throughout the meal without being intrusive. Genuinely kind person!!! It's a busy place  to be sure but the staff treat you Well!  The salmon was nicely seasoned and grilled right. The kale and Brussels sprout  salad is my favorite. They have hearty selections and terrific healthy selections too. Try it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Soooo disappointing. We get pizza pretty much every Friday night from one place or another and I thought oh let's try BJ's...bad idea. Ordered a large BJs Favorite pizza. Don't do it people! Other food I've eaten there has been pretty good and I've had pizza there before but when it comes to take out just expect to get a lot of dough in a carton. Check out the pics. Do you see any cheese? Any sauce? Look at that one slice with two slices of bell pepper. Wow. Nice job BJs. $30 was wasted on this horribly made pizza."}
{"text":"$3 PizookieTuesdayssss, whaaaat?!@!! And half off wine It has been over 5 years since I've eaten here and honestly it wasn't too bad. 

We had a party of 7 lol. Family dinner night! Our table ordered...
Mahi Mahi tacos. You can choose between fried or grilled topped with some cabbage, pico de gallo and i think it's some kind of aioli. De-lish!

My love got fish & chips and the couscous macncheese. Fish was pretty good. Batter just a hair too much for him BUT that couscous was really good! Who would of thunk?? Couscous mac.

Garlic chicken pesto pizza. G-double O-D-GOOD!

Sisters got boneless Siracha chicken wings and a guac burger (bleh, b/c I'm *cough* allergic to avacado. 

And the little cousin got a kids cheese pizza which by the way looked really good and he said, it was delicious 

And for desert, pizookie of course. Peanut butter, salted caramel, chocolate chunk, monkey bread pizookie. All were delicious and only $3 on Tuesday for a normal size

As for our server, she was awesome. I feel horrible bc I don't remember her name BUT she kept our drinks filled, was knowledgeable on the menu, and  was fun! 

I definitely will come back to try other dishes on the menu and will be back for $3 Tuesday pizookies."}
{"text":"The food was  good. The prices were reasonable.  Our server Kodie was outstanding she was knowledgeable personable and very professional. She made some outstanding recommendations about food and cider. No matter how good the food a reasonable the price it's nothing if you don't have a wonderful knowledgeable server we would come back for her alone."}
{"text":"Love BJ's!!! Came here Thursday for their special on ribs. They have a really good deal for half rack of ribs with 2 sides & you can choose either a soup or salad & it comes with a pizookie for only $13.95 & if you can a full rack it's $18.95. We arrived at 7:30 and waited 30 minutes or so to be seated (we were a party of 12). When we sat down I told the waiter we are here for the ribs and he told us they are sold out! We talked to the manager and he said they can make 3 half racks and he said he can give us a pork chop or sirloin cause they ran out & still gave us the deal. The manager was super nice and helped us with what he can do and totally gave us some good deals. 

Everything is super good! The menu is huge! I love the broccoli soup! Also my favorite is the pork chops & ribs! They do have tvs around the restaurant. 

They do have deals the whole week as well. 

Definitely try this place out it's super good."}
{"text":"I visited this location 04/07/18 at around 9pm. Walking in we were kindly greeted by the hostess. Was sat in a comfortable booth, very spacious. Our server was exceptional, fairly kind but service lacked a little. She took awhile to take our order but excused herself. On another instance she forgot about my refill but again she forgave herself. My compliments to the kitchen staff because the food was beyond amazing. Gets better every time I go. Would definitely go back. Only improvement would be quicker service. Other than that it was great"}
{"text":"Bar and bar staff are great.  After drinks, we sat at a table in the bar and the server recommended a pizza and spinach dip.  Pizza was below average at best and spinach dip was horrible.  However the service was great and the house beers were also great.  if they can fix the food I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Sorry BJ'S, our last visit has made me decide that we can no longer be friends. Although you do normally serve delicious food, our last visit here during the early evening hours left us wanting more. Our server ignored us for our entire meal, we had to get her attention for more napkins and water (even after she said she'd be back with more water), and she seemed entirely pre-occupied. We had our 2 year old with us and that, unfortunately, sometimes seems to scare our servers off. Our child was very well-behaved and we ALWAYS clean up after ourselves. Although you are normally an awesome place for happy hour or a dinner for two, please do not ignore your paying customers (and good tippers I might add) just because they have a little one."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on our way from Town Square. The staff is always warm and welcoming :)

Their mozzarella sticks are absolutely the best ones I've ever had - hands down.

We tried the Tavern-Cut pizza. It was pretty good with great food textures including chicken, peperoncinis, basil, onions and more. 

Overall, our meal was delish!"}
{"text":"The Menu here is really great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome."}
{"text":"I do NOT know where these negative reviews came from but this place was packed, people out the door, and had the best service I've had in a long time outside of a 4 star restaurant.   super helpful with the vast menu....of food and beer.  I had a pizza.  Off the chain for something that Vegas lacks.  I'd be back if I were from here ;-)"}
{"text":"My family and myself were at your restaurant on Sunday.  Our server was Nicholas and he was very attentive to our needs.  One of the politest young men we have encountered in our life.  The food was very yummy.  The kid who brought our food was a doll as well.  Thank you for the fantastic dining experience.  Plan on making this our regular Sunday dining place.  Thank you hiring such a wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Three of us decided to venture into BJ's on a muggy Thursday night. The parking lot was packed but we were delightfully surprised at how empty it was upon entering. Although there were very few people in the restaurant after 5 minute of waiting, we finally got the attention of waiter that went and got her hostess off her phone to seat us. Our server was fine, not as knowledgeable as I would prefer. The servers that bring you your food also need an attitude adjustment. The part that got to me was the bus boy that thought it would be wise to root against the Cavaliers and cheer even louder when LeBron was injured on the floor. I am not one to pick sides but your place of employment is not the place where your personal beliefs are needed. Overall, I find that there is a lack of management within BJ's walls apparent in the poor-inconsistent service, and the no apparent control over employees. 

The food is ok if you are not paying for it and most certainly not worth the BS."}
{"text":"Ambiance is relax and family friendly. Service is fast and efficient. Ordered a couple of alcoholic beverages, calamari, pizza, and a pizookie. Thought pizookie was free since two days ago, we were also here with family and friends celebrating my Mother's birthday. My husband signed up for their rewards. So we decided to use the coupon today, having such a great experience the first time here but now the server say we cannot use the coupon. We asked if the manager can explain why we cannot redeem it and he fixed it for us. Overall, food is awesome here. It's not expensive especially if you  take advantage of their specials. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is off the chi-zang!!!!!!!!!
We had Brandon as our server. He said we should try the Root Beer glazed ribs which were amazing by the way. This place was clean, the energy was good, the wait to be seated was not long at all. I can't wait to go back to try some more of the mouth watering food."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last weekend.  We were seated immediately.  The food variety is quite large and everything we ordered was really good.  They make about 9 different beers and the one I ordered was quite good.  Service was prompt and attentive despite the restaurant being quite full.  I would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to other people.  The one down side is that they do not offer any coffee other than just plain old brewed - no lattes, etc.  They should raise their game on this score.  Prices are reasonable.  Lots of families eating there, but no rowdy children."}
{"text":"Excellent food but service is slow.Ive been waiting 20 minutes to get the check and it isn't very busy here.Not good"}
{"text":"Great food, Always enjoy this place. Catherine O. was our server great service, really fun and attentive. 

New menu items Nashville Hot chicken sandwich w/fries really good. 

Also ordered Southern Comfort chicken sandwich w/fries good as well."}
{"text":"I finally made the time to venture down to BJs after work one night. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a homemade root beer with a mini pizookie. The burger and fries were amazing. Not a thing to complain about. The pickles were amazing little crunchy pieces of heaven. I'm wondering if I could go in and just order a jar of pickles?  The root beer was probably the best soda I've ever had and who knew that something as simple as a chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream could make you feel like you just won dessert lottery? 

They have a ton of different things on their menu. There is something for everyone. Next time I'm bringing a DD and trying a few of their cocktails and sangria. They also have a decent wine selection and obviously plenty of beer."}
{"text":"Blown away at horrible my experience!  I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste any more of my time in this place.  I took my wife and her parents and we went on a Sat afternoon - busy but not incredibly busy.  What went wrong??  .....ordered a bowl of soup and received a cup (without soup crackers).  I had to track down server and tell him.  He said he would bring another cup...it never came.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it came out with LESS THAN ROOM TEMP fries.  If that wasn't enough...the grilled sourdough from the sandwich was COLD!!  Needless to say, I provided feedback, did not accept any other food or compensation and will NEVER return!  Even though I can't stand Denny's I would have rather eaten there!!!  YUCK! Save your money and avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty middling.  The Black and Bleu burger was a respectable middle-tier burger.  It came with \"seasoned fries,\" but I'm pretty sure the only thing on them was salt.  I guess salt is technically a seasoning...

I had their on-tap root beer, which they tout as having a slight toffee and vanilla taste.  I would've liked to taste more toffee (hardly noticeable) and less vanilla.  I'm not a fan of vanilla; it makes a root beer taste a little too weak.  Give me more sassafras, maybe a touch more wintergreen, and drop the vanilla.  

Overall, it's not a bad meal for the money, but it's pretty unspectacular.  I guess you can't expect a whole lot from a pizza chain..."}
{"text":"I give the service a pass because they are still new and trying to figure things out, it wasn't terrible, but the bartenders weren't too friendly with each other. I got a Hawaiian deep dish pizza and a few of the BJ's beers. The pizza was okay, nothing to write home about. The BJ's beers were less than impressive. As a self-proclaimed beer snob, I was dissatisfied by the lack of hops in their session IPA and regular IPA. The Imperial Stout has a big boozy flavor to it, not the roasty/malty taste that's enjoyable. 

All in all, a lot of different average beers, and a book of a menu."}
{"text":"We got here around 5 we expected to be a little busy it wasn't we were here for a birthday party and there was already another party going on between the two parties of over 10 guest only had one server and no help we got in there and I waited over 25 minutes to get a drink then we order our food ordered appetizers which were actually pretty decent then we ordered food my food came out called my wife food came out completely wrong I had ordered the ribeye steak and it was extremely dry I like my steaks medium rare and my steak was extremely dry I never put A1 sauce on it had to get that I ordered an alcohol drink and it was just straight alcohol no flavor to it whatsoever best time to put on the hockey game on the TV which they did and 5 minutes later they changed it again to a soccer game and I went up and asked why the hockey game was changed to go because somebody else want to watch the soccer game like but I was here first watching hockey finally changed it back the food is way overpriced horrible service I set with an empty water glass for almost 40 minutes and didn't drink it in my alcohol drink it was disgusting"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  My boyfriend and I have been there three times and each time, were extremely happy.  The service has always been good and the food is delicious (especially the parmesan crusted chicken! yum yum).   I am usually a little hesitant with breweries because I have a very small range of beer that I find tasty but they have a few options that even I love! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I hesitated in giving a one star review, but after 5+ trips, they earned it. The food is usually good - 3-4 stars - and the beer and drinks are good. What kills this place is the horrendous service. It's beyond bad. Like a 0 is more appropriate than a 1. They are slow on food and drinks. We got our meals before the appetizer on two occasions. Once they ran out of what we ordered and the server never came to tell us - we were there for about 2 hours, were served one drink, never got what ordered, then had the manager come and tell us he \"put something in\" for us and hoped we would like it because they ran out of pasta (seriously?!). It's just not worth the continued aggravation to try to give this place chance after chance. It's so convenient and this area desperately needed some other dining options but this place is just a disaster."}
{"text":"BJ's was a decent experience for my girlfriend and I. 

We stopped in for an early dinner one night and some cocktails. There weren't any drink specials offered when we were there, but they do have a nice selection of drinks to choose from. I enjoyed a mojito, while my girl had a long-island iced tea. 

Our server was super friendly, very accommodating and he took his time serving us so we could relax and not feel \"rushed\" to eat and leave. I ended up ordering their baked ziti and it was very good. The portion size was surprisingly small given the portions of their other plates. 

For the two of us, a couple drinks each and dinner set me back nearly $70 (including a coupon for $10 off that my girlfriend had). I felt that for a chain restaurant, that was a bit high. I almost thought I was overcharged, but didn't feel like reviewing everything so I just took the hit end left. 

In the end, I would possibly come back in the future, depending on how busy other restaurants are in the Desert Ridge area."}
{"text":"So I wanted to give BJ's another chance like I said I love the place.  This time, I ordered curbside.  I got home as I had ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon.  There was no asparagus inside my to go plate and no chipotle glaze in the couscous.  It was freezing cold so of course I was not going back at night to have them fix my order.  I am just disappointed to have to take one of my favorite local spots off of our regular dining."}
{"text":"Love going there fir lunch. Fast service and good food! Love their appetizers ."}
{"text":"It pains me to be here at HH when Kona is a few feet away offering the tastiest treats for next to nothing. Instead i'm at BJ's for a company HH, trying to make the best of it.

The only great thing about their HH is the $4 you-call its. They're not you-call-it-wells, they're you-call-it-anything, so my smart-ass self ordered top shelf gin with ginger beer. Unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite (Hendricks) OR ginger beer, so I caved with Tanqueray on ginger-ale. Sad, but still a damn good deal for $4.

We ordered the lettuce wraps and egg rolls at $6 each as a HH special price. Funny thing about HH pricing, you sorta expect it to be the same regular menu item at a discount price (which is why you're so \"happy\" to attend). Well, a little investigation lead me to realize that the appetizers on the HH menu are SMALLER than their regular-priced counterparts.  The lettuce wrap on HH comes with 3 individual leaves of lettuce with a miniature sample of the meaty sauce while the menu displays the lettuce wraps as 4-6 leaves surrounded  by multiple bowls of filling. How fishy.

Then the egg rolls appeared. 4 tiny little nubs of fried dough with avocado that tastes like its drowning in mayo. Did I really just pay $6 for this? Is this really a \"deal\". I think i'll just have a liquid-gin dinner for HH and call it a day. No thank you."}
{"text":"BJ's is a date-night staple for the boyfriend and I. The food is very consistent (I tend to order the same thing every time!). Not gourmet by any means, but tasty. Their new \"Small Plate\" appetizers are awesome and cheap! They also have a low-cal menu section, which is nice, but needs to be expanded. The menu is huge...like Cheesecake Factory huge. Their house brews are great. And the Pizookie is to.die.for. Two people can eat (drinks + entrees) for about $40.

Only 4 stars because of the service. It's hit-or-miss. Generally, food takes quite a while to arrive. The place can get pretty crowded on weekend nights, but the bar area is open seating with full menu."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that has just about anything you could ever want to eat. The downside is it tastes like frozen, processed garbage. Very similar to NPL."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  The selection is great and the drink menu is much, much, much improved!"}
{"text":"The Menu here is great.  So much to choose from and its always good.  No mater which location we visit our service is always good and we never have to wait long to be seated.  The Jambalaya is a big favorite, and the pizza here is awesome.  I've also noticed that they have improved the drink menu quite a bit"}
{"text":"We tried burgers and parmesan garlic chicken wings.Taste was amazing also server was so helpful.Try their craft beer so good."}
{"text":"Lots of Beer selections...hard to pick one...
They're pizza was good and happy hour deal was pretty good, too.
You can create your own pizza. 
The Mediterranean pizza was good. It looks like chicago deep pan pizza but taste much better.
Appetizer was good....potsticker and spinich & artichoke dip with chips was yum..."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Awful service. 20 minutes to get drinks, only then did she take our food order. Another 30 minutes to get food. Got some orders wrong. Appetizers arrived after the food: we had 2 littlest kids with us and they got their food last. They orders Mac and cheese. That was kraft mad and cheese clearly. It take 5 minutes to make. Why did they get it last?

Asked to see the manager, never arrived, and we waited another 30 minutes for that miracle to happen. 

Awful. Won't be caught in this place again even if they pay me.

This is embarrassing for their brand, and really, for any restaurant. 

Not even an apology from that. Yeah... no."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch during the week with some co-workers.  I thought BJ's is incredibly clean and the server was really attentive. The interior is fun and the lighting of the bottles on the bar created a really cool atmosphere.

I ordered the Mini One Topping Pizza with a side salad.  It was only $7.50 which I thought was an awesome lunch time deal.  I wasn't really thrilled, though.  It's a deep dish pizza, which is fine, but it just felt so...messy.  I ate it with a fork and knife because that was the only option, but even then I didn't feel like I could enjoy it.  I didn't know anything about BJ's prior to the day of, but as a chain restaurant it definitely has that chain restaurant food taste.  So I wouldn't expect much more than that.

We also all commented on the loud echo in the restaurant.  There weren't many people there, but everything reverberated.

I don't drink but there was a massive board with a list of beers.  If you're a beer drinker, this really wouldn't be a bad place to go to sit and hang with friends over a couple of beers."}
{"text":"This is a great place the beer selection is awesome we love is place so excited they built one close to us everything is great but my all time fav is the Hickory burger it is moist and well cooked with ample fries.the bread bowl chile is to die for. I can say enough great things and I rarely give five stars. But do call head seating and oh yea you can pay from the app and. Not have to wait around for the back and forth crap with the bill"}
{"text":"Great, casual restaurant with a focus on quality food and great service.  My prime rib was a little under-cooked and had quite a bit of fat.  It was still a large piece, though, and I'm used to other restaurants not cooking my steaks properly so never even thought to complain.  Our server, Angela, was not satisfied and sent the manager over who proceeded to comp the entire meal and prepare an entire new meal for me to take home.  This goes above and beyond and emphasizes BJ's focus on quality food and great service!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the first time with a couple friends. Our friends raved the food at B.J.s. My wife had the pulled pork and I had the Jumbalaya. Both were absolutely amazing! We also shared a bowl of some of the best broccoli cheese soup around. The service was great. The wait was quick. The most overwhelming part of the visit was choosing what to eat with an array of options. I am definitely looking forward to taking my children or any family that might visit from out of state.
UPDATE: Went here for a second time. The service was great. Most of the food was good. AVOID the boneless wings. Unfortunately they are not that great..for as much good food they have here,boneless wings are a no go."}
{"text":"Just want to post the meaning
Of true customer service ! Had a great
Dinner I think they thought they were behind or being slow and at the end apologized and gave us a huge discount and shook our hands and wished my husband a happy birthday .... I gave him a great tip and the manager
He was young ,
Mature and kind and as busy as it was they handled this amazingly!!  FYI we had patience but for
Them
To notice and apply
A
Discount was so kind and my daughter is 1 she was crying we asked for
Bread he walked to the kitchen grabbed her fruit and a knot bread and she was happy ! Our waiters name started with an \"m\"
Totally forgot his name but he was amazing and the manger , heck them both worked together and were genuine !!!"}
{"text":"I've been to BJ's a lot through the years mainly for lunch and sometimes for dinner. Their beers are excellent. My favorite is the pirahna ale. Everything that I have ordered is always excellent brewery food. My favorite lunch is the California Club flatbread pizza but you can't go wrong with the soup and salad or the sliders. They have a huge menu too. C'mon it's a brewery so you just know that it awesome."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me I went in for lunch and had the fish tacos which you can have grilled or fried i had fried and it was delicious they had a number of dishes for lunch I will recommend this place to everyone the atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"This place has decent food, variety of everything, big menu, full bar, open late. 

This review is mainly for their Pizzokie's! My go to place to get these wonderful things. Half cooked melty gooey cookie with cold ice cream on top. Hard to beat.

Recently came here - I order the Pizzokie trio and the new monkey bread Pizzokie. I ordered the classic (Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla ice cream), cookies and cream cookie with vanilla ice cream, salted caramel cookie with vanilla ice cream.
All were fantastic - the salted caramel with pretzel was my favorite

The new monkey Bread had great flavor and was delicious! It isn't true monkey bread - but for what it was it was really good!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good, but the portions turn out small and I swear I've gotten sick after every time I've eaten here. Not just me, but my mom and my friend both have gotten sick from eating here. The pazookie is amazing but I get nauseous and the runs after I have one every time too. It's disappointing after great tasting food to get sick, but the portions are disappointing enough as well to not bother returning. There's better out there..."}
{"text":"I have been to this BJs a few times, mainly because someone else drags me. I wouldn't come on my own. Our twin group president wanted to have our last board meeting here.  She called a month ahead to let them know we would need a large area, preferably a private room.  The person she talked to assured her that they could accommodate us.  The day of the meeting, she called early in the morning to let them know we would be meeting at 6:30.  We got there at 6:25 and they were not expecting us.  They told us to wait at the bar while they set up the tables.(We were 18 twin moms, yes large board).  Well, the room was not private at all, it was just another area, divided only by half walls.  The noise level was so high, we could not hear each other.  We ordered some food, which was ok, nothing to write home about.  My Fundraising co-chair didn't get her meal until I called a waitress and made her aware of that.  Our meeting ended up being the fasted we have ever had, mainly because we could not really engage in conversation.  I guess we won't be coming back.  I think I am finally out of people who could drag me to this place."}
{"text":"Important points, good food, fair service.
Our server was very attentive, refills on drinks, fast calamari-hot crispy..good.  It took 6-minutes.  She was the perfect server, but stuck with looking bad because food takes longer.  BJ management can see on the food tickets on how long the food takes.  Get with it guys, 
BJ's has a menu unmatched but service has always been a tad challenging.  We sat on a Sunday.  the wait was 10-15, and we got in in 10.  That's good.  Religiously, the food takes a while, but a quality product take time.  it shouldn't take 25-mites for a lunch.  Just think if you have a 1/2-hr for lunch I would not go here. BJ's consistently takes longer.  
They can improve, but my past 5-years of eats has shown otherwise.  Dinners are 28-32-minute wait, great quality, and the TV's are what can help pass the time.  I hate to sound racist but, my 15-years of food service industry, I'd hire Hispanic cooks.  You can bet if you go to any restaurant and there are Hispanic folks cooking, it will get to you fast.  It will be quality food.
We had a hand battered chicken strips, very good.  The green chili burger was thick, hot and tasty.  Not real juicy, cooked well done, but I had a bite it was good.  I had the Asian salad, which was great, with the crunchy won ton skins mmm good.  My son got the pepperoni deep dish, which is just like Gino's East in Chicago...amazing.  
This is why I gave this place 4-stars.  If they can serve their lunches in 15-minutes, and dinners in 18, then they'd be a hit."}
{"text":"Wait was very long even with call ahead. Appetizer came same time dinner. Food was just okay."}
{"text":"Have gone to this Bj's multiple times, but I just wanted to make this review in reference to Father's Day. We went there for a late lunch, and it was pretty busy. They seated us as fast as they could, and the service was very good. They even gave us a free glass and a gift card for a follow up visit just because it was Father's day. The food was good, but the only thing that doesn't make it into the 5 star range is the fact that the food didn't absolutely wow us. The huge 12+ page menu made it hard to make a choice."}
{"text":"Server took ten minutes to come to the table. Spinach dip came out very cold. How hard is it to microwave? Meal came out wrong as well.  Overall, generic and poor execution."}
{"text":"We like to go to BJs but don't go often enough. The food is always good and the portions are exceptional. The staff is always pleasant in the restaurant is very clean it does get busy and you have to wait but what do you expect when you go to a restaurant this good. Prices are reasonable and the desserts are to die for!"}
{"text":"I love the wings the pizza is just strange. After ordering pizza and being unhappy because it has no sauce on the pizza. They bring us say four pizzas total to the table in an effort to fix the issue.
After a extra long 2 hour wait I requested to speak with a manager or the cook. 
We were told by the management that the pizza comes with nothing but bread and cheese and what ever topping you pick. Well that's not pizza if you ask me. (That's called a sandwich.) The manager came to the table and told us its premade so its nothing he can do to make it better. He gave us a gift card in the amount of 25 dollars. I wont be back for the pizza I will be back for the wings."}
{"text":"The food was so good. I spent 79$ for seven dishes. Even the Peach Sunset Tea was refreshing and delicious, I normally can't drink things without sugar but the quality of this tea was top of the line."}
{"text":"First time I came here and it was great... Deb our server was the best... She knew a lot about the menu and the varieties of draft beers... She made a great recommendation for me... The food was great big portions at decent prices... Will definitely come here again real soon..."}
{"text":"I can say that I will never eat here again. I'm so disappointed in the quality of food that I ordered here. I get having char marks on your food but my steak was so burnt that I felt sick from the first bite. I went back to get a new order and it's STILL burnt. They need to get a new grill cook or something because this was horrible!"}
{"text":"One of my local favorites.  Avocado rolls are delicious and the selection of micro-brews should satisfy any beer aficionado's taste.  

Love the atmosphere and the service is generally top notch.  (We had one experience where a waitress in the bar/booth section could have used a little more training is customer service and attentiveness)

Food selection and quality/taste was superb.  If you time it during their lunch specials and/or happy hours you can save some money."}
{"text":"We tried the burgers.i had a port Bella and my friend had bacon cheese burger
 Both were made with perfection. The fries were crisp and plentiful. Our server was on the  ball in all aspevts.what a different good experience"}
{"text":"Whenever in doubt, I can always trust BJ's!  Always Have my blonde beer, and appetizers!  Had the sliders, and glazed ribs..excellent!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, but my favorite location is Centennial Pkwy!!  My friend and I had pizzas since they were half priced., and happy hour!  This location (Charleston) doesn't feel as cozy as Centennial.The food was great.  BJ's in general is a great place to eat!  I have had a lot of items on the menu, I have never been disappointed.  Shout out to our waitress \"Franky\"..she was great!"}
{"text":"Gr8 place for drinks and food. Open till mid- night so if u r hungry n looking for a decent place to eat with less crowd, this is the place. Chicken wings r very light and not too much sauce. Must try - Pizookie"}
{"text":"We had the most irritating experience here tonight. We will probably never go back. First of all our server took forever to take our order, only to discover that they had given us an old menu and I happened to order something that is no longer on their menu. So we had to figure that all out about 15 minutes after we ordered and they said they would just make something like it. Well it had turkey and bacon, but clearly wasn't the same , but that was better than my husband we ended up getting a chili quest dip for his meal instead of the pale Ale chili he ordered. We didn't want to have to wait forever so he just ate a bit of it  when our server finally came around again, we told him he brought the wrong thing so he offered to take it off our bill. Good since he only ate about 3 bites of it. We then asked to redeem our points to get a pizookie, but because it was taking so long we needed it to go. When the pizookie finally showed up, it was not to go!  They said it would take another 10 minutes or so to get another one to go. We said to forget it and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager showed up, we explained what happened, and she apologized, we asked to get our points back from the pizookie that they. Oils not manage to get done for us. We had now been there just shy of 2 hours. We were on a time schedule and could not nor did we want to wait around any longer. We just wanted our money back for the pizookie . The manager came back a few minutes later and e planned she could not refund that because we used their app to pay our bill!, are you kidding me. We used their app as recommended , and to speed up the process of trying to get out of there and now we got screwed out of a pizookie. It is unbelievable to me the terrible service we had there."}
{"text":"Food was better but service was worse. Never received a refill on coffee. Had to ask twice for Sweet & Low and gluten-free menu. Guess what? A month later & the gluten-free menus are still missing! Do they even really exist? I'm at the point where I'll object to dining here if this place is busy."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! I don't even think they deserve 1 star.. Waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table, 20 minutes for drinks, 45 minutes for just an appetizer... Then another 30 minutes for my food, when they finally brought out the food you could tell that the food had been sitting under a heater or as the manager called it a \"hot line.\" The there was hair in my food and all the manager did was say sorry. Said he would take care of it. Serious lack of communication because my server comes back and says oh did you still want that bread bowl!? Really?? Horrible"}
{"text":"After waiting in line for over an hour to see the Easter Bunny Mandi L. and I decided we needed a bloody mary! Hunnie Bunnie wanted ice cream, so BJ's it is! 
First Mandi grabbed a booth inside but I thought we should sit outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. They set us up with a table but there was no umbrella shading it so it kind of sucked, but we decided to stay outside anyway. Another table said they were leaving soon so as soon as they did we grabbed their table and it was perfect. 
Hunnie Bunnie had a scoop of ice cream and we enjoyed some spicy bloodies. They garnish these with a big ol' celery stick, a pickled green bean, an olive and a picked pepper. Not bad. Could have used some MORE garnish like a pickle, a beef stick, a piece of cheese... LOL but that's just how I personally like them: mini salad in my bloody glass!"}
{"text":"Located in one of the many shopping complexes ringing the north side of Phoenix, BJ's is a brewpub/sports bar serving up casual fare at bargain prices.

Blame it on the lunch rush: service was at a crawl, though the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. And the food was fine.

I went with the Parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich, a chicken breast coated with Parmesan bread crumbs and served between a soft roll with lettuce, tomato, and a garlic dressing. A little heavy on the lettuce and tomato and light on the coating, but a good sandwich with particularly good thin-cut fries.

I didn't get the chance to sample any of their dozen or so brews, but it looked like a solid selection. They brew their own sodas, as well."}
{"text":"Beer is ALWAYS good.

But BJ's beer is actually really good.  Most beers, to me, are just that... beer.  But these had a great taste, texture and aftertaste.  I had the sampler, the blonde, the red, the heffe, the stout, some blueberry beer (that tasted like sparkling wine really) and something else that for the life of me I can't remember.

My favorite was the heffe.  

We had a bunch of appetizers... the avocado rolls are FLIPPING AWESOME!!! The just blind you with their awesomeness. (lol I love that Kung Fu Panda movie)  We also had the lettuce wraps, which were ok, and the chips and salsa.  The salsa was great... good texture and just the right spicyness to not kill you.

Then after that we all had the Mediterranean pizza... it was GREAT.  That was probably THE THICKEST pizza I have seen in my life, without having the huge crust of a deep dish.  Incredibly good.

Service was good with the waitress.  She was attentive and nice.

The only thing that was bad was they advertised the pumpkin ale, and they had run out for the season.  If you're out, take down the ads!!

We'll be back, definitely."}
{"text":"This place used to be our favorite restaurant in the area. I was there today for lunch after a long absence.  We were seated in a 2 person booth in an area that used to be open. People seated near us were too close. Their conversations over powered my own. We ordered our food after a bit of strong sales pitch for drinks and food we didn't want. When it came the table was too small for the  salad and sandwich we ordered. The salads came out 1st and sandwich followed 2 minutes later. Quality of the food slipped significantly. The bacon on my wedge salad was burned. The veggies on the sandwich were old and poor. All said and done, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the nachos and a mini bj pizza. Both tasted like they were \"frozen\" and recooked at the restaurant. I was very disappointed. I do not believe I will be back."}
{"text":"Always have great service at the bar. Bison burger is good along with the shrimp lettuce wraps. Plenty of beers to try on hand from tap to bottles if u like to try different beers"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that usually I am a big fan of BJ's, but this time was a total disappointment!

Started with the waitress taking our order orally instead of writing anything down. First my wife and I ordered chicken ceaser for an appetizer and pizza / burger for entree.

All of the food arrived at once which was the first mistake.
Secondly the pizza had the wrong toppings - write down the order!
The burger and fries were only warm to begin with and after eating the salad it was cold. 
Also, I didn't want to eat before my wife had her pizza.
To re-fire the pizza took over 30 minutes!
After all said and done I went to the manager (I Never do this)
He comp'ed the whole meal - at least that!

I don't think that we will come to this location again, but I will visit other BJ's near us."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to BJ's and I liked it quite a bit. We went this past weekend for a family member's surprise birthday party. There were 22 of us in our party ranging from 2 years old to 90 years old. It was arranged for us to have our own buffet of food which was great! The service staff was cordial, but I wouldn't call them friendly. We had 2 servers helping us and neither of them cracked a smile...not once. They did provide adequate service for such a large party but to not crack a smile even once is kind of odd. 

We had cheese sticks, hot wings, and the artichoke dip with chips for our appetizers. They were set out on a table near us in buffet style. The cheese sticks were crispy on the outside and cheesy goodness on the inside. The artichoke dip was flavorful and the hot wings were actually quite good. The wings were served with NO SAUCE on them and you could add as much or as little wing sauce as you liked to your own taste. This I liked quite a bit. The wings had a nice crisp to them and were plenty meaty. The wing sauce had a good bite to it and I liked being able to control the temperature myself.  

For our lunch, we had salad with a choice of viniagrette dressing or ranch dressing. It was a basic garden salad, nothing special, but it was fresh and crisp and looked freshly prepared instead of pre-made as one might expect for a catered lunch. We also had several choices of pizza. My favorite was the barbeque chicken pizza. We also had tomato and cheese, BJ's favorite, and I think it was Mediterranean pizza. The pizzas are Chicago style so expect that thick, fluffy crust. This worked nicely for the selections we had which were loaded with toppings. The crust was able to take all the toppings and not get soggy. There is nothing worse than soggy pizza crust. 

All in all, the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I would have given this a 4 star rating had the servers been more personable.  I'll definitely go back again with a group or just with my family and try some other menu selections."}
{"text":"I ordered To Go food while enjoying a beverage at the bar.  When I returned to my hotel room, I found that my order was not only incorrect, I wasn't given any utensils or napkins.  My bad, unfortunately I tipped the staff very well, certainly not what I would have tipped if I would have gotten good service. Take note, bad customer service spreads like an illness."}
{"text":"I have been here two times now.  The first time was over a year ago when my GF took me there for lunch.  We enjoyed it but I do not remember what we ate.  Today, we went for lunch again since BJ's sent my GF a birthday coupon for one free meal.  So we went and she had two chicken tacos in pita bread with chips and salsa.  The chicken tacos, especially in pita bread was super delicious or so she said.  The chips were fast food quality but the avocado dip and the salsa were very good.  I ordered their double brewmaster deluxe burger -- that is two 5 oz. patties with two slices of cheese, bacon, onions, tomato slices, and lettuce -- it comes with a boatload of fries.  It was very good.  A side note --- the have a half pound bacon cheese burger that has essentially the same ingredients but with only one slice of cheese and an 8 oz. patty.  Why would anyone order that for the same price as my double brewmaster deluxe burger???  We ordered two soft drinks too.  They gave her a birthday cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday.  We were stuffed and the food was good.  I was impressed, especially with the birthday coupon."}
{"text":"Lunch was awesome today. I had the Fried Chicken on mash potatoes and corn. It was outstanding once again!
My wife had french dip and it was incredible. This place is great!!!"}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza is actually pretty tasty. We had the spicy Hawaiian and I really enjoyed it. The service was abysmal. Lunch took almost 2 hours. Most of the time was waiting on our checks which were wrong. The server didn't understand the daily special on pizza. This may be a function of the new staff but is unacceptable as is. I won't be going back until they get it together."}
{"text":"Its BJs, a chain with a obscenely huge menu, which I feel can be a red flag for not fresh food.  But it is what it is, just decent bar food, good beers, and usually pretty easy to get in an out of.  I dont think I can justify giving a chain 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place can't take the cheese out of anything, it's like dairy land. Our waitress was awful and not helpful at all."}
{"text":"Was surprised that I had to drive around the parking lot 3 times to get a parking space. I thought that would be a good sign, alas it wasn't. The wait was only 15 minutes and once we were seated the waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. I tried the dark beer flight. When that came I was surprised that nothing was really outstanding. Out of all 4 beers I would say that the Nutty Brewnette was the best. I ordered the Blond battered shrimp, and my better 9/10ths ordered the chicken marsala. She was very hesitant to order it because she has had amazing C.M. from another restaurant in town. My shrimp came to the table and there was 11 on the plate! Unfortunately the shrimp looked like they were smashed flat to about 1/8\" and they had a very hard crust that was the batter. They had a somewhat weird taste. The 1/4 cup raminkin that the coleslaw came in was hot and so was the non dressed purple cabbage. I don't care for hot coleslaw so that wasn't eaten. My wife's chicken marsala was drowned in marsala on a bed of tasteless green beans. Overall service was nothing spectacular, because after our food came to us we had to sit and wait for our silverware. I say the place is packed for some reason, but I don't believe we will ever be back to find out why."}
{"text":"My fav place with family & friends, dates with my husband, & happy hour with teacher colleagues. Always fun, clean, pleasant, courteous, & enjoyable."}
{"text":"Nice Place.  Hope it sticks around.
BJ's is a great place.  Sorta like if The Cheesecake Factory had a child with a Gordon Biersch and that child ended up graduating from a reputable collage.  Its both and yet better than either one.

Beer:  Drink some.  the Hefe, the Stout, Pumpkin. Drink them all!

Apps: SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP. No Joke, may be the best i ever had.

Food: Parmesan Crusted Chicken, ask for extra cheesy goodness!

P.S. Get a White Chocolate Macadamia Nut POOZOKIE"}
{"text":"Went for late lunch and we both ordered a deep dish large pizza at about $25 a piece, we wanted to take some home...If you love bread, then buy this...because 80% of our pizzas were bread with a little toppings on it...if this is their idea of \"deep dish\" it is very sad. I would have sent them back, but did not want to embarrass my son. You could have easily peeled off the layer of cheese and ingredients because it was that slight...Will never go back for their so called deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"This is not our first time at Bj's but it was still good. I had the vanilla cream soda that comes in a beer mug which was delicious. For dinner I ordered the grilled chicken pasta which was pretty good. My husband ordered the barbecue pulled pork burger which he loved. He said the sauce was complimented by the bacon and cheese. He also had the Grand Cru beer instead of the usual Stella. He said it was very smooth and the rye was perfect. My mom had the classic chicken sandwich which was hot and fresh the chicken was crunchy but tender and juicy inside. A great basic chicken sandwich. The spaghetti was devoured by our 12 year old so it must have been good."}
{"text":"I would like to thank the GM April. She was absolutely amazing. She eased my stress and made my dining experience at BJ's embarrassment free. Dealing with a mobility scooter can be difficult especially when areas are packed with people who don't see you. The food was perfect and flavorful. The restaurant was clean and staff busy but cheerful. Tony our server was very sweet and attentive as much as possible with as busy as it was. I was very impressed with how everything turned out for our Father's Day dinner. I will most definitely be returning. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Honestly?  Don't come here.  We've been going to the BJs location in Summerlin for years, and that location is FAR superior.  Every time we give the Centennial location a chance, we're extremely disappointed.  It is worth the extra drive to get to the Summerlin location.
First, the service here is always bad.  We always have to wait ages for drink refills and orders.  And, literally, every single time we've received something incorrect when the food arrives.  And I'm not talking about something small - I'm talking about an entirely different entree being presented than ordered.
Second, the \"to go\" service is equally horrid.  The pickup times are never even close to being correct, i.e. told 20 minutes and waited 50.  Plus, the food tastes drastically different from when you eat in versus take home.
We've decided to stop giving this location anymore chances.  An extra 20 minute drive to the Summerlin location is WELL worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch, I love the Honey Crisp Chicken Salad & my husband tried the new Spinach with Seasonal Berries salad + Blackened Salmon...we ended with a Chocolate Chip Pizookie with substituted Chocolate ice cream!
Downloaded their APP & saved $5 off the check :)"}
{"text":"I love BJs! I have had it serval times back home and this was not my best experience. I went out with some of my friends, who have never been there before, I am sad to say their experience was below satisfactory. I understood they were busy but you have to respect your customers. I am a college student, I chose to spent what little money I have at this establishment and I want to get my money's worth. We were told the wait was only 20 minutes, we waited over 35 minutes. We never heard our name called. They claim they called us. They do use a text messaging system as well but I never got a message. They were calling names but the hostesses were not speaking clearly into the intercom or it needs to be fixed. I keep on moving to try to hear the intercom but I simple could not hear. Their voices sounded like they were underwater. When I went up to ask where we were on the list they said they called us. I explained I did not hear them. The hostess responded in a snarky voice, \"Well, you should have received a text message.\"  I explained to her I never got it and she rolled her eyes at me. She then responded in annoyance, \" Well, we will see what we can do for you.\"  Shortly after, a different hostess sat us, she explained that the intercom is meant for outside not inside and that sometimes they have errors in their text message system. Okay, well not everyone sits outside, It was cold so I was standing inside. My friends wanted to leave before we were even seated because of the lack of the experience of the hostesses. They are the first impression of the restaurant and they should remain respectful to customers even during the Friday dinner rush. 
The food was excellent though! As always BJ's food was delicious! Our server was busy with two large parties as well but she kept on checking up on us and making sure our drinks were full. This server definitely made up for the chaos of the hostess station."}
{"text":"First time here.  We found the food just ok - nothing spectacular.  Tried the craft root beer which was ok as well.  Server was friendly but after she took our order we didn't see much of her - someone else brought our food and she didn't check back in until we were done with our food.  

We had the opportunity to go to a BJ's in Orlando FL and decided not to based on this experience."}
{"text":"Note: this was my first visit - I will update again
Time: Tuesday 4:00pm

We were immediately greeted and asked if we had the BJ's app on our phones. - If you have the app they will scan it and automatically apply any points to your account. With the app you may also pay through your phone.  By paying this way you will receive a 20% discount off your bill.  We had zero wait time!

To drink I ordered the peach berry iced tea (non-alcoholic).  It was very light and refreshing. The refills were free!

I had the barbeque pulled pork sandwich with shoestring french fries.  The sandwich was delicious.  The pork was tender, the onion straws were crispy, and the sauce was both sweet and smokey.

The downfall of the meal was the fries.  While crispy and flavorful they were also cold. 

My only regret is that I was too full to try one of their exciting desserts!

Next time I plan on getting a dessert and maybe trying one of their many craft beers."}
{"text":"I first experienced BJ's at their Chandler, AZ location when we were living in neighboring Ahwatukee.  I liked it then and I like it now.  I love their \"house\" beers and I don't have to argue with my family because there is truly something for everyone.  Want a fish taco?  Fine.  Want a steak?  Fine.  Want a pizza, Fine..... I personally eat the avocado egg rolls as my dinner because you get two huge ones that seem to be stuffed with an entire Avocado each and they have a nice spice to them.  I miss fresh Avocados from my years in Phoenix area.  The ones you buy at Market District or Trader Joes suck.  Apparently all the good ones go to BJ's because their Avocados are Southwest-worthy.  Right now the restaurant is packed from \"eating with the elderly\" time through closing because it is a new and different restaurant in the South Hills so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  If you are a 4 or under party, the bar area is walk-in with tables.  Gotta love PA, the kids can sit in the bar area!  Good for us!  As far as the quality of the food - if you like Houlihans, you will like BJ's.  Similar broad-spectrum menus and quality of food."}
{"text":"Let's start out with the important part of the review just in case you don't read any further...the pizookies!! Your choice of oven fresh cookie served à la mode. So many choices, I go for the cookies and cream every time!! Unless I'm with my girlfriend, then we split the trio where we get to mix and match three of our favorites. This is a great place to come even if you just want the dessert!!

The food is good! There is nothing on the menu (aside from the pizookie) that keeps me coming back. The ribs are good, the ribeye was good, but they were just that...good. I wouldn't select BJs for those food options. 

The customer service is hit or miss. Last time was phenomenal, this time I was a little disappointed with the service. 

All in all, I'll keep going back!!! They've earned my patronage!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks every time we come here. Everything is always clean and well taken care of. Our server Kimberly C was amazing and made sure we had a great experience. Next time we are back, we will try to get her as our server again!"}
{"text":"What a joke. I can't believe I was actually prepared to pay $12.00 for an individual pizza and a small side salad.

Ordered curbside. Lady said it would be 20 minutes.  I arrived to find no parking whatsoever. I called and told them I had arrived but there was no parking in the designated \"curbside\" spots.  Lady who answered had no solutions. So just then I noticed a spot, told her I had found one, and asked her to please bring me my order. Well, no one ever came out. I saw a waitress serving other cars, but she didn't bother coming up to mine. After waiting over 10 minutes, I simply left. Went around the corner and grabbed a couple of slices from Roco's for $5.00! They were delicious.

Guess what? They never even called me to let me know my order was ready!  

You people have some nerve charging way too much money for average food and deplorable service. 

Stay away from this poor excuse for a dining facility..."}
{"text":"After having gone for the second time last night, I figured it was high time I get in here and talk up the Parmesan Crusted Chicken I've had both times.  The white cheddar mashed potatoes are worth an order of this dish!  Get yourself the Chocolate Raspberry combo drink with some stout and raspberry beer (I can't find it on their online menu, but check it out for sure).  It doesn't matter how many people have already said it...their pizookies need to happen at the end of your meal!  The peanut butter is always my first choice but their fancy salted caramel pizookie is good too.  We got the trio this time around and shared different bites with the whole table...if you're okay with sharing, this is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"This place is huge. I really liked the design and layout of the restaurant. The outdoor seating and fire table are awesome. 

We went there on a Saturday evening with a party of 10 people. We had reservations I thought was cool that they even took reservations. So we got sat right away.

The service: It was average our waitress was nice. I know our party was on the bigger size and although it wasn't for lack of effort on her part all of our orders got messed up. One person at our table didn't even get their entrée until we were half way through our meal. Which they comp'd him with a beer and a desert. 

The beer: I tried 3 different ones their hefe, pale ale and thier IPA. I would say over all the beer was plainly average at best a far cry from fatheads. The hefe was my favorite of the 3. I am a hop head and found thier pale ale and IPA lacking in both hop flavor and aroma. 

I will probably never go back here."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves is when your dish is different from what's described on the menu. I dislike red sauce so I was super excited to see a deep dish pizza with Alfredo sauce (the Great White Deep Dish). Little did I know, it had Alfredo PLUS red sauce. I was completely confused why it had red sauce when the menu specified Alfredo (I'm clearly inexperienced when it comes to deep dish). Anyway, the waitstaff was completely unaccommodating. They took my pizza away without offering any other options so I sat there, watched my boyfriend eat and left starving."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and there's so many choices of food and it's all super good, the desserts are out of this world!!!!!!!! i have like 4 cookies real talk this place in with the shots bro lol. i'd come here everyday for the rest of my life if i didn't like live so far but whatevz live life in the moment. always. yolo forever and this place is awesome three stars my ass ok bye"}
{"text":"Tasty food and the beer choices are solid. I really enjoyed their house pale ale paired with a tasty, but not spectacular, vegetarian pizza. 

This is good place to go with a group, keep in mind that it is impossible to get a table on a Friday night.  

I find this place on the spendy side. However, the lunch and happy hour specials are a good deal, so try it hit those if you're a miserly cheapskate like me. 

Tenaya Creek offers better beers, Big Dogs boasts more enticing food options; BJ's is a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood. 

Minus a point because it is, and feels like, a corporate chain."}
{"text":"Interesting brew house in Vegas suburbs.  It has a chainy type of feel, but usually has quite a following.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  The food is American comfort food.  They are tasty, but predictable.  The star are the beers.  There are too many to count.  The place is great for a large group of people."}
{"text":"Poor service. The food took a long time to come out and when it did, it was cold. The check took even longer to get and then....  you guys...... 27 minutes for her to bring back our change!!! There's no way she thought we were leaving it as a tip either because our change was 46 dollars!"}
{"text":"I love coming into BJ's, and I came in tonight with my family for my birthday. I work in the restaurant industry, and I was seriously unimpressed with their service and waitstaff.
We weren't greeted with a \"welcome\" or \"hello\" by the hostess up front, just her chewing gum with an open mouth. I don't think I saw her smile once. It was a busy night, I understand. But it continued with our server, Lauren. I remembered her name because I was embarrassed for her in regards to her hospitality. Not warm, not friendly, maybe spent 90 seconds total with our table the entire night. She made no effort to be warm or welcoming, and she seemed to be in such a rush that us asking for service was an inconvenience to her. 
The food was good! That's what those two stars are for. However, when we ordered a dessert (we were so excited for the pizookies), there was a long black hair in one of them. Mind you, all of the women in our group are very blonde - we knew in no way could it be ours. We let Lauren know, and she took the dessert trio off our tab. She didn't apologize, she wasn't apologetic or accommodating whatsoever besides doing the bare minimum of taking the dessert off our tab. 
The manager was friendly and apologetic, but the impression had been made. I work in a restaurant that gets busier than most, easily as busy as BJ's was tonight. Our waitstaff is still warm, friendly, collected, and accommodating. The lack of professionalism at this establishment was impossible to ignore, and the quality of our service had me feeling mortified on Lauren's (and that hostess's, and frankly the entire restaurant's) behalf. I truly hope Lauren was having a really, really bad night, and that she doesn't regularly give this quality of service to other customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best location for dinner and a movie! Too bad it's not that great... 

We went right when it opened and had an awesome experience. We sat the bar, the bartender was awesome, and our food was fast and good. 

Just went back after a few months and it was terrible! My burger was so greasy that I couldn't eat the bun because it was soaked through (gross, so I didn't eat the burger either). The fries were cold and had definitely been sitting for a long time. My boyfriend got the mahi mahi and shrimp over couscous and didn't care for any of it.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Another issue with Ahu Tuna Salad with 2 ounces. Except THIS TIME, Manager Jeremy was not pleased with being asked to remake this item from our delivery order. Instead of making sure we had a proper salad, it was covered in won tons (we asked for none), the tuna was horribly overcooked and had fat grissle stuck to it from not allowing it to rest. The staff internationally screwed up my replacement salad as much as they could. Then Manager Brad argued with us over the status of the cooked tuna, the ounces, and whether won tons were asked for. Smh. I'm so done with this business. Such a ripoff."}
{"text":"Good service, attentive wait staff. Good food with the usual huge American portions. Reading some of the other reviews, everybody else has pretty much covered it. I'll post some pictures though. I agree it's a good place to go, it's super casual, a little bit loud for the music for my taste, but I think it's for younger people.
Huge selections of beer as you would expect in a brewhouse, large selection of wines and mixed drinks. 
Adequate food choices from dinners to. pizzas, salads, appetizers, everything was good. We got the corn fritter appetizer, very nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this establishment often. The staff is always very friendly and quick, which we like. We love their Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza, but they've taken it off the menu. Most of the time they'll make it for us anyways, but a couple times, when ordering via phone we were denied our special request."}
{"text":"YOU NEED TO READ SOCIAL MEDIA!!! I had high hopes for your new restaurant, but since it opened, it's ratings on Yelp have been going steadily downhill. You need to bring in a professional management team to turn this new opening around. We were told an hour wait at 6:15 pm on a Saturday night, and though I noticed a lot of open tables sitting for quite a while, we weren't seated until 7:30 after I went up and pointed out an open booth. I like the setup, I like the menu, and actually, I could like the food. The beer selection is top notch as is the layout. We ordered an app of fried calamari, and the order was out exactly when the waiter took the order in. And it was barely luke warm. We sent it back, since a $9.95 app of calamari of that size better be spot-on. It's replacement came out 30 MINUTES later. And it could definitely have been more crispy and less greasy. And nothing close to an apology from anyone.

We had a table of 3, consisting of 2 burger orders and a salmon quinoa bowl. After our dinners were delivered 30 minutes after the appetizer was finished(!), no questions as to whether we needed anything else. Ketchup on the side? No offer. Sauce on the side that was ordered for the salmon  - no sign, and no one asking. Everyone was quite happy with the food - burgers, fries and salmon were all cooked perfectly. So the fault is NOT with the food. As we sat during our 3 hour and 15 minute experience, we noticed an awful lot of unoccupied tables and a continuing waiting crowd. That's lost revenue, especially after these people suffer bad service. I really think this is a reasonably easy fix, but you better get it done soon. Once a new restaurant gets a bad rap, it's very hard to overcome, especially with several new restaurants opening right in the same development. Since this is your first entry in the area, you may want to polish your local image.

Oh, and parking is horrendous. Who thought up building 3 restaurants in a row with a Trader Joe's in the middle, with a small shared parking lot?

Summary: decent menu, food good but could be way better, food delivery horrendous, table turnover and wait time estimate poor, wait staff inattentive, bar and draft selection above par."}
{"text":"We tried BJs again. Service was excellent but the food was Ho hum. We brought home most of the food as leftovers but decided it wasn't worth eating, so we threw it away. 

The website features food that is no longer offered so we made the trip here for nothing. Extra star for the server who was professionally and  friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here quite a bit and always receive great service and perfect food. The deep dish pizza is always prepared just right. We usually split the santa fe chicken salad as well and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Generally love BJ's and go to a different location, but will never be back again.  Absolutely terrible. Our waitress was awful. Not attentive, slow, forgot everything, never checked in, drinks took 15 mins after ordering, bad BO, trippin'. Then the food...potato skins were pathetic and no cheese at all on 4 of them. Avocado rolls...part of the pit was in the roll, but they didn't care.  Pizza...cold! Literally took bread and put toppings on it and brought it out. Cheese wasn't melted, nothing stuck, pan wasn't hot. Then it wasn't cut and nothing to serve it with. Complained and they brought another small pizza 20 mins later (everyone was done eating), which was no better.  The manager said he is teaching life lessons in the kitchen and knows they have a lot of fires going on. Weird for him to say any of that, but bottom line fix it! Take care of the customer. Make them happy. Produce good food. Try to do something. After all of this, the manager went to put the pizza in the box and realized it wasn't cut and couldn't get it out of the pan so he dumped it upside down and then flipped the box over. Ridiculous! Toppings everywhere's (since they were never melted or stuck). Then monkey bread...no sauce, dry, over cooked and ice cream. We asked where the sauce was (the butter/cinnamon/caramel stuff) and they said they ran out. So instead of telling us that prior or offering to switch desserts they brought out a dry terrible dessert missing the main ingredients to make it good. 

No one cared.  They comp'd the 1 small pizza since we didn't even eat it being it was cold, but nothing else! Party of 8. Major issues. Complaints. 2.5 hours of ridiculous service. Waited 28 mins to get our check after requesting it multiple times. First time in my life I debated walking out and not paying, but we didn't obviously because we are responsible human beings. What a cluster of a place, customer service, management and food!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great atmosphere!

They have a wide variety of stuff on the menu ranging from bar fare to tapas style smaller plates to specialty drinks and some great desserts.

We started with the fried artichokes - crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The aoili dipping sauce was perfect.

I dined on the open faced pot roast sandwich which was super tender. It actually tasted home cooked. It was served over garlic toast and mashed potatoes and covered in a brown jus gravy. Mmmmmm. Seriously yummy.

For dessert we had the beignet. Um, yes. YES. It was covered in real strawberries and whipped cream and ice cream and was friggin' delicious.

This place was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan chain restaurants, but BJ's does a pretty good job of making you forget your are at one. The menu can be overwhelming but the food is consistently good and the service is attentive. I think some of the prices are ridiculously expensive  ,like who would pay $16 for spaghetti,  but I don't blame this location. In summary, the food and service is good and the menu offers a nice variety."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch & were seated right away.  It was pretty busy but our server got our drink order right away.  We took some time to look at the pretty large menu & decided on getting something off of the lunch menu. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken & hubby ordered Buffalo Wings.  Food came out quickly & piping hot.  My chicken breast was delicious but very small, which I guess isn't a bad thing since it's just lunch.  The country gravy served with the chicken is delicious & their shoestring french fries are so crispy & flavorful! I think I could make a meal out of their fries & gravy, actually! We decided to try their pizookie sampler & chose peanut butter, oreo & salted caramel. Omg. I'm salivating thinking about those little pizza pans of awesomeness.  They were warm & oh so delicious. PB was our favorite :)

When it was time to pay my husband realized he left his wallet at home, no biggie, I have mine...wait (digs thru purse)...no...no I don't. Crap. So we're sitting there & my husband says he will go all the way home & get it.  Luckily, I glanced over at the little BJ Rewards sign at our table & noticed it says that if you sign up for their rewards program you can pay your bill with your phone! Whoa. Talk about perfect.  So we did & thank goodness because I really wasn't looking forward to sitting at the table awkwardly while my husband went back home ;)

We'll definitely be back for dinner & drinks because their beer & drink menu looked pretty neat!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quality budget dinner.  Be sure to take advantage of the call ahead feature one hour before you plan to arrive.  We were promptly seated on arrival  Nearly every table taken at 6:30pm Saturday but not too noisy.  The short wall dividers between the bar and the booths for four and between the two rows of the booths for two really helped.  

We had the Peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp and the seared ahi salad, both really excellent.  Only $50 with two cocktails, tax, and tip.  

Service was prompt at all stages and our waiter stopped by several times to check in."}
{"text":"I have always loved the pizza here. McGregor hears about my less than satisfactory experience at another location, and took it upon himself to take care of us completely. I was overwhelmed with gratitude to his willingness to make our experience over the top awesome! Thanks McGregor!"}
{"text":"This review is based on JUST the Superstition Springs location:
My favorite kind of pizza is from BJ's. My husband and I usually get half pepperoni and half buffalo chicken as toppings. Other than a Caesar salad and a pazookie, I have not tried anything else... so this review is based on just these foods alone. The pizza is extraordinary and just one slice will make you feel full! We tried the pazookie (ice cream with a cookie) a couple of times here, but I have had better elsewhere. Actually, their pazookie makes me a little sick. Their ice-cream tastes cheap and frothy. 

Normally, I would give BJs a 4.5 star review, but because of my most recent experience at the Superstition Springs location, I am going to bring my starred review a couple notches. We invited some friends to BJs and advised them they could not go wrong with the pizza! My husband has a fatal allergic reaction to olives, so we always make sure to tell the waiter to NOT put olives on anything he eats. BJs has usually accommodated this request, and I appreciate that. However, I feel that our waitress at Superstition was largely incompetent. Well, I was correct! While we waited for our pizza (which took an hour-- it has never taken an hour, okay?) our water glasses remained empty (for an hour people!) The waitress never came to refill our glasses. We were annoyed by it, and even a little embarrassed that we had raved so much to our good friends we had invited about the restaurant. When our pizza finally came, there were OLIVES on the pizza!"}
{"text":"My best friend loves coming here for happy hour/lunch. We used to come all the time until the manager made a snippy comment about us going other places more, so we stopped coming at all for awhile. But last week we went back and it was good. I love the southwest salad with salmon on top. It's a tiny bit spicy and the dressing is just right-not goopy. I love the avocado's and black beans and the red pepper they use to dust the plate. It just works for me, especially with happy hour glasses of pinot grigio! MMmm!"}
{"text":"Food sucked no flavor at all. Everyone hated their food .. service was not their from the minute we walked in ."}
{"text":"3rd visit not good!
Waited for server to bring waters
Took her 10min
Then server sets them down
And takes another table their drinks 
Doesn't return until she turns in their order 
Then busses another table!
We left!"}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Great pizza and half price on Mondays is awesome.  Beer selection is nice too.  Decor is very cozy."}
{"text":"I don't typically give chains a 5 star review but we had an OUTSTANDING experience at this BJ's last weekend and here we are a week later and I'm still very pleased! We had a group of 12 people and from the time of reservation to the time we got our check we received 5 Star treatment all the way! 

The food was good, the service was EXCELLENT, and the overall experience was top notch! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was delicious Jessica and Anthony were great waiters. Made sure my bloody Mary's were always on point. All and all everything was awesome !! Thank u !!"}
{"text":"Was seated right away which was surprising because it was a busy weekend and we had a party of five. But it was probably 10-15 minutes before a waiter came to get our drink order. Another 10 minutes before we got our drinks. Service is definitely slow. Burgers, fries and beer were delicious!"}
{"text":"Yep, I am a fan. Yep, it is a chain. It's a chain done right and I give credit where credit is due. I enjoy a good beer, and whether it's a BJ's house brew or a guest tap, I always find something hoppy and malty to drink. I usually patronize the bar area, which is my go-to at most establishments, and this one is non-smoking so it's always a good choice. Servers and bartenders are always great and if you can make it to a beer dinner I highly recommend it.

Besides beer, I generally order stuffed mushrooms, potato wedges (not fries), salad (they have several that I like) or pizza. On a rare occasion I have a pizzookie. It's an awesome dessert, I just don't do sweet very often. 

The mushrooms are probably my favorite menu item. I think they are stuffed with the spinach and artichoke dip, among other things, and I cannot get enough of them. The pizza is great. It's pan pizza, like pizza hut style only really good. Not to be confused with deep dish, it's just a nice thick buttery crust and just slightly doughy. Health food it is not."}
{"text":"Consistently average. The best part of the place is the beer flights.  For the brews alone it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We were excited to see BJ's was finally open.  We called ahead so we wouldn't have to wait to long, which worked out great.  We had the wasabi Brussel Sprouts - which was excellent    My daughter had the Seared Ahi Tuna salad which she truly enjoyed, I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken - which was delicious.  My husband really enjoyed the Chicken Club Sandwich and fries.  They both enjoyed a few of the craft beers.   Service was great.  It was a little higher priced but much better quality food than Applebee's.  Loved the extensive menu and are definitely planning to return."}
{"text":"Used to love coming to BJ's to eat but....... what happened to the food ? Price of salads skyrocketed. And the new BBQ menu is the worst. The chicken and fries are sooo salty that we couldn't stand it. The waitress knew too. The pork sliders was so-so but the bbq sauce needs to be redone. Who ever did the taste test for their sauce needs to be fired ! This is their big promotional push for salted foods so you would order more drinks. This is not the BJ's I once knew. Your done BJ's."}
{"text":"I was actually really impressed, even though I didn't think I would be.  I headed here for lunch last week when Chipotle was super busy.

They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did).

I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.

My server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.  Very friendly, not over-crowding.

I'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat), but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!"}
{"text":"Very prompt service during happy hour on a busy Friday. My waitress Alysha was super attentive and polite even though she was working a party of over 15 next to me. I went especially for the seasonal Summer \"Watermelon Mojito\" and I ordered a Jalapeño turkey burger. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Dont do it!!! Food poisoning from the happy hour chicken taco's...i would have rather ran a marathon than get that sick ever AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment! This place offers a full menu that has literally every single food item you could possible imagine. The service is very good as well! 

I usually am not a dessert person at restaurants but you cannot come here without getting the pazooki!"}
{"text":"Always yummy...this last time my hubbie ordered the wedge salad, ....oooo it was blue cheese heaven!! This place never misses. I also love there lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"So this is just a drink review. Bjs has an amazing selection of crafted beer. I tried the Nit Wit, Jeremiah Red and the Harvest hefeweizen. They were excellent! If you are a beer drinker, put bjs on your map and check it out for a fun time!"}
{"text":"Lunch crowd was very busy but the bar has open tables and booths. Nice menu selection and good weekday deals. I had lunch special half California chicken sandwich, soup, and fries for $7.99. Tuesdays is half off all wine by the glass and bottle so I also took advantage of that! Nothing really special but over all good service, good atmosphere and make sure to take a look at their daily specials."}
{"text":"Let me just say, James P. has the best service I've ever received. He was such a nice person and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for our night out. I love coming to this BJ's because I know that we will always have great service! Bj's is so lucky to have a server like you!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were amazing and had a great selection of beers on tap.  Did. It try any of the entrees, but they looked delicious as well.  I have four stars because I didn't try the entrees and the wait time was crazy."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was just okay. We started at the bar and had a few drinks before being taken to our table by the friendly hostess. 

We ordered the lettuce wraps. They were pretty good, but there was not enough filling for all of the lettuce they gave us (I am talking about a scoop per lettuce piece if even that). Tasted pretty good though, but nothing spectacular. 

As a main ordered the barbacoa bowl and my husband had the fish tacos. The bowl was okay but extremely salty. I probably shouldn't have ordered that at a place like this (I should just stick to chipotle for that stuff). My husband said the fish tacos were just average. Maybe we should have stuck to their pizza or burgers thought. 

I ordered their peach beer which I enjoyed as well. 

Overall, average food, good beer selection, great place to watch a game. We would give this place another go."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start when complementing BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, but I'll give it a go. Once you enter this heaven brehouse if there isn't a line to hold you up in of course the wait is worth it.  

If your lucky enough to get a seat at the bar then you'll be able to see there many beers they have on tap. There food is well prepared, and they also have wine if your not so much a beer drinker. The one thing that did draw me away while drinking were the high chairs they use in the upper part for seating, but the multiple flat screen TVs took my mind off of that almost right away. They do not have TouchTunes so the music option is out, and all your left w/ is lite chatter w/ the friends your w/.

When you think of a brewery or Brewhouse usually you don't pair that w/ a family themed restaurant, and yet BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse completes that circle."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for soup and something light and we were served by Jennifer R. who was friendly, quickly took our order and made us feel beyond welcome. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"I don't come here very often but it's always nice when I do. The root beer is fantastic! I've never had a bad experience with service. The food is good but not fantastic. I typically get pizza.  Desert is always good but I'm usually too full to get it."}
{"text":"Does anyone else agree that the best part of a wedge salad is the blue cheese crumbles? I came here for take out just for two wedge salads and they both came with a pinch of blue cheese, so little I could barely taste it. I think my picture does justice. The take out service was alright and I tipped the lady that helped me but this wedge of lettuce and a sprinkle of tomato, onion and bacon is not worth $5+"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate something with friends, was promptly taken care of and spoken to by my first name (part of their great rewards program) shared a large half veggie/half meat deep dish! So delicious, also finished our meal with a triple chocolate pizookie! Great establishment!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sirloin steak which was a little too overdone but still very good. Our server insisted that I take another one with me because I was already quite full from the delicious artichoke appetizer I had. My husband loved his corn fritters & pizza and our server was top notch! Ask for Athena at the Henderson location."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the food here, but the southern fried chicken I ordered was seasoned with way too much salt (and I love salt!).  My husband ordered mozzarella sticks and buffalo chicken flatbread, which were both very good.  The service was excellent, as usual."}
{"text":"It seems the floor issue has been address and no more ice skating. Still, watch you step and you sit at one of the best bars around and an even better bartender in Amy. The food is pretty good (my fav is Cali flatbread) but the drink selection is mind boggling (I chose BJs own hop storm cuz I like the hops). Don't worry, Amy behind the bar will quick become your best friend and guide. With tons of insight and advice, she'll find you next favorite beverage. It's a local bar feel inside a national restaurant chain."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this location and my boyfriend and I were dissatisfied to say the least. This time around my deep dish pizza came out on a plate, not in the pan, and the bottom was completely mutilated. Once again I was brought nothing to separate the pizza so my fork and butter knife had to suffice. We ordered a pizookie trio, and they brought out the wrong flavor. I told our waiter, (who was awesome by the way) and he brought out another one right away. Which yet again was the incorrect flavor. The manager on duty came by our table to ask about our experience and I told her what happened. She proceeded to attempt to argue with me about what flavor the second pizookie was then quickly walked away and came back with our check. They ended up comping our meal because they goofed up. The first time we came to this location we had a similar experience. Awesome server yet again, but the kitchen staff just couldn't get it right. The food runners brought our food to the wrong table both times, and failed to bring anything to but the pizza with. The first time around we waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the restaurant was completely dead. On all three occasions we came it seemed like our servers were the only ones doing anything. The food runners and bus boys stood around gossiping and twiddling their thumbs. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I really loved the fact that you can order mozzarella tomato caprese instead of a regular salad. I had the Peanut chicken  Asian noodles and my husband had the ribs. Everything was amazing! The waitress was patient and gave great advise on which beers to try. My husband really liked the in-house brewed Hippy Dippy Beer. Really great food and service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, restaurant is clean and service was great. We would highly recommend this place to all in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came in for quick pizza and beer at the bar and we were served really fast (like unusually fast for BJS on Saturday night). Pizza was great as always. Never had a bad deep dish here. Really friendly bartender named Tiara. She was great, quick and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The salad was decent and my beer was good, but for one person and those two items my bill came in at almost $30, including tax and tip. With so many incredible options in and around the city that's really a bit too high for an experience like this, in my opinion. 

That's not to say BJ's isn't without merit. The menu is huge, so if you're coming with a big party, all taste buds are likely to be accommodated. Bonus for a robust \"light\" menu as well. 

Our group numbered well over 10 people at any given time during the evening, and was served in just over two hours, including multiple waves of orders. So, kudos for quick service.

In short, if you're looking for an average but quality experience you are likely to find it here, no judgement!"}
{"text":"What a zero establishment. When I got the check, they inserted a business card for Mr. Uphoff, the manager. This implies that he is concerned about your opinion. Not even close. 

If you are unfortunate enough to get the waitress Jeramie, run. Cold, uninterested, useless and doesn't care about the customer or her job. 

I wrote Mr. Uphoff a detailed email detailing our experience commenting on positives and negatives. No Response. Not even an auto reply. Zip. After 4 days I forwarded it to corporate. No Response. They are disinterested. 

Go elsewhere. They food is marginal, service is weak and I spent $65 for lunch for 3 people. No drinks at all. Seriously. Any place is better."}
{"text":"Our server Ruben and his trainee Erin were great, I would like to say especially Erin who took great care of us. Because we used their app, we had 20% off from our check. Their Avocado egg rolls are always delicious! We were very thankful for her service."}
{"text":"Not my first visit here, but it's time for a review. First visit, shortly after they opened was fine. Each subsequent visit has gotten worse. Today was the icing on the cake. 

In for a very late (3 pm) lunch. Not very many patrons, plenty of wait staff. Seated for several minutes before the server came to our table. That's as good as the visit got. Lukewarm cheese sticks with about a tablespoon of marinara. We asked politely for more marinara, and my wife ordered a specialty tea. When the tea came, the glass was maybe 3/4 full. It was a basic iced herbal tea, and my wife wanted sugar. Okay, we'll ask when the additional marinara comes. Nope. No sign of marinara ten minutes later. No sugar (or salt and or pepper) at the table. Twenty minutes after ordering, we still haven't seen our main course, two hard-to-prepare salads. My wife was trying to be patient so we waited. Good thing, since our server was chilling against an empty table for at least ten minutes while we were waiting. It was apparently the thing to do. I like bucking the system, though. We asked for the manager. When we asked for our check, he apologized and covered our cold appetizer but didn't really seem surprised. 

Every aspect of this visit was miserable. With ample dining choices in the area, we may have visited for our last time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to BJ's for a few years and I had forgotten how great the food is there.  Went on a busy Friday night, but only had to wait about 20 minutes or so to be seated.

Started with classic potato skins.  Perfect.  Cheddar, bacon, and cheese with sour cream and/or ranch dressing.   Bring friends, this is not a single serving plate.

For the entree I chose the Tuscan Chicken Lemone.  It's new on the menu and I hope they keep it for a some time.  Wonderful flavor - lemon and butter, good stuff.  Pasta was tasty too.  And the cheese bread?  Don't get me started. 

Normally at BJ's I would have a beer, but I felt like something different so I ordered a nonalcoholic berry cider.  Only lightly sweet and very snappy, it was quite refreshing and a nice change from overly ambitious drinks that crowd out the flavors of a good meal.

Too full for desert so nothing to report.  The service was very good - prompt, accurate, and engaging.  

The only issue we had was with the fold out extension for our table.  Every time my friend (G.) hit the top of the table too hard (he's a big guy, but still) the magnetic latch would give way and the extension would swing down and whack one of us in the leg.  After a while I just moved my leg out of harms way and was mildly entertained every time G. would get stung in the thigh.  Probably an anomaly, but a stronger magnet might be a good idea."}
{"text":"This is the best food restaurant! I love the options they have and it's perfectly seasoned! Don't get me started on the pizookie!"}
{"text":"I came in yesterday and the food was terrible. I ordered the fettuccine chicken alfredo without chicken and the fettuccine wasn't just al dente, it was undercooked and hard. The food came out  kind of cold and I ended up finding chicken in it. Yesterday the service was fine, but a couple times before we had very odd servers and one with very very poor hygiene. I definitely won't come to this location again."}
{"text":"Decent food, but they are soooo god-awful slow! Expect 1.5 hours on a weekend evening. It could be our particular server, but it's slow about 50% of the time."}
{"text":"It's good. 

If you've been to any other BJs, you will recognize the inside of this one, which is just fine. 

First, their beers are very good.

Next, the menu is a vast book, kind of like of Cheesecake Factory did a THI Fridays. There are lots of starters. I suggest the avocado egg rolls. Excellent (but heavy)!

Their entree salads are good. Their pizzas are very good. The floor is well staffed and the service is good."}
{"text":"I'm at this restraunt regularly and my thoughts are that the food is delicious but its really a hit or miss on the service. Some days are great and somedays are terrible. I will say this though, there is a waiter here named Anthony who is literally THE BEST SERVER I have ever had! He goes above and beyond for his patrons. He is always on the ball with great customer service, timely refills and answers for any questions or menu exceptions. Everytime we get him I know well be taken care of. Let's go Bjs give the kid a raise!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour which is 5-7PM. Their happy hour menu is limited and you can only have it at the bar which mean max 6-7 people can come because there isnt enough seating at the bar for a big group. 7 of us were forced to cram onto a small table, so there wasnt enough room to put more than 2-3 dishes on the table at a time. 1/2 off small deep dish pizzas which can feed 1 person (4 slices) and 1$ off wine- we had to order 6 pizzas for 6 people. The beer wasnt even worth getting on happy house so we just got pitchers cause it was cheaper. But they do brew their own beer here. 
Recommend: Hefeweizen and the Stout. Blonde taste like water/coors light/bud light- nothing special.
We ended up ordering the flat bread, calamari, nachos (which we didnt know were on the menu) and drinks as well as 5+ deep dish pizzas.
THE DEEP DISH PIZZAS ARE TO DIE FOR! i mean i can tell they were clogging my arteries as I ate them but Damn were they delish
the flat bread was ok, calamari was not bad, the worst thing was these half ass nachos that came with a small dollop of sour cream and even smaller dollop of gauc. Plus it didnt have meat on it just a haphazard mix of beans and cheese. Def dont recommend the nachos
The reason this place gets 1 star is due to 1 person and 1 person only: THE BAR TENDER NAMED TREVOR
Heres the story: My friend who was getting married had never tried a car bomb. I decided to get her one. This A**hole TREVOR decides to pour use 1/4 of a pint of Guinness and then 1 total (1/2 shot jameson and 1/2 baileys). To all that have ever ordered a car bomb: IT IS  1 PINT of GUINNESS
1 shot of Jameson poured into the GUINNESS
1 shot of baileys on the side. 
(Yes and I realize there is more than 1 way to make it but this is the way I've had it for the last 10 years- and my mom used to be a bartender!!!) 
For those our thinking this is just me and my friends trying to get more alcohol or that it was about the money- it is not. I WAS MORE than willing to pay for him to make the drink I was accustomed to. 
Anyways I go to the bar explain to Trevor this is not a car bomb and he argues with me saying it is that if he pours more Guinness that the cup will over flow. This guy is trying to serve me some Shitty 1/4 cup guinness and wants my friend to drop her shot glass into it where it will shatter and she will literally be chugging shards of glass. He tells me he wont do anyting about it so i call the manager who finally fills the PINT up only 1/2 way because TREVOR is a douche and he cant say no to the manager even though he knows well that it is supposed to be 1 PINT full (although when I asked the manager he never had a car bomb- so i dont blame the manager). And to prove to the manager I google the recipe and showed it to the manager and told him, his employee was arguing with me to which he did NOTHING. HORRIBLE SERVICE and management. I mean i just showed you the recipe and your going to tell me that Im wrong and not have your employee fix the drink?
TREVOR is incompetent and TREVOR should be fired. The guy cant even make a proper drink. 
DEF dont recommend getting a drink from him. And if you do check cause he has not had training with bartending. For all i know he said he put the 1/2 shot of jameson that was supposed to go into the drink, but for all i know he is lying and there was no jameson to begin with. NOT TO BE TRUSTED
HORRIBLE bartender, service was decent from our waiter (a filipino guy). 
Bottom line- a few more ounces of Guinness wasn't going to screw over his tab, but it was going to make me and my 6 girlfriends very happy- esp my gf who was getting married! And Trevor really ruined our experience there. He choose to fight with me instead of providing good customer service, all over a few ounces of beer. 

TiP if you decide to get past the horrendous-ness that is TREVOR, download the app:
1) you can pay your tab on it
2) you get reward points toward future visits
3) you get a free dessert which you can redeem if you show to your waiter- We got a free Pazooki"}
{"text":"everyone to their own opinion and this is mine about BJs in centennial.  If you are traveling up from the las vegas strip area, take the US 95 N and then go straight up to the Ann rd exit.  Take it left to all the shopping and eateries.  Follow it to BJs on the left you can't miss it.  Parking is ample and as soon as you walk in, it has a very lively  vibe. This is the second time we ate here and we loved it so much the first time, we needed to return when we came back into vegas.  I would have gave full stars this time but our waiter wasn't that great.  So, sat and he came up and was not interested in US, just wanted to see if we had a card with the restaurant and we said no and he left and didn't come back for a while.  Upon his return he stated that he needs to know if we wanted a frequent diner card and we said \"NO thank you\" because we don't live in vegas and he walked away again.  Now, someone else came back to do our drinks and then he came to take our order and didn't seem to want to help with our questions.  So, we just ordered what we knew and then he was on his way.  The food came and made up for the poor service.  We had shrimp scampi (if you like drier scampi like I do and lots of garlic with angel hair pasta...this was awesome) the husband kids had stuffed mushrooms, cheese sticks, chicken pasta and the grilled salmon.  All five of us devoured our meals and appetizers.  No room for desserts...had the pizookies the last time and they were fun but not good enough to make room for.  Will return to BJs centennial again and again.  We like the cleanliness of the place and the neighborhood is great.  We used to live in Vegas and loved this area."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, my favorite is the avocado egg roll! I order the appetizer as an entree. My husband loves the pizzas."}
{"text":"Went to BJ's on Eastern in Henderson,   was great food nice atmosphere.  The Atlantic Salmon was amazing.  I would recommend BJ's for all to try.  Not overly priced either."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. There was a short wait for a table. I ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer and they were very good. The wife who normally would not touch them also liked them a lot. For lunch I had the brisket bacon burger and it was incredible. She had the French dip and was very pleased with it as well. The fries were hot and crispy but could be better.

Service was fast but expect about 45 minutes from the time you walk in until you walk out. The food is a bit on the expensive side $10 and up for burgers however the quality is certainly worth it.

I plan on going back tomorrow.

So I went back and had the double burger this time. Excellent but not as good as the brisket burger. Service was a bit slower but still above average. I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"There was NOTHING bad about this visit.  I usually am not a fan of chain restaurants, but we were in the area and decided to stop in.  We arrived at 3ish on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was sufficiently full, but we were seated and greeted, right away.  Our server approached and explained some of the specialty items, such as their handcrafted sodas and pizzas.  We proceeded to order, potato skins as an appetizer.  I ordered the Shrimp Quinoa bowl with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My daughter ordered deep dish pizza and my husband ordered the chicken club sandwich with fries.  The potato skins arrived a short time later, huge portion, definitely large enough to share.  There was a side of ranch dressing, as well as sour cream.  Our entrees arrived shortly thereafter.   My bowl, contained brown rice, mixed with quinoa, topped with roasted tomatoes, wilted spinach, mushrooms and a generous portion of seasoned shrimp.  The portion was more than sufficient and it was simply delicious.   The Brussel sprouts were really good, seasoned nicely with cracked black pepper and undertones of lemon....delicious.  My husband and daughter enjoyed their meals, as well.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, but the food is sub-par. Service varies from good to decent. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"I went to different BJ's over the years and hardly have any bad experience with them. Their food are exceptional and always received excellent service, especially at this location. The server that helped us were super friendly and constantly checked on us. We didn't even have to ask for the refill with our drinks.
We ordered the following items
Appetizers:
Chicken wings $11.50 - ask them to split in half buffalo and root beer glaze. Very crunchy and little oil. 4.8/5
Avocado egg rolls $11.50 - still prefer the one from Cheesecake but their tamarind sauce is good though 3.5/5
Crispy calamari $11. 50 - pretty much similar to other restaurants but not that oily. 4.2/5

Entrees:
-full back pork ribs Thursday promo $17.95 it came with two items and a mini pizookie - worth getting this deal if you happen to come here on Thursday. The sauce amount of sauce was perfectly applied to the ribs and the meat was super tender 4.8/5
-seared ahi salad - $15.95 - my brother ate the meat and I ate the salad. Their rice vinaigrette sauce wasn't that sour 4.4/5
-seafood tacos $10.75 - my brother said the seafood was well marinated and he would give it 4/5 :-). 
-steak top sirloin - $16.50 nothing special about this dish 3.8/5
-Shrimp & asparagus pasta - $16.95 - too salty and somehow the flavor wasn't there 3/5
- tavern cut flatbread brew house classic with pineapple - $17.25 must eat it while it still hot but very crunchy. They burned it a little though 3.5/5
- Tavern cut garlic chicken pesto $15.95 - too dry would be better if they have little bit more sauce 3.5/5
-Spaghetti with meatballs $9.99 - my daughter regret that she she ordered this dish. The dish was too dried and nothing special with the sauce. 2.5/5
I opted not to order my dish so I could try out all the dishes :-). Anyhow, I love their root beer drink."}
{"text":"Just not all that.  If I am eating at the Chandler Mall then there are 4 restaurants I would rather eat at."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. If I felt like going back to the restaurant I would. This is totally unacceptable!!

Update - The Executive Chef reached out to me and went above and beyond to correct this. She also explained that the pizza I was given was the pepperoni extreme. I ordered a pepperoni with extra cheese. I should have clarified. Due to the extra effort to correct this, I'm changing my rating. Additionally, the pizza I received today was fantastic. Thanks Kim!!!"}

{"text":"BJs was a place that my husband and I frequently would visit, mainly due to the late hours they have. We routinely pick up food from here and have given this restaurant multiple chances after they CONSTANTLY mess up our orders and finally, enough is enough, and I can't see a time when we're coming back. Back on Veternan's Day my husband and I picked up food to go; my order was severely messed up (missing toppings, wrong side), and I called the restaurant to let them know. The worker was apologetic and said we would get refunded; I gave our card number that it was purchased on and three weeks later, still no refund. Obviously, refunds don't take that long so we went back into the restaurant to ask about the refund. While we waited for a manager, one of the chefs came out and discussed how \"crazy\" the restaurant was and busy on Veteran's Day, and they messed up a lot of orders. I chuckled inside because I was thinking, first of all, a restaurant should be prepared to deal with demand, secondly; you mess up our orders all the time. Eventually, the manager came out who really seems to be like a nice guy; we have talked to him several times due to the multiple times our orders are botched. He offered us either our money back or a $25 gift card, so we accepted the gift card and left. Later, we wanted to grab dinner, so I ordered food from BJ's on their application. I ordered a sandwich and a turkey burger and within minutes my cell phone rang, it was BJs saying the order had come through as a large pizza and that the cooks in the back thought it was odd that a pizza had mayo on it, so they figured something had happened. What was confusing is the fact that they assumed it was a pizza, but they said all the customizations we added to our order were visible. My husband made sure they could see all of our customizations, asked about them, and they said they had the order correct, and it would be ready for pick-up shortly. When my husband went to pick up our order, after being in there for 20 minutes or so, he saw the turkey burger had a side salad with it. He questioned the worker saying that wasn't right, and she argued that the turkey burger comes with a side salad WITHOUT dressing. He said I know, but my wife changed her side to fries (why would you argue and what is the point of customizing an order if they can't get it right?). My husband then was obviously skeptical that the rest of the order was right, and he asked if the turkey burger had onions on it (I love onions and previously when I ordered the turkey burger they left onions off, which is stupid because one of the toppings it comes with IS onions), the worker replied that onions were on it because it comes on it. Well, thankfully my hubby is smart or just knows how bad they are, so he asked for some onions on the side. Anyway, we get home; I go to look at the toppings on my turkey burger and sure enough -- no onions. I could go on and on about all the times that they have messed up our order, and even though we had a gift card, we still paid too much for service and food like this. One other example, one time we placed a take-out order and ordered a specific pizookie - the restaurant wasn't able to see what flavor pizookie we wanted, and what flavors of ice cream, so instead of calling us, they gave us whatever they wanted (are you kidding? Prices are way too high for this kind of service). We are very loyal customers, and we won't be coming back anytime soon. Something with the way this restaurant runs is severely broken and obviously nothing is fixing it. The sad part is this was our first time being back since they messed up our previous order, and here they go again getting it wrong. It is sad that places like McDonald's mess up my order a lot less than a place that is much more expensive."}
{"text":"First time there, we were impressed. The wings were great and Clam chowder in sourdough bread was great.
Service was very good and attentive, of course we had to have the Peanut Butter Pizookie o complete the meal"}
{"text":"I really like BJ's. Food is great but service is kind of slow. It's like they don't have enough employees. The guy that served our table was great but you can tell he was overworked by having way too many tables. We placed our order and we ended not getting our appetizer just because it was simply too many customers and not enough help.I felt bad for him and tried not to make any requests. I hope they hire more people soon!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Bj's when I lived in Orange County. I was stoked when I moved here and found out that there was one fairly close by. This place gets very packed on a weekend or Friday night but I have no problems with it. The staff is very friendly, fast and delivers great service. Love the huge menu they have with tons to choose from. My personal favorite is the Buffalo chicken pizza paired with my favorite beer a Jeremiah Red. If you got room left in your stomach  there's the pazookie which is a bit of heaven baked into a cookie topped with icecream."}
{"text":"Great layout, tasty looking menu, creative drinks, friendly staff, but but needs just a little fine tuning on operation. Bj's has been open at this location for aprox a month and I think it will be extremely popular once they're rolling.

Experience: We received prompt seating at 4pm in a nice, large booth facing all of the sports games (which was perfect). Our server was friendly and sweet. We ordered the artichoke appetizer and soup salad combos. We requested our food to be \"coursed\": app first, then salad, then soup after salad so that the soup wouldn't get cold while we were eating everything else (this has happened to me before and so I was specific about it). *This didn't happen. 
The app came out extremely hot and so we had to wait for it to cool. We didn't mind that, but then our soup and salads arrived together....and we weren't finished with the app and the soup was warm, not hot, which meant it went cold by the time we were finished with our salads...which is why I asked for it to be timed out. Nobody wants to eat cold clam chowder. The timing of the food was disappointing. *Side note: They need to check the silverware before wrapping it.

Food: The artichoke app was slightly briny but ok.
House salad was delicious with fresh greens and veggies and I really like the balsamic dressing (ask for it on the side). The Caesar salad was way over dressed. I'm not exaggerating, we didn't finish it. The clam chowder had nice flavor and we would order it again. However, I would want it to be a good temp instead of warm to cold. *Tip: No bread, crackers, or anything served with it, so you may want to order it in a bread bowl if you're looking for that. The Smores Pizookie came out perfect. I like that they offer a Pizookie Trio so that you can try more than one kind if you choose. 

They have daily deals and the servers should offer those when giving you the menu's. It makes you wonder if the staff gets to do menu tasting so that they can let you know what's their favorites are or what's popu

We'll be back because we see the potential and know they just opened and it takes time to perfect things. I am detailed in this review in hopes that they will make adjustments because I really like the place. Not to be harsh. I would give it 3 1/2 stars and my relative said 3 stars. 

Another user wrote that if you check in on Yelp that you get a free Pizookie or App...I checked in, but didn't get that notification/ offer...disappointing :(."}
{"text":"2.5

It hurts my heart to write this because I went here three days after its grand opening and everything was amazing.  The food was great. The service was honestly the best I can remember having at a restaurant.  I ordered their Asian salad and the chicken was cooked to perfection

I came back on Monday of this week during lunchtime to meet my family for a quick meal.  My quick meal ended up taking over an hour and a half for a total order of: 2 unlimited soup and salad meals, the santa fe salad, and my brother got some type of chicken dish.  Aside from the fact that they have one group of people waiting on tables and another group running the food and that is clearly extremely confusing and only causes more issues than productivity, I think the entire process needs a review.  I think their way of trying to be efficient having people designated to sections & tasks in this huge place is more negative than it is positive.

I won't get into details, but my parents' soups and salads were coming out in doubles without spoons, our waiter was nowhere to be found for a period of time, three different people brought out the orders.  It was just chaos.  My brother and mom had also been here on two separate previous times within a week and had the exact same issue with the confusion.

They have really really great food here plus an extremely extensive menu, but if you are looking for somewhere to go on a date or somewhere to relax, I would give BJs a couple months to get everything sorted out and settled.  I know I will wait to go back."}
{"text":"After being gone for two years, I was extremely excited about coming back to this restaurant and extremely disappointed to find the most hateful hostess waiting to seat me. There was not a welcoming smile or even look when she asked number of party. She then explained how to find our table and told us to go sit and she would bring the menus along. First impression of one of my favorite past times was horrible, however, the server was amazing and the food was delicious. Must try the honey-crisp  chicken salad!"}
{"text":"1st time there. Friendly staff with a clean and inviting atmosphere. Waited about 5 min to be seated but it was very busy and I now know why. I had a jalapeño burger, wife had the chili, kids had spaghetti, sirloin steak and chicken tenders. All were terrific with wonderful flavor. Total bill came out to $90 which is awesome for 5 ppl. Until next time!"}
{"text":"I've found items on their menu hit or miss...the appetizers and small plates are good. I especially like the honey sriracha brussel sprouts and crispy fried artichokes. However,   I was not impressed with their pizzas"}
{"text":"BJ's never disappoints. I love this chain. From the extensive menu to the consistently good service, it's really a one stop shop for me. 
Tonight, I dined alone and BJ's is excellent at accommodating parties of all sizes. They have small 2 person booths, larger booths, easily combined standalone tables and bar tops. The perfect place for any size party. One thing I wish I could change about my job is the amount of times I dine alone. Don't get me wrong, after a long day of meetings and being surrounded by coworkers, sometimes it's nice to have some 'me' time, but I was raised having family dinners. Sitting on my own gets old but the way BJ's sets up the floor plans, I don't feel uncomfortable having to sit at a bar or an extra large table for one.
The food is a whole different topic. I will hunt down a BJ's anytime, for the quality and standard of food they present. No beverages this time but I enjoyed the double bone-in pork chop, sweet potato fries and steamed broccoli, for my entree. Dessert was a delicious pizookie trio of cookies and cream, peanut butter and chocolate chunk. Mmm mmm mmm!! Flawless!
Megan was a great waitress. They were pretty busy for a Thursday night but she made sure I was checked on, regularly. My entree took 10 minutes or less after I ordered it. I was starving so it was really perfect timing. The pizookie took a little longer than I expected but considering the crowd and we all seemed to be on roughly the same timeline for food, I think the kitchen got swapped. 
The meal in my photos, plus dessert and a starter Caesar salad was $34.05 (not including tip).  I'd call that reasonably priced, because it really was a lot of food. I'll always be a good customer here!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection, mediocre brewery.  Well, to be fair, we came here after a beer sampling session at Khoury's.  We had just finished drinking some of the finest beers available in Vegas (and some not available in Vegas).  

To drink I had the house brown ale.  It was sweet, dark, and very malty.  There was a strange chemical taste to it as well, perhaps.  I tried some of my friend's stout, and it was also pretty mediocre.  His description of this stout is classic, \"It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean.\"  What a great description, ha!  However bad the brewery is here, the guest beer selection is amazingly great, and completely makes up for it.  

If you aren't a beer drinker, the food here is worth having too.  I had the shrimp pasta, and loved it entirely.  It was more dry than typical restaurant pastas, which I loved because the sauces these places use usually get gross after a while.  I could eat this pasta all day.  It might have been a little over priced, but I didn't mind at all.  My friend had a big deep dish pizza.  I didn't try any, but it looked delicious (and he confirmed this for me).  We also had the potato skins as an appetizer, and again a huge hit.  These were big thick potato chunks with skin, along with bacon and cheese.  Yummy.  They came with ranch and sour cream sauces.

A little expensive, and the house brewery didn't impress me (as a craft beer drinker), but the guest beer selection was great.  The food was definitely top notch for a hipster type restaurant.  I'd go again!"}
{"text":"BJ's does a lot right. They greet you warmly when you walk in. They serve you quickly. They have an extensive menu, with a lot of options for appetizers. 

They have great options for vegetarians, and a gluten free section of the menu, too.

The food is very good, especially at their price point.

They have some pretty good beers, although they don't compare with some of the better local craft breweries. 

This place is packed, they have a strong following."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of bjs but this was my first time at this location and I probably won't be back to this one. First my daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo she asked for NO broccoli when she got it there was broccoli on it. Second I ordered a cherry Pepsi I got that but asked for a little more grenadine on the side it took 20 min to get it cause he forgot about it. Then I wasn't sure what I wanted so the waiter recommend this one burger so I asked if it had there special sauce on it and he said no then I asked if there was cheese on it and he said yes then I asked what else was on it and he said just bbq sauce so I got that he didn't tell me anything else that was on there, well when I got my food it had no cheese it had the special sauce on it and he failed to tell me there was green peppers and chopped tomatoes and onions on it. We told them about my daughters and when the bill came I was still charged for her food. My husband got the triple decker and asked the waiter for No mayonnaise and when he got his there once again mayonnaise on it. I understand there are going to be mess ups and I'm ok with that but on everyone's food that I had with me is a little much if you don't remember what people ask for you sure need to write it down. And one more thing every time if we need anything he never stopped at the table it was just a walk by is everything ok or do u want dessert . Not a good waiter."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Frequent go to for the family.  Good craft beer, good specialty drinks, and good food."}
{"text":"Fiancé and I come here often. We each order something often. Let's start off with the food, the avocado egg rolls are superior , stuffed mushrooms are delicious, chicken tortilla soup looks small but is actually really filling, &parmesan garlic wings are a must. The waiters/ waitresses are extremely accommodating. And the plus is the food isn't that expensive, nor the drinks :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Came out here to visit my sis from California and just had the worst service ever! No napkins given to us at the bar, I had to send back the spinach artichoke dip since it came burnt and chew and half way filled, and I ordered a pizookie to cash in rewards point on my BJ's app it was never brought to us. I didn't want to stay any  longer with bad service so we just left without it! Such a disappointment. I frequent Bj's in California and what a let down out here!"}
{"text":"I have been to BJ's twice now and was extremely impressed after my first trip.  I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken with Rice and black beans and my girlfriend got the pesto chicken sandwich, both of which were delicious.  We also ordered the sliders, which were really flavorful - but the buns were really greasy.

I was excited to take some friends there after having a really good first experience, and we went back yesterday and couldn't have been more disappointed.  The menu is very large, which in theory isn't a bad thing as long as you can make all of the dishes well.  We ordered the avacado egg rolls and a mini pizza for appetizers.  One of us got chicken tacos and 3 of us ordered burgers done \"medium.\" 

Our appetizers came out a few mins AFTER our main courses.  The Medium burgers all came out WELL done.  Zero pink in the middle, char burnt on the outside.  It made for an extremely below average burger experience.  The avacado egg rolls has a brownish tint to them - which indicated that the avacado wasn't prepared freshly.  They were very average.  The pizza and chicken tacos were really good - and because of the mixup with our order the manager comped us our dessert.  We got a few pizookies which was the highlight of the night.  

All in all really disappointed with the service.  Most of the knocks on this place are service related and it starts from the top down (management).  The servers were really polite and seemed to be doing the best they could.  Also don't waste your time ordering a burger here, opt for something else."}
{"text":"My dear sister mentioned we dine here on Saturday with my Mom and so glad we did.  They were a little busy in the dining are, so we took the option for the bar seating in a booth (we are non-drinkers) and so glad we did.  Two of us were famished, and the dark haired female server efficiently took our order, brought us a the delicious avocado eggroll appetizer and meals came out promptly.  They have the best Arnold Palmer's here and my sister and Mom mentioned the flavored ice teas here are wonderful.  My Mom had the cherry glazed salmon dinner and loved it, my sister had the Mediterranean pizza and was in awe of it as she said she had been craving it.  I opted for the my favorite chopped asian chicken salad and loved it with the great dressing and veggies - so good!  Check it out if you haven't been here for a while!"}
{"text":"Bj's has a great Tap beer selection.  I like how they also feature a few local Las Vegas Brews like Joseph James and Tenaya Creek.  The Bartender didn't seem to know much about the wall of taps except the one's brewed in house by Bj's.  That's ok I guess no one likes an overachiever anyways.

The location in centennial hills is always busy.  I have never been here with out having to wait for a table for 25+ minutes. Service is decent and consistent.  The menu reads like Tolstoy's  \"War and Peace\" with over a 1000 pages.  I find large menus incredibly annoying.  K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid) I bet they could get three more turns on each table a night if they did not give you a novel to select your dinner from.  

The food at Bj's is always decent.  Some creativity goes into the dishes to make the flavors come out.  I find myself always going for a burger but the Deep Dish Pizza is good also.  Overall solid place to have a consistently good meal.  They have some great happy hour specials on appetizers and $1 off on beers.  My favorite part is the great Beer selection.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the interior decor of the restaurant. Drinks and food are good, prices are a little marked up but it wont break the bank. Family and kid friendly, wait staff is okay need some work but it's a newly open restaurant so it's understandable. I'd definitely come back though!"}
{"text":"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants! The staff is always very nice and the food is amazing. I usually get the boneless wings (1 LB. of boneless wings for like $12!) and the two best flavors are the dry rub Sriracha or the garlic Parmesan. You can also ask them to do half of the Sriracha and half of the garlic Parmesan. My other favorite thing to order is the guacamole bacon burger. It's amazing and so tasty!"}
{"text":"Handicapped unfriendly .  The non-bar eating areas are all down several steps from the entrance level. This typically wouldn't be a problem except at BJ's.  The ADA required ramp is at the BACK of the building and the only way to get there is through the long, crowded and furniture-filled bar.  Impossible to navigate with a wheelchair or walker most of the time.

If you can't handle stairs, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Was here for a family birthday dinner...never been here before, but others had and said it was a really good place... couldn't agree more...had a small wait due to crowd but nothing too bad...service was excellent...loved the salad I got..was huge and tasty...everyone loved what they ordered...prices were very reasonable...will totally come back"}
{"text":"BJ's is honestly a restaurant that I've been dying to try for many, many months. Tonight the opportunity to try it out finally came up, and it left me wishing I chose Fire Rock (up the street) instead. I'm honestly not sure what time I walked into the restaurant, but I do remember the host recommended we sit in the bar. A few minutes passed before we were greeted. When I server dropped off the water and Sierra Mist, he pitched the happy hour menu. I checked the time to see if it was worth it, and it was 9:54 PM. We decided we'd order food off the regular menu when our server came back, and I'd order a beer off the happy hour menu after 10. It felt like a lot of time passed, so I decided to check the time. 10:14. 20 minutes had passed, yet our server never came back to take our order. No one even stopped by to help. By this time I was starving and couldn't wait any longer for food. We ended up walking out and grabbing fast food down the road. I've heard nothing but negative things about the service here, but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Turns out the rumors were true. I can't even say I'm mad. I'm just epically disappointed."}
{"text":"My first experience at BJ's could best be summed up as \"crap-tastic.\"

Here's how I arrived at that conclusion:

-Bad Service: My server looked like hated his life; he never cracked a smile once, nor did he ever check on or refill our our drinks, which were empty halfway through the meal.

-Dirty Glassware: At first glance, my water glass looked like it had some sort of flashy green garnish, like a mint julep might have. But this isn't the Kentucky Derby; this is BJ's. That green leafy thing sticking to the outside rim of my glass was a big ass piece of lettuce from someone else's meal, steam-stuck to the outside of my beverage. The offending lettuce was so big, so Mt. Rushmore-esque in size that I really don't know how even the busiest server could have missed it. Yuck.

-Bad Timing: The appetizers took 20 minutes to arrive; entrees came out roughly 2 minutes later.

-Improper temperatures: The nachos and the fried artichokes came out together; the nachos were stone cold, but the artichokes were nuclear hot. My chicken wings were crispy and delicious, but my boyfriend's wedge fries were cold next to a lukewarm hamburger. 

Less than 2 hours after eating at BJ's, dinner revisited both of us with a vengeance. . . in the bathroom. I wish I was joking about that."}
{"text":"The food was good as always. Our server Keisha was really nice. We had some minor issues with our order but they fixed it right away and offered us something to hold us out until our meal arrived."}
{"text":"This place was a good time. I had a cheeseburger and sampled a few brews. The servers were very nice and the atmosphere at this place was really good."}
{"text":"Service is crappy.. how can you make reservations and takes as long of a wait as a walk in? The it'll be ready in 5 mins ended in 45 min wait?"}
{"text":"I went there for brunch on a sat.  It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away and service was good.  I had a hef which didn't come w/ a lemon wedge but it was lemony without it.  I also had their stout which was nitrogenated but still wasn't creamy like a cask Guiness.  I had the breakfast pizza and it came with home fries.  The food was pretty good not the best but reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!!! Put ourselves on the online wait list and then waited 20 minutes to check in and was told you place doesn't count till you check. Why have an online check in then?!?! Waste of time"}
{"text":"I love this place but don't come here enough.  There are lots of options that everyone can find something that they like on the menu.  Next time I will have to remember to use their app to get on the list to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"This is the fastest I have EVER chosen to update my review from barely a week ago. I mention this to further attest to the seriousness to which I attach this addendum to my original review. It is not something I do often (or ever, actually) and I apologize for the need to do so, but given the turn of events, I feel that this update is required and is not done in a post haste mindset. 

Now, I specifically said in my original review that the reason that I chose to give BJ's a 4/5 star review was due to their decision to remove a long standing menu item that had been offered in their menu for well over a decade. The menu item in question is their former proprietary \"Cobb Sandwich\" which was removed from their menu approximately two years ago. 

After I posted my review, a customer service representative from BJ's commented on my review and said the following:

\"Hi Michael,

Thank you for your comments. We can still make the Cobb Sandwich for you, the only difference would have to use ranch instead of the creamy garlic dressing. Just let us know and we will be more than happy to make it for you. 

Thank you. 
Frank Acosta\"

Though I have not had the opportunity as yet to test this offer, I am trusting that Mr. Acosta being an employee and public representative of BJ's, is certainly speaking the truth. The next time I go to BJ's I will certainly order my favorite sandwich and can certainly get over the fact that ranch will replace the creamy garlic dressing of the original. This is much more minor of an update versus New Coke and Coke Classic. Yes, I realize that it potentially opens the doors of High Fructose Corn Syrup in CocaCola Classic versus original Coke, but that is a debate for another time (and Mexican Coke, made with real sugar, is all I carry in my fridge anyway). 

I personally wanted to thank Mr. Acosta for his comment on my review and thank BJ's in general for twenty years of delicious bar food in a fun and vibrant atmosphere. 

BJ's Brea was my headquarters through the mid to late 1990's and I still go there whenever we make it back to the old OC. 

Thank you, BJ's for creating the great Cobb Sandwich and for being an all around wonderful restaurant and nostalgic place to socialize and enjoy custom brews."}
{"text":"BJ's has something for everyone, and their food is delicious! The wait wasn't too long and my burger was cooked to perfection. I hear their pizookies are to die for. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"this is one of our favorite places to go have pizza. They are happy to do the pizzas half and half so we can have a variety. even on a crowded Saturday night the service was still good."}
{"text":"I come here often with my family for a quick meal that offers something for everyone. 

Although they do offer something for everyone,like all chains, its not always good. Same with the service. Most times its slow, especially if you sit at the stations in the far back. 

Ordered the lettuce wraps, the filling was all cold and there was little flavor. Even with the sauce added, now I only tasted salt. 
My husbands salad looked as though the lettuce had been out for sometime, and somehow the chicken fingers did not pass my daughter's tastebuds. 

Typically I have gotten a decent meal here. It could have been the night, but they were not that crowded. We were immediately seated.However I was surprised though that our server never asked if everything came out ok. I would have probably said something. 

I'm sure I'll go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant you think their training would be excellent and their customer service would be off the charts... not the case with this location. 
We came in at 3pm on Saturday, plenty of open tables but still a decent crowd. We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes before someone came to our table. When they did, she grabbed the pepper shaker to give to another server, did not say hello or even acknowledge us. Turns out, she was our server. 
When she came to get our drink order another 5 minutes later, we had so much time with the menu we asked if we could put in our order. All simple food, tacos, wings, soup & salad.  A salad was served at our table, way before our drinks. We then waited 22 minutes for our food. Yes, I timed it because everything else was taking so long. Finally our food came except for the bowl of soup. Refills were done before the soup was delivered to the table. While waiting I noticed plenty of servers at the hostess stand having free time, talking, singing and joking around. By the time my soup arrived, one of my friends had already finished her meal, and a second person was almost done. 
We were there over an hour and a half. No apologies for slow service, it was as though it was the norm. I also don't appreciate servers using pet names (baby, honey, love) when taking your order or serving your food and drink. 
The food was good, but with that kind of service, it's not worth the time."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!! Incredible food! I've been coming here for years and no matter what you're in the mood for,  they have something that will for your fancy. I have yet to taste anything in their menu that wasn't delicious!! (And I've pretty much tasted almost all of it) It's a great place for date night or hanging out with friends. And the waiter Kopy is AWESOME!! And don't forget to save room for a pizookie.. seriously drool worthy. I legit drooled on the table during a first date once.. don't judge me. Lol. Seriously,  just go here.  You'll be so glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Here with a large group and let me say that these stars are earned from our server Jake! He's super incredible and courteous. Thanks, Jake!! Oh, the food is good, the drinks are good, and I'm sure the other servers are cool too"}
{"text":"So, first visit to BJs in Desert Ridge..AND MY LAST!!!
I arrived with family to include my in laws. Well after waiting for a bit the waiter took our order. Thats where the \"ok\" part of this place stopped and why it should be out of business begins:
Bathroom: too dirty for dogs
Wait staff: 0 personality

My order arrived way after the rest & when it did it was NOT anything like what was on the menu. The person who delivered it gave me some lame excuse as to why it didnt and attempted to appease me with \" we'll make you another one\". Really??? You had 35 minutes to deliver something that looked like a heat and serve microwave dinner!?

DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"The environment can be chill or loud, depending on when you go. They have TVs everywhere, which are great for watching football on Sundays. They do take big groups, but told us they could only separate the checks 4 ways max. Also, parking is a pain during busy evenings/weekends, especially since it is right next to Olive Garden.

I do not like their pastas. The pizza is delicious. The strawberry lemonade is fantastic, but they can never seem to make a good batch consistently. The pizookie (white chocolate & macadamia is my fave) is unforgettable.

I go here often, usually with friends, but it is far from my favorite. Their food is good, but none that I would ever be yearning for.

After you get all the blowjob jokes out of the way, don't forget to order a pizookie. It's the one \"for sure\" dish they have."}
{"text":"I was really optimistic about coming back here, given that I waited a year. 

Sat in the bar area due to it being a Saturday and the wait time for a table. 

The bar staff was attentive at first, but once the food was ordered, it's like we didn't exist. 

Jamie (the female bartender) was talking poorly about policies, management, and previous disciplinary action taken against her to her regulars. While I understand wanting to vent, this isn't the time or place to do it. 

Food came out. Only thing I asked was no mustard on my sandwich. Simple, right?.... Always. ALWAYS. It never fails! When I ask for something specific, such as NO mustard, it comes out with mustard! 

While waiting for my sandwich to be remade, the manager was very friendly. He offered a drink or chips. Also offered desert when we were finished. I declined due to not being a desert person. 

I was truly hoping for a better experience and don't see myself coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wear a sweater! They have this place set to sub zero! Food was just ok. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"So you walk in and see this huge beautiful restaurant. Sadly we didn't know we were going here tonight so I wore pajama pants. It's not too fancy but nice for a not too pricy dinner as well. 

We got seated and ordered our drinks. The first 2, maybe 3 pages were nothing but beers or wines. When the food came it was literally so hard to decide. Such a big menu and so many things that sound really good. I couldn't decide for a while. I got the sirloin steak, an appetizer (fries), and my steak sides were mashed potatoes and clam chowder. The fries were really good, the steak was smaller than the portioning of mashed potatoes (I'm actually being serious I've seen a french fry that was better than the steak), the chowder was hands down the best. Service was amazing and I'm honestly very impressed from this place. Even though the steak was very small, I still got realy full to where I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Great selection of drinks. Bar service really depends on who you get, some are great and others you can tell do not want to be there. Food is also amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and dinner with a friend - attempting to give it one last go. 

The one star rating is for our excellent, friendly and attentive waitress. She was great and by no means does she deserve a one star. The peanut butter s'mores pizookie was also quite good - albeit a bit sickeningly sweet. 

I don't even know how this many bad things  are possible in one meal, but it happened -gritty guacamole with an overwhelming and strange sour flavor in it (are they squeezing a fresh lime into this?), lip puckering levels of salt on tortilla chips, a \"porter\" beer that was like a watery, flavorless, and flat soft drink and of course the \"star\" of this evenings failure - the 14.95 ahi tuna salad - about 6 pieces of 1 inch tuna and some greens with giant tomato chunks and greasy wonton strips all soaked to death in the most disgusting dressing I have ever tasted. To top it off my salad bowl was covered with some inexplicable green powder sprinkle that also tasted bad - I ate the tuna squares and left the rest. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I have left a full plate in a restaurant and unfortunately tonight was one of them. 

So disappointing. Sadly, I can't see myself ever seeking this place out as a choice I will ever want to spend my money at. Third time was a charm for me."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and would come back in the future. On one occasion, I celebrated my birthday here and they give you a cookie pie with a lit candle on top! The pie was delicious at best.
Also, their burgers are huge but are very good! Sometimes, I had to take half of it home with me because it was too big for me to finish. The fries are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance & service, love this just wish they did not get rid of the fields of green salad!"}
{"text":"This is by faaaar....our best place to watch the Monday and Thursday night NFL games! They have great specials during the whole game, amazing food selection and all of it is delicious! The bartenders are the best, most attentive I've seen! They know what I drink after 4 visits and my loyalty number. They'll all friendly, funny and professional! Tracey, Allan, Tiara and Krystal are the regular bartenders when we're there. We see alot of repeat regulars that make going there an enjoyable few hours!"}
{"text":"I worked late on a Wednesday night and stopped at BJ's for dinner and to avoid traffic in the Valley during rush hour.  

I love the atmosphere here... dimly lit, chalk board beer lists, higher-end sports bar feeling, ample televisions.  I was sad that my husband wasn't able to join me since we haven't eaten here before, but he worked late that night.  

I sat at the bar and my server, Chelsea, was awesome!  She orchestrated my meal at a perfect pace for me.  She gave me great suggestions on appetizer sizes versus side-dish sizes.

I ordered a glass of 14 Hands Merlot and a large deep-dish Five Meat pizza (extra cheese, please)!  I was able to relax and unwind before my dinner was served.  The pizza was served and placed on a brushed nickel structural tripod that elevated the pizza above the table-top (allowing for extra room underneath).  When Chelsea placed the tripod on the bar in front of me I knew the pizza was going to be big!  

I will admit now that I have always been a fan of Pizza Hut's \"former\" pizza crust.  It was a typical foccacia-type pizza crust.  The pizza dough at BJ's is made like foccacia, with olive oil - crispy outside and warm, fluffy goodness inside - like a pillowy respite for the toppings to lay their tired, protein-infused heads on prior to being devoured.  Was the sauce a little sweet for my taste?  Yes, but that's what sells today.  Happily the pizza sauce is NOT the star of the show here... the crust and toppings are!

The happy hour specials here apply to \"good\" wines too (not just house wines).  I ordered the brussel sprouts for Ray as an appetizer and hauled the remainder of the pizza home for his dinner/lunch.

Dessert?  Monkey Bread pizza-thingie with vanilla bean ice cream on the side.  A gooey, cinnamon, chewy carbohydrate mouth party that I thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"We tried this spot because of a friend recommended it! We were very happy with the service and the food! This was out first visit- if we lived closer we'd definitely stop again!!!!

The pizza was great and my husband loved his burger- all portions were very big which was nice."}
{"text":"5 for sure, thanks to our bartender Savannah. Great appetizer recommendations and SUPER props for serving our beer in a clean chilled mug and even taking the time to water off the sides so I don't grab a sticky mug when we have overflow! We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Sigh. Took my daughter today for her 21st birthday. I have literally never seen such a disregard for customer service in my life. The disinterested millennial waitress actually seemed annoyed that we were there. I mentioned that it was my daughter's birthday, mainly to harass my daughter, and I might as well asked the millennial to swallow razor blades. The food was a a step better but just a step.  The sodas were flat. My daughter had the grilled cheese and soup. Meh. I had the jambalaya which was horrifically over spiced, not over spicy but Cajun-ed to hell and back. I thought to complain, and I hate being that guy, but the thought of trying to interact with the millennial seemed so painful, we just paid and left. Thank God, Doctor Strange was just about to start and we could at least eat popcorn to sati"}
{"text":"Lots of seating with good atmosphere.  Ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms.  We were disappointed that they were the size of a quarter and not even close to the size shown on the menu.  The bartender was not friendly at all but was efficient.  I had the house IPA and the stout.  Both were great beers."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was terrible! The place wasn't even that busy still the server will disappear for long periods of time."}
{"text":"After I wrote my previous review, the general manager contacted me within an hour. He apologized for the food and the manager's response. He asked me to return. Dinner on him. My cousin and I returned this past weekend. 

The food was great. The service was fantastic. I am back in the fan column. Like I said previously. I can accept an off day. I cannot accept disinterest and lack of ownership. 

Excellent bounce back."}
{"text":"Food is cold, over rated, not fresh and service isn't friendly. Waiters are always rushing you to order. This BJ's on this side of town is awful! Please get better management."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, we come here for the Pizookie!   Ice cream layered on top of a giant cookie.  Mmmm.

However this time around we also had regular food and beer.  Loved their \"blonde\" beer.   It paired well with my Cajun Pasta w/ chicken, a dish I highly recommend getting here.  We also tried their calimari which was standard. 

My friend had the southern style fried chicken.  She said it was cooked and seasoned well and not greasy at all!  Great.

There is a separate bar area, plenty of seating in a nicely dim room.  The ambiance was perfect for my group.  Our only small irk was that our server was sometimes not present when we needed him.  Trying to find him for the check after we were already full and ready to go was one thing.  Putting in my debit card with the bill and trying to find him AGAIN just to pay for the darn thing is enough to drop 1 star from this place.  

Come for the great selection of beers and the food, keep an eye for your server or he might just get lost for some time."}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good. Like most of the reviews say, the service can be slow. This place gets super busy. So do most of the restaurants in this area though. I think too many new homes and not enough major commercial centers to handle them all. There are a lot of people working here but I see them all overwhelmed.  

The Raspberry Lemonade is really good and refreshing. So is the root beer, and most of the beers I have tried. I haven't ordered anything on the menu I didn't like. And the menu is huge."}
{"text":"I am extremely suspect of the health standards of the BJ's. Went into this location for the first time today and throughout our visit fly's where all over, kept landing in us and our food. The food itself was just okay, pizza was really nothing special, chicken wings had a very oily flavor and had no seasoning (I ask for sauce on the side so they don't get soggy) and the calamari was also bland. The server was polite and attentive. Very dissapointing from visits to other bjs."}
{"text":"I love this place it's my favorite!! Their balsamic chicken is to die for. And their homemade sodas are delish! Always has a friendly staff and clean. Definitely a family favorite."}
{"text":"Not too bad at all.  I enjoyed the beer and the burger was pretty decent.  Bartendress was cute and pretty good at her job so I really have nothing to complain about.

I can't give 5 stars without it having changed my life though."}
{"text":"I came here for a day lunch date with my friend and we had an awesome time. We sat at the bar, had great service the entire time and really enjoyed our food and drinks. We tried about 8 different beers from BJ's and I liked them all! Their seasonal double IPA was super delicious, and their stouts were really tasty as well. For food, we ordered a couple small items- the fried portabella strips appetizer, the Brussels sprouts appetizer and a small Hawaiian pizza with habanero added (the bartenders recommendation). Everything was great- the portabella strips were juicy and the sauce that came with them were so complimenting. The Brussels sprouts were just as good, although I would have preferred if the sauce came on the side, rather than them swimming in the sauce. Regardless, the sauce was REALLY tasty. The pizza was super delicious, although I didn't really notice a spicy kick at all from the habanero. Just when I thought we were done eating, my friend ordered the ahi tuna appetizer. This was the first time I had ever tried raw tuna... and I really liked it. It was fresh, and the portion was pretty generous as well. Overall- we really enjoyed our afternoon here and I am looking forward to coming back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Okay finally a review.  Typically I am in this place once a week, why?

For me two reasons.  Food quality & beer selection.  In the past few months they have paired back the menu thank god it was like the Cheesecake Factory way to many choices.  They have healthy choices for us actually looking for smaller portions and the ability to substitute vegetables for starches without an up-charge or making you fell guilty because they may have to write something down.

Unlike other places in the area they have there own craft beers, but actually carry selections that would compete with there own so as consumers we have excellent choices here.  I personally like the Parana Pale Ale which is there own.  

My wife and I sit in the bar area so are adopted (not really she's a Gator Fan... Roll Tide) daughter can wait on us.  Rebecca is by far the best ambassador for BJ's.  While she pretty much runs the bar (never stops) she also takes the time to greet each and everyone who sits at the bar, answers any questions and makes you feel like you are her only customer. While in the background you can see the drink orders pile up. 

So if you are in East Mesa and are looking for reasonable priced food, and a great beer selection, go in Wednesday - Saturday sit at the bar, yell out loud \"Roll Tide\" and the bartender who turns and gives you a dirty look is the one you want to wait on you."}
{"text":"We were greeted right away when we sat down! The pizzas took a while to come out but they were good. Our server was very attentive even though she was really busy. Also you have to try the pazooki sampler ... The pazooki are def the number one reason I come here"}
{"text":"Happened to see a BJ's in Roseville and realized that this is a national chain. It was busy on a Sunday night. Seated immediately and the service was quick and efficient. The kids menu is available and the 3 items for $6.25 had a generous portion and filling for the kids. 
Ultimate Long Island ice T was a concoction of various liquor with a splash of Pepsi. It was nice. 
Barbacoa cauliflower tacos was very flavorful, the base was more like naan bread, this came with a quinoa based cold salad which was quite tasty. Peruvian quinoa with shrimp was a little bland however the shrimp was cooked perfectly and nicely spiced. 
The menu is extensive and some items are repeated to bulken up the menu book."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- fresh and new, seemed to be family friendly, they need to work on cleanliness
Food- looked great but was tastless
Prices- lunch specials between 7 and 9 bucks
Service- friendly however very slow
Overall experience- unsatisfied, will not be returning.
My wife and I arrived for lunch and the place was almost full. The hostess acknowledged us with a halfhearted greeting but sat us to our booth quickly.  When we got to our booth the floor underneath the booth was blatantly littered with food, bits of torn paper, crayons, used drink straws and so on, basically as if four young children had been seated there prior to us and the staff failed to sweep up after they left. 10 min later the waiter introduced himself and took our drink and appetizer order. The waiter (Chase) was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu.15 min later our drinks arrived and he took our lunch order. Another 20 mins later our appetizer arrived and the waiter noticed we needed refills. We had the bonless wings. They were ok nothing special. After another 20 min and our lunch arrived via a somewhat rudish food runner who did not acknowedge us and basically drop our plates in front of us and took off. I had the pulled pork sandwich with wedge cut seasoned fries and coleslaw. All of it looked great. Pork was moist and tender but no flavor. The fries once again had no taste. The coleslaw was delicious. I did not finish my meal due to lack of interest. The wife ordered the Jalapeno burger with the seasoned wedge fries and at first glance it looked great. But after further inspection the burger was way overcooked and the pepperjack cheese looked dead. She lost her appetite, but she is 9mths pregnant so that may be why. I never tasted her burger it just didnt look like something i would have liked. Her fries were no different than mine. Drink refills were few and far between. Yes we were there at the lunch time rush but the restaurant was not that full to have effected the service and serve times to that extream. However even if the service was on point the food fell short of our expectations."}
{"text":"Chanel's service was 5 star, good fast food! Love the Brussels sprouts with Sriracha sauce and have it on every visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to BJ's about five times....I have ordered the ceaser salad each time with the dressing on the side....EACH AND EVERY TIME THESE IDIOTS DROWN MY SALAD IN DRESSING!!!!!!!!!  I am done!!!!! I will never go back to BJ's!!!!!!! Obviously the waiters can't listen to simple requests!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We have been here a few different times and have always been satisfied with the food and service!  They are great for kids and parties!"}
{"text":"First Visit: 

Good and bad! 

First the good: Food was delicious, servers were very nice and bubbly. We ordered the ribs (had a good bit of meat on them, and good sauce), the pasta with blackened chicken (very flavorful), baked potatoes (cooked well and came with sour cream, butter, scallions). Many options for everyone on the menu and even some options I haven't seen at other restaurants before! 

Second the bad: The servers did not check on us much, the food took about 45 minutes to come out once we finally got to order, which shouldn't have taken that long because we came after the dinner rush to avoid that specifically. The app you can download gives you good rewards but only if you pay using the app, which we would never put our card info in to an app. The rewards should be for any regular paying customer.. Not happy about that. 

Would recommend! Food was worth it& menu selection was great. 

Second Visit: 

Wait was not long. The beers were good but service was bad. This is the second time the service has been crappy. The waitress never checked in, she would disappear when asked for something. Had to wait about 20 minutes every time we wanted ranch, beer, anything really. My brisket burger came without the burger the first time, looked great though and the waitress let me keep the brisket sand which. When she brought out my actual sandwich, I was confused as to what was on the burger. The brisket looked nothing like what was on the previous sandwich and was actually gross looking, they were not the same brisket. I ended up scraping it off my sandwich and using the other brisket. We will be back because of beer and to try other food selections, but don't expect good service here apparently! 

Third Visit: 

Three strikes and you're out, won't be returning. My experiences seem to get worse each time, we have given this place three tries now. Wait was long, which is fine. Finally got seated and waited forever for anyone to come to our table. Our waitress was a blonde and very unprofessional and not experienced at all. She took forever to bring even our waters out. The service is always horrible and they are not nice either.. usually the food is alright, but I was very disappointed with my fatty burger. She charged our bill all wrong and split it wrong as well. She brought the wrong beer out after saying one was available and then told us we were wrong about her saying that and that she never said it was available. She got extremely defensive and was rude about it. 

Don't recommend.. I'm all for giving places lots of patience and multiple tries, but this place has failed me every time I come. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food and great place to eat with family, friends, and coworkers. I did go there a few months back and in took 45 minutes to get my drink order taken."}
{"text":"We've been eating at BJ's on West Charleston since we moved here.  With a large assortment of menu choices, a kid's menu, and a nice beer selection (including BJ's own delicious assortment of brews), there's something here for everyone.  

If you've never been before, or you get lost in the large menu, I'd recommend the Crispy Fried Artichokes (artichoke hearts) or the Avocado Egg Rolls for a starter.  Moving on to main course choices, try the Bacon Cheese Burger, New Orlean's Jambalaya, or one of the Tavern Cut Pizzas.  The Spicy Pig or Garlic Chicken Pesto are both favorites.  If you're in the mood for salad as a main course, definitely check out the Kale & Roasted Brussel Sprouts Salad.  There is also a good assortment of dessert options for anyone who is still hungry after the meal.  Finally, there's a gluten-free menu for those who want or need to adhere to a gluten-free diet.

In the larger restaurants in the chain, the noise level is slightly above average, and has even been noisy at times, but it's never been too loud.

As I mentioned, BJ's brews it's own beer; you have 10 beers and a hard cider available to chose from.  They also carry a nice assortment of others beers as well, so you're not bound to their own brews.  By the way, the in-house root beer is delicious.  Be sure to give it a try during one of your visits.

Finally, the West Charleston location is conveniently located near Red Rock Casino and Downtown Summerlin, so consider adding this BJ's to your dining choices if you're out and about in the area.  They're consistently good and worth a visit.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here with the family to support a school fundraiser.  I had never been here so I was looking forward to it.  We were seated right away and our server was pleasant.  Food was better than Applebee's, and the portions were huge!  For a family of 5, it was around $50, and that included the very affordable kid sized sundaes for my boys.  Love that they made the desert affordable since my kids are usually still hungry after meals and ask for desert but then take two bites.  Such a waste of money!  Great atmosphere, nice and spacious.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't amazing, service was very slow and inattentive. Staff is very young, they should do a bit more training to get to reach better professionalism."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place, I've been coming here since I was a little kid and always loved the food and desserts. But I came in here last time and was helped by Teddi R, she come up to my friend and I and right as we ordered waters her mood changed, like she expected us to be broke teenagers that can't leave a good tip or afford soda, when in reality I just don't like soda. But after this point in our dinner we had NO service. The restaurant was empty so she had no excuse like \"it was busy\" or something. She came and just dropped off our food and didn't talk to or look at us. Then after about 20 minutes we were done eating, and bored sitting there, she finally noticed and picked up our plates asking \"can I take these?\". She never asked us how the food was or check on us. After all of this we paid and left, she never thanked us or anything like that. 

Now tonight I came back with my girlfriend and got seated in her section. From the start I warned my girlfriend that it was probably gonna be terrible. We waited at least like 7 minutes before she came up and introduced herself. Teddi then asked what we wanted to drink, a water and a tea. Because we had waited so long she also took our food order. We then waited and she brought our drinks, she quickly dropped them off without saying anything. After this we had an expo bring us our food about 10 minutes apart, my girlfriend got the soup and salad combo so I get that hers would be faster, but seriously a 10 minutes gap?!? After my food can by another expo, I at and the food was good as always. But Teddi would never have know this because she never asked, she walked passed us, and I counted, 6 times before she came back because our plates were cleared and out napkins were on the table. She then asked if we had saved any room for dessert and we ordered a pizza cookie. It came out by another expo and we ate. After we had cleared that she came back and dropped off the tab without saying anything about the food. I paid and she never said anything to us as we left.

Normally I don't leave reviews but 2 times in a row at a place I love going and this same server is doing the same stuff. She is terrible at her job."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner tonight, enjoyed the Prime Rib special.  Meal was perfectly cooked.  My son enjoyed the shrimp scampi. Service was very good, didn't get a five star, atmosphere is too hectic with people waiting.  Make reservations on open table so you don't wit too long!"}
{"text":"Two locations, 2.5 stars. Solid chain restaurant.
This location -
This particular location had a couple of quirks. The ambiance is absolutely awesome; they have a lot of space to work with and the doors allow the restaurant to control the noise level.

Food wise, it's on the pricier side for Pitt, I don't exactly look to spend almost $20 for lunch if there's no alcohol involved.

The cheese-curd appetizer was delicious; it's just literally a salt bomb. So beware!

The soup is pretty heavy (had the unlimited soup and salad lunch deal); It was a broccoli cheddar soup that added cheddar on top. On the gloppy side, but I liked the flavor. The salad on the other hand - the caprese - total waste of time. The balsamic is too sweet, and it's missing some salt  and pepper. Not worth the time. Trying something else, next time."}
{"text":"Pizza is yum! So far, the service has been great and accommodating for large parties. . Checked out other BJ's in S.F. And So. Cal and it's always crackin!"}
{"text":"Came to this location twice so far and have visited the franchise three times. I must say, for a chain, the food is good and they have a lot of fresh options, in addition to the fried foods and pizzas. Their pizza is delicious- I enjoy the small Hawaiian personal size pizza, it reminds me of a fancier version of school pizzas. Their ranch is also really good, which is important to my boyfriend and I since we love ranch dressing. Their boneless wings are delicious, however we didn't love their signature root beer glaze- it was way too sweet for us. Brendan had a burger here the past two times he visited and he liked it both times. I opted for a salad the most recent time- it had quinoa and blueberries and kale, among other delicious healthy ingredients. It was so good! I was really impressed with the freshness of it. Their appetizers are yummy- I love the fried portabella mushrooms, as well as the roasted Brussels with sriracha. Service has always been great and the beer selection is really impressive. I would love to come here for a game sometime or happy hour."}
{"text":"We love BJ's Henderson.  The food (great pizza and wonderful price on Monday's) is the BEST.  Our server Davina.. outstanding...never waiting for a refill on your terrific ice tea either.  She has a great personality and makes our visit so nice.  This is why we love BJ's !!"}
{"text":"If you want beer and/or dessert come here. The food is mediocre. Nothing special there. The only reason we really come is for the beer and pizookie. My husband loves the many types of beer they have. I love the warm cookie and sweet ice cream."}
{"text":"I love the tomato basil salad.. I can eat two of them. We eat here a few ti,es a month. The staff are always helpful and attend to our needs quickly. Thank you for you great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"why does bj's leave me cold ???? they have a cool name.....they have beer.......i had a hefe the other day I guess it's there version  it was cold  and flavorless like water. There apps are decent and we have had lunch there before it was good sometimes the service is good other times just mediocre ........oh bj's I may return someday but your not high on my list"}
{"text":"Goodness I love this place. It's a chain, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hold a special place in my heart. I can't get enough of the mocktails . They have a berry limeade cocktail that satisfies my need to have a unique refreshing drink. This drink has unlimited refills with fresh fruit in every glass. 

Bjs staff is always happy to serve you and never lets your glass stay empty. The food is always fresh and I'm currently craving their guacamole as I write this review. I have probably been to this establishment 10 different times, so I don't speak based on an antidote experience.

My favorite dishes so far include the tomato soup in bread bowl, Cajon chicken pasta, and their golden beat salad.

I'll be back during happy hour for their nut brown ale and discounted appetizers.

:)"}
{"text":"We just had an excellent dinner at BJ's.  It was very crowded and fairly loud, but the overall experience was still very good.  Our waitress Gabby, was excellent!  Even though she was incredibly busy, she took the time to explain the different dishes and 
Suggest a type of beer that my husband may like.  All service was so good, it really was impressive.  The food, Cobb salads and the seared ahi salad were excellent!  Even though my Husbands salad did not come with onions, he asked for them and a server quickly complied.  Thank you to Gabby and staff for making a quick dinner and enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Stay away. Had to send back to kitchen 3 times a very simple order. Fully discontinued diet root beer. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Nothing amazing just another chain restaurant. OK drinks and OK, food. We sat at the bar and waited for our bar tender, I'll say we waiting to long. She only checked on us a couple of times, we were here over 2 hours talking and only got 2 drinks."}
{"text":"We put our name on a call ahead list at the restaurant and when we got their they had \"lost\" our call in reservation. They said they would do their best to seat us in 20 minutes?. 50 minutes later (7pm) my soon was hungry.

I asked for a manager and explained what happened she said she would seat us right away and get us a free appetizer. 

I have a food allergies and appetizers are hard for my diet. The manager said she would see what else she could do. 

When the waiter came by he was amazing. He let me \"create\" a sandwich that was not even on the menu to meet my allergies. It was delicious.

He then came back and told me our whole meal was comped and wished me a happy Mother's Day!

The executed excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"BJ's is a great place. Great food, great beer, great hand crafted root beer (according to my son,) and great service.

BJ's offers healthy size portions (often enough to keep me in left overs for a day or two at our family condo.) I highly recommend any of the specialty salads or the stuffed baked potatoes, which are a meal in themselves.

If you are up for some beer - the 7 beer sampler fits the bill to start. I would recommend the Tatonka Stout if you like dark beer. BJ's also offers some hard ciders and regular mixed drinks.

Watch for BJ's happy hour - most mini pizzas and appetizers are 1/2 price later in the evening in the bar. 

BJ's is great for kids and offers several kid's selections (that are adult size meals.) Most come with an included drink - my son always gets the handcrafted root beer, which is a lot better than the other soft drinks.

Grab a bit at BJ's - you won't be disappointed. They have a great take out too if you want to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Great place. Lots of choices. Always good service. Great for large groups. Huge bar area. Lots of TVs to watch the games. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love this place. Our server was fun. Food was good. Beer is cold and the wine was fine. Love their bogo and all my coupons."}
{"text":"Love everything about this restaurant. Great food, dronks, staff and atmosphere. My local hotspot."}
{"text":"Love to take visitors to BJ's. Their menu has something for everyone. Especially love their soup/salad for lunch. If you seconds you have the option to try a different choice of each. I'm seldom that hungry but I've had friends who appreciate the opportunity to try another option. Never had anything that wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Take out is very disorganized. Placed order 20 min before I arrived and I still waited an additional 20 min for my order. As I waited there was no comfort from the employees saying that my order is on the way or was still cooking. There were multiple people that came and got there orders way before I did."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten in once and gotten take-out 5 times. The baby back ribs are delicious as is the blueberry apple Cole slaw. The service was good but not exceptional. The French fries taste homemade and the loaded baked potato is HUGE!  The app is great but there  is a bug that won't allow you to order a fully loaded baked potato. The curb-side pick-up is very handy."}
{"text":"Very happy with their gluten free options!  I have celiacs disease, and finding somewhere I can eat good food is a challenge.  Love the pazookie!"}
{"text":"Well, thank goodness for Paul.  We walked in and wanted to sit at one of the 8 empty tables that had access to see the LSU game today.  The hostesses were completely confused as this was not her plan.  We stayed and eventually after managers involvement the staff was able to figure out how we could possibly be seated in the section.  ( Mind you there were tables all along the side that were filled.). Paul stepped up, dedicated himself to our table and was the best waiter we have ever had at this restaurant.  HE deserves 5 stars.  The management- ugh- figure it out."}
{"text":"Great first class service when you sign up for a BJs card at the check in desk. 

I checked in tonight with the hostess and gave her my phone number associated with my BJ card, and we were escorted right away to our table. There were around 20 other people still waiting in the lobby area for a table. 

The servers and manager gave us exceptional service, and catered to our special requests. The pan pizza we ordered tonight from their new pizza menu was wonderful. 

This is a great place to go with family and friends for any occasion. The location is easy to access off the 215 freeway and the Charleston exit.

{"text":"An amazing dinner here last night! The vibe is wonderful. We got seated immediately once we walked in. The staff are extremely friendly and fast. And the food was amazing. Highly recommend if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the WORST EXPERIENCES EVER. 

1. Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more \"Cajuny\". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water, making it completely inedible. 

2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalapeño burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn't it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns?

3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn't turn around... and the restaurant wasn't even loud, the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here, 30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn't deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes? 

Worst of all, it was an extremely slow night, slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn't have to pay for the extremely salty, dirty, sink water flavored pasta.

Now that I think about it, I should've listened to my boyfriend. This experience, along with 1 burger and 2 appetizers was not at all worth $27. No wonder they call themselves BJ's cuz this place BLOWS!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It all started when I received a coupon in the mail for a free personal pizza. I was new to the area, my husband was deployed, why not try it out. Their food has always been amazing no matter what I've had (deep dish buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite!). When I broke my leg and was in a wheelchair a random waitress saw me struggling and helped me get into the bathroom stall, waited for me and helped me back out. She was amazing and her help meant more to me than she will ever know. I'm  sad that I didnt get her name. The only bad experience I've had after two years of dining here was last night. Brandi was our waitress. The restaurant was surprisingly not  too busy but her service was horrible and she was extremely condescending any time I tried to talk to her. Anyway, the BJs mobile app is easy to use and you receive points just  for eating there, which build up fast when  you love to eat like I do."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience I had to share.  We were seated within 5-10 minutes which was the expectation that the hostess set upon giving her my name.   This is the first time I had ever been to a BJ's.  The menu is quite large.  I will say tho, they were advertising the Committed IPA on draft, advertising it on the table.  I got excited!  When I went to order the IPA  I was told they were out.   That's annoying no matter what restaurant is involved.  DO NOT advertise a product, ESPECIALLY on the table being the first thing I see before the menu, and then not have it to sell me.
   I also understand that this tends to happen in the restaurant business so no docked points for that here! 
We had the Carne Asada french fri appetizer concoction.  It was delicious and perfect for 2 people to share.  We also had the Chicken Tacos and the Puled pork Sammich 
( hahaha love you Matt ) with the wedge fries aka HUGE FRENCH FRIES.  Both delicious.  I decided to order the Top Shelf Margarita with and extra shot on the side, due to the general weakness of the Margaritas made now a days.  Well... the margarita was really bad. I could BARLEY taste the Tequila!  I happened to see the manager  \"DAVID\" who had stopped by and introduced himself earlier. I expressed my concern and he personally went and made me a new margarita. I personally think that the recipe for this particular margarita is being served in too big of a glass and the measurements are out of whack. Top Shelf means Premium liquors, EXPENSIVE.  I think the drink was around $10.  For $10 I better taste more than sour mix in the margarita.  It was disappointing but expected to a point because of my habit of ordering a shot on the side to throw in it.  This particular recipe NEEDS to be RE CREATED.  After David re made the Top Shelf Margarita it was still too sweet I barley could taste the tequila ( hence the shot on the side ). So really I spent around $18 on a margarita ( quite ridiculous ). I was however very impressed with David's customer service and impeccable personality and ability to makes us smile and have a great time.  David also helped us figure out dessert to take home.  Let me let you in on a secret.... shhhhhhhhhh.....  They will special make your cookie dessert!  We got 1/2  macadamia 1/2 salted carmel!  We were treated like gold not only by David but also Kim.  Kim was very patient with us and informative.  She made great suggestions and always had a smile on her face as well as a great attitude.  We were presented with the \"BJ's Premier Rewards Loyalty Program\" by David when we were wrapping up the meal.  I signed up and we will be returning.  There are ALOT of things to try on this menu and they have TONS of good beer on tap and in the bottle.  If you like Micro Brews and strong, weird beer that you can't get just anywhere, give BJ's a shot.  They've got a nice selection.   I give them a 5 star because of the way we were treated, the great time we had because of the treatment, the more than generous and friendly staff, the atmosphere was awesome ( Dim lighting and comfortable ) we were sat quickly in a booth as we requested and the food was delicious.  We walked out of there feeling like a million bucks and VERY WELCOMED BACK!   Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Our meals were excellent. I had the cherry chipotle salmon and my friend had the rib eye steak. Service was great and attentive. Also had the calamari for an appetizers. Very delicious. I totally recommend this place. Great food Great service."}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day dinner last week.  It was the first time at a BJs location for myself and my daughter, although the rest of the family had been there in the past.  We had a large deep dish pizza (BJs special) and a medium deep dish with anchovies.  I can honestly say this was some of the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas!  Very fresh ingredients and I liked how they use fresh cut tomato instead of tomato sauce in the pie.  BJs offers an extensive menu and is an excellent choice for a family gathering.  Very kid friendly and excellent food.  I will definately be back and would recommend this restaurant to others...."}
{"text":"Ordered the soup an salad for lunch and wow it was good. Haven't been to Bj's in forever, guess I'll be coming back. So surprised how cheap our total was plus the server was amazing !"}
{"text":"BJ's was treating Veterans Day right, received any meal for free plus our waiter gave us free dessert. Service was great, food was great even being crowded on a Friday night we got seated within ten minutes. Definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Good selection of food. There was something for everyone. All of our food was well prepared and great tasting. Our server was Amy C. and she was one of the best servers I've ever had. Very friendly and attentive. She constantly asked if we needed something before I ever had a chance to flag her down. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like beer, pizza, and of course giant chocolate chip cookies? No one. BJ's brewery is awesome. It has a nice atmosphere and it is very family-friendly. The food in general is good. I really have never had a horrible meal there. The restaurant is always clean and inviting and they always play the best sports matches. It's loud enough in there to be fun but quite enough to have business meetings and talk with a friend or coworker over a nice meal. To be honest, the only thing I don't like is that there is barely anything on the menu lesson 700 cal. And that does not include the side dishes."}
{"text":"Berry blast cider is the best. I come to this restaurant just for the cider. It is a little on the sweet side but it takes a little sweetness to bring out the fruity flavor of the berries. This is a nice sports bar with plenty of room for group get togethers. The food is good and the menu  is large enough everyone can find something they like. I will go back for the Berry Blast Cider."}
{"text":"If you are going to B.J.'S for their deep dish pizza, this review will help you.  We went to BJ's on Labor day at 4:00 p.m., my husband had a coupon for 50% off their pizza.
We had to wait 15 minutes before being seated.  There was lots of tables, but very few waiters.  We ordered the BJ classic deep dish pizza, which would be $24. 00 if we did not have a coupon.  We waited 40 minutes to be served a deep dish pizza on a platter with raw vegetables.  The picture in the menu shows deep dish pizzas in a pan with lots of melted cheese and cooked vegetables.  We were so hungry that we started eating until we noticed no sauce on the pizza.  We spoke to a manager who stated they don't .put sauce on the pizza they have seasoned tomatoes. As far as the vegetables he agreed they needed to be cook more.  He took the pizza away and said they would remake it with sauce and cook vegeables.  We waited 45 minutes when they rushed out of the kitchen to tell us they had to remake the second pizza because it cracked in the oven.  We tasted the 3rd pizza, and there was no more sauce that the 1st pizza and the vegetables were still raw.  We gave up, and left the restaurant with the manager writing off our pizza.  We came home and I reheated my left over dinner from the nite before that I had made homemade.  My husband thinks B.J.'S is using frozen pizzas that they just add to what the customer had order.
I could have bought a better frozen pizza and add my own toppings.

If you are there for happy hour drinks, than this review is not helpful for you.  If you want deep dish pizza BEWARE they are way too over priced for their pizza."}
{"text":"Smells like a urine washed subway station in here. Server is nice, but super slow. And dishes (plates included) brought out are dirty. Other Yelpers said so, found out for myself. Yuck"}
{"text":"So I decided to come here with some friends to celebrate my birthday. I wish I would have gotten the name of our waiter but it seems like this location has had it's share of bad service anyways, Which is really sad due to how satisfied I was with the portions and flavor of the food. Everything was cooked to perfection and not to mention the amazing variety of foods and drinks. Anyways on to the main point: Our waiter was just...weird in the way of how he talked to us and did everything. Its almost as if he felt uncomfortable serving us as he didnt want to look us in the eye and did everything half-assed and handled everything passive-aggressively. I understand that being a waiter is hard especually attending to many people however this particular night was not busy at all. 
It was my 21st birthday so my friend wanted to buy me a drink, & obviously we had to show I.D., I knew it was a long shot since I had just gotten my I.D. renewed (i brought the old one and a new temporary one). With that I was declined my drink, which was no big deal, untill it came time to ask the waiter if they did anything for birthdays. In a very mocking and sarcastic tone he said \"Point and laugh at you.\". After 15 min he brought out a cookie with ice cream and a candle on top and just handed it to me...no \"Happy Birthday\" or anything else that other places do for your birthday.  I'm not asking for a parade, rather a little enthusiasm.  This experience left a bad taste and honestly I'm very dissapointed.  It's not that hard to engage your customers and to be nice, like really, it won't kill you I promise!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and we've never had a bad experience. Our server tonight was fantastic. She was very attentive and the food was brought out hot and quick. Very nice decor for a brew house and a nice place for a date night. Noise level is a little high when it's busy but other than that, great place."}
{"text":"Like a lot of local places it was great when it opened but then they get the business established and everything changes.  They get lazy, service slips, food quality becomes inconsistent and so as a consumer you are in the dilemma of having a 50/50 shot of having a good experience... or not.  Don't like those odds and so prefer to just go somewhere where I know it will be good without the guesswork.  It gets very noisy when busy especially when there are kids and screaming babies!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer made on site, and some unique deep dish pizzas make for a great happy hour and reverse happy hour. 

Despite the recent rise in the price of the mini pizzas the half off deal at happy hour is hard to beat. The deals on the beer are not the best, but they quality makes up for it. 

I really like the spinach artichoke pizza, Imagine taking a pizza and using a creamy artichoke spinach dip in lieu of tomato sauce. That is one rich deep dish pizza. Couple with a tatonka stout and it is one great meal to indulge in. 

Some of their other great beers are the Jeremiah red. As the name implies it is a red Irish beer. Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat.

For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off. There is some deal on well drinks, but then why come to a brewery to drink anything other than beer?  


If you find your self feeling the effects of the beer too quickly the potato wedge fires make for a great sponge to soak up some of the happy juice in the beer.

Don't forget you can get a growler (1/2 gallon) of beer to go!"}
{"text":"I would give five stars. ..but I usually do carry out service here which is fantastic.  Amazing food and the cashier is so friendly and goes above and beyond. However with dining in experience the service I've had has always just been average and the prices are very high. Great upscale sports bar for the guys to take their ladies if they want something nicer than your typical bdubs experience."}
{"text":"I love the physical location. The revolving door, the huge wall of alcohol and beers -- its lovely :) 

But the food is o-k. I have had mixed experiences with staff so that's why it gets a 3. There was twice where we had 2-3 different servers( people training i think)  then there was mass confusion.. And then there was a time where our server was on point. 

Overall - its a safe place to go to get variety on American food - and the Pazookie (my fave is the red velvet) is the business!"}
{"text":"Way better than the Silversdo Ranch location. I ate the whole pizza for a change. My boss lady didn't let me get a Pazooki! Left my cellphone ot was turned in to mgmt!"}
{"text":"The pizza is outstanding! Their berrs selections are great. Too bad they haven't built a location near the Galleria Mall"}
{"text":"Great food, Great beer choices, great atmosphere, great staff, what more can you ask for. The Grand Cru is delicious, especially if you let it warm up a little. With it a little warmer you can taste all the suttle notes in it. The Jambalaya is not the best I have had but is tasty and you get plenty. I had enough for 2 people. I try to visit here at least several times each year I come down to this area."}
{"text":"Came here with my family because someone recommend this place. There wasn't any wait and we got seated right away. Our waiter was awesome and was very helpful with answering questions. I had the deep dish ziti and it was 'meh'. The handcrafted root beer didn't taste too special. Overall, the service was great but the food was average at best."}
{"text":"I went there after driving 9 hours from California. I was starving and decided to go there, because it looked pretty good. We split the basil-tomato-mozzarella pizza which was just ok. For the main course I decided to get the Bj's Burger, expecting that the burger which is named after their restaurant is the best burger they have. Normally after a 9 hour drive and I am extremely hungry everything tastes great, but the burger was probably the plainest burger I ever had. I doubt that we will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. Often it is tolerable. One time we had a great server, but that was just one time.

Tonight was just as bad. We ordered our food. I like these fries they have (or used to have) with pork and green salsa. They removed them from the menu a couple months ago, but when I went in tonight, they were back on the menu - so I ordered them.

After several exchanges with the waitress in between about how we think our orders are wrong (and her telling us they weren't), we finally got our bill.

Amy S., our server, charged us for pork sliders, which are nearly double the price of the pork fries. I bring it up, along with our points for a discount, and she tells me their not on the menu. I told her they were and that's why I ordered them, and she says they're not and they have to charge me for these sliders instead.

I am very disappointed after this trip. I don't see how it's my fault that I ordered what's being shown on the menu. 

Absolutely no attempt to make it right, she only told me how I am wrong, then gave me my bill back to pay.

We likely won't be back after this. We've had pretty poor service here before, but this was completely unnecessary and frustrating."}
{"text":"Understandably, my family and I were moved from the bar due to me not having my ID. However, unfortunately the hostess didn't smile when we were seated and my moms food came out inedibly salty, and the manager Ron never came out to apologize. The only saving grace was Keith our serverr, he was kind and polite. 

Don't come to this BJs, service and food quality are falling off."}
{"text":"Love the Brewhouse Bacon Cheeseburger! The wedge fries are bomb too. Favorite appetizer is the Avocado Egg Rolls! BJ's is vastly becoming a very regular dining spot! Great service as well. They could offer a better Happy Hour. Other than that, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my family (party of 6) went there for dinner a few nights ago. There was a 45 minute wait. No big deal. 55 mins pass and our buzzer finally buzzes. The hostesses then tell us to stand by the stairs and wait.  Another 15 minutes of waiting we had to do..and people kept walking by us so we felt VERY in the way. I asked a hostess why we had to stand and wait here and she said \"so youre ready\". uhm okay? I was perfectly ready in my spot on the seat thankyouverymuch. Anyway, we ended up being crammed into a booth. Oh well, at least we all love each other in my family. Then the server was very blah..Not bad but not good. It was busy so im sure he was in the weeds a bit. I had the santa fe salad and about died..YUM! The rest was good but those hostesses need to get it together. I AM a hostess and have been for years so I know how things go and I would NEVER make a party stand in the middle of a walk way for 15 minutes to \"be prepared\"."}
{"text":"First time to this place and what a place it was...  

We started off with the fire roasted sarachi drizzled brussel sprouts. Very good don't know what the seasoning was they covered them in but I was delicious... then we ordered the x-large deep dish pizza which was very good although it was not worth the $26.00... you can get the same thing from Pizza Hut for $10.00.... 

But the main reason we went there was so we could try the beers... and once again I can't complain about the beer although only had the one.. Jeremiahs Red. The wife on the other hand had a mixed berry cider which was also very good... both made by BJ's... 

A little bit on the pricey side but we will be back"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience this past Monday! My server was Jason!  He was very conscious of what me and my table needed from the time we ordered til the time we left! Had an excellent knowledge of the food & drink menu and very helpful to pick what was best for a picky eater like myself! I and my family will be looking forward to DEFINITELY coming back to THIS particular location due to this particular employee. He ensured a great dining experience to me and my family and very helpful! Thank you very much! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BJs is usually a weekly stop for me. Enjoy the atmosphere and the food is always good. I am a beer guy and I love their beers, but at $6 a pop the bill stacks up quick. They currently have specials for each day of the work week  minus Friday. Monday is 1/2 off pizza, which if you like deep dish pizza is a fabulous deal, and Wednesday is $4 beer day another good deal. All in all this place is consistent and I will continue to frequent it."}
{"text":"Always good food and brew. Service was fast and attentive.  Happy hour starts at 3 M-F."}
{"text":"Unhappy with food. Raw. Asked for another came back same way raw,but no fries this time.  Fries arrived 10 min later. Server may have accidentally  through my food down in front of me.  However  the 805 beer was delicious.  :-("}
{"text":"Been here twice since they opened. Feels like a cheesecake factory type chain but with a focus on beer. The menu is similar in size (like a book). The atmosphere is typical. I got a burger both times...something that you can't really mess up too bad. I liked their hefeweizen beer. My friend got the jambalaya and liked it. All in all, I'd go back if the wait isn't ridiculous like it always is at olive garden. The staff was peddling the BJs app and other annoying items. I think once all the kinks are worked out it will be a welcomed addition to the other restaurant choices in Mentor."}
{"text":"We went around 9 pm so there wasn't a wait at all. It's a pretty large restaurant so there's plenty of seating. Drinks and food were good, and the staff was friendly. The only con was that my burger had some pink and I asked for no pink but it was still manageable to eat and not bad enough that i felt like i had to send it back. Overall I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  I ordered soup and it came without crackers.  When I asked for them they didn't come until I was almost finished.  My husband ordered a salad with his spaghetti.  The salad didn't come until he was half finished with his spaghetti.  No apology for any of it.  The food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I like this place. I like the pan pizza and can always find something on the menu since it is a very extensive menu."}
{"text":"First time visiting BJs last night and I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered: BBQ Ranch chicken salad with avocado added. The salad was fricken huge and I loved the crispy onions on top. It was cold and refreshing and divine! Hubby got the California burger and said it was ok. All in all, a decent place but was a bit pricey. 12.00 for my salad and 10.00 for his burger that wasn't very big. Strawberry lemonade was ok but Chili's has better. Pizookie was good but they are easy to make at home, not worth it to pay for one here. Service was good although my avocado was initially left off my salad. Would I go back? Yes I would but not often since its kinda pricey for what it is. Would get the salad again, maybe try their pizza, and some of their brews."}
{"text":"With our 2 salads & beer, waitress was confused & had attitudeNo bread or crackers with salads & small portions!  Never going back."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker...but my husband is!  So this review is for their food.  I know that this is a chain and it's the kind of food that you'd expect from a chain.  At least they are consistent with the quality.  They do have the best Cobb Salad that I've ever had.  It must have been the combination of the greens, bleu cheese, turkey, avocado, tomatoes and bacon.  Last night, my son wanted Pizza (A Friday night staple for the kid), so we ordered the Margherita Thin Crust Pizza.  I like an almost cracker crust, but this was way too thin and too crackery.  He ate two small slices.  I know he wants the more flaky bread kind of dough.  They do have a deep dish, but we're not into that either.    I ordered a Wedge Salad.  My brother-in-law asked what the hell it was and why I have half the iceberg on my plate.  I don't like iceberge lettuce, but this is almost embarrasing to admit that I do like this salad!   I know it doesn't have any nutritional value.  Heck, it has negative nutritional value.  My BIL and DH both had the Sourdough Burgers and they both truly enjoyed it.  It's this kinds of Pub food that you come in to this place for....and the beer, I guess."}
{"text":"We took my mother in law here for brunch before a movie at Red Rock. I'm still rather new to Vegas but I'm learning my way around. This was my first time in BJs. 
This place was packed and I know why. The food was phenomenal and the price cannot be beat especially for Vegas. 3 meals plus an appetizer and our bill was under 35$. I thought the server had messed it up but when I checked everything was there. By far the best onion straws in the valley. Yes I am becoming an onion straw expert.  The plates are well sized and the food was so good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great house brews (the porter was as good as any I've had anywhere) and an extensive soup to nuts brewpub menu at extremely reasonable prices. We tried the guac/bacon burger, ahi poke app and the salmon quinoa bowl....all hits, no misses. For a. chain brewpub, this place is pretty hard to argue with. Big nicely laid out room with perefectly nice servers. 

Can't go wrong here. At this price point, the place is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the food at BJ's. I like the fact that they have a big menu and something for everyone. The Pizookies are heavenly. However, the service is ALWAYS terrible.  It must be a corporate issue. I visited many locations in various cities and only once have I ever had good service. This last visit at the Centennial location was no different. Being a Friday night, we expected it to be busy. We didn't have to wait too long for a table, but once we were seated it was 10 mins. or more before our server came over. No big deal, he was obviously busy with multiple tables and we took the time to decide on our food. When he came over, we ordered food and drinks. He brought the drinks out promptly, but that was it. We never got 1 refill the entire hour we were there. A little crazy to me since I'm paying $2-$3 for an iced tea and my husband and I had each drained our glasses before the food even came out. I don't blame the server entirely, it's not like he was standing around idlely. I blame management (or whoever) who allows servers to become so busy that service suffers. This is something that needs to be addressed before I will go back."}
{"text":"This is by the South Hills village mall.

It's a nice large location with open seating and a bar and modern industrial design.

I had a coupon and ate here twice my service was good. It was packed but my food wait wasn't unusually long.

The food is decent to good depending on what you order. I had shrimp parmesan which was just OK and BJ'S favorite deep dish pizza with meatballs and vegetables which was good!

I had the monkey bread with ice cream which was good but too crispy. I want the outside of the bread to be crispy and the inside to be soft. I also tried the white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie with ice cream. It was good but the cookie stuck to the pan. 

I would eat here again. The menu is huge and they have lots of beer!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today had the unlimited soup and salad soup I chose was clam chowder was it was slightly salty to my taste but otherwise good Caesar salad was very good I also had a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup which was very good our waiter Joseph attended to our needs very well I have frequented this place on numerous occasions and have always had very good food and service wait times can be lengthy during football and dinner hours I would not recommend this place for children"}
{"text":"The New Orleans Jambalaya was on point! I had to send mad compliments to the chef. Let's not forget how scrumptious the Pizookies are! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"This is my fav Chandler, AZ restaurant for good reason. Amazing pizza and amazing cali chicken sandwich and AMAZINGGGG PIZOOKIES, too bad my north east friends have no idea what the hell a pizookie is but this is the shit. The best thing to grace the designation of dessert is the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Great prices too this place really knows how to get you to come back.

Relatively quick service on balance, lots of TVs for watching games. I haven't had the beer yet but its a brewery so I'm sure its good."}
{"text":"Brook at the bar was nice. This place had great air conditioner. Nice selection of beers."}
{"text":"My family and I had a terrible experience here. We arrived around 6:30 and waited for about 30 minutes. Although our server was very nice, she had no sense of urgency whatsoever. I'm not sure if it was because they were understaffed or what but our entire order was such a long lead time. From the time we sat down and got our food it had to have been about 45 minutes. When we got our dinner it was luke warm as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile before it even got to us. In total we were here for about 2 1/2 hrs and we probably only spent about 30 minutes eating. Definitely wouldn't recommend coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's a pretty cool spot. The food is always good and the prices aren't bad. Apparently there known for there deep dish pizza!?! They make there own beer! Love the Jamaican Red! All in all I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Friendly staff and food so good. Will definitely come back here. Planning allready to celebrate my birthday here soon. Will recommend to my friends and family to check this out"}
{"text":"I have always spoken highly of BJ's Brewery but enough is enough. This is the 3rd time I have contracted food poisoning. The first 2 times I thought.... hoped it was a fluke. The first time was from the chicken lettuce wraps.... second time ahi tuna salad... and just this Friday the derby salad with chicken. Don't get me wrong the food is great and they have a little of everything for everyone's taste. The service is usually outstanding and the atmosphere is wonderful. But there is seriously something wrong with the way the food is handled or stored. They really need to take this more seriously. I will not be back. Eat here if you want to risk having regrets later."}
{"text":"Normally when we go to BJ'S back in Ohio we enjoy both the food and the service but that didn't work out for us here.  Table of 7 versus one server who we had to wave at chase down to take our orders, refill our drinks and even get the check.  She apologized once for being suddenly inundated by folks coming in but that didn't improve our service.  

Seriously! She asked if we wanted our empty soda glasses removed (no we had grown attached to them) and never removed the empty appetizer plate till the very end.  

The food was good all around except it seemed the ahi tuna salads ordered were very stingy on the tuna but the lack of service just put a cloud over the dinner."}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the past year or so and have really enjoyed all of our dine-in experiences. However, takeout out has been less than satisfactory. If you are a Sally like me its best to actually eat there then to try and order through the app. Any special instructions I have submitted have not been followed through on.  I have enjoyed their specialty brew flights and my daughter really likes the homemade sodas. Try the brussel sprouts appetizer you won't be disappointed. And the gluten free pizzas are some of our favorite."}
{"text":"There was a \"15 minute wait\", but we were called in sooner. The place was pretty busy- Sunday night at dinner time. Thomas S was our server and he was wonderful. Prompt awesome service. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos, recommended by the server from the options I was debating between. They were UH-mazing! The side dish was also delicious. I would definitely recommend BJ's."}
{"text":"My family and I recently went here to celebrate and unfortunetly our visit was not positive.  The appetizers came out cold, food was ok but the service was very lacking and ruined our experience.  This will be the third time we have gone here and each time there has been an issue.  The first time we went, they got our food order wrong.  That was ok, no big deal.  The second time, our food came out cold and the service was lacking.  So we didn't come back for some time.  This last time when our food was delivered, we were doing good but the server didn't come back to refill our drinks or check with us or anything.  The food here has the potential to be really great but if the service is lacking, nobody will want to eat here which is odd because the place always looks like it's busy.  If you do go, I hope you get a good server that is attentive and brings out your food on time but as for us, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This southern California transplant is a good, fun restaurant. Located across the street from the Red Rock Casino in Summerlin it is nice and new and in a nice part of town. 

They have a huge selection of beers to choose from. The menu has just about something for everyone. They have lots of deep dish pizzas to choose from as well. The pizza is what they are known for. The service was friendly and fast.

BJ's has a desert called a Pizookie, which is a baked cookie topped with two scoops of ice cream and served in a dish.You can choose from chocolate chunk, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter or oatmeal raisin walnut ice cream. Totally not healthy and totally yummy."}
{"text":"Let me start with I was on a much needed date night with my hubby while the kids greyed grandmas hair for the weekend. We were seated at a greasy table top and the seat cushions had grease and food particles on it. Not good and I'm wearing all white! I only rate with three stars because of the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant. The food,drinks and service was great! But back to my issue, I don't know how well they clean and sanitize their cloth napkins that the silverware is wrapped in and we use on our face (the corner of your mouth) but for the sake of the community's health, I hope very well! I found five cloth napkins in total on the floor under my table and the surrounding tables ( I counted on my way to the restroom).... I noticed a little extra cushion under my stiletto and my husband stepped on something that poked the bottom of his shoe and that's when he noticed a couple of forks under our table as well. This is when I began to look around and noticed more than I wanted to. Upon picking up the napkins I saw silverware and trash at all of the surrounding booths! We brought it to our waiters  attention and he was highly disappointed.
As we finished our meal a bus boy came by to \"clean\" the booth next to ours and we understood! He spent five seconds (literally) wiping down the table with a dirty damp cloth and did a quick swiffer wipe on one seat cushion and neglected the other! He didn't bother to look under the table or properly wipe down the entire seating area... it was a total hit and miss. All in all the food, drinks and service are always great but the cleanliness gets worse with each visit...."}
{"text":"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse boasts a delicious assortment of brews and cocktails. I'm not a beer drinker but occasionally go here for lunch because they have a decent-sized menu, reasonably-priced lunch specials and plenty of tables with almost no wait time. I recommend trying their Southern fried chicken resting on a bed of cheddar mashed potatoes and corn. BJ's also offers \"enlightened\" items, food that's healthy and relatively low calorie. One of my lunchtime favorites is the Maui pork chop. Just one grilled bone-in chop with a sweet glaze, served with potatoes and crisp green beans. Finish off the meal with their famous Pizookie, a cookie baked fresh out of the oven and topped with ice cream. It's to die for."}
{"text":"BJ's seriously doesn't need another review but ill give it a shot anyway. 

I got a flyer in the mail that said they were doing a special dinner and a date promotion. For $20 bucks you get 2 soups or salads, one medium pizza, and a shared poozkie (thats a desert).  Then you pay $15 and get 2 movie tickets to a regal cinema. 
 
I thought there had to be a catch but nope it was totally legit. The medium pizza is seriously HUGE. We couldn't finish the thing and i had to bring the rest home because it was just that good. We ordered the sweet pig pizza. It has real ham and chucks of pineapple on it. AWESOMEEEEEEE

The clam chowder was crazy. This is the first place that served me clam chowder that i didn't have to doctor up with a little salt and pepper. My wife ordered the tomato soup and that was pretty decent as well. 

The servers are always really nice here and don't allow us to run dry on drinks or feel neglected. The only thing stopping a five star rating is well, actually nothing. Im changing this sucker to 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time here but wont be my last. It seems like they are sort of a sports bar but I think they need more TVs as the coverage lacks.They have a very extensive menu. Everyone was happy with their meal but my dad. Poor him. He ordered the Chowder Bowl and got only the bowl. They were very apologetic and said he could keep the bowl while they prepared one for him in the bowl. What came next was a shock. They really over baked the bread bowl and it was dark near burnt and very crusty. They should never have delivered to the table. I got the the spicy pig pizza and my wife got the old country tomato basil. She ordered extra artichoke. Just a little advice When someone orders an extra topping out it on top so they can see it. At first she returned it because you could not really see but it was there and she did enjoy. We got biegnets for dessert and there were very good. 

Service was excellent and attentive. For the type of restaurant I thought the ambiance was nice. 
A little more quality control could bring this place to a top choice among the sports bar type restaurants."}
{"text":"Came into BJ'S as I wanted a salad. I'm eating alone great atmosphere. The bartender Brad is the best. I told him my eating situation and his suggestions was amazing. Thanks Brad for the great drink and food suggestions. Brad attitude was great as well. Adrienne was great as well very friendly even if though she was not my server. Thank for the great service."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable place, didn't eat this time just some drinks at the bar. Friendly service little steep on prices but would go back."}
{"text":"Solid place with a great menu!  I think the chicken tortilla soup is so good!  But there is so many varieties and a nice low-cal menu as well.  Service was great the last time I was there.  Flat bread pizzas are really really good.  I like it here."}
{"text":"Had the quinoa salmon bowl and because of my garlic allergy our server recommended the lemon butter sauce which was heavenly divine.  Our server Anthony totally went over and beyond as a server: super attentive, provided excellent recommendations plus gave us insider news of a new dinner for two coming up in the next month that ensures we will be coming back again and requesting him as our server.  Ask for anthony for your next visit at this location for superb service!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great staff, timely service and drinks are kept full. Five stars."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and we are here every week!  We love the chicken wings with the drizzle on the side.  The grilled Atlantic salmon us really good and you can't go wrong with any of their salads."}
{"text":"Great food horrible customer service, but if good food matters most to you that's all that matters.  Meanwhile if you have kids or a family it might be rough.  Being in Summerlin they like to take care of the Summerlin people and could care less about the regular people.  If you're single and hot you'll get a table quick if you're a family or fat good luck!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always come for the grilled chicken baked potato seriously the best! Came to brunch for the first time today, and I was not disappointed. Staff is always friendly and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Went there with 6, place was dead, server never showed up so we complained to the hostess. She said something to him and he walked the other way so we left and are now at Burgatory!

Update:  Burgatory was AMAZING!  It was awful to have to remove my party (including two kids 4 & 1) across the street but well worth it.  I've been to this restaurant before, and the food is pretty good, but the competition in the area is a lot better. Updating my review to two stars based on previous visit, because I am less irritated as Burgatory filled me up, but I won't be back again. Too many better options around that actually want your business."}
{"text":"\"What do you want to eat?\" \"I don't know, what do you want to eat?\" 

We've all had these questions asked to us before by someone and BJ's is the spot to be. Are you craving pizza? They have that. Are you craving some Fish n' Chips? Has your stomach been telling you that you want pasta? Well look no further as BJ's has essentially a little bit of everything. I've been to BJ's countless times and not once have I ever been disappointed with my food or service, so a review for them is long overdue. I was here a few days ago on a Wednesday night and they were packed, so you know this place has to be good. Luckily my sister and I were seated just in time before there was a wait. Even though the place packed our server consistently checked up on us and always made sure our water was filled. Their selection and variety of appetizers, entrees, sides, and mini-appetizers are plentiful. You are bound to find something on the menu that'll interest you or satisfy your craving.

Our order consisted of:

An order of the calamari
An order of the Caesar's salad
An order of the fish n' chips
An order of a small deep dish pizza
And you always have to make room for dessert especially their pizookie, which is basically a pizza-cookie topped with Vanilla ice cream. Can't decide on a specific flavor? You have the option to split the pizookie in half. My sister got the chocolate chip while I got the cookies n' cream.

For a place I've been to countless times and have always been satisfied with my food and service, BJ definitely deserves that 5 stars.

NOTE: Sadly they no longer offer thin fries or waffle fries and only have natural cut fries."}
{"text":"I have a lot to say about BJ's. Let's start off with the walk from the parking spaces to the building. If you park across the driving path, be careful! The cars come flying down the ramp from the mall parking lot and we had a close call when we were trying to cross. I think maybe it would be a good safety practice to put up a speed limit sign or paint in a cross-walk so there are no accidents.

Once we approached the door, we noticed that the main entrance is a revolving door. I know there is some kind of energy savings with a revolving door but this one is the stuff of nightmares. If the waiting room is crowded, there will be people standing on the inside of the revolving door so when you go through it, you can't exit easily. Now, there are handicapped doors available to the side of the revolving door so I strongly urge you to use them if the restaurant is busy. 

When we entered, I walked up to the hostess and told her there were two people in our party and gave her my name. She wanted my first name, last initial, and my phone number. I looked at her puzzled and she said, \"Oh, the phone number is so we can text you when your table is ready. Sorry, I'm assuming you've never been here before?\" She was correct, I had never been there before so I think she should ask if we would like a text when our table is ready instead of demanding customer phone numbers with no preface. 

We were told it would be a 30 minute wait but I don't think it was that long. When I got the text that our table was ready, I went back up to the hostess stand and she pointed behind her to the other hostess stand. Why two stands?? This is kind of confusing for a newcomer. So, the people at the second stand take you to your table. It takes up a lot of extra space that could be used to extra waiting room seating to eliminate the revolving door issue. Just sayin'.

The host seated us at a cozy 2-person corner booth at the back of the restaurant. We were pretty happy about that! It was my husband's birthday so a little romantic spot to enjoy our meals was appreciated! 

We looked over the drinks menu and ordered some unique brews. It's really cool that they have a lot of craft beers to choose from. They had a beer I had been looking for but hadn't ever found so I was very excited to order it. Next, we ordered our meals. I ordered the guacamole bacon burger and hubby ordered a different burger.

The burgers came out and looked gorgeous! I really enjoyed my burger but it didn't enjoy me. Unfortunately, I was sick all night. I've never had a burger do me wrong like that, it was kinda disappointing because the flavor of the burger was pretty good. The fries were also good. I like the thin shoestring fries! I really wanted to order a salad from the healthier menu but I couldn't justify paying $14 for a salad.

Overall, weird new experience. Not sure we'll be back. If you're that close to The Rail, you go to The Rail!"}
{"text":"We had a big group of 18 with us during Spring Break and because there were so many people to try to please, BJ's was a great place for everyone to find something they liked. We ordered appetizers, various mains, and desserts. There wasn't one thing we didn't like, even the kids liked their orders! 
For appetizers, the flatbread nachos and potstickers were a hit. I eat potstickers anywhere they are offered and these are among the best I've had. Crispy on the bottom, but steamed perfectly, with a ginger soy dipping sauce. I'd order these as my main course. 
I ordered the prime rib dip sandwich with fries. Fries are more of a beer battered fry which I like. The prime rib was cooked to about med rare, shaved thin, on a roll, au jus ok the side for dipping. 
Two people ordered the root beer ribs-tangy, sweet, slightly spicy, tender meat both liked them. 
We ended with the salted caramel pazookie- a cookie baked in a small cast iron skillet, topped with ice cream and salted caramel. I'd go back just for this. 
If you like lots of choices, and good food on top of that, give BJ's a try."}
{"text":"I went to BJ's for a group birthday celebration and overall had a good time. The grilled chicken potato was good as usual, as was the berry cider. Our service was a bit slow but the waitress was friendly and trying her best."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. After being seated, received water and then did not see our server for ten minutes. Ordered beers which arrived 5 minutes later with no head on them. Food arrived quickly but were served cold fries and the bacon on my girlfriends burger was barely cooked and cold to the touch. We notified the waitress who informed us to set them off to the side. 

Five to seven minutes later,  a manager arrived with fries and condescendingly asked if it wasn't up to our expectations. Girlfriend explained and he attempted to tell her it was because they sit in a steam tray (all while speaking in a tone as if we were 5 year olds). I later ordered an amber lager and was given a pale ale. Avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere. Overpriced, mediocre food with poor and condescending service."}
{"text":"Im gonna give it 3 stars, more like 3.5 but i round down bc its not quite 4 star. There r a lot of crappy things on the menu to navigate around but they do open at 10am on the weekends. Their burgers r good. I am not a fan of deep dish but my wife loves the spicy pig. I like their sandwiches and the chowder is really good. Stick w those and the desserts and youre set"}
{"text":"I would have given it 5 stars but we waited almost an hour for a seat. Not sure they could really do anything about this, but it was frustrating. The food was great. The service was good."}
{"text":"Worst BJ's I've been to 
I was there for 3 hours in the middle of the day on a Monday 
After waiting an hour just to order we get our order placed and wait 30 minutes for our food and the server completely forgot about my sons food and then we wait for another 30 minutes just for his food to get to the table. It also took another hour after we got the last of our food that was messed up by the way to get our check and pay.
And the whole time we were there we only got one water refill.... never will I go to this BJ's ever again..."}
{"text":"Great place for good food. From pizza to to burgers you can't go wrong. Bj's is that kind of restaurant were you know 99% of the time your food will come out looking and tasting amazing.

Weekly specials*
Any weekday you come in they offer a daily special including; 1/2 off pizza on Mondays, $3 pizookies on Tuesdays, $10 burgers on Wednesdays and rib deals on Thursdays. 

Rewards program*
Every time you enjoy a meal you will collect points for every dollar spent. Rewards include free pizookies, and discounted meals. The more points you rack up the bigger the deals. They also email you specials including free appetizers and restaurant specials.

Weekdays are typically slow and weekends you will find there's usually a wait. Today they had an off day but sometimes that happens. We had a few issues with missing items on our meals but a manager came out to reinsure they were fixing my meal to the appropriate standards. Whenever we've run into any issues with food, a manager has always came out and talk to us. It's a nice gesture showing acknowledgement that they messed up and the problem is getting fixed. I come here for the food but the customer service is always extra great!"}
{"text":"First time here with my girl and the steaks were over cooked..... but the manager promptly came out and comped our meals and made us some delicious steaks...... also MIA is a great bartender and very sweet..... First time and definitely not the last...."}
{"text":"We have been to BJ's twice since this place has been open on Eastern.  I know it's been open for a while.  Every time we want to go to this place we try to just walk in but there is always a wait on the weekends.  not just a little wait, a good 40 minute wait.  so we end up going somewhere else.  This time I thought to call ahead and put our name on the list.  I highly recommend doing this if you are going to go on the weekend.  
I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza.  There are different sizes.  I asked the waitress what difference between the mini and small pizza was.  She said the mini was more individual and the small was about a little bigger. She recommended ordering the small because I said I was hungry.  The buffalo chicken pizza was great.  It is a deep dish pizza that includes two of my favorite foods (Buffalo chicken wings & Pizza.)  I also ordered a nutty brewnette pint because this is a brew house.  It was ok, not great.  It is a brown ale similar to new castle.  New castle is a lot tastier.  If you like hand crafted brews and pizza this is a cool place to go."}
{"text":"Good variety menu. Good servings.Typical American food menu.. good ambience. Good to have a choice like this one."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  Parmesan  crusted chicken and twisted blt spinach salad were amazing! Service is top notch. We are from Washington so sadly can't eat here often. Open concept with great music. Great strawberry majors too and beers."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this place on a Wednesday night for her late birthday celebration. We came in around 5 o'clock and the wait was 50 minutes for a table of two... Crazy! Good thing the mall is right by this restaurant so we decided to kill time in there. When we came back they still had us wait an extra 20 minutes! I understand it's the holiday but I wish they have a better system of making a reservation ahead. (FYI they only take reservations of a party of 6 or more) 

Besides the long wait, the food was great! I had the roasted salmon with quinoa and it was delicious. My friend tried the mahi-mahi tacos and she liked that a lot too. 

I'll have to come back on a better day when they're not super busy. Because the food was not bad at all and there's a few other things I would want to try in the menu!"}
{"text":"There desserts are the best!!!! Never have I ever had a bad experience. I recommend the bj's favorite pizza. Its  a deep dish pizza. The staff is awesome, they are pretty fast for always being busy. Which is a good sign :)"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! Graduation party for 35..we called in the reservation ahead of time. Of course we couldn't be seated until 1/2 the party came. Another person told the hostess she didn't know how many were in the party but thought it was less than 35. When all 35 showed up the manager was argumentative about the # in our party, seemed irritated that there were more, made little attempt to accommodate us, wouldn't give us a neighboring table. Finally someone had the wherewithal to give us another booth. Never had this level of service at BJs...disappointing."}
{"text":"I really want to know how this restaurant functions on a night that it's actually busy. Came here for my birthday tonight. My sister in law tried calling ahead to make a reservation as it was going to be 8 adults and a baby. She was told that we couldn't get a reservation because our party was larger than 6 people (first red flag). However, she was assured that they are NEVER busy on Sunday nights and that we should have no problem being sat right away. Okay then- we decide to go. Get there just before 6 pm. There's a decent amount of customers in the restaurant, but nothing crazy. We go to the hostess stand and are told, \"Oh, well since we have to push two tables together, it's going to be a 45 minute wait.\" We were hesitant, but then looked at how many tables were open + how many people were leaving the restaurant and figured it wasn't going to even take 45 minutes (and probably wouldn't have anywhere else), so we put our names in and wait. And wait. And wait some more. Meanwhile, all these small parties of people walk in and are getting sat right away. During this time not once did either of the hostesses come to check in on us or say they were working to get a table together for us asap- just nothing. Finally, after an hour of waiting my other sister in law, husband, and their baby (my niece) have to leave because the baby is getting restless. THE WHOLE POINT OF US GOING WAS TO BE TOGETHER FOR OUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. So we go back to the hostess stand to let them know that our party is now going to be just a table of six. As we walk up to the hostess stand, the hostess literally looks over my fiancée's head to ignore him and sit another party that had literally just walked into the restaurant. I'm ready to leave and just go to Panera at this point, but we decide to stay. I wish I could say it got better from that point on, but sadly it did not. We were sitting for about 10-15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Then as we're getting our drink order, my future father in law tries to order a beer, but our waiter interrupts him to tell him that the beer he wants is very similar to another beer and that he'll get him a taste of both (ummmmm okay?). So he goes back and gets our drinks. My future in law tastes both beers and orders the beer he originally tried to order to begin with. At this point we don't know how much longer we'll have to wait until the next time we'll see him, so we figure we need to order our food as quickly as possible. I we order appetizers. And wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, we get plates, only to realize that we weren't given enough plates. Oh, and at this point we don't have silverware or the beer my future father in law order. So we say something, finally get the amount of plates we need and the silverware. Still waiting on the beer. The beer finally arrives, but it's the wrong beer. Luckily, that gets fixed fairly quickly (and by fairly quickly, I mean we only wait 5-20 minutes before the correct beer is brought out). Finally, after being in the restaurant for almost 2 hours, our appetizer arrive. I wish I could say they were terrible, but they were pretty good. We had the chicken pot stickers and lettuce wraps. Then we got our food- oh, except for me because they messed up on it and our server surprisingly caught it and had it fixed. We finish our meals and then then bill came. We see that nothing was comped even though we had expressed our grievances throughout the dinner. At this point, I'm ready to scream, but miraculously hold it in. My future father in law says something to our server, who responds with \"oh, was it anything I did?\" Weird. But, we did end up getting some of our meal comped. The manager never came out to apologize or check in on us what-so-ever, so it's clear as to where the problems stem from. So, that was mine and my fiancée's birthday dinner...... The only reason that this is getting one star is because the food is good. Horrible service and there is clearly a management problem, but decent food. Sadly, it's not good enough for me to ever go here again."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken grilled cheese is so good, bf had the bacon burger and BLT salad, started with artichoke dip EVERYTHING IS AWESOME"}
{"text":"It was okay.

I mean the place was very nice and clean. The food was okay. I had the wings and a friend of mine had the double cheeseburger and it was actually pretty good. Plus I do have to say that the house brew was good as well. 

My only problem was with the prices and the service. The prices were a bit pricey. For 3 people who had 1)wings 2)burger and 3) spaghetti w./no meatballs..the bill came too 50.00! The food was good, but not THAT good!

...and on top of that the service moved pretty slow. It wasn't that busy and yet there was a great lag in service.

Honestly, the food was good enough that we will come back and try it again one day...but if the service isn't improved, it will most likely be the last time..

Update to come...but for now...

3 stars."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place has it all. Great service, a hugh variety of food to choose from.

I really like their pesto chicken grilled pizza, but I could go on forever with all my favorites. Check out there craft beers too.

Simply delicious."}
{"text":"I've never ever had to give such a harsh review before, but unfortunately the service and quality of food at this particular location was absolutely horrendous. It took an hour to be seated, which was 30 minutes passed the suggested wait time. When we were finally seated (party of 5) the booth was filthy and too small. It took 25 minutes for our entire party to get our drinks. After another 30 we got our appetizer which were all salads. It took another 26 minutes for me to get my salad dressing. My husband and I have celiac so BJs is usually very accommodating when it comes to food allergies. When I got my food they had their battered fries touching my gluten free burger, unfortunately with celiac that would have sent me to the hospital. I had to have my food sent back. When i received my burger it was raw in the middle and missing a couple things that came on it. My father in law ordered a burger and fries, the burger came 20 minutes after everyone else finished their meal and his fries were cold.My father in law was also horribly disrespected by one of their managers when he complained about the service. She snatched plates out of his hands rolling her eyes and mumbling. The other manager came out and apologized and took care of the entire bill. We love bjs but will never return to this location ever again."}

{"text":"An amazing restaurant for any occasion!!! So many food options (all great, but I have my favorites!), many drink options, and comfortable atmosphere! 
I've been here many times for birthdays, celebrations, meetings, and just for lunch!
Prices vary, you can spend a lot or can find something for cheap! ($15-) 
Tonight I was there with my best friend for her birthday and our waiter, Brandon, took so much care of us! Birthday pizookie (specialty cookie/brownie desert) & free drink  Brandon, you rock!"}
{"text":"Came in with my Husband and Daughter for the first time after she received a achievement certificate from her school for a free kids meal. 
Tam was our server and had a great experience! He was efficient, knowledgeable, and friendly. 
Cost was a concern when we came here, because, like most, we are on a budget, but  I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable the menu was. 
Food was tasty and good proportions. Not over the top. 
Good craft beer selection on menu with accurate descriptions of what they taste like and food pairings to go with. 
Very impressed that the manager came over at the end to congratulate my Daughter for her achievement at school and gave her a pin. It shows they care about the community and not just doing the certificate to get more business. Although it worked, because we probably wouldn't have gone there. 
We will be back! Thank you for the good experience."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this is somewhat of a chain. Overall it was okay. Good beer selection. I got the Mac and cheese with chicken and siracha sauce. The cheese sauce was a bit thick and wasn't all that great but it was bad either. Also random note: anyone else think their logo is so blah and it appears that zero effort was put into the design of it?"}
{"text":"So, this was an interesting experience.  First of all, I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants with massive menus.  Now, that being said, the experience was OK.  I had the spicy pig, which was good, but made incorrectly.  When asked to fix the order, the waiter brought back the same, burnt, flatbread with the added topping, uncooked, place on top.  Now the topping was only pineapple, so there was no issue with this being raw.  

My server was nice, but I have to say my table was shocked when we found out he had been there a year.  He was very wrinkled and did not seem to know the menu well.  He brought me back my flatbread in that condition and then asked if it was OK or if it should be remade.  I just feel that it was not the experience I would expect from a high end Chain."}
{"text":"Because you can't reply to the review, this is a note for the manager:

I have used the app twice to get on the list before arriving. First time the incident I mentioned in my first review occurred. I tried it again two weeks ago and then called the hostess stand. Person I spoke to said it takes 10 minutes off the wait max and he couldn't even see if I was on the list. We went somewhere else that night. Just wanted to make you aware. Thanks!"}

The food came put pretty fast as well. Kaitlyn and Alga were our servers today and they were really great and friendly. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"When you get seated prompltly at 4:45 with a less than half dining area And wait more than 10 minutes without staff even asking for a drink Order, one asks why give BJ's your business!  And to think
We come enough to be rewards members.  Bye Bye BJ's"}
{"text":"I went here on Thursday ordered Parmesan crusted chicken. Chicken was warm not hot potatoes and vegetables were cold. This is second time I had potatoes and vegetables came out cold. I got quest and chips appetizer it came out with meal. I have received much better service in past and food was hot."}
{"text":"We like BJs handcrafted root beer & cream sodas!! Free refills and they're served in a mug - like a hand crafted beer. They're sweet and smooth. Delicious! The black cherry is less sweet than the others. The orange cream tastes the orange dreamsicles from my childhood. The cream soda and root beer are tasty too! 
I ordered the dinner portion quinoa salmon dish. The quinoa was good, and there was a TON of it. Way too much to finish. The salmon was a little too salty for my liking. I ate it because I was hungry & hate to see salmon (or any protein) go to waste. The mushrooms and asparagus were good in the mix, also. More of those and less of the peppers & tomatoes will be my request if I try this dish again.
My husband ordered a salad and the 5 Meat pizza. (Yeah, he's funny.) He thought the salad was overpriced for what is given. (He's in the restaurant business, so knows food costs, etc.). And he was not impressed with the pizza. It was okay. 
We both enjoyed the chocolate chip pizooki. A softly baked, still warm cookie with ice cream on top...is hard not to like!!
We had not been to BJs in a while, and now we remember why. It's okay, and the tab with tip was $60. We both want the quality & taste (for that price) to be a little more impressive. 
The service was great! Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive despite having many tables & guests. Our wait time was 10-15 minutes at dinner time on a Thursday, so not bad at all. We just desired more from the food flavors of our entrees."}
{"text":"Sometimes it is difficult being gluten-free. I'm not talking about being gluten free to jump on the new diet fad bandwagon; I'm talking about having to eat gluten free or suffering the nauseous, gut wrenching pain of gluten poisoning. So when I had to leave Chicago, which has a plethora of gluten free establishments, to live in Las Vegas I was nervous that I wouldn't have many options that didn't completely empty my wallet and bank account each week.

Thankfully, I have found BJ's. 

I don't know about the rest of their menu, but I've eaten off their gluten free menu and I will continue to do so for a very long time. 

Do I eat healthy? Sure. Do I workout? Absolutely, 6 times a week or more. Does a girl have to start off the meal with a bowl of luscious, cream filled tomato bisque that makes my veins fight to keep unblocked? Yes. Does a girl have to eat some pizza with melty, oozy mozzarella cheese, Italian Sausage, garlic and fresh basil once a month? Darn tootin'. Does a girl have to finish the above meal with a GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP PIZOOKIE?!? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!

Oh that tomato bisque. You creamy souptastic gluten free deliciousness. Your high fat and calorie content would normally make a health nut like me cringe and hide under a table. However, when you come to the table, lightly garnished with parsley, smelling like Mom's tomato soup when I was a kid, I must devour every last bite. I did today. I almost stabbed my fiance with a spoon to get the last drop.

You have to understand that there are some restaurants (*cough* Aurelio's *cough*) that seem to think that gluten free means that either we don't really like food or that we don't know what real food should taste like. Some gluten free pizzas have this bland, eerily flaky, bulky pizza crust that can barely brown when cooked let alone withstand pizza sauce, cheese and other ingredients (see above coughing spasm). BJ's makes this amazing thin crust pizza that is perfectly thin, crispy and has garlic and herbs infused in the crust to make me remember why pizza makes my heart sing every time I ate it back in Chicago. The Italian sausage was not as good as Chicago, but it still hit the spot, especially when they drowned the pizza with deliciously melted mozzarella cheese with roasted garlic. As I ate it I forgot that I was gluten free and simply enjoyed my food. Pure comfort.

I could go on for pages about that freaking pizookie. You guys, it is a deep dish chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top. When I say ice cream I really should clarify one thing. By the time it gets to the table it isn't completely ice cream anymore because that warm, gooey, rich and downright sinful gluten free cookie melts that simple ice cream and makes dessert something that will haunt me whenever I go to the gym (which is right down the street).

One thing: I can't wait for their gluten free menu to grow. Right now they have some soups, salads, pizza and giant stuffed baked potatoes. Don't forget that pizookie too! Maybe some flatbread, hamburgers and a couple other entrees other than a balsamic chicken would be FANTASTIC!!!

Service was great. Water never went empty for more than one second, very friendly, patient and knew his gluten free items. His service was flawless, and I could not have felt more comfortable eating there as someone with a major allergy. If I wasn't suffering from a food coma I would go find his name off the receipt, but right now laying in bed with a round, full tummy seems like the perfect way to enjoy the rest of this meal."}
{"text":"I went to BJ's Restaurant for the first time this weekend. And we had mixed results. The service by Brandon was excellent, but please tone it down on the upselling. He made a great suggestion regarding getting double meatballs in the Calzone as one of the two additional toppings that comes with the dish.

The nachos were good, but could have used some Guac and Jalapenos to bring it up to excellent. The meatball Calzones were excellent (better than Uncle Sam's I'm told, sorry Sammy).

 I know Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, and you Sir, are not Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Not even close, that's why the Yelp rating for this restuarant takes a header. This is what a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza looks like.......http://www.giordanos.com/. Their pizza was just a lot of crust with a thin layer of cheese and toppings. The Wendy's \"Where's the Beef\" lady would have been yelling \"Where's the Cheese\" if she had a \"Chicago Deep Dish Pizza\" at BJ's.

Having said all that, my family and I really enjoyed the atmoshere and the great selection of entrees and will be back to try the other entrees, but just not the Pizza."}
{"text":"The service here was so bad...we waited forever for our meals, our glasses ran dry begging for refills and the waiter forgot several of our requests. The only redeeming factor was that I did find the food good and I know the restaurant just opened, so I'm hoping the service improves and this was just some new restaurant jitters."}
{"text":"A BJs recently opened in McCandless Crossing near our home. We've gone a few times because we really enjoy the food, however the service is always so horrible. We recently went to the BJs in the South Hills and I was interested in seeing if our experience would be different. It wasn't. The service was super slow and inattentive. We never got our appetizer. Had to ask for a refill from the bar several times and soft drinks/water cups ran dry without refills. They brought out the wrong flavor boneless wings, then charged us for both when we asked to keep the mistake wings since they would just be wasted anyway. We asked to speak with a manager after the waitress told us she wasn't allowed to take it off the bill, and the manager was very short with us. She did take the charge off our bill, but you could tell she just didn't want to deal with us. As a chain restaurant, you'd think they'd have the management and service down pat, but that just isn't the case with BJs. We've now been to two of these restaurants and both had the same poor service. Since this has been our experience across two restaurants and perhaps 6 visits, this issue is a management issue, not a server issue. They are either too short staffed for the number of tables they have or aren't giving their servers adequate training. Don't come here unless you have lots of time to kill and plenty of patience."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down, everything was prompt, hot and delicious, service was great as soon as we walked through the door & on a busy Sunday too"}
{"text":"I've been to BJ's probably over 10 times, and I've always been consistently impressed by their food. I've had so many pizzas, pastas, tacos, and desserts from their that I've lost count, but I will showcase some of their highlights. 

I usually don't get appetizers from BJ's because their food is in really large portions, so I'm full by those alone, but I've gotten their chicken tenders before, and they're really good. They're nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside like you'd expect. They also give you this tangy honey mustard dipping sauce with them which is a great complement. They also come with a mountain of french fries. The fries don't taste too good with the honey mustard, so I usually just ask for ranch dressing for them... because I think ranch is the perfect dipping sauce for fries, not gross ketchup.

Their pizza is great. If there is a long wait, and you have to sit in the waiting area, the servers will come out with deep dish pizzas put up into individual bite sized pizzas for the crowd to sample while waiting. I think this is epicly nice of them because I would be perfectly willing to wait, but it's always nice to snack on a little slice of pizza too. hehe. 

I usually just stick with pepperoni pizza. It's a classic and is loaded with lots of meaty pepperoni, stringy cheese, and hearty tomato sauce. Normally, I hate tomato sauce on pizza, seriously, the less sauce the better, but with BJ's pizza, their sauce is so flavorful that the abundance of it is fine with me! Their barbecue chicken pizza is really solid as well. I've had it a couple of times. I like CPK's BBQ chicken pizza better, but this is a nice deep dish take on it. Next time I go, I need to try the buffalo chicken pizza to see how that compares to various ones that I've had. Maybe I can persuade my boyfriend to go there this weekend. hmm...

The sandwiches are really yummy. Their pulled pork is really tender and not dry at all. The Cobb sandwich is tasty too with the addition of bacon, cause everything tastes better with a littler... err... a lot of bacon on it. The BJ's burger is great, but you should definitely add bacon to this one for the reason that I mentioned above. Their parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. It's very cheesy, and their mashed potatoes are very creamy. Their fish tacos are great too. They go great with a side of strawberry lemonade to drink.

So... as if this review wasn't long enough... DESSERT! First off, get a pizookie. I've seen some of my friends' pictures on facebook where they've gone to BJ's and they've ordered something like the apple crisp for dessert. I've shaken my head at those pictures many times. Seriously, you don't know what you're missing unless you get the pizookie! It's the best part of the meal. I always get Triple Chocolate Pizookie with Ghirardelli chocolate. My boyfriend and I split it, and it's pure decadence even after you claim that you're so full that you can't eat dessert. 

So yeah... this was a really long review, but I've been here so many times, and I really wanted to share how much I love BJ's. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though). 

Although I will say that the service was awesome, the \"good\" ends there. 

The food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it. 

The drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all. 

Next time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy."}
{"text":"The waitress Jennifer was extremely kind and helping.  She made great suggestions. Amazing customer service plus food was delicious."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to dine at BJs on Dec. 3rd.  We get the little buzzer for when your table is ready, and we sit down.  First, there was another diner that was sitting on the bench in the \"waiting\" area breastfeeding her baby.  Why the restaurant would allow this - I have no idea.  But anyhow, we wait for our buzzer to buzz, and low and behold after 15 minutes it's buzzing.  We go up to the front, they get our menus ready and ask us to stand off to the side.  We stand off to the side... for 30 minutes.  The hostess tells us literally about 10 times that our table is being cleaned.  So why ring the buzzer if it wasn't ready the first time? 

Finally, the hostess takes us out back to our table, and the table is still dirty!  What in the world??  So we stand there as she grabs a busser to clean the table.  Then we get seated on a wet table.

Our waitress comes after a few minutes, and she has this matter-of-fact attitude and doesn't even apologize for the mishap which she clearly knew about because she was talking to the hostess who was telling her about it.  But anyway, we order our drinks.  She comes back and gives everyone the wrong drinks.  Everyone on the table just starts handing out the appropriate drinks to the appropriate people on the table.  

We order our food and wait almost another half an hour for our entrees.  The chili was absurdly salty, and it had an alcohol taste to it.  Completely inedible.  We tell this to the waitress, and she apologizes but does nothing about it.  At this point, we conduct ourselves by the dining golden rule to not anger your waitress.  We say nothing further.  

I ordered a 12oz steak - medium.  This was the smallest most overcooked steak I have ever had.  It was 6oz at the most.  It was unbelievable.  Underseasoned and lacking from any flavor.  I ask the waitress for steak sauce, and she brings it by and just drops it on the table without even looking my way.  

When we were done with our meal, she comes by and tells us \"if you want desert, you can have red velvet pazookie. It's good.\"  That's it?  No menu, no other choices? 

We pay our bill and leave.  The quality and service was abysmal at this BJs.

You're better off going to the one in Centennial or Summerlin."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly servers and hosts. Their app works well for mobile pay, getting on the wait list for a shorter wait when you get there, and using rewards points and coupons."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, considering we come here enough to have a BJ's Rewards card, but sometimes I feel the service is lacking when they are busy or running a large party table. They have great beers & I love their fried artichoke hearts. 70% of the time, it's a solid 8/10 for a dining experience, but they aren't able to be consistent with it. It's usually a hit or miss when we go to eat there."}
{"text":"The food is soso, but the pazookie is amazing. My husband loves their pizza, where I prefer a more thin crust pie myself. Lately the menu is starting to get humongous similar to a Cheesecake Factory menu.  So if you like options, they have it. Our waitress Amber G honestly made the experience 5 star. She was funny, attentive, and thought of little things like the kid's starter plate.  Thanks Amber G for making our family dining a great experience."}
{"text":"Hubby and I finally went to this restaurant on Thursday night. First and last time we will.

Service leaves a lot to be desired for. Food took forever to get. Waitress came to us several times to apologize, and say that the food was coming soon. 

It was NOT worth the wait. I ordered the burger with a side of mashed potatoes. They brought it, and the burger was overcooked, and had bacon on it...I didn't order it this way...I don't eat pork, and was totally turned off. Told the it wasn't mine, and the server insisted it was. I told her it wasn't, as I did not order bacon, and she said, \"oh, it must be HIS\", meaning my husband. He already had his burger in front of him, with the bacon that he ordered.  They just made them both the same. I sent it back, they offered to take the burger off of my bill, AND get me a free one.  I told them no, I would just eat the potatoes.

They tried several times to make me another, and I politely refused the offer. The waitress then said, \"Why wouldn't you want a FREE burger?\".  I told her because if they could not get it right the first time, I don't want it.  How hard is it to get a rare burger with cheese?  They specialize in burgers, don't they????

Anyway, I have a personal rule for myself. If I wait forever for my food, and they mess it up, I don't want it or anything else from the \"chef\".  Period. I watched too many movies where the cook spits on the food, since someone complained, and I am not taking the chance.

I ate the mashed potatoes, and they were pretty lame.  My husband's burger was mediocre, at best.  He told me to be glad that they took mine back, as it was pretty bad.

Sad that the North Hills can't get any good restaurants. All they are getting are chains, and the procedures are an assembly line, I think.  No thanks, before I pay for bad food, I will just eat at home."}
{"text":"Until recently i had only had the pizza, but their enormous encyclopedia of a menu is full of tons of delicious options from sandwiches to pastas.  Overall very impressed with the quality of food which encompasses a multitude of genres."}
{"text":"DO USE BJ'S APP!!  When dining on 3/24/18 I paid the bill thru their app and my card was charged. The waitress said it didn't show paid in the restaurants system so we paid the waitress.  So both charges clear my account.  I went into the restaurant on 3/26/18 and I was told one of charges will be refunded.  Well it's 4/2/18 and I still don't have my money back, so I call corporate phone number. They don't have customer service and my call transferred to the restaurant.  No sorry, no nothing.  The food is not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"My client and I had lunch here yesterday and let me tell you, it was Amazing. We were waited on pretty quick. We ordered appetizers that ideally would take longer than expected, but got it fairly quick. My client ordered the Avocado rolls I think and I had the Ahi Poke, which can I add was delicious. We later had our burgers and that could not have been any better. My client has the Black N Bleu Burger and I had the Turkey Burger, My Golly, it was nice, juicy, and just hit the spot. Amazing I tell you."}
{"text":"The food is the only reason I come back here. The service is awful!

A dinner for two people should not take over an hour and a half. The restaurant wasn't overly busy either. It took awhile to get our orders and when the orders came out we asked for a side of ranch for our fries. By the time the side came out, we were about done. We ordered a pizzookie for dessert. When we were done we waited a good 15 minutes for our check. There is no reason why a check would take that long."}
{"text":"This is not your usual sports bar fare.  The Thai Chicken salad is amazing! Juicy chicken, fresh avocado & a delicious dressing on fresh greens. I'm embarrassed to say I ate every bite!

You can get the usual items on a sports bar menu but the difference is they take the care to make sure everything is top quality.  I haven't had anything here that wasn't fresh and well prepared.

The servers are friendly and attentive.  I don't give 5 stars easily but this establishment
takes the time and puts in the effort to deserve it."}
{"text":"Came here after walking out of Twin Peaks due to a lack of service. Once seated it was about two minutes between getting our drink ordered taken and our drinks being brought to us. Our server Rachel was really attentive and anticipated our needs. We ordered the five meat pizza and it came out very fast for a pizza and tasted great. Overall a great place especially with their happy hour beer prices. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I went to the BJ's in Polaris Columbus Ohio and it was pretty much the same as this one. The food really isn't all that bad it was exceptionally busy because of the Christmas season and this restaurant is positioned right near the mall which makes it getting into and out of pretty challenging at times. Our issue wasn't with the food but rather the service. I did order a buffalo chicken wrap which they said they didn't have but they did offer to make me one I thought okay awesome this is sweet these guys are going to make me something that's not on the menu. However what came out was a chicken parmesan style pita pocket thing which was absolutely delicious none-the-less but it wasn't what I ordered.

No it was lunch and are servicing to you a little bit frazzled but my main reason for three stars was that the entire time I was there there were stacks of dirty plates that would never bussed off of the table.  
As our lunch when on the stack of dirty plates just got higher and higher and higher almost humorous. It's several different points we did see the server come by and look at the stack of dirty plates and just keep walking. For now just three stars I'm willing to come back and try it again because the food was actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"A very large menu and great food.  The avocado rolls are my favorite appetizer! Staff was great also."}
{"text":"Good food.  Pizza is very good but the sauce is a little bland.  It's very popular so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I always receive a very consistent meal here, whether if I'm in the mood for a salad, pizza or turkey burger.  BJ's always is pretty busy so don't be surprised if you have to wait.  

Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Pizookie, which is a giant pie lie chocolate chip cookie fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, that in itself is a meal!

If you are looking for a more up-scale bar scene but want to escape the slightly higher prices of Yard House, I would recommend BJ's."}
{"text":"I can still remember the first experience I had at a BJ's Restaurant. It was in Arlington, Texas back in 2008. I wasn't nearly as big of an annoying beer snob back then and, more importantly, I wasn't so hung up on eating healthy food. This made BJ's a pretty damn good joint for me. My wife and I loved their pumpkin spice ale and the pizookie, c'mon, nothing that good should be legal. Anyway, fast forward to 2017, we're back in Cleveland, and we'd all but forgotten about BJ's. That is until we heard they were opening a location in North Olmsted. Gods be praised. (angelic choir, light beams).

Yeah, yeah. It's a chain. We all get it. While I don't go out of my way to frequent chain restaurants, I also feel that if a chain is done right, there's nothing wrong with it. More of a good thing, right? And as far as chains go, BJ's is about as polished a concept as you're likely to find. Big menu, good beer, clean and modern design. We stopped in at this location around 5pm on a Wednesday with mild trepidation and vague recollections of pizookie-induced pancreatic spasms. We were also aware of everyone's complaints about wait times, so our expectations were managed accordingly.

If you've never had a BJ's experience, one of the first things you'll probably notice is the sheer size of the place. It's pretty damn big. I hadn't noticed so much in Texas because, well, because everything in Texas is freakin' big, but in tiny Great Northern plaza, BJ's is a monolithic structure of epic proportions. It still has that new restaurant smell.

We were greeted by a group of smiling young ladies as soon as we entered. We were told it'd be about 30 minutes our so. A quick assessment of the surroundings and we spied seats at the bar. Wait averted. BTW, the guy working the bar was a consummate professional. Service industry folks that take pride in their job and exude confidence and friendliness are a rarity. Celebrate (and tip well) when you encounter them. Our beers were always filled, our plates cleared toot sweet, and waters without asking. Overall, service was excellent.

The beer. While it's not really brewed on site at each location (they own 6 breweries in 5 states) it is really tasty, expertly brewed and styled more toward the middle of the bell curve. They've got styles to suite just about every taste - pilsner, wit, stout, IPA, pale ale, hefeweizen - and they do seasonal and limited run beers like the aforementioned pumpkin ale. I've had just about every beer they brew and they are all solid. Annoying beer geeks may knock 'em, but seriously, I have no complaints in the libation department. Besides, they've won multiple Great American Beer Festival awards so they've gotta be doing something right.

The menu here is sizeable but well laid out and organized with beautiful photography. It's like it has been scientifically designed to appeal to just about everyone and, lo and behold, they've even got \"enlightened favorites\" living happily next door to the usual, more indulgent suspects. Really, it all looks and sounds great, so you'll have trouble deciding. If it were in any way possible, I'd love to try everything. We had a pizookie in our sights, so we tried to eat conservatively. Here's a rundown of our selections:

Twisted BLT Salad: Probably the most disappointing dish of the meal. Baby spinach, diced tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles tossed in honey sriracha vinaigrette and topped with smoked bacon and chopped hard-boiled egg. It tasted OK, it just wasn't tossed, stingy on the dressing, and the goodies seemed in short supply.

Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts: Tossed in the same/similar slightly sweet & spicy dressing as the Twisted BLT Salad, most of the sprouts were cooked properly, a nice char throughout.

Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms: Mini bellas stuffed with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Yum. These poppable apps were delicious. The lemon pesto sauce really brightened them up.

Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl: I know. Way too healthy. The chicken was roasted perfectly, a nice crispy, spicy crust. The quinoa was tender, well-seasoned and plentiful, but the bed of spinach was raw instead of the advertised sauteed, the mushrooms were also nearly raw, and the ratios were just off.

Enlightened Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos: The roasted salmon was cooked perfectly, the maple cumin glaze was tasty albeit quite sweet, and the broccoli slaw and candied pecans (more sugar) added nice textural elements. The side of seasonal bistro grains was OK - a cold salad of quinoa, black beans, tomatoes, corn and cucumber. The pita shells are also quite hefty, so I'm not really sure how \"enlightened\" this dish is. Tasty though.

The Pizookie (small version, perfect for 2) - If you haven't had a Pizookie you haven't lived. Restaurants all over the country are emulating this dessert with its warm, sorta underbaked cookie underneath ice cream. BJs has mastered this treat."}
{"text":"The Monday half-priced deep dish pizza was amazing. However, the service was terrible. 

We waited almost forty minutes for our food and after our leftovers were boxed, it took over thirty minutes to get our correct check. The entire agonizing experience was almost two hours.

The waitress also bumped into me with her tray, multiple times. 

When you start a new with lunch specials and end with \"have a good evening,\" there's a big problem. 

BJ's might be great in a few months, but they certainly have kinks to work out."}
{"text":"I am impressed they serve bison burgers. Food is good. Like the menu choices. Like the home-brewed sodas. Only complaint is the curbside service has not been available on two occasions. Restaurant is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is always the kids' first choice because of the fries and pizzookie ... it's really good, the Buffalo chicken pizza is to die for and the menu is huge. Great beer and cocktail selection and a rewards card we use often. In the service is always good, but slooow because they are always packed. I do find it hard to find low carb options... but that's my problem."}
{"text":"Love their food but... It takes forever! It takes a good 1hr 15 mins for lunch and order lunch specials. For dinner it's about 1hr 45min. Hopefully they will be faster next time."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in BJ's food. I ordered the French dip sandwich  and the runner who brought out the food didn't even notice  that she had a empty sauce dish on the plate that the horseradish sauce should have been in. She then tells me to be careful as the plate is hot, which it was not hot at all. The roast beef on my sandwich was very cold like it just came out of the fridge and the cheese was not even melted. I told my server about my sandwich being very cold ( not even room temp) and he took it back. Ten minutes later he brought me another sandwich which wasn't even warm, crazy how bad the preparation and food quality has gotten here. I don't think I will be back as the last few trips to BJ's I have been really unimpressed with the food."}
{"text":"Haha, BJ's, now that that's aside...

The food here is amazing! I came here for lunch with my mom even though I wasn't hungry at all. Their menu is large with something for everyone, even for those like me who come in with a very little appetite. They have a small bites menu consisting of stuffed mushrooms, ahi tuna, and a few other choices for $3. I ordered the ahi tuna that was seared to perfection for being such a small filet and the portion was perfect! My mom ordered the flatbread and salad lunch combo. I couldn't resist trying her flatbread. OMG, the crispy thin crunch of their flatbread...so delicious!

I checked out their beer selection and was pleasantly impressed. I can't wait to come back with an appetite to try more items and beverages off their menu! The hostess greeted us with a smile while she sat another party in front of us and then came back right away and sat us. The server was quick and the food came out fast. The decor was nice, but its still a fun casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Restaurant is tidy and welcoming. Server was knowledgeable and helped with every selection along the way. The Mediterranean Pizza was exquisite and had ingredients that are lacking in most other imitators. Many craft beers and the Brewhouse Blond fit my palate perfectly, as I tend to favor the lighter varieties. No complaints whatsoever, and I look forward to visiting this location again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were just at BJ's it was awful. Our soup was cold, the salad had wilted lettuce, also chicken was cold We normally go there for dinner this is the first time we ever went there for lunch we will not be going back. I'm giving you one star because  our waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"First time at a BJ's...don't know why I waited so long!  Great menu options, but opted for the cherry chipotle salmon dish.  WOW!  Very nice flavors, perfectly cooked.  Nice and healthy too.  Our server was amazing!  Never let our jack and cokes get empty  :)  Most definitely coming back for the salmon!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I may be one basic-ass bitch, but I am a beer connoisseur. I originally came here because this was my late husband/s favorite \"All- American\" restaurant, but for a restaurant/ brewhouse that prides themselves on their craft beers... they kinda suck. Just being honest.

I've tried a few things on the menu, and the Santa Fe egg rolls were pretty legit. The white cheddar mashed potatoes are pretty life changing, to be honest. All of their steaks are overly seasoned with sodium, and like I said previously... their beer kinda sucks. Many descriptions pride themselves on body and flavor, but I always find them to fall flat and short.

Service is always hit or miss. You'll either get spot on service, or you'll see your server once or twice your whole meal."}
{"text":"The only reason this restaurant even gets one star is the waiter.  He was so nice but the food was horrendous.   I ordered the \"new\" baked ziti, and it literally had a half of a cup of oil in the pan. I couldn't even eat it.   I took one bite, then looked at the pan and the grease was oozing out of it everywhere.  It was so gross and made me immediately nauseous.  We called our waiter over and he took it away and took it off our bill.  We left before my husband even finished so I think the whole meal should have been comped.  Needless to say, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very crowded and the staff was pretty nice!  They seem to have issues with communication among staff though.  I would give 5 stars, but my food was cold.  I would've asked for it to be heated up, but the poor guy waiting on us had like 15 tables and was running like crazy.  I'll definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Went here, after we got a housewarming gift card from our realtor. Foor was surprisingly delish! We ordered, again, bruschetta and a deep dish pizza.  Had the beer sampler, since I'm not big on hops, this wasn't my thing, but they do make their own root beer, which is just as yummy! For desert we had oreo deep dish cookie, served w/ 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream (YUM).

Only thing is, the waitress seem to \"forget\" something you asked for...1st time we went, they \"forgot\" my drink, 2nd time, I asked for ranch dressing and she \"forgot\", I had to ask another waiter...

Go online to find a $5 coupon...its well worth it!"}
{"text":"Bj's is always consistent . The food is good and so are the prices.   I have had a few visits with slow or sub par service but again it's pretty rare. The menu has about 4 pages of drinks and beers and lots of appetizers. The lunch menu is by far the best."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times but this will probably be our last.  Went the day after Christmas so the wait for a table wasn't the issue.  The lack of staff made it a miserable dining experience.  The server was overwhelmed with too many tables so we had a few different servers bring out appetizers and food with drinks out to us.  This created a mess at the table as no one was clearing out plates or collecting our empty glasses and there was no server to refill our drinks.  We had to also wait for our check."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was terrible. I usually try to cut the server lots of slack, especially when serving large groups, but this was ridiculous.  We had a two year old so we just stopped by a coworker's retirement celebration for a short period of time. But when my son got squirmy and we tried to sneak out early, we had to wait 40 to 50 minutes for our check.  The food was slow, it took forever to get things like a spoon for my son's applesauce, and the waitress made lots of errors on the bills and credit card charging (they wound up just making us wait until everyone was ready to go and giving us our check last. So much for slipping out early). Hopefully they are working out their new restaurant kinks and the service will get better."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time.  Great atmosphere and a great selection of craft beers.  They do not offer bread with your meal.  I had the gluten free pizza which was ok and smaller than I receive at other restaurants.  The salmon and quinoa was good and a decent portion.  My wife enjoyed the fish tacos.  Overall the service was good but you had to ask for items that you sometimes expect from other restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat.  Seems to be busy all the time.  Staff was okay.  Food was good.  I'd go back for a casual night out for dinner."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite spot in this city to get Gluten Free pizza! They also take into account cross-contamination for us Celiac's, which means I can go out to eat without stressing or worrying over whether I will have a migraine with the hour. Anybody out there with similar dietary constraints can appreciate the significance of that. Besides the pizza, though, they have a pretty wide variety of GF dishes, and my non-Celiac friends and family always seem to find a dish they love, (my mom always gets one of their pastas). I go here once every few weeks, typically. Love it!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about a year now. We go for our company lunch. Awesome that you could order online and set it for a specific time when you are in a rush. This place gets better everytime. We always get The best beginnings platter for starters. I order the bj's classic pizza or The great white. You can never go wrong with those. I also get a pizookie. If you've never had it, believe me, order one you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went to this Bj's with a friend who lived on that side of town. It was their first time at BJ's so i was excited to share one of my favorite resutaruants with them.

It was late in the evening ( almost 9 ) and it seemed our server had quite a few tables. 

She was very nice but our food service took way too long 25 minutes for an appetizer and then they food came out just 5 minutes later. Luckily we were starving at that point so we scarfed down our app. 

As always dessert was amazing. 

Would definitely go again but would not go that late."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, my dining experience last Thursday was not to good and the time before that too.  The customer service has gone down hill.    The waitress was lousy, the hostess had an attitude and the food was served cold.!    BJ's  wake up, get your act together, this use to be one of my favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"The last time I reviewed BJ's it was for lunch but this time we went for dinner and it was also great.  We went with friends and all of us had a hard time choosing from their extensive menu.  I had the flatbread margarita pizza and really enjoyed it.  My husband had the parmesan chicken which he said was good.  He also had a cup of their clam chowder which he loves.  Our friends had the deep dish ziti and sriracha chicken/bacon mac and cheese and they both enjoyed their dinners.  Our server, Anthony was one of the best waiters we have had in a long time.  Ask for him.  We had a coupon for $10 off our meal so the price was right."}
{"text":"Pretty standard BJs. Usually a wait, extremely loud and crowded. They do have a good selection of beers & cocktails. They have an app now that you can put your name in online that usually works pretty well. And they have a decent selection of meal specials."}
{"text":"I came here tonight to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with him and 13 friends! I made a reservation and we did have to wait past the time I reserved as the large party before us was past their time limit. The hosts were doing the best they could to seat us despite the inconvenience. I spoke with the manager who was very polite and helpful! We were seated and the server, Nicholas was amazing! I honestly felt so awful because I could tell things out of his control kept happening (POS system went down and deleted orders he submitted  which delayed the food) he apologized and remained polite, and positive during the whole time! He went out of his way to comp 50% or all the entrees and even gave us free sampler appetizers! I truly believe he went above and beyond and genuinely kept his composure while being super friendly! I want to thank you so much for handling the situation as well as you did! And thank you to the manager and hosts for being so professional and accommodating. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to head for BJ's over Fuddruckers last week. I ordered my favorite Jalopena Burger medium.  My hubby ordered sliders well done. When they came out everything looked beautiful, like a picture. I took a bite of my tough burger. My husband opened up his burger and it was medium. I do no appreciate overly done meat and my hubby likes his cooked til it's dead! When the waitress came back we made the decision to have our meal done again. When my burger came out, the presentation was not very comforting. It was not built up the way the previous burger had been served. This time my wedge fries came out over done and lukewarm! My hubby noticed that his wedge fries were also overdone this time round. I took a few bites out of my burger and left all my wedge fries which are normally scarfed up first thing. I left a whole burger on my plate. I said WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. I do believe it is the way things are said to the cooks in the kitchen. They tork them off with some comment about the food. What should be done, is just put in another order. After the food is checked, THEN the comment can be made about the first order for this customer. This way the manager, who SHOULD be bringing out the replacement dish can see with their own eyes what is on the plate. I can say the coffee is good."}
{"text":"I love BJs! Alan & Tracey are the best bartenders west of the strip! Friendly, attentive, fun, speedy, just a pleasure all around to come in and see them when I get off work, want a drink, some good food and great service! The wait staff and managers are alsi always so friendly and welcoming! Tonite I had the Black n Blue burger (always good and one of my favorites) my normal Ketal &  Tonic with 2 limes and my favorite, a lemon drop shot....Tracey makes the best!
Thank you BJs for always making my experience through the moon!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with good employees. Although a chain restaurant, their beer selection is nice, their own brews are not bad at all (Jeremiah Red and Abbey are awesome) and their bartenders are really solid (Tyler and Ashley stand out amongst the team).  Plus their happy hour from 4-7pm with half off pizzas (awesome pizzas.....) is a great deal.

NOTE: Does NOT brew on site. Everything is shipped in."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a nice meal and a beer.  I usually order their Chicken Salad and Jeremiah Red beer.  After a couple beers, the restaurant is within stumbling distance of the Chandler 24 Movie theater."}
{"text":"Have went to the one in San Bruno a lot an now over here in Las Vegas during my spring. Better than what I had Saturday with a badly cooked steak. But anyways the dish that I love the most is the Tuscan chicken loume (sorry for any typos) it's is a citrus lemony light delight. I love the balance of flavor although I'd recommend that you don't feed it to some kids as there taste buds are still developing which might make them not like but yet it's a good why for them to try something new. I'd give these Resturant's a 5 star rating because of their great attention to detail and nice customer service. Definitely coming back as usual."}
{"text":"BOY this place is always packed! They have the booths, tables, and bar area to hold a lot of people, but there is usually a line to be seated. So keep that in mind when you decide to stop by BJ's for a meal. There are enough TVs to keep you occupied. I love the dark interior but there is still a very open feel with all the windows. Now, customer service is where the place could use some improvement. The waiters seem to be so busy and overwhelmed that they barely can catch their breath when they stop by your table. Food does tend to take about 10 minutes to come out but again with the amount of people ordering, I bet getting the food out rapidly is a bit of a challenge. The menu has something for everyone. Even the newly transitioned vegan that I have become can find a handful of items to munch on. Prices are comparable and right on for the atmosphere. I feel BJ's is a step from say Chili's, Applebee's, etc. I could see BJ's being a good place for a first date, a family gathering, sports date, or a work gathering."}
{"text":"It's Wednesday afternoon at 1:20 and there's no empty seat in the entire restaurant. 

The service at this place is simply amazing. Whoever trains this staff needs an award. 

The food was decent. Calamari was overcooked. Spinach salad was slightly over dressed and a little too sweet. (Small portion too.) The tea was good, not standout. 

But really my takeaway from here was the service. They even gave me an iced tea to go, without my asking."}
{"text":"I was seated at 809pm and not one server came up to my table for almost an hour. After complaining twice. A waitress finally took initiative and decided to serve us. We waited about 20 minutes just to receive an appetizer which the manager said was on them due to the wait but then waited another 30 minutes for our food to actually arrive. The waitress never cleared our tale of the old plates and drinks and never gave refills until we asked. I have never received such terrible customer service. And my pasta was cold"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them negative stars. We went and sat there for 15 minutes with out any coming up to us. Not a I will be right there not what can I get you to drink. Even on a Saturday night that is ridiculous, I feel that we were over looked because we were a 2 top.  Then when I went to leave and complained I was asked by the manager to stay and he would make sure I got my food fast.  Really that's all you  got.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Dropped in for early dinner. We had the Asian chicken  and a santafe salad. Both were very good. Each a full meal. Service was good. Wasn't too noisy. Enjoyed the experience. Really appreciated the waitress offering us each an ice tea to go. Even joined their rewards club while there."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night for their baby back rib special. It was absolutely delicious! The mashed potatoes were amazingly good as well. We had excellent service. Even the people that delivered our food we're very friendly. I told the server my son and I were going to share the dinner and he actually brought out split plates. This was awesome because I didn't have to do it myself!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid places like this because they usually serve greasy, crappy, frozen dookie on a plate. I was pleasantly surprised by their menu and beer selections. They have good food at great prices.

If you want bar food done right with a good beer, stop here."}
{"text":"I will usually go here on my lunch break and they staff never fail to get me out in perfect timing. I usually just sit at the bar and I have to say the lady bartender is without a doubt the best server/bartender that you could ask for. She is friendly, cheerful and just has the perfect personality. I have never had an issue with the food nor the service at this locations, so I recommend BJ's to most of my friends."}
{"text":"I loved the food here , and the beers are amazing! Esp there IPA. I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews on the service, I can't really say anything because I always sit at the bar, but the bartender is always good and takes good care of us."}
{"text":"Service, food, menu selection, kid-friendly, everything was excellent. We had a short wait to get in but we felt it was fair for a Friday night with a party of six. We only waited about 20 minutes. We ordered the Brussels Sprouts appetizer and it was delicious and then got a visit from the manager apologizing that our food was taking awhile due to two large parties ahead of ours. We didn't feel like we had to wait that long but it was nice the manager cared enough to come and check on us to make sure we were happy. It was a great dining experience and we will most definitely return."}
{"text":"I find the staff needing more help in delivering service. 
On my last two visits we ordered appetizers that never arrived. Both times I had been given the same lame excuss that the order had fallen on the floor and was being recooked. I found this to be rehearsed and not very beliveable. 
The food arrived a bit cold and feel the staff may have been the same."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I was a little disappointed that BJ'a Brewhouse no longer has my favorite Imperial Stout beer. I love in Utah, one of the most alcohol repressed states in the country (although getting way better) and I told everyone how good it was who asked me where to go in Las Vegas. They have a new Tatonka Stout. It's good but not as good. 
Our server Woody was excellent. Great personality and he really interacted well with us and the customers he waited on. 
Today's feast started with the BJ's HopStorm IPA and an appetizer of BJ's Brewhouse blond beer battered asparagus.  The IPA was good with a light hoppy flavor.  The asparagus stalks were too wide and over cooked. I won't order that again. The country fried chicken was very good and the mashed potatoes was the best I have had. I don't know what they did to the potatoes but it worked well with the chicken. Although I was a bit bummed out that they nixed my favorite beer I look forward to coming back for another meal."}
{"text":"Bad service + bad food = me not coming back 

Service- first, we asked for lemon for our waters and the waitress came back twice before bringing it. Second, my husband asked for the wedge fries with his meal and was given the string fries. Third,  she asked if he wanted mustard and he said yes. Didn't actually get it until the burger was already on the table. Finally, she said she'd be bringing us water twice and I'm still waiting. 

Food- my chicken tortilla soup had good flavor, but too bad it was only luke warm. My salad had hardly any dressing and the romaine had a few brown spots. My husband's burger and fries were both cold. Not to mention his bacon wasn't cooked. I like my bacon medium, medium rare and I wouldn't have eaten it either. He also asked for a medium burger and it came out well done. 

Not a great experience overall."}
{"text":"BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA IS AMAZING!!!!!
Pazookie is always yummmmy too!"}
{"text":"We use to love coming here, but it's been awhile since we have returned. My husband and I were very excited to come back and brought friends who have not been here before. Our Waiter started off great and let us know that all refills of the root beer would be on the house, that way we could try out all the flavors, which by the way, all of the flavors are amazing! However, after that, our waiter seemed to go down hill. Our mozzarella sticks were brought out cold, and our extra side dips were never brought out. He seemed to not give us much attention and was more focused on getting in a few smoke breaks before he brought out our appetizers, pizza, and dessert. We were not pleased with the service and were disappointed that our friends first experience was not better. 

However, the food itself was great and we all loved the pizzas and of course, the pizzookies."}
{"text":"went here the saturday evening with a group of 11. (2 kids and 1 baby.) had to wait half an hour for a table but that was expected. we had a really nice server but i forgot his name. he was from hawaii and made conversation with us. was funny and joked around. the place was busy but he kept checking on us. got all of our food and drink orders right. i had a bite of the calamari and it was pretty good. shared the medium deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza. had a few pieces to take home with the boyfriend. had a slice of BJ's favorite pizza and i loved that. (sadly my boyfriend doesn't dig veggies like i do so i had to sample from his grandparents plate.) so much green peppers and olives. all the colors on it made me love it even more. i say if you don't want to wait for a table go on a week night when i would assume them to be less busy, but their deep dish pizza is really worth trying out with a glass of red wine."}
{"text":"My five-star rating is just for the deep dish pizza and its croissant-like crust.  It is delectable!  As a former Chicagoan, I claim some expertise in deep dish pizza (eating, not making), and I've got to say that B.J.'s makes the best.  I've never had any crust like that.  Ever.  

I haven't had much else at B.J.'s  The multicolored chips and salsa was very good.  Didn't care much for the thin crust pizza appetizer.  

The Pazooki (huge hot cookie served in a pie plate with ice cream on top) is yummy, but the last one I had, it was uncooked in the center.  However, you get a free one if you tell them it's your birthday!

THE best BJ's is in Laguna Beach.  Order one in the restaurant, and go sit on the boardwalk at Main Beach.  Just something about that sand blowing on there!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in our visit today. We were seated promptly and no wait, which is nice on a Sunday during lunch. During this visit, service was slow, had to remind server to bring our drinks. No refills were given on water or root beer....we were pretty much ignored by our server after our order was put in. Pizza had little to no sauce on it and crust was undercooked. We probably won't be back soon. I was pretty bummed because usually BJ's is reliably good."}
{"text":"Customer service is always excellent here. My husband and I LOVED our meals so much we ordered more food to go to eat for dinner. I also got a couple drinks and they didnt skimp on the alcohol."}
{"text":"I love love love this place so much. the servers are always very understanding & nice. from the 100 something times I've been here, they've only gotten my order messed up 2 or 3 times. they always make the food amazing and the pizookies are so good!! I highly recommend everyone come here :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant...and I cant wait to go back. The food and beers were so good. The menu delivers a wide range. I am certainly happy northeast ohio now has a BJ's."}
{"text":"I understand it is hard to be accurate when trying to estimate when you can be seated,  but when I call 20 mins ahead,  get there,  and get told it is about a 40 minute wait still,  and 1.5 hours we are still waiting,  that is just wrong.  Do not lie to me,  let me decide if I want to wait, I would not have waited that long this time,  but would have tried another time,  now I can promise you I will not be back,  in spite of the food and beer being good. I know it is busy Saturday nights,  but when you tell me I can call ahead 30 mins, and tell me a reasonable wait time, just to trick me into waiting, I cannot respect that.  As mentioned,  the food and beer are good,  but relative to the wait to get to a table,  not THAT good."}
{"text":"If you like crappy service than BJs is for you! We waited to be seated, then when we finally were seated no one came to our table. We waited 15 more minutes before just walking out. No one came by to greet us, no menus dropped off for us, nothing."}
{"text":"First time there and thought it was a decent sports bar type place. I had the Jalapeño Burger. The burger was juicy and above average tasting. I like the toppings and overall flavor, but the bun failed. It was too big and didn't hold up to the burger. Half way through the bottom pretty much disappeared and I was left with the crunchy top part. The skinny fries were very good. The light Thai salad was decent but way over dressed. Good and friendly server who quickly replaced our first order of fries after they came to us cold. He even brought an extra order with our meal. Overall, decent food, good service, but it felt like a soulless corporate place. I would go back but would rather try someplace with more soul and a more unique feel."}
{"text":"We come to BJ's once a month or so and sometimes more when they have their 2 for $19.95 deal - you really can't beat it.  You get 1 medium pizza of your choice, 2 soups or salads and a full size pizookie.  You can also upgrade to a large pizza for I believe $2.00 more and it's definitely worth the leftovers.

The only reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service can be \"iffy\".  There are some really great servers there that can multi-task and few others that could really use some extra training OR just not be put on the dinner rush."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to visit Bj's instead of Cheese Cake factory. The server was amazing and on point. They've installed a new system that does not allow servers to create meals. In the past I've ordered a Patty melt with no problem. Today due to the new system it was not an option. I've ordered regular nachos as well...again not so able. My sister complained to the manager who was able to by pass the new computer system. While waiting for the food, runners came to the table with the wrong food. The runner apologized stating he read the ticket wrong. The waitresses seemed frustrated because the system is sub par. The food came with sides that were not requested. My wife ordered Chicken Parm with broccoli but instead got mash potatoes. The main meal came prior to the appetizer. The food tasted fair! Aside from the system and few hic-ups...not bad"}
{"text":"Lunch at bjs!

Like eating here, the food is good/ok, I think I enjoy the waiters personalities above everything else here. The Centennial Center is descent enough and just as good as the rest I believe. They are new and i've given them enough time to break there heels in! Overall good pizzas and beer! I still like the tomato bisque soup and it's Cheese Ham sandwich neighbor!! 
Well, it's just like a Yard house I would say~"}
{"text":"We don't eat at many national chain restaurants.  But when we do, we prefer BJ's."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a BJ's in a while so much has changed...for the better.  The menu is very large now and offers some really nice lunch options.  The lunch portions are very large and well priced.  I was pleasantly surprised as I have never been a real BJ's fan in the past but I would definitely come back.  The restaurant was cuter than I remember.  I had the the shrimp scampi and tomato and mozzarella salad lunch combo.  Both were very good.  The tropical ice tea is delicious as well.  Our server could have been friendlier and more attentive but it wasn't a problem.  Can't wait to come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Hefeweizen! Whenever I'm in the mood for a fresh. enjoyable brew, this is my GO TO. Great Bar area as well!

Perfect place for Happy hour! I'd recommend the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls as well!

And of course their Pizookie is on fire always!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are huge fans of the happy hour. Our son is still under two and can act his age. Whenever he does, the staff is always understanding. The beer is great and the dessert menu is on point!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick meal before a movie.....Ordered the Deep Dish Ziti, which was really tasty!....As a new member of their loyalty program, I received a Pizookie
Man, talk about delicious, warm chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream (more than enough to share) and Delicious!

Service was Great! (Canaan was top notch)

***Note: Salad doesn't come with Pasta ***"}
{"text":"Went to bjs for veterans day had a free lunch.  Always have a good time here.  Julia was the bartender.  Very nice and attentive.  What a sweetheart.  Military discounts year round.  Good happy hour and great beer selections.  Great pizza and burgers."}
{"text":"Friday nights are really packed.  food is great!! a must get is the Pizzookie (sp?)  my fave is the white chocolate macadamia nut.  Another favorite of mine is the balsamic chicken entree off the 500 calorie menu. I can't remember exactly what it was called but it's bomb! 
The happy hour menu is ok.  Beer is good! Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice chain restaurant tucked away in McCandless Crossing. American fare with very little imagination.  If you're a beer drinker then BJ's was built with you in mind.  Little impressed me about their food selection, but they have an enormous beer/cider selection.  Not being much of a drinker, the best I could muster was three stars. The waitstaff wasn't great, the food was unimaginative, but what I ate tasted pretty good.  They did mediocre exceptionally well.

Good for groups, kids, but the parking is awful.  They share a lot with a grocery store and another restaurant. Expect to walk a pretty good distance from your car to the door, and if it's calling for rain - bring an umbrella.  It's a hike."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Vegas!  I get the pizza every time and am never disappointed.  Gluten free items too which aren't always easy to find.  Beer is awesome too.  Can't wait to go back....maybe tonight!"}
{"text":"We got the two person pizza deal for $20.  The pizza had a really good fluffy crust and the watermelon salad and the tortilla soup was really good.  We then finished it off with a white macadamia nut and oatmeal raisin pizookie which was also really good.  The server was friendly but we had to keep getting his attention to refill our water and had our appetizers but had no silverware to eat it with. There new beer nitwit was good and my wife had a white peach margarita which she really seemed to enjoy.  She ordered her second one and after about two sips we received the bill and only saw are waiter when he noticed the credit card."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and while getting unpacked and settled, I grabbed take out from here about twice/week. I tried similiar type restaurants in the area (i..e, Claim Jumper) but have found the quality of food and friendliness of staff much stronger here than other places. 

There have a been a few issues - one time, despite waiting to pick up for until the 15-20 minute ready time, my order hadn't been put in yet. Another time, a salad with the dinner didn't make it into my bag (and I didn't realize this until I got home). Both times, however, the staff was super responsive. With the delayed order, the manager comped the meal without a complaint from me. Likewise with the missing salad - I called and asked them to just make a note for the next time I was going to be in (b/c with boxes still unpacked, it was inevitable I'd be in again) but they comped the entire entree. When I went in the other day, they also gave me a complimentary gift card for future orders. I've not eaten in the restaurant, so I can't attest to the service of the waitstaff (as mentioned by several people in previous posts), but the take-out order staff is super friendly, accomodating, and easy to deal with. 

The food is pretty good. It's not fancy, gourmet style. It's quality comfort-type food that's much better than bigger chains (i..e, Applebee's, Chili's).  They have the best mashed potatoes in the area. Their salmon is excellent, and the parmasan chicken was really good too. I don't like their fish and chips, but I've not found a local/Summerlin restaurant that does fish and chips well. (But am still looking!) 

I'd definitely recommend this place and think it has 5-star potential (but need to eat in to find out)."}
{"text":"We've been anxiously awaiting another dining option after Smokey Bones closed so we tried BJ's for lunch only a few days after opening. First impressions were bland. The restaurant was loud and somewhat overcompensating on staff. (I don't need a refill on my drink when it is 3/4 full). We had pretty much counted this one out after our food took forever, however once it did we changed our mind.  We ordered a burger for me (no bun, declined the gf free bun) and he got the pulled pork. I will say that was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. It was a bit greasy, but I was not ordering a burger to be healthy anyway. My husband really enjoyed the pulled pork and we both loved the fries. The prices were reasonable and we left happy. I will probably wait awhile until the staff is better trained, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is not my first time coming to this location. Each and every time I visited Woody always takes care of us. He is a great server and is so funny. He gives us lots of options we never would of considered. 
Today I had lunch with my friend after we went hiking up at Red Rock. We got two huge salads that I can't remember the names of & we couldn't even finish  them But were completely delicious. 
While eating lunch I remembered I was looking for a location to have my birthday dinner. For a large group. I asked woody if I was able to bring a cake in from a local bakery (Freed's) because that was a deal breaker considering we already ordered it. He went out of his way to get the manager and even bringing me the brochures. Great guy. 
By the way they said yes we could bring the cake from Freed's or Freed's could deliver it (awesome) and we will be booking our party with them ... to be continued"}
{"text":"We come here from time to time.  Went in on Friday night to eat with the family and Christopher was our server. He was great!  Came back last night and sat at the bar, Collin is usually working. He is great too!

I just wish their gluten free selections were more abundant."}
{"text":"Odd service from an odd man. Not sure if he was overwhelmed or what but def odd. Even to the other guests around us. Everyone having to flag him down.

This location has taken a habit to hiring old adults like Denny's would.  An odd direction to go in. Food was fine, flatbread, pulled pork, s'mores pizookie.  

Beers cold and good. Service just odd. 

We prob won't seek out this location like we do with the north Tatum location."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the Valley. Ya ya ya.....so what it's a chain. The proof and bake their doughs perfectly. The deep dish pizza is sweet and hot and is perfect for my pepperoni, jalapeño and pineapple tastes.

Their brewed beers are fun and they recently started bringing in more unique styles.  No pizzookie this time but once I had the smores flavor I'll never go back. Until the promotion is over lol. 

Where else can you find a fun little restaurant style sports bar open till midnight. It's great for industry peeps.

Last but not least, Stewart is the best. He's the strong accented bartender that is pretty much a dream. He's been here for years which is amazing. He's polite, quick, witty and has a great memory. I will continue to try to steal him for my business!"}
{"text":"Something for Everyone

I've been to a handful of BJ's Restaurants and have never been disappointed with my dining experience. However, the BJ's Restraunt and Brewery in Peoria is my favorite.  BJ's has high ceilings, long bars, mix of tables and booths, and large flat screne TV's within viewing distance of all. I can honestly say, I truly enjoy the ambiance at BJ's.

The menu at BJ's is varried, offering a large selection of beers, cocktails, and entrée's, there is something for everyone at BJ's. If you can't find something at BJ's to eat,  then you don't like to eat. 

The burgers at BJ's are delicious and one of my favorite entrée's, but if burgers are not your thing, BJ's offers plenty of other options.  The Thyme-Lemon Chicken and Steaks are amazing and grilled to perfection, with a  a bit of char, tender, and so flavorful.

Service is reliable and well-timed. The staff is very accomdating without being intrusive.  Table or bar seating are all good and their to-go service works well, too.  If your looking for a nice dining expeirence give BJ's Restraunt and Brewery a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service by restaurant management
We had a unique problem that was readily taken care of by the restaurant manager; the staff was so accommodating
Many choices of beers; full bar; the IPA was okay; I liked the blonde and I'm no gentleman
Food was excellent
I loved the jambalaya
Fish & chips were excellent
Great service by Frankie
Loved the triple chocolate pizzooke (?)"}
{"text":"I am starting to really like this place. Today the service was great and he kept our drinks never empty. He was great on suggestions and the food was good to.. So now you might ask why I didn't give it a 5.. I didn't give it a 5 star because the food was VERY SLOW in coming out.. The salads were slow at about 12 minutes to come out after order and the lunch. Was 55 minutes for a pizza and flatbread. I think that is a bit much but other then that it was a great experience"}
{"text":"Delicious food ! Yummy food ! The one star is for the customer service I received. When I arrived I had young lady by the name of gracelyn or Gracie not too sure what it was but this young lady sat me and my husband . And her attitude was horrendous. I understand everyone has a bad day but this was unacceptable . I also understand I might have asked too many questions in one sitting but the attitude was unnecessary.  I called in to speak with the manager and I was disconnected . I reached out around 6ish . I tried to reframe from making this review on a social platform but I was forced to. I requested the name of this host from server whom actually was very polite about the situation and apologized on their behalf . This was my first time there and possibly my last . But again the food was delicious !"}
{"text":"I seated myself at one of the high bar tables, waited for my order to be taken for 20 minutes....no one ever came. I got up to ask the hostess if I had to place my order somewhere else, she stated that someone would be with me shortly. Another 3 minutes, still no one came. I went to the bar and asked if he would take my order or would I have to wait for a miracle from the heavens. Chicken was room temperature but the bartender was great. Not so sure if I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with the online ordering for takeout and the service for this location. I was emailed a receipt as confirmation of my order and when we arrived to pick it up an hour later, which is time they gave us, we were told our order was not made because they didn't have the ribs we ordered. I had left my number as well as my email which is how i got the receipt and no one bothered to call us to notify us at all. The whole point of leaving our number was in case they needed to call us for something and they never did. When my husband went to pick up our order the workers didn't know anything about it and then notified us it was never made bc they didn't have one item. The workers were not helpful at all. My family and I will not be going to this restaurant anymore and definitely will never use their online ordering again!"}
{"text":"I love the soup, wine, pizzas, appetizers! The prices aren't too bad. Love the wine and beer. Happy hour prices are good so is the dessert!"}
{"text":"Menu selection was outstanding...presentation excellent....taste good but add your own salt....which is a good thing....price is great...but best of all was our server, JUDY.....she has worked there for many years, she told us...but does not get as many hours as she needs or would like...loves her job and the people she works with....I know we over tipped by usual standards but she was worth it...if managements really reads these...please give her more hours!  Love Tuesday nights as it is 1/2 price wine night but she usually doesn't work on that night so at least add that night to her schedule."}
{"text":"Personally, i work in a restaurant so i ultimately have high expectations. but even somebody who doesn't work in a restaurant would have seen the awful service being put forth. We came in for my sisters birthday and we had a server start us off by getting us drinks. my friend got a pepsi and it was out of syrup so he got her another one without even replacing the syrup so it tasted the exact same. nobody in the restaurant could figure out how to fix it so we all got different drinks. So then we had another server take care of us which was strange. There wasn't a large variety of food on the menu. So when the food comes out it's basically a child sized proportion. Anywayssss, the server brings out the cake when our party had gone outside, she sets it down and leaves and doesn't even bring out forks or plates with it. then we went and grabbed her to order pazookies because she was seriously never around. she brings out the pazookies and doesn't even bring out the birthday girls dessert. By the time she got her cookie we had all finished ours. The only decent person was the hostess and the manager, i feel bad for both of them :( only coming back for pazookies."}
{"text":"Pizzas are OK and the salmon dish is a nice healthier choice.  I like to take friends here and get the pizza cookie because a portion of the proceeds benefit the charity for cystic fibrosis (CF) research."}
{"text":"Service was
Literally the slowest ever.  Saturday 3:15 we were seated didn't see a server for 10 min.   He finally took our drink order.  Kids got their sodas.. within a few min.  We waited another 10 for our drinks.   Hubby got the beer sampler and the shishito and pepperoni app.  (That was delicious.  ) although we had no napkins or silverware. Server gets his tablet to work ....... finally.  Clearly a pen and paper won't work.  Gets orders taken.....finally it comes out my chicken sandwich is the exact opposite of what I asked for.... instead of all the toppings I got none.  Server finally reappears we ask for check and boxes.  
He half apologized for the slow service (we had to box our meals up so our son could get to work)  t

Wanted to express my experience with bjs and conveniently their contact me page redirects you to a page with their desserts.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Usually a wait on weekends, as was the case this evening . . . Haven't always elected to wait, but tonight we wanted to stay for football and good food.  The experience was positive, beginning with friendly staff from the host team to our server. Santa Fe Spring Rolls were a tasty appetizer (albeit a tad small). The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was excellent; the small pie is more than enough for one (you can even share a few bites and not leave hungry). My wife ordered the very flavorful toasted chicken pesto sandwich. The Premier Rewards program is a nice plus; simply ask your server for an application before you pay your bill."}
{"text":"Great staff who provide excellent service. Has a great group of friendly regular guests. Bathrooms could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"Beer seemed a little flat and watery.  Appetizer combo was not bad.  

Not a bad place but he wait time is outrageous.  Sit at the bar if possible.

Can back on a Sunday night and the service was bad.  Sat in the bar area and it took forever to get someone to clear the table.  Waitress was nice and tried her best but the food took a loooooong time, yet the place was only 3/4 full.  

Waitress just apologized for the poor food service.  Kudos to her.  Management, sucks.  Plain and simple.  The two times here, I feel the managers are clueless as to what is happening.  Sorry BJ's but you need to look at your operations here in Fairlawn.

Gave you two shots and that is it!  Nice try."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Our server Anthony was terrific. His recommendations were spot on and he was friendly, funny, knowledgeable and attentive. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Well this place is hit or miss, we usually go here once or twice a month and it's rarely consistent. I always go with the Ahi Tuna salad which was a mistake this trip. The salad tasted and appeared to be a few days past it's prime. My kids enjoyed the chicken tenders, however; my wife's food was cold so, another and final strike for us. Unfortunately we won't be returning for a while after this trip. The staff is always very friendly but overwhelmed with tables."}
{"text":"Blackened salmon was fine, there was nothing extraordinary about it. The quinoa salmon bowls we incredible, my mom and I just kept raving over them. We were trying to figure out what the spices were but I waitress was a little overworked and said she would find out for us but then she forgot. My daughter liked her fish and chips, there were plenty of fish pieces, at least four big pieces. And my son ate both of his mini cheeseburgers and cute little skinny fries."}
{"text":"The chicken Alfredo was great! Our server, I believe his name was Nathan, was amazing!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what was going on but we had horrible service. They took my name at the front after being ignored for a bit, and no it wasn't busy at all. They finally called my name within a short period (only good thing that night, but wait there's more!) and walked our party of 3 to our table, though it seemed like they didn't know where to even seat us in a half empty restaurant, mind you. Well we sat down at a table finally and waited for 30 minutes. No one offered us a drink or greeted us or anything. Maybe we forgot to take our invisible cloaks off or something. I guess they didn't want our business. Because even after complaining (respectfully), they didn't seem like they cared at all. So here I am now across the street at Yard House with amazing service and food, writing this review."}
{"text":"\"Chicago style\" pizza was not Chicago style, but other than that - the servers were nice, decor was smart, and the food was good.  Tasty brews as well!  They have a spinach and artichoke pizza I highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Today I enjoyed great food and great customer service my waiter was awesome she very patient, and very attentive she's on point she takes her time to go over the menu never had to call her for refills thanks Shawnda for your service will definitely return"}
{"text":"Great food as usual. Either greasy bar food or healthy options this place has it all. My favorite is the Crispy Jalapeño Burger."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Mentor restaurant options, but very busy! Call ahead - Menu is great and extensive - OK to visit on a diet too.. Many no carb options, etc...  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Finally tried BJ's. It is one of those menus like The Cheesecake Factory. Not as bad though, but slightly long and overwhelming. 

Best part was that I was finally let in on the secret of the Pizookie! YUM!!! I went with the traditional chocolate chip and was not in the least bit disappointed! I could eat those all day....

This location: busy, but service was good especially for how busy they were. 

Food I tried:
Avocado Egg Rolls--my favorite! So yummy!
Mac and Cheese--my least favorite. Dry and tasteless.
Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread--I love anything with goat cheese!
Great White Pizza--not bad, not good, did the trick.
Pizookie-SEE ABOVE AMAZINGNESSSSSSS"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always good and the service is great! (If at all possible, ask for Anthony as your server. He's absolutely amazing, extremely nice and his hospitality is second to none.) The beer is great and you have to get a pazooki! Great family place and always a good go to spot!"}
{"text":"Always good times at BJ's! Brought a friend here that was visiting from out of town because for the people who live in Vegas we don't always want to deal with \"the strip\" just to get some good food! Although we missed the lunch specials that end at 3PM we were still pleased with this dining experience! When we walked in there was maybe about 10 people in there! Not busy at all! Happy hour was still in session and because they offer some really good $5 Mojitos I had to participate hehe! If you choose to do happy hour you must sit in the bar area and some of my personal favorites off the happy hour menu are the avocado rolls and the buffalo wings! We were a bit hungry so we still ordered off the regular menu as well! Calamari was a Very good! The Cherry Glazed salmon was a HIT! I recommend trying that if you are in the mood for fish and or watching calories because it's only 550 calories! Friend ordered the Brewhouse double burger with bacon and loved it! BJ's is known for their pazookie's and I personally like the red velvet one! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I placed an order To go through postmates  when my order arrived, it was completely wrong. When I called the restaurant to see why, she told me I need to go through the app and request help, which I already did so. The manager on duty also told me that I did not order the veggie and I order the beef burgers. She also lied to me on how postmates works as I myself have driven for postmates in the past. If your restaurant makes a mistake own up to it and give good customer service. I understand mistakes happen but to lie and say I didn't order something goes beyond a bad review. I eat at BJs a lot but this will be my last time ever."}
{"text":"My first time here and it didn't disappoint! The food was delicious. My husband and I got burgers and wings, and the wings were fantastic! They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Make sure to order them tossed or they will only drizzle the sauce on top (wouldn't be enough sauce). The burgers were perfectly cooked and were huge! Had to take half home.

Next time, we're going to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Came here after 230p and was seated by the best server ever Davena and she went above and beyond our expectations. It's because of her that I will be back. She only works during the day so come here for lunch on Thursdays for their Baby Back Rib Thursdays. It's totally worth it.  And their clam chowder is one of the most tastiest I've ever had."}
{"text":"First, it's a really nice bar.  The bartenders and staff are just great!  If you love beer, get the sampler and try them out, but the red ale is the best in my opinion!.

Having very fond memories of the amazing tuna poke at Lulu's in Lahaina on Maui, BJ's was in for some steep competition.  They succeeded in a wonderful take on the dish.  The avocado egg rolls made my belly happy as well, and were NOT at all greasy.

Very very good.

Lots of TVs to watch various sporting events.  Lots of fun!"}
{"text":"*Updating my rating from 3 to 4.

Stopped here for brunch because the nearby independent breakfast restaurants each had a long-ish wait for a table. 
BJs was not bad, but not great. 
Our server was friendly and provided good service. Coffee was tasty, nice flavor. My \"enlightened omelet\" was delicious although I substituted whole eggs for the egg white. 
My \"fresh fruit\" looked old - some of the strawberries were brown/discolored, one of the grapes was moldy.
Overall, I'd give my experience a 3.75 rating. It was fine."}
{"text":"I usually really like BJs..it's not my favorite but they do have a few really good items on the menu. One of my favorite things is the tomato bisque. It's to die for! This time, I decided to pick up a pizza from there with my friends. We ordered a pep deep dish pizza online and picked up curbside. Once we got home and started eating, there were different veggies throughout and a piece of pineapple?!? They were sloppy making it. Next time I will just go to Pizza Hut for half the price."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 8. Didn't take very long to get seated. However the food was just below average. 
Vegetables were not washes correctly and tasted like dirt. Waitress was sub par. Did not check in on the table regularly and took a long time to get our checks. The best part of the whole meal was dessert. I would not recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"HUGE immense large menu (did I mention they have a lot of choices?) Don't bring your indecisive friends here or they will never order.  Americana food at it's finest, usually a line on the weekends, more expensive than you would like but better quality than you expect."}
{"text":"Our third time here in the last year was disappointing. Confused staff at the door were slow to take names, get people to their tables. Finally an unapologetic staff member said we and others were free to sit in the bar area and could enjoy half off appetizers and drinks there. Once seated, waitress there said that no, those specials don't don't count on weekends. Later resolved - deals during NFL games- but staff were clearly confused. Mixed drinks were loaded, overflowing with ice- remember that from the last visit- so any \"deal\" was meaningless. Tortilla soup heavy on gelatinous, salty broth. Burger in oversized bun, root beer riblets unremarkable. This place is crowded but felt very \"chainy\" tonight ( not always the case w chain restaurants). Across the street is Rays Place- in retrospect the local place we should have gone to."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed that the quality of he dishes and service has deteriorated while i was away. 
My favorite - Balsamic chicken with white cheddar cheese mashed potatoes use to be incredible all of the time. I'd always get this dish whenever I'd visit.... I've been gone for a while and upon return have been let down. My husband got a dish he hasn't had before and said it was okay, and the avocado egg rolls for appetizers are no where near the cheese cake factories avocado egg rolls (which are amazing).
The food was served luke warm as if it had been been sitting for a while before getting served and quickly went cold. The server was only extremely \"on\" and attentive, or \"off\" no-where to be found. 
The prices sure stayed the same - around $70 for 2 people but the quality of food isn't what it used to be sadly.
The only thing that was on point was the strawberry Mojito."}
{"text":"Very good food and service,  Great variety and unique flavors.  Forty minute wait, but they served food to waiting guests.  Now that's class!"}
{"text":"I always loved this place when I lived elsewhere and it is even better in this new spot. The bar area is much larger than most BJ's that I have been to and the beer selection is great. We got very good food as well."}
{"text":"Not Celiac friendly.  

I called ahead to verify their gluten-handling knowledge and once there let the server know I had actual Celiac Disease not just a dietary preference. Both times we were assured that all precautions were/would be taken against cross contaminaton but the fact that I'm sitting here in pain and ill... well, it tells a different story.  I believe the cross contamination comes from them using a serving ladle that's used for filling the bread bowls; ladle comes into contact with the bread bowl and then goes back into the pot of \"gluten free\" soup. I also wouldn't be surprised if there's a level of cross contamination coming from the rags/towels used to clean the plate from drips or to wipe off hands (even if they use gloves, I've seen chefs wipe gloved hands).  The food itself (Broccoli Cheddar Soup) was tasty... even the gluten free Pazooki! However, I can't in good conscious give a higher rating. When dealing with food prep for someone with Celiac Disease you absolutely CANNOT use a knife (or other utensil) that has simply been wiped off, or a cutting board that has been in contact with gluten (unless you really scrub at it by hand), or wood-anything."}
{"text":"Ive been to BJ's dozens of times and typically have always had a good experience until yesterday. The service has always been good and there is definitely no issue there.

I went to this location on Sunday with my parents and my mom and I both ordered the sirloin steak - medium. Ive ordered this plenty of times before and its always been good... not Outback good, but definitely decent. Yesterday's came out like it had been cremated. The char was so thick it couldn't be cut off. My steak was grey with no pink and charred. My moms was the charred on the outside and bleeding in the middle.

I sent mine back and my mom thought she could salvage hers. The waiter was awesome, service was great. Manager came out and apologized and I told him that I wanted it just like the picture, no char. What did I get.... the same amount of char and a pink middle. Took one bite and there was no other taste than the char. Literally, all you could taste was the burnt meat. Sent it back again and the manager came out again.

I was informed that two weeks ago all the steaks had changed and this is the way they are doing them now. Why I am writing this post... just to let others know about the change, since BJ's didn't feel the need to change its images on the menu and didn't mention it to us when we ordered.

So, long story short, ordered the steak, sent it back twice. Decided to not even try and go with the Chicken Pot Stickers. They rocked. By the time I got my food, everyone at the table was of course finished with their meals.

I was a little surprised that after all that, the manager didn't ever offer to comp anything. I don't mind paying for what we ate and its not an issue that we were charged, but I was just a bit surprised it wasn't even offered. I didn't ask, but left disappointed in the whole experience.

Will we go again? Yeah, probably for Happy Hour and stick to the appetizers. But not going to go expecting a good meal."}
{"text":"We haven't really been back as much since Angel (the bartender) left, but wow! James was so incredible! I thought the service couldn't get any better but seriously? We will go back to coming back here on a regular basis! I highly recommend sitting at the bar and order through James. His upbeat attitude and recommendations were ON POINT! Amazing service!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but had a dirty table and dirty silverware and it was terrible service no one even wanted to clean our table kept passing it to another person to do."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with friends at BJ's. They loved the avocado rolls as much as we did (BEST avocado spring rolls ever!) and we all ordered the California chicken sandwich. It did not disappoint! Service was fabulous--those Diet Cokes with vanilla just kept coming. And the Pizookie was a hit as well."}
{"text":"Thursday night about 9pm it was busy. Parking was packed and is tight lot.
The booth was not lit well but spacious.
We ordered fried artichoke hearts as appetizer and it came with a mayo type dipping sauce. Only like $3.95 and a must try before meal.
We got the new Asian Kung pap chicken. It was supposed to have alot of veggies and snow peas but only had a couple and good rice. But it tasted good with alot of chicken.
The the Californificatiin  flatbread, it was good but the mayo sauce drizzle was kinda nasty so I took it off. The tipping were good,
The finally was the desert giant pan baked fresh chocolate chip cookie topped with massive scoop of French vanilla ice cream. Sugar shock WOW and bust out the defibrillator. Sweet heaven has arrived. Try it you'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"great spot to come for a bite with friends with a wide range of beers and drink specials. 
i've tried multiple things on the menu, but usually stick to the chicken mediterranean tacos. tried the new salmon pita tacos which were also awesome! grilled salmon with a creamy aioli, crispy green apples and a slaw with toasted, candied walnuts! pita is soft and the side quinoa/couscous is a refreshing palate cleanser between bites. 

the root beer glazed chicken wings were great. right amount of crispy bite without drying out the inside and the glaze is not overly sweet. my boyfriend loved the crispy chicken salad with the honey mustard style dressing and my bestie loved the wings. 

we come here once in a blue moon, but overall, for the beer selection & consistency with food quality, i would definitely recommend this spot if you want a little contemporary american cuisine variety. 

service can be a hit or miss when dining, but i have noticed that the bar seating area with RACHEL is always a win. having had different servers there, i would definitely say she is the friendliest & best at her job. hard to find servers that actually care nowadays about the service quality, so if you're picky about service, find her! 

definitely worth a shoutout BJ's!"}
{"text":"The staff here is too nice, too good at their job, they should all be fired for being too good and then be hired by Gordon Ramsay. The food quality is...above Applebee's, barely. The drink selection is solid, and the place is attractive and clean. Thanks place. Also , heads up to management, it says on Google that this location is open 24/7. 

I ordered the : Avocado Egg Roll - 9/10
       Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza - 7/10
                            Fried Calamari -  4/10

{"text":"The Food is good. The waiter we had on this particular day wasnt the best they have. We were hungry and the food arrived late. The overall experience isnt something i  would want when i go out to eat."}
{"text":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in the strip at Great Northern Mall is in the location previously occupied by Smokey Bones restaurant.. Our party of three had dinner at 4 pm on a Saturday. A bit early, but our guest couldn't wait to try the prime rib. All in all, it wasn't worth the price.

When we entered, there were four \"hosts/hostesses\" with a moment of confusion determining where to seat us. Our waitress  was ebullient and  cordial. We start with drinks. I ordered a double dirty martini, up; my wife asked for the vanilla cream soda, and our guess asked for one of their specialty drinks. Our drinks arrived after a significant wait although neither the restaurant nor bar were busy. The cream soda was not in a chilled mug as listed on the menu: \"Sorry, we're out of cold mugs.\"

The bartender brought over the alcoholic drinks and asked who received the Absolut martini. I told him I'd ordered a dirty gin martini. He acted as if it were my fault the order was wrong. He said he'd have to \"check the ticket\" to be sure I'd asked for the correct drink. Strike one.

I ordered the Chicken Lettuce Wraps [$10.75] appetizer and my wife asked for the Brewhouser Blonde Asparagus [$4.95]. The chicken for the wraps was watery and drippy, though the flavor was average. The asparagus was greasy and clumped together as if either fried too long or at too low a temperature. She didn't finish it. Strike two.

I ordered the Classic Rib Eye [$22.95] medium, french fries, and creamed corn; our guest asked for the prime rib medium rare; and my wife ordered the Fresh Atlantic Salmon [$18.50].

My steak arrived at the far end of medium: brown inside and nearly juiceless, more like well done. Strike three.

The prime rib's surface was an odd pink and more like medium than medium rare. The salmon was average. I didn't bother to finish the steak, although the fries were well prepared.

On the whole, the food was mundane and much more expensive than similar chain restaurants. For instance, a comparable boneless rib eye from the dinner menu at Longhorn is two dollars cheaper and has always been cooked correctly every time we've dined there.

While a restaurant can't control it's clientele, it's offerings will draw certain customers. BJ's extensive pizza offerings brought in two parties of 10+ while we were there, each with a large number of children under five years old. It felt more like a Chuckie Cheese than a casual adult restaurant.

Later that evening my wife got sick to her stomach from the greasy appetizer.

We won't go back and I can't recommend BJ's unless you're under five and will only eat pizza."}
{"text":"Ill keep this short and sweet.

Good: food, some of the beers. Their Piranha Pale Ale was fantastic.

Bad: some of the beers. Their Irish red (I forget its name) was one of the worst beers Ive ever had."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  The restaurant always keeps busy and has delicious food!  I have never been disappointed with the food, service, or drinks.  Ask for Dan!  He is fun, friendly, and always good for a smile!  Your whole family will love it.  Don't forget to try the pizookie.  My son's favorite is Oreo."}
{"text":"Fun place server was great. Had deep dish pizza and burger. S'mores dessert was the bomb. Pleasantly surprised for chain restaurant"}
{"text":"Having been open now for a few months, I have been here 3 times. Being one of the only \"trendy\" resturant in the area it can be quite busy all the time. I'm sure this is great for their business. For me there food is not worth waiting the 30-60 minute for two people. We ordered the all meat pizza and it was ok.. the crust was not cooked thoroughly. The beer is good. My biggest complaint for this resturant is the dessert menu. A pazzokie? really A) I really hate that name. B) it's nothing but a soft cookie with ice cream on it... not even original I can buy the same thing at albertsons, where I throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds slap icecream on it and shazam half the price and same taste. I wan't more choices, cheescake, a sunday, cake, etc. Until they open an outback or something better nearby I will continue to eat hear on occasion.

   I checked not good for kids, but it's not bad for kids either. It's a brewhouse so a bunch of adults getting lit is not a great atmospher for kids and they may get bored easily. Red Robin and McDonalds are good for kids. My opinion.

The customer service is lacking on weekdays. The place is filled with servers, chatting it up while we wait for drink refills, to get any kind of service.. we had to ask for water and for menus after waiting 15 minutes."}

Now, about the food, we have work lunches here often, food is good and service is fast. Their lunch menu is decent.
Just a few times we have been there for dinner and it is too loud for my taste."}
{"text":"Bjs is definitely underrated!! I honestly forgot it even exists till recently i've been addicted! definitely fresh delicious food!!! the lunch & dinner options vary my favorite is the santa fe chick salad ahhhhh it is so bomb!!! of course i please myself to a monkey bread pizookie just to make sure i'm extra full & satisfied so i have a difficult time walking to the car lol.. ALSO they have curbside pick up!! or take out orders & the service is always great!"}
{"text":"The service was good, the salmon was good, the salad was good, the veggies need work."}
{"text":"The food was average, and the service was lacking.  I had the salmon and a salad.  The salad was good, the salmon was average, and the asparagus was bitter and burned.  My friend ordered the beet salad only and the server didn't trouble herself to let me friend know that they were out of the beet salad until my entree arrived.  Not cool."}
{"text":"I had almost forgot I tried BJ's when I first moved to the valley some 8 years ago and was not impressed. Although the atmosphere was good the food just did not match. I did not return until yesterday when a coworkers birthday came up and so off to BJ's I go. 

I was really hoping after all this time maybe I misjudged this place. I have to say that the service was excellent. Our waiter, although very busy on a Friday afternoon, was attentive and friendly. The first misstep was when I unwrapped my silverware and one of my forks had dried food stuck to it, gross. Oh well this can happen I guess so I order a chicken sandwich with a wedge salad and side of shoestring frys. The blue cheese dressing on my salad was runny and tasted sour. The sandwich was OK and my frys were cold. 

So overall it was a fail, I guess I will give BJ's another 8 years and try again."}
{"text":"All around excellent experience!  We've had months of frustrating dining at lots of other restaurants- cold food, bad service, but not at this BJ's!  Our server Nick was knowledgeable and friendly.  Food came out quickly and was piping hot.  Excellent pizookie trio- we tried the salted caramel, peanut butter and ghiradelli chocolate.   Amazing.  Kids licked their plates clean and our burgers were outstanding.  Because this is a brewery they make their own root beer and cream soda in house. Best cream soda ever, hands down.  Manager David takes great pride in running a fantastic restaurant.  Well done BJ's- we have a new restaurant to frequent!!"}
{"text":"Came for Friday brunch right as they opened, 
Empty at first & filled up quickly. But not loud or annoying. 
Service was fast! Server was kind, 
They have a nice lunch menu. Good food, great seasoning. Good portions. I ordered a mojito & this place knew what they were doing! Not a lot of places can make a decent one. 
I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Whats the point of call ahead seating- add to waiting list from app arrive at restaurant 15 minutes later told 20 minutes- wait 30 minutes ask status- told 15 more minutes... whats the point. This is ridiculous. If you'd have been upfront about the wait we would have gone elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience for our first time at BJ's. We were helped by Joshua, and a fellow young lady whom he was training(she didn't have a name tag). He was extremely kind, helpful, informative, professional, and even thanked me for my service upon carding me for a cocktail. They were also very particular on assisting us with our service dog via food and water, which was a huge plus as well.. Thank you guy's. Will definitely return.

Edit: p.s. the food was good too"}
{"text":"Second time here, wanted to make sure it was as good as I originally thought, and not just because it was new.

Yupp, I found second time to be just as good.  Came here for lunch with wife, pretty good lunch menu.

2 beers
2 sandwiches 
1 app
$30

not bad! 
-App: Queso  and chips is great, they also refil chips.
- Both of us had the buffalo chicken 5 cheese sandwich, fantastic, plenty of fries
- Pumpkin beer is smooth, and Red ale just as good

ill be here again

To the managers, I recommend putting in a patio for the summer, I truly feel this place will be dead in summer if one is not installed, People like to drink beer outside!"}
{"text":"Way too loud and they have subpar cocktails but the yinzer  crowd won't mind at all.  They have low standards 

There's a lot of food choices but this joint is just average slop. 

My table was soaking wet and not even dried off.  Pathetic"}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Saturday night and it was awful. 

I ordered the tuna salad which was the special and they forgot half the ingredients, when I mentioned it to the waitress she didn't seem to care and laughed ! 

My boyfriend got the lemon thyme chicken which looked so good on the menu but it looked like mush on a plate and the rice wasn't cooked 

Yuck !!"}
{"text":"LOVE THE BLONDE BEER

Had to grab a quick pazookie trio here after dinner.
The place was packed for a thursday night there seemed to be a little wait.
We sat at the bar & we were greeted very quickly by the bartender .... we knew what we wanted & ordered right away. 

I personally can't drink very much & they had a little 5oz. Beer that they sell too! It's so cute and the perfect amount for me. Got the blonde beer & it was delish.

Had to give a 4 star on this review because the pazookie cookie was not hot. Maybe they changed it or something but it used to come out hot to the point where u can't really touch the silver tin part, but the tin wasn't even very warm. That was the only thing a little disappointing since I took a friend to try the restaurant for the first time.
Other than that great service! =]"}
{"text":"SCRUMPTIOUS THICK PIZZAS!

I absolutely love BJ's so after a doctors visit we had were hungry & unanimously chose this spot since it was also on the way home. We ordered take out & decided on 2 LARGE pizzas... when we arrived to pick up we noticed on the board that there was a family style package meal that includes 2 Large pizzas, salad, wings, & 2 sides for around $5 more than what we were already paying for the 2 pizzas we ordered & when we tried to mention it to Brianna when paying out she was just super rude about it & also had no idea about this special. \" o... I guess you can....\" in a rude tone of manner i would have to say as we pointed out what their special entails. We also had to witness her being a bit toney w/ another person that was trying to apply to the place... =/  that's my reason for the 3 star... 

The food was great though even if it was take-out... by the time we got home it was still hot & delicious. But one thing that really SUCKED was that we had asked for extra ranch on the side for the pizza & when we got home, all we see is the one ranch that came w/ the wings =[

MASHED POTATO - very smooth & rich creamy flavor... I love it when such a simple dish is made perfect. 

FRIES - crisp skinny fries Can't complain they're fries.

BUFFALO WINGS - the sauce was on the side & it came w/ a good amount of celery sticks.

2 LARGE BUFFALO CKN PIZZA - although I usually go w/ the GREAT WHITE, the Buffalo chicken pizza here is delicious... not too overwhelming & perfect texture to the crust as ALWAYS & the right amount of protein & veggie ratio for each bite! 

SANTA FE CHICKEN SALAD - refreshing salad w/ some crisp to it w/ the tortilla strips & the Santa Fe dressing was awesome.

Hope to be back to try the dine in experience since I usually go to the one on eastern. Hopefully it will be a bit more friendly when dining there."}
{"text":"Had a large party celebrating two birthdays and made a reservation a few days ahead of time with a manager. Called in again to extend my party number and a different manager said I wasn't even put down for a reservation. I'm glad I called or else my party and I would've shown up with no table. When we arrived, we had to wait 25 min even though it was late night on a weekday (it was not busy). During our meal, we were checked on once which is unfortunate because I drink a lot of water and need refills semi-frequently. None of this bothered me until two of my guests had to leave early so they got their check, left cash on the table, and left. Our waitress Laura threw a little fit about how much they did or did not tip. Even though the rest of us tipped normally, her attitude made us all reflect on whether we wanted to tip well or not. She proceeded to drop our cards down on the table for us to go through since she was annoyed. We wanted to put in an additional desert order to make her some more money and she was annoyed because she had already taken an order for us. She forgot to grab my card I was holding up so she was annoyed that she had to come back for it but I mean I don't have to pay if you don't want me to right? In the end, we had to talk to a manager about what is appropriate behavior and conversation to be having in front of customers."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch mid June, BJ's is always a favorite. I love their version of a caprese salad and the chicken tortilla soup is my favorite. We had the best server (Alicia) on this visit, she was friendly and funny and made our stay very enjoyable."}
{"text":"We went to visit a friend that was a server. The hostess staff is completely incompetent.  They sat many people before us and didn't attempt to accommodate us.. I know this is a corporate restaurant designed to move people through as quickly as possible.  If you want a corporate impersonal experience, I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself.

Our server at the bar was wonderful, and I'm sure the rest of the staff is also.  As a manager, you would think the host staff would be your top priority."}

Our waitress, Laryn, was very knowledgeable and kind. She took excellent care of us ! The food was deeeeelicious and great portion sizes! Everything was sparkly clean and inviting.  We'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"The B in BJ's stands for: Boring, Bad, Boo-boo, Bland and BLAH. I can't decide. 

The service we had is clearly a 3 star. Our waiter was extra friendly to me which I always welcome. But he also forgot to put in our appetizer order. His saving grace was the fact he kept the drinks coming. 

Drinks- Cherry Cola Throwbacks. Hot damn those are De-licious! Packed with booze and large amounts of sugar, but it just tastes like a soda fountain Cherry Cola. What an intoxicating treat. 

Pizza- Margherita Deep Dish add Mushrooms. This pizza wasn't any better than a Red Baron pizza you microwave at home. Nothing about it was memorable or delicious. 

Dessert- Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter Pazookie. It is what it is. Hot cookie with ice cream. Nothing more, nothing less. Enjoyed by all. 

Overall BJ's is not remarkable to me and I will not go out of my way to return. I will gladly pay higher prices for MUCH better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh? 

Also, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh?

All in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the \"Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad\" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious.

No other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it's like eh, whatever, who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance. 

Really love the large selection of everything! Iron out the deets, BJ's Brewhouse!"}
{"text":"The staff is always nice, day and night ....food great never had a bad meal ....love to come here after work and decompress ...."}
{"text":"Sweet Pig Pizza and Chicken Bacon Ranch are two of our favorite items on the menu here. But what I like too is there are occasional specials like during the summer they have an additional BBQ menu. The spinach, arugula and berries salad and the corn fritters are really yummy. 

As far as family restaurants go, I love this place. My 7 year old adores the pizookies and we always get a booth so she can spread out if necessary. Service has always been good when we've come and as far as chain restaurants go, this and Sammy's Wood Fired Pizza is as good as it gets for us in Las Vegas."}

{"text":"My second visit to BJ's Desert Ridge was yesterday. My best friend Alex was in town from Canada and has never been. Two couples and a baby, so they sat us at a half-moon booth which was spacious and comfortable. Our order was taken quickly, although this restaurant has an enormous menu, practically a novel! Everything we ordered was plentiful in portion and prepared correctly. I love fettuccine alfredo and order everywhere I go...this version was slightly bland. My friend's triple decker sandwich had maybe two drops of mustard on it, but all we had to do was add more. Can't recall the server's name (young-middle age woman with half upper sleeve), but she was kind, knowledgeable and prompt. She left the restaurant before we did, but I am also a server and sometimes you just gotta go. We will be back next time we are in need of a casual meal."}

He very efficient with a packed house and extremely courteous.  Besides providing our group of 5 adults and 1 infant with absolute amazing service, he made us feel comfortable and as if we were family. I will definitely be back because of his service. Amazing job Dan,  keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"Well, if you like mediocre food and lackluster service, then you'll love BJ's!

The food is on par with what you would expect from a chain restaurant. Decent but nothing really exciting. 

Service was pretty slow. Our friend ordered a piña colada. After she tried it, my wife and I both tried a sip. It tasted of a little alcohol and blended ice. She returned it for a pepsi. 

Then my wife had ordered an appetizer salad. Our entrees were delivered, and no salad. The server realized she forgot the salad and told us she would bring it out and have the manager take it off our bill. 

Then the server offered a refill on our friend's pepsi, and brought a diet pepsi. 

Now I know why it's been almost a year since I've been to a BJ's, and why I'll most likely never go back."}

The second time the service was slow but all in all the service wasn't too bad. They make their own root beer and cherry soda. How awesome is that! Unlimited refills too. Even better!  

I tried the Cobb salad from their lunch menu and it was the perfect portion. Not too big and my too small. I was able to finish it all and still feel comfortable. No stuffy feeling if you know what I mean. 

Although this is a bar it's still a nice place to come to grab a bite to eat. If you are in a rush you might want to get take out. 

I can't wait to sample other items in their menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for variety, BJ's is the place for you.  Their menu includes everything from pasta to burgers to pizza to salads to tacos and is sure to please guests of all ages and degrees of \"pickiness.\"

I ordered the Parmesan-Crusted Chicken, which our server explained was one of the most popular menu items.  The portions were large and included 2 full chicken breasts.  They were laid upon white cheddar mashed potatoes that were to die for.  The entree came with a lemony butter sauce, but I felt that there really wasn't much of this on my plate.  The little bit that I got tasted extraordinary though.  The dish was also accompanied by steamed broccoli, which lacked seasoning and flavor in general.

BJ's also offers their own custom craft sodas, which was a huge draw for me.  I am a huge cream soda fan and loved their own in-house cream soda.

They also have \"pizookies\" which are large skillet cookies for dessert.  We got the sampler, which included 3 mini cookies, so we could try several flavors.  The peanut butter was our personal favorite.  But all of them were delicious.

I'll definitely be back to try out additional menu items!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner, and even though quite busy we did not have to wait very long to be seated. Our server was Mallory, who is very pleasant, and she was quite prompt in taking our order. The appetizer chips and guacamole were great, and our entrees made our day. Probably one of the best cups of coffee I have had in a while. Our second visit, and it was comparable to the first."}
{"text":"Awfully slow and terrible service. I had to repeat myself several times. Over an hour an a half on a Monday night for a salad and soup. By all means, please move at a glacial pace. The employees were more interested in having conversations and counting their tips than serving the customers. I had a reward and asked for it, took over 20 minutes.

Will not be returning to this BJ's."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service at this location is a bit off. My grandma purchased gift cards for the holidays and it took a good 20 minutes for the transaction. Apparently the computer had a glitch. That's fine.  We were patient and understood that things happen. With the purchase of $100 you are suppose to receive 4 souvenir beer glasses and a 20% off VIP card. My grandma received the glasses but not the VIP card. So, I hop back in line and the cashiers at the to go section (where you purchase gift cards) were too flustered to even acknowledge their customers. After about 15 min someone finally acknowledges me. They did give me the 20% gift card but then proceeded to explain that it may not work properly because the VIP card was not rung up with a transaction. Know what am I suppose to do with that?! The manager gave me his card and said if I have issues to show his card. The only problem is that my grandma lives 30 min away and barely goes to this BJ's. 

Now, on to the food. I ordered the Cajun pasta. It was ok. NOTHING like the Cajun pasta that Cheesecake Factory has. I also had the broccoli cheddar soup. Now, that was GOOD. Looks like I gotta just stick to pizzas, beers, and pizookies when I'm eating at BJ's."}
{"text":"I had the black and blue burger with potatoe wedges. The wedges were crisp but void of seasoning. The burger was pretty standard and was kind of bland in regards to the Patty, but the bacon and cheese gave it some taste. Had the Brussel sprouts as an app which saved the meal as they were crisp and charred up perfectly. I had the house made root beer and that was super tasty as well so make sure and order one if your a soda fan. Service was great as was the ambiance of this joint. I will come back if just in the mood for apps and drinks."}
{"text":"I recently move to the North West side of town and knowing that I have always liked BJ's on the East side I decided to try the Centennial location.  I typically get take out and I have never been disappointed.  I love the curbside delivery as I have kids and don't even have to get out of the car.  The staff is very friendly and very prompt. I have also eaten inside and have received the same great food and great service.  I would recommend BJ's to anyone looking for a great variety of food to choose from and service that is not only friendly but expeditious as well."}
{"text":"Ok, I've given this place a couple of chances. Here's the bottom line. Atmosphere is comfy with a very nice bar area. The beer is good. The food is mediocre. The service is abysmal. My advice if you're determined to come here? Sit at the bar and don't get food. Just order beer. You have half a chance of actually enjoying it. 

This time we got there 10 minutes after they opened for a pre-movie lunch. 35 minutes later all I had was a water, nearly empty. There were no more than 5-6 other people in there. There were at least 10 servers, 6 of whom yakked it up in one corner and didn't move the entire time we were there. Ok, maybe there was a meeting. If so, I hope it was about how crappy the service is and what they need to do to fix it. But I doubt it. 

The food is just ok. The fries are so skinny it's like what's left over from the potato after the real restaurants take what they need. And they are not good. Burger was ok but I've had better at most bars. Yeah, I've had way better. And without the disaster that is their service. Don't look for me here. I'll be somewhere where the food tastes great and customer service actually means something."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and this review is way overdue! This place can get pretty crowded and busy at times. But you can't ding a restaurant just because of that... It means they're doing their job and running this place as it should! 

I have never had a complaint about getting greeted every time I walk into BJ's. When it's busy, they give us an honest estimate as to how long we will wait. None of that \"10 minutes\" when they really mean 45 minutes! 

Once we get seated our drink orders are taken almost instantly. We have quite some time to look over the menu, we never feel rushed. When you have no idea what to order waiters/waitresses are always recommending and suggesting things. 

Food comes out hot and fresh. You never have to wait too long for your food. Approximately between 30-45 minutes, max! I appreciate the waiters tending to our needs and frequently checking up on us. 

I never have complaints on cleanliness here. The waiting area, seating area, and bathrooms are always so clean! HUGE plus for me! Excellent customer service! Welcoming and accommodating staff. I would highly recommend this place! 

Side note, if you don't know what to order I would suggest: 
Appetizers- avocado egg rolls, stuffed mushrooms
Main Dish- Cajun chicken pasta, (any flavor) deep dish pizza, or broccoli cheddar soup and/or clam chowder with a bread bowl
Dessert- you can never go wrong with a pizookie! But definitely try the beignet! 

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"This location should be ashamed the way the treated a veteran on Veterans Day. My father went there on Veterans Day to order a meal that was supposed to be free. After waiting a long time he asked where his meal was, they apologized and said we must of served it to the wrong person. He was irritated and said he'd leave and go to another restaurant. The manager didn't offer to pay for his 2 glasses of wine ($13) or anything, he only offered to put the order in again. How disappointing."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for the Pizookie or I would never come back. Don't know who runs this shack but the service leaves much to be desired, slow, not super courteous, just didn't seem happy to be here. Was drinkless for about half my meal. BBQ brisket burger was really good. The spaghetti and meatballs was good but nothing to write home about. I thought I was supposed to get a salad but the server never said anything so I guess not. Other locations have been great. Must be New management and working on changing the culture."}
{"text":"My impression of BJs is that many of my guy friends love to meet here for pizza and beers when I am in town... 

The pizza is good.
The service was good considering how busy they can get.
They can really accommodate large groups for sure too!

Worth a taste."}
{"text":"This area was in a desperate need for a place like this.  It's a chain without the cliche chain feel.  The food was really good.  Fried artichokes are a must! And their thin fries were perfect.  Our server, Chelsea rocked and went the extra mile for us.  The gm came to our table and was so welcoming. To top it off, they had guys with giant umbrellas outside walking people to their cars. Quality place, quality staff, will def be back!"}
{"text":"We came to BJs this evening for happy hour and we unfortunately had to sit next to an inebriated man.  We asked the bartender Scott at what point they stop serving him and the bartender said \"when he's drunk\" and I said \"you don't think he's drunk?\"  We got the manager involved as this guy was touching me and making a scene and i felt it was handled very poorly.  The manager just made him slide down and kept saying \"I have to slide down for the fat and ugly girl.\"  This guy was clearly over served and they let him remain at the bar and continued to make a scene.

I absolutely will not be back to this location due to the way this situation has been handled.

I am expecting a response and would look into your bartenders over serving your guests as that is definitely a liability."}
{"text":"I am a long time patron of BJ's -- absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!!! I've been to many in Colorado and Arizona, and I do have to admit this one particular location consistently, time after time, gets my order wrong. I've sent back more dishes brought to me here than any other restaurant in Arizona.

If you order anything, be sure you want your  dish exactly how it's stated on the menu otherwise they will most likely get it wrong...

Food - great
Service - okay at best
Quality - okay at best
Wait-time to get your order - atrocious!!"}
{"text":"We've had Danielle as our bartender/server multiple times and she's always on her game. She's very attentive and chatty but aware of others. She's probably the best."}
{"text":"I have never wrote a review but I was appalled at the service here yesterday (5/31/13) at lunch. I was with someone and we were literally one of the first people in the door at 11am and didn't get our food for a good 45 minutes. I was on my lunch break and not once did the server come over to apologize as the restaurant filled up and other patrons came and left after already eating. After finally getting food he just dropped it in front of us, cold and walked away. I have been a server before and I think that's why it bothered me the most, knowing what I would have done in his situation, at least apologizing for the wait or even sending over a manager. I was late getting back to my office due to coming in at 11am and not able to leave until 1230 after shoveling the food in my mouth. I would come back, but if I had the same server, ask for someone else."}
{"text":"BJs is a nice combination of a few things Sports bar, microbrewery and pizzeria.  The wait in a Friday or Saturday is not worth it but if you can get there at the start of happy hour there are usually enough seats.  Their hamburger pizza is awesome!  The beer is pretty good but not as good as four peaks.  They do have pretty good lunch specials as well."}
{"text":"Keisha was our server.  Excellent service and food"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here just last night, and it was amazing like always.  Their pizza is one of the best I have ever had.  They have all of the traditional toppings, but their specialty pizzas are to die for.  I had a buffalo chicken pizza that was spot on and amazing.  Their always seems to be a long wait (and for good reason), so make sure to call ahead.  Also, their desert 'Pizookie', which is a cookie topped with ice cream cooked in a small pizza pan, is a perfect end to a meal."}
{"text":"I eat here from time to time.  The service in the bar area is slow. In the restaurant, they have runners with the food, but if there is a problem, you need to tell the wait staff. the runners will just look at you or ignore you.  The food here is good.  I like the deep dish pizzas and the brewed root beer is excellent! It comes in a cold glass without ice.  Also, try the Asian Chopped Salad or the Lunch specials - salad with half a sandwich and fries.  It is a good price, and with a drink it is all about $10.

The atmosphere is professional, but not friendly or \"warm\".  Every time that I have entered, I feel as though I am bothering the front staff.  They always seem distracted. Sometimes they ask for  the rewards card, and sometimes they do not.  

I go for the food, not for the service.  Of the many times that I have been there, only  a couple of the servers have been good.  Some are slow, and some are annoying - calling me sweetheart/baby/darling, or just not responding.  Once they get the wait staff properly trained to serve, it will be an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"I only gave it 3 stars because the fish and chips had an awful coating. 3 of us ordered the fish and chips. Over salted, too heavy and gummy coating. Everything else was great. Nice server. Good beer. This place usually doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Checked out BJ's for happy hour. They have great happy hour deals and their pumpkin beer is delicious. Not too sweet but a nice subtitle pumpkin flavor. Best of all the bartender gave us the courtesy of asking if we needed anything else before happy hour ends. Thanks, Darnell!"}
{"text":"Great staff.  Well taken care of.  Food was good.  I'd come to this location again."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this location with a friend during my vegas Holiday trip. Since there's not too many in AZ whenever I can visit one in another state I jump at the chance. We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty crowded so we decided to eat at the booths in the bar area so we wouldn't have to wait. Our server was very attentive and was a good sport to put up with my friend's crazy sense of humor. I decided to start with the pomegranate margarita and ordered their Cajun pasta with shrimp as my meal. I like BJ's for the reasons why I like the Cheesecake Factory; tons of options and they're always consistently delicious. My pasta was huge,  I ate a large serving and still had lots to take with me for leftovers. For dessert my friend and I shared the baked beignet that was warm delicious and the perfect ending to my meal :-). This place is pretty solid so I may think about driving out of my way to visit one here in AZ."}
{"text":"I went there in a Friday afternoon and was sat right away even though the place looked really busy. The waitress was really friendly. Food was good. I had the mozzarella sticks which could be served with more marinara sauce. I also had the BBQ salad which as awesome. I asked for Tabasco from a passing waitress who forgot to bring it but the main waitress brought I right away when I asked. Also had some drinks that I thought were on happy hour but we were not sitting in the bar area, so happy hour didn't apply. It would have been nice to know that beforehand. Overall it was a really nice and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"From calling in the order, the packaging of the food to the quality of food our overall experience was excellent. We ordered fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and corn, chicken tortilla soup and santa fe salad. Everything was delicious. The packaging was done right with tight lids and cold food separated in another bag from the hot food. I can't tell you what a pleasure it was to get our food home without worrying about any spills! The bags of food could have been tipped over and nothing would have spilled. I order a lot of takeout and this restaurant is now on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Usually a pretty good meal at BJ's if you can handle the wait.  Service is friendly but it's often difficult to get your server's attention.  We started with Caesar Salads and asked the person who brought it to our table for fresh black pepper.  She said she would let our server know.  We waited about 7-8 minutes until we finally saw our server and asked her.  

Pizzas are always tasty.  But the real reason my kids like going here is for the pazookies!!"}
{"text":"Our soccer team was in town for a college showcase and BJ's was closest to the hotel the girls were staying.  I spoke with Donna (Manager) and arranged a pizza, pasta, salad buffet for the players and their families.  She emailed me the contract and just like that, we were all set. 

When we arrived at BJ's for our dinner, I was surprised to find out that they don't start preparing the food until we get there.  I was a tad bit panicked because the girls had tickets to see the UCLA game, and dinner was already going to be rushed.

Not to worry. We were seated and they already had the salad out! The girls quickly pounced on that. Before they were finished, the pizza and pasta started making their way out. Perfection!  We had plenty of time to spare.  But wait!  Better get the pizookies started, so the girls can have them right after dinner! Where is the server?!? Oh? He got the pizookies started already??? Phew! I've never been to a buffet where things ran so smoothly.

I thought there would be a problem with the check...as there always is with a large group. Nope!  The check was correct to the penny!  We will definitely choose this BJ's again when we are in town!  

Thank you Donna, Ron and your staff for making our dinner so seamless. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice. Service and food are outstanding! The first time they were very busy but our wait for a table was less than five minutes. Our server was a tad slow but we didn't mind as it gave us time to look over the menu. She was super friendly and helped me make a selection. I got the tilapia. The husband got the jumbalaya. Both were so good. They do their own rootbeer and cream soda and I can't say enough about those. You can actually taste the butterscotch in the cream soda. The second time we went was a Friday night. They will not accept reservations for a party under 10 but if you call before you arrive they'll add you to the wait list. We called half an hour before we left the house and added our name to the list. When we arrived the place was packed to the point that people had to wait outside. We walked right in and they had a table for us. No waiting at all! We got some very dirty looks. lol  Despite being very busy our server was attentive and quick. I got the thai salmon covered in mango salsa. Amazing! Husband got the chili burger. My friend got a club. We were all so into our food we ate in silence for quite some time. I tried their black cherry soda. It was really good. The only gripe I have is that I ordered their gluten-free pizookie at the end of our meal. I got it to go. They did make us wait a bit for that and later, when we opened it up, we discovered the pizookie was not cooked. It was just a doughey mess. I was very disappointed by that. I had also expected it to be somewhat bigger. It is $5.99 and really just an oversized  cookie but not so big that I'd call it a pizookie. I won't be ordering that again. But we will for sure go back to BJ's for a good meal."}
{"text":"Service incredibly slow. Just ordered appetizers and took 40 minutes and they lost one of the appetizers. The calamari was incredibly bland, no seasoning in the breading. Not impressed. Menu is far to big and nothing sounds too incredibly delectable. Very underwhelmed. Disappointing addition to route 20."}
{"text":"A nice place to go to get a steak or salad later in the evening.  Unfortunately, they close at 11pm.

I have had nothing but good service here and I prefer this place over the Yard House simply because it is not loud and overbearing at night.  

On the many visits here, I've had the Turkey Burger (it was moist and delicious), the Rib-Eye at medium rare (perfect!), the Thai Chicken Mango Salad, (the sweet dressing really makes it POP with bright flavor, and the Santa Fe Salad (the fire roasted red peppers, jack / cheddar cheese, avocado and corn make this Santa Fe Salad one of my top Southwestern Salad favorites out of any restaurant...)

For desert, we sometimes get the PIZZOOKIE!  Chocolaty goodness is yours to behold!  Definitely try it if you have room for it at the end.  It's very worth it.

The servers are usually quick and on top their game.  The restaurant is very clean and neat.  The ambiance is very casual and perfect for a date.

I'll be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Beer selection was better than your local bar , but it was definitely limited. They have about 8 in house beers which are well advertised but not very good and with what ever taps are left over they squeeze in some other nationals , stone IPA, Stella Guinness . If your a craft beer drinker don't expect to be impressed. Food was par, not great but not bad. The reason for the two stars was the server, slow and I was extremely disappointed at her lack of knowledge about beer... this is a brew house ... and I'm educating her on the product they serve. Educate your people they are the face of your company."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It has almost anything you're hungry for.  I am a picky eater and like to eat on the healthier side.  They have many healthy vegetarian dishes to choose from along with a full range of great beers!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and fantastic atmosphere! You can taste the freshness of the ingredients used in the food! I will definitely be returning and recommending this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Love this  place always good food. Today though they had a run on silver ware, my daughter prefers fingers anyway. Oh have the totanka and Cortney is an awesome waitress according to my daughters last two visits she had her both times. \"Super sweet, nice and gets the job done in an amazingly awesome news way!!!\" That's a direct quote about Cort from a twelve year old foooodie."}
{"text":"On a bit of a \"healthy\" food kick these days... so I love that they have an \"Under 575 Calories\" menu.  The Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi was surprisingly tasty.  The stir-fry veggie-pineapple fried rice was yummy and filling.  Sooo... I couldn't help but cheat just a little... but how can you go to BJ's and resist the Avocado Egg Rolls?!  I suppose you could if you didn't like avocados.. but if you're a fan and you haven't tried them, definitely give them a go on your next visit! :)"}
{"text":"Third time here and always very good. Appetizers are good size portions. Mozzarella sticks, spinach artichoke, calamari are all excellent.  Tortilla and broccoli cheddar soup are very good. Pasta, pizza, prime rib are all very good. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Drinks are also tasty."}
{"text":"i don't live in or near glendale so i have no idea what there is to eat near where we were shopping/staying for the day. after some google and yelp searches for places that had menu items we could eat, we settled on BJ's. 
i've been to a BJ's before in southern california. it is good. a well-rounded menu and pleasant staff. they kept the water glasses full. we shared the lettuce wraps. the shrimp was well seasoned and cooked well. we also split the hawaiin mahi mahi. the fish was a little overcooked, but it still tasted pretty good. 
prices are comparable to any big bar/food chain. i would eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the parmesan encrusted chicken, and I've never been disappointed.  I love their mashed potatoes, and their broccoli ir has this lemon-y flavor which isn't typically done. 

The service here is always very good I have never left here disappointed. Their house beers are so very good if your over the age of 21, and would like to try something different I would say definitely to for it. Almost forgot to mention their Italian sodas are gooood! 

It's almost always very busy, so I would try to call ahead and check in."}
{"text":"My Dad and I ate lunch in here today.  And it was a mixed bag.  He had the Margherita Flatbread, which he said was great and it looked good.  I had a Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  It had Pesto, Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Grilled Chicken, and I got the garlic aioli on the side.  And it comes with a side salad.  The salad was great.  It had some sort of citrus vinegar dressing.  I really enjoyed that.  However, there was something in the sandwich that set my mouth on fire.  I don't know if they put jalapenos in the pesto, but something was extremely spicy.  I could only eat half the sandwich.  And there wasn't a whole lot of chicken on it.  We each had some of the house root beer, which is excellent.  The service was also good and it was very clean in there.  I'd definitely eat here again, however I'm staying away from the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  The other downside is that they share a parking lot with two other restaurants and when it is peak eating hours, it can be brutal trying to find parking or dodge bad drivers."}
{"text":"BJ's is a good option for casual dining. It's a large, spacious place with a huge ceiling.
In addition to a large selection of beer (of course), the menu is about eight pages in length with options for every taste. Included are burgers, tacos, flatbreads, salads, fish.
The portions are large enough to usual produce a leftover. The food is decent."}
{"text":"We love the chili-cheese Burger, it's huge and is more than enough for both of us. We also only sit in the bar area, the service is quick and normally we want to watch a game while we eat. They have a good selection of Micro-Brew's, the Red and the Brown are my Fav's."}
{"text":"Wow, this is the first time I feel like if I could give a review with negative stars- I would. The horrible customer service that your takeout section provided me today, leaves me baffled because usually I love coming here for takeout and everyone previously has always been so nice. 

Today I walked into your takeout section, was was blatantly ignored by your staff. Including a guy in a button up shirt, who I'm assuming is a manager? I walked in and stood there while they continued their conversations with cellphones in hand. Almost as if they were waiting for one of their other coworkers to make contact with me so they would be forced to help. Talking and laughing amongst each other and having personal conversations while helping me. Just so unprofessional. 

I came in, and although I made my order hours in advanced- when I got there my order wasn't complete....I ordered HOURS in advance. I get it, it may have been busy and no biggie I can wait a couple minutes. But then the girl helping me, asked the other girl to go grab my side items- it made me feel like I was a nuisance and she didn't even say sure! I'm sorry about that! Or of course no problem! It was a scuff and then came  back with hardly anything in my side cups. 

I just can't believe it, and as a manager I HIGHLY recommend that you review your staff and retrain them on how to deal with customer and guide hem on customer service. 

NOW I JUST GOT HOME AND MY ORDER ISN'T EVEN RIGHT. You seriously have got to be joking, they put the wrong condiments, sides. 

What a crappy experience that deters me from supporting you guys. Oh well."}
{"text":"Anthony was absolutely great! Super patient since we came towards the end of the night. Something was too hot so he took it off the bill - totally unnecessary but incredibly hospitable!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I used to love this place and have always had good service. Today we sat about 10-15 min w/ out drinks 2 times our drink order was wrong and we waited over 35 min for food. Was busy but not crazy crowded. Waitress was not attentive."}
{"text":"perfect place for family and friends to enjoy a good meal together, only negatives is slower service then what I gave when I waited tables. I was trained to greet your table within 5 to 10 minutes it was roughly 20. also the manager didn't know the sisters to the yelp questions when I checked in. food is so good it's worth the small wait."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place to order curbside pickup on nights when I want good food, but don't want to cook. Good pricing and the convenience of pickup."}
{"text":"My mom friends and I love this place! It's late hours are super convenient. Though the staff seems to all be unaware of the late night specials that scroll through the electronic signage and have argued with us several times! We are like...it literally say it, RIGHT THERE. The drink and food selection is huge. I recommend the avocado egg rolls, if you have a days worth of calories to spare, lol!"}
{"text":"The food and service was subpar for the price you pay. Would recommend if you are wanting to grab drinks and appetizers. Great drink selection!"}
{"text":"A favorite date night place.  I had a hefe, the corn fritters and the deep fried artichoke.  Heaven in my mouth.  The only problem was our server was a tad spacey and repeatedly forgot my husbands salad.  Management ended up comping it since it didn't arrive until well after we finished eating, so NBD."}
{"text":"I can not count the number of times we've been here now.  It is excellent.  The menu is extensive and extremely good.  We've taken friends here and gave $50 gift  cards to some people and we can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  The service was well above average.  I've read other reviews saying service was bad - you people need to go back and try again.  I don't think you were in the same restaurant we were.  We love this place and will be back many times and bring friends with us."}
{"text":"There is no losing here.  The food is so good!!  I usually shy away from bar pizza, but this was some of the best pizza I have had.  Awesome chicken wings.  And they have a large selection of great beer.  There is nothing like a beer with real flavor.  I usually do not like a really dark brew, but they have the best.  

Great service, just a great place."}
{"text":"Came here last night after a dbacks game and for a Friday night it was surprisingly empty. Got right in and served fast. My date and I had the lettuce wraps for an appetizer which were delicious! We then shared the Spicy Pig thin crust pizza which was delicious as well. I didn't pay but my only complaint is that the thin crust pizza (more like a flatbread) is one size only and it's like $14.50. I could easily have eaten the entire thing myself, just seems a little steep but again it was very tasty. I moved close to desert ridge so I'm sure I'll be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"The waiter we had was telling us what I wanted to order. I an on a special diet and have ordered this meal for years, no problem. This time it Was a problem and he was not one of the usual waiters that wait on us. We almost walked out until we saw a manager and spoke to him. He said there was no problem and took the order. We also asked for a new server because he had a attitude. He also went  to another table telling other people the same thing, I know they did not look happy. If he is my server next time I will go to another station."}
{"text":"Jill was our bartender/waitress and was AWESOME as usual. ALWAYS FANTASTIC service!!!! The Tatonka Stout, Nutty Brewnette, PM Porter, Jeremiah Red, Hop Storm, Piranha, and Brewhouse Blonde as all great! BJ's has THE BEST RIBS ANYWHERE!!! The Northbeach  Mahi Mahi and shrimp was extremely good! Our boys had purchased a $100 gift card on line for Christmas, and we received an extra $25. Such a deal. We never regret coming here. Great service, good beer and excellent food!!!! $2.00 off appetizers during all pro games and $1.00 off beers even on Sunday's. GO CAVS!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Asian salad was always at BJ's when I lived in Southern California and I hadn't found one I love in the Pittsburgh area, so I was excited when I found out BJ's was coming to Pittsburgh. I know that's not what you think someone would recommend from a pizza place, but the chicken in it is so well prepared and the dressing and mandarin orange slices make it pretty perfect.

The salad and pizookie were still wonderful, as was the rest of the food our party ordered. I'm sure their pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers are all still really good here. If it were closer, I'm sure I'd go more frequently. 

The cider they make was very good, as were the beers ordered in our party. 

There's no sign that faces the street, but BJ's is the red building up and to the left of Bonefish as you're looking at the buildings from 19. 

It's a small restaurant, so signing up for their app (which gives you a free mini pizookie your first trip and other rewards) allows you to get in line before you get there, which is probably a good idea if you go at a normal meal time."}
{"text":"Haven't been to BJ's in years and tried this one with my family.  Loved it! Great food, great service!  The best is their new portobello mushroom pizza and their best beginnings appetizer! Let's not forget Pizookie!  But it can get crowded so go early!"}
{"text":"Service needs fine tuning, shouldn't get your appetizers same time as your entree, 3 visits to restaurant and each time got appetizers after our meals, nothing like the Florida locations we have gone to"}
{"text":"They really do try hard at BJ's and I feel like they get that extra star for effort.

When it comes to family friendly chain restaurants, BJs is one of the few that I like. Their food, while not of remarkable. is consistent and some dishes don't substitute in fat to make up for flavor. BJ's has been able to really define itself in what is a competitive market segment. Having it's own selection of micro-brewed beers, deep-dish pizzas, and of-course the pazookie set it apart from the likes of Claim Jumper and others. 

I usually end up coming here almost once a week. The sandwiches and the deep-dish pizza (the Great White and the Mediterranean are awesome) never fail. But what really brings me in is of course the pazookie. It's their signature dessert, just like the cheesecakes at the cheesecake factory. 

Service is often hit or miss, but unfortunately my last experience was a miss. I came in during happy hour with a couple friends to catch the game. The bar area was pretty barren, no wait at all. We got our seat an the server took our order. Unlike most happy hour patrons, our group ordered pretty much everything. Beers, appetizers, pizza, pazookies, everything. The food was good, but for whatever reason, our server kept rushing. Maybe she was about to get off and wanted this the tip before she clocked out, I don't know. But considering the place was totally empty, I don't get why they would want to turn this table over so fast. Feeling rushed really does ruin the dining experience, especially at a place I go to so often. She brought our check out before the pazookie arrived which is highly unusual. After dessert had arrived the server stopped by to see if we had paid, seeing we that we had not, she stood nearby waiting for us to do so. This made the whole dining experience really AWKWARD.

I don't really expect every experience here to be like this, but it was really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great mobile app with nice reward program. Make reservations, dine-in pre-order, carry out and curbside, and group order option. Dining in, the experience and atmosphere is great. I've ordered take-out/curbside several times, and not once was the order correct. After a few bad orders, I was provided a $20 Gift Card to return. I used it for carry out, and that order was the worst I'd gotten. After another failed attempt, I have not gone that route again. Diverse, delicious menu for all tastes including kids, nice bar with great options and TVs for sports fans. I can recommend the dining experience in-house, but carry out is a gamble..."}
{"text":"In Phoenix from FL for unexpected visit. Staying at La Quinta in Mesa. Front desk clerk recommended this restaurant & LQ guests receive 10% discount. So glad she did! I had chicken specialty w/ mashed potatoes & broccoli, DTR had salad, both delicious, would definitely recommend this place! And return..."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go to BJ's because we had trouble trying to make a reservation. Called to make reservation on a Wed for Fri night. The phone recording clearly states they take reservations for 7 or more. Young lady who answered took my information and said she needed to check with a manager to verify availability and I would receive a phone call within 24 hours. Thursday comes and no word so I call back & there is no record of my info from Wed call. So I leave my info again. They say I will receive a call Friday morning to confirm & to \"stay by the phone.\" Friday, the day we are requesting the reservation for 7:30, 3:00 PM comes and no confirmation call. I call again & there is no record of our reservation. I was exasperated. I explained all of the above to Terry & she assured me she was personally pencilling us in. When the first of our party arrived they were told it would be  another half hour & they don't take reservations for parties of 7 (it clearly states on their recording they do.) Anyhow we were seated by 7:30. They pack you in! The service was wonderful, food good. They were very accommodating by bringing out the Birthday cake we had brought w  candles lit- no annoying Birthday song! I would recommend going here again but if you make a reservation, follow up because the staff doesn't seem to know how to do it."}
{"text":"WE went around 7 pm on a mMonday eve.  All was going well when the food took 45 min. to get to table and it was only egg rolls and hamburger.  The server was ok but never the less the food took forever.  I can usually wait about 25 min but this was outrageous.  Sorry BJ's we won't be back!"}
{"text":"We went with Family on Friday night for a Birthday dinner and Happy Hour. We had a wonderful server named Paula. Paula was the BEST server I have seen in a long time. She made us feel like we were family and anticipated our every need. The food was good, but the Happy Hour needs help. Happy hour is only good on Mondays for the 1/2 price pizzas, otherwise they need to work on better pricing for expensive beer, and very few choices for food."}
{"text":"BJ's is, and has been for over seven years, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas; and I have been to A LOT of restaurants all over town. To me, a great restaurant is one that has an enjoyable environment, great food, good service, and fair prices. BJ's definitely has all of these qualities. 

To begin, the environment is very welcoming and well-kept. The restaurant has a big city, Chicago style, feel to it and offers both bar/lounge area seating with a full bar and several flat screen TV's all around the restaurant. The dining room offers booth seating for two, four, or up to eight and tables for a small party of a couple friends or a huge party of a high school archery team, (I tried going with something other than football team, you get the point...). The lights are slightly dim to keep the mood somewhat mellow, but the TV's and music keep the restaurant upbeat--it's a good balance for a good environment. 

The food at BJ's is awesome! They offer a great selection of appetizers which are perfect to share, as well as smaller sized appetizers, \"Tiny Bites,\" which make perfect individual appetizers or sides. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pesto flatbread pizza, (appetizer to share), and the gourmet mac & cheese, (individual \"tiny bite\"). As far as the main entrees, BJ's offers a wide variety of foods ranging from classic burgers to Italian inspired pastas to Teriyaki Chicken to Grilled Salmon and even some Jambalaya. BJ's also has some delectable gourmet salads and wholesome soups. My favorite entrée has to be the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. 
There is a large selection of drinks offered at BJ's, from the full bar to specialty drinks, both alcoholic and non, as well as their signature hand-crafted root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry soda.   
Now for the good part--the desserts. BJ's is known for their pizookies. Pizookies are cookies, baked in a pizza pan, served hot out of the oven with two scoops of ice cream on top. They have the classic Chocolate Chip pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top as well as quite a few other flavors such as Triple Chocolate, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, and, newly added, Red Velvet. There's also an Oatmeal Raisin pizookie for those of you who like to feel like you're eating healthy even while having dessert. BJ's also offers beignets and an ice cream sundae as well as a couple other dessert items. 

Almost every time I have been to BJ's, the staff has been very friendly. Only a couple times have I ever had an issue with a server or host. If my order is ever made incorrectly, which rarely happens, the server will gladly take it back and bring me the correct order as well as give me some sort of compensation, such as a discount or free dessert. 
The prices are really good for a restaurant such as this one. They have lunch specials during the week which are only about 6-8 dollars. As far as the prices on the regular menu, most of the items range anywhere from 10 to 18 dollars with a few exceptions being slightly 
higher or lower. 

In all, BJ's is a great place to have a quick lunch, to go on a date, or to take the family out for dinner. It is very unlikely that you will be disappointed with this restaurant, (unless, of course, you are a complete restaurant snob who will complain about the most insignificant things), and I do hope that you give BJ's a visit in the near future."}
{"text":"It appears from other reviews that there is definitely a problem with \"wait time\" here. My daughter and I have been here twice in the past couple of months, both times we chose a high-top table in the middle of the bar area. The first time service was slow, we chalked it up to being in between after lunch and and the very start of happy hour or short on staff. BUT, last night, our service was just plain ole SLOW. Last night we arrived approx 8:00 for dinner. No wait for a high-top table in the bar area but it took a while to for our server to get our initial drink order. She returned, we placed our food order and that's when the wait time got even worse. Our drinks were empty....even our water! She never checked in, kept looking for her and we were about to just leave but we had a hungry little boy who needed his dinner. She finally came to our table with some weird reason why our dinner was delayed, took off real quick and our glasses were still empty. Finally able to get a second round ordered and then our dinner came out. It was hot and delicious....good thing or we would have just left. We were comped on the bill for the delay so the situation was acknowledged. I sure did notice another couple next to us in tables that were seated 30 seconds before us ( I know, I wanted that table but didn't make it in time) were done, served, ate, paid the bill and left before we even had our meal brought to our table. 

The food is amazing and delicious and there is a wide selection of beers. I hope that my next visit our server will be a bit more attentive and my glasses don't sit on the table empty"}
{"text":"Took someone here this weekend for a birthday dinner on saturday - it was pretty busy, but we were fortunate to find an open seat at the bar. This BJ's seemed a little smaller than the Chandler location, but that didn't really bother me. Our service was good and the bartender was really chatty though I didn't mind. 

Started off with some Hefeweizen, clam chowder sourdough bowl for appetizers, and some BJ's deep dish pizza for dinner. Food was really good, servers were nice, so I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat then I remembered son telling me bout this place so I called ahead we got there no waiting went right in the waiter was so nice his name was Jon very nice disposition he asked us if we would like to try samples of their beers, so we took him up on that trying the Oktoberfest brew n the other one was sunset pretty good, we ordered the stuff mushrooms, Advocado egg rolls, both were very food Id like to recommend ordering the California Advocado Club mmm very delicious , then for desert  we had pazookie Ghirardelli chocolate cookie warmed with chocolate icecream  in the middle sprinkled with chocolate chips delicious, any way I do recommend this place n Jon provided great customer service, Thank you Jon!"}
{"text":"When excellent food and service meet all your expectations it deserves recognizing. Our server was so friendly and informative. She was able to answer all our questions about the specials and entrees. The food came out quick and was delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Saturday for my Daughter's birthday dessert choice.  We LOVE the Pizookies and accompanied with a Stout, doesn't get much better.  Service at the bar tables was spot on and as usual. the restaurant was very clean and inviting.  Have been here numerous times and especially enjoy their flat breads."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but my last 3 experiences have all been very poor. To be fair they were all either delivered or picked up by myself and eaten at home. I ordered my favorite deep dish pizza each time. The first 2 times there was literally no cheese on the pizza, it was just crust and a few pieces of chicken. The last meal I just had yesterday I specifically paid for more cheese, and this time the chicken came out very...\"funky\"...likely undercooked. Everyone at home thought so which is weird because their chicken is spot on. I'm not sure if this is only because there wasn't as much care put into the orders because they weren't being eaten in house but it has been quite disappointing."}
{"text":"My sister and I came for a celebratory dinner and it did not disappoint! Our server gave us great service and the manager went above and beyond to make sure we had a nice meal! Thanks you!"}
{"text":"Well, BJs is consistently bad and that's about they only thing they've gotten down. My husband and I decided to give them a chance for a pizookie tonight. When we were seated, we figured we'd give their appetizers a shot. We did the sampler with the avocado egg rolls, cheese sticks, wings, and spinach artichoke dip. The dip was runny and gross, the egg rolls had no flavor besides avocado, but the cheese sticks and wings were ok. We didn't finish much of it. For dessert we did Oreo, chocolate chunk, and salted caramel mini pizookies. Meh, I don't get the hype. They're okay but they're really not all that great. We prefer the passion cookie at Streets of New York, but they were closed. They get two stars because the food was tolerable. 
As far as service, I'd give Airica four stars. She was hustling and appeared to be the only server in the bar area. Our food took forever, but that definitely wasn't her fault. In regards to other staff, there was a server who violently burst through the kitchen doors multiple times and nearly throttled a customer. He also loudly complained to the host about how many issues he currently had. We all have bad days-I get it. But come on, keep it professional! I've learned my lesson and I'll stop banging my head against the wall that is BJs-never again!"}
{"text":"First time going to this restaurant and it was great! I would definitely go again! I like the ambiance as well and they brew their own root beer for those who like it!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least least once a week....great place for kids or meeting the girls for a drink. Large selection on the menu and beer selection is AMAZING! Nice selection for kids as well, lots to chose from. Ask for Rachel if you go, she always give great service!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Salad dressing bland.
Problem was service. Finally got ketchup as I was done with meal. Definitely need better training for wait staff."}
{"text":"Pass this place all the time and went in on monday where they have half off pizzas. Ahi poke was onolicious and the lemon pepper wings were dabomb.com"}
{"text":"I am an HR professional working at the headquarters of a national company located about a mile away from this restaurant. Part of my job requires me to cater lunches for visitors to our office which can be a challenge in the North Hills. On Tuesday, July 25, 2017, I decided to give BJ's a try for a take out lunch for seven. As is my preferred practice for these events, I placed the order online, but was surprised that no payment was requested. A few moments later, I received an order confirmation email with an online payment link. Upon clicking the link, an error message pops up that online payments are not accepted via the link until 15 minutes before order is ready. I waited until 15 minutes prior and entered my payment into system. I then received online confirmation of my payment and requested an email receipt which was received shortly thereafter. Upon arrival at the restaurant, the server putting my order together claims no payment was showing. I advised that I paid online. The server goes into the back and brings out Junior Joe Manager who restates the same. I advised him that I paid online and will not pay twice. Junior Joe states no payment received so I tell him to have a nice lunch, turn and begin to leave. Junior Joe states that if I leave he will call police because I ordered food and did not pay for it. I advise again that I paid online and I will not pay twice. Junior Joe states he will not tolerate my aggressive behavior and I must leave. I gladly left without food never to return again. Upon arrival back at the office, I called BJ's corporate office in California and explained situation. Tiffany stated she would investigate, make sure payment is credited and call back. No call, email, fax, telegram or carrier pigeon has been received. As someone who understands the challenges of having employees with diverse skillsets, I normally would recommend a thorough program of retraining for Junior Joe. However, given the serious nature of this incident threatening legal action against a customer, termination is absolutely justified. In addition, I strongly recommend staying away from online payments at this place because clearly they have issues which border on a scam that they are unwilling to address with their payment processor. Personally, I will just stay away from BJ's altogether and continue to purchase from competent restaurants that appreciate my company's business. The \"F\" rating BJ's has earned with the Better Business Bureau is very well-deserved in my opinion."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.

Overall, I enjoyed my trip to BJ's.  I came for the brew but also tried some food which was solid.  Their beer is surprisingly unique and flavorful for a chain microbrewery.  I had the 4 beer sampler for a little under $7 and also was able to sample other brews because the bartender was gracious.  All of the ales (pale, IPA, DIPA) were nice and a less hoppy variant of the style.  The Porter had a solid chocolate taste and the imperial stout was very smooth for the 8+ ABV.  As far as food, I had a quinoa salad which was not overly memorable, but was good enough for a meal.  

There are 3 BJ's within the Las Vegas area, so wherever you are in town, you are bound to be near one.  If you are looking for a solid, not macro brew, come here.  They also offer very good guest taps and bottles for very reasonable prices ($5-6.50) when it comes to Las Vegas.  The Happy Hour for beer is $1.00 off draft and there are also some food deals.  I recommend you give BJ's a try."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Very disappointed. I love the beer but if you're not spending money with a group then forget it. Come on. If I'm not getting good service being by myself for a quick beer why would I come back with a group or even another person? The second star is for the good tasting beer I had."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple times but the food was really good every time. I have had the pizza and a couple of the sandwiches. All delectable!"}
{"text":"First of all, the floor is so slippery that even wearing hiking boots didn't prevent my boyfriend and me from nearly falling. Later on, I saw a man with a cane completely fall and none of the staff seemed to notice or offer assistance. Even when I mentioned it, none of them cared. I'm betting if they don't close due to lawsuits within a year, they'll be lucky. The food was bland and greasy. My boyfriend tried a burger which was oily from top to bottom- even the lettuce was soggy. I had the chicken club and did not like the garlic bread, which was also soggy upon arrival at the table. The bright spot was the sriracha Brussels sprouts, but again, they were drowning in crema sauce, quite unnecessarily. Everything is overdone and not really worth the effort. Likely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a parmesan chicken sandwich there and it was really good. my bill was average too. service was nice and relatively quick. I'd definitely go again for lunch."}
{"text":"Here is a new one for us..... now an old one for us as I do not have the want to return at least not for what I ordered.....apps.  Were potato skins, i got more of a puff vibe airy and void of flavor as well had alfredo here.   I heard of al dente pasta but not al chewy pasta not a fan of the baked ziti, this dish was full of oil which i am not a fan of, but I can say that the clam chowder in the garlic bowl was a good dish along with the tortilla soup.... so all in all the liquid items which include water were on point ...Nicole our server was very adequate as well on time and personable....."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We live near here so we come here pretty regularly. We like to sit in the bar, we typically get better service if we sit in the bar area.  Food is pretty good for the most part. I think I have only had 1 bad meal here. Chik parm was definitely not very good.  Love the atmosphere. Sign up for BJs rewards and you can get free appetizers and other good stuff."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Ordered delivery from here to try it out and not only did we not get half of our order, but food was cold and gross. My wife called and complained about incomplete order as was told they would send gift card for compensation, well it's been about 2 months and still nothing. Wrote to company and complained and never got a response. Horrible customer service and would not recommend delivery as food was cold and gross upon delivery."}
{"text":"First time here after looking at it for years. Was a great experience, will def be back"}
{"text":"Every single time I go here everyone from the host to the servers remember my name and my drink, and I only go there 2-3 times a month. I usually go during happy hour for their half off mini pizzas which are to die for!! The BBQ chicken cannot be beat, I have 99% of the time. Plus, their pizookie is AMAZING!! I will miss this joint when I move back to Green Valley but they just opened a new in Henderson. GO to this place if you want happy servers/bartenders, awesome music that isn't too loud for conversation, and a huge food selection.

Like most places, it's a madhouse after 6!"}
{"text":"The saving grace of our meal was the mozzarella and tomato salad. Amazing! Unfortunately the entrees were mediocre to bad. We came here for lunch, and I had the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese. Pretty sure the chicken tenders were frozen and not hand breaded. Probably didn't help that my sandwich arrived lukewarm. My wife wasn't overjoyed with her triple decker sandwich either. Like I said, average at best. I would have given 2 stars but for the fact that they brew their own beer, and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Horrible service was waiting for over an hour for them to not have a table for us. We called while shopping they said it was gunna be 5 more minutes so we show up 5 minutes later and they say they don't know how long it's gunna be because they don't have any tables open and they had a bunch of tables open behind them clearly unreserved. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by BJ's for lunch one day, and I'm so glade we did!! The place was packed, but we didn't have to wait too long. The waitresses and managers were very polite. We had several managers check on us throughout our time there. They have a pretty big menu, so it was hard to decide what to order. I opted for the Gourmet Five Meat pizza. It comes with meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. I had them hold the meatballs on mine. When I tell you this pizza was EVERYTHING!!! It was so good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. After I enjoyed my pizza I had a root beer float...it was okay. I cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Something for everyone. Great staff. Awesome environment to watch sports. Have held a few large gatherings for family here and wouldn't go anywhere else.  Always a go to place for out of town visors. Been a coming here for 7 yrs and never get tired of it. Continuously updating the menu with new cuisine. They offer gluten free and vegan fare. Microbews are amazing. Have been to BJ in other states but love this one the best."}
{"text":"Our family went to BJ's restaurant recently,  It was a great experience.  The food was very tasty.  The kid meals food and portion size was also great.  They have a new expanded menu with new offerings and now offer gluten-free buns for their hamburgers.  The waitress was great, but the highlight was when the manager, David, came over to help us with the new BJ's app.  We had trouble logging in  and the manager took the time to help us and then when we still could not log-in, he offered to give our contact information to his tech guru at headquarters.  David was very personable and you could tell by talking to him that he took a lot of pride in his restaurant and was very loyal to the company.

We finished off our meal with a delicious gluten-free pizzookie, which the whole family enjoyed."}
{"text":"First of all, let me just say that my wife and I frequent this restaurant at least 4 to 5 times a week. We know all the managers all the waiters and waitresses except for one manager and of all of those we have a very good relationship with. We've always enjoyed the service and the food and on occasion we might have an order that's not right but no big deal. Tonight was different, I have never been so frustrated as I was tonight. I ordered an Asian salad which they are making it differently now than what they used to. The salad was so wilted I couldn't eat it and I finally just gave up. When the waiter came back to my table I never said anything and I never complained but my friends brought it up and told him that that the salad was so bad that I just couldn't eat it. So the waiter apologized and said that he would go talk to the manager because there was only like maybe one quarter of the salad that have been eaten. It was obvious that there was a problem with the salad. So the manager comes which by the way is one of the managers that I don't know personally, and he gives me this excuse that the reason why the salad looks like that is because the chicken is warm and it makes the salad look like that. But that wasn't the reason why. The chicken wasn't even warm when they brought it to my table for one thing. And then it was obvious that the salad was not wilted  because of the chicken, it was wilted because it was just bad salad. So he apologizes and then he leaves. So my waiter comes back to the table and asked me if the manager had come to the table and asked me if the manager had  spoken to me and I said yes. And he asked me what  he said and I told him that nothing was ever mentioned about not charging me for the food. So he leaves to go find out what he is supposed to do and he is told by the manager that he explained it to me and that was good enough. The waiter felt really bad and was put in a bad position because he knows that we come in there all the time and I could tell that he felt very awkward. So on  the way out I have a few Choice words to say to the manager and he looks at me and says \"What! I was going to give you your money back\" . But that's not the way it was at all. He had a chance and he didn't do it and then all of a sudden he's trying to make it look like he had every intention to give me my money back. Needless to say I was pretty ticked. We have never been treated like that before at that restaurant
And let me just say that our waiter was great.   We could tell that he felt bad about the situation and he even offered to pay for desert but I declined.   It was not his fault. Poor professionalism on the managements part."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, good time at BJ'S. We love going to BJ's. Warning, its a little loud."}
{"text":"Food is nothing to write home about and the service was horrible. With all the great places to eat here in Vegas and Henderson you would think they would be better. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Burger was wayyyy over cooked and dry, fries were also. I'm assuming my food was left to dry out in the window. Wait staff was super forgettable. Only reason I would come back is for their good drink selection. Stick to other locations, You're better than this BJ's."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order 30 minutes early. If you place an online order for curbside pick up and actually show up on time prepare to wait 30 minutes or more. I would suggest ordering and showing up late. Also they allow anyone to park in curbside pick up parking so if you're want a close space and want to eat in go ahead and park there. They will not do anything to you or your car. 

I only eat here when I am given a gift card. Now I'll just pass the card on to a friend or better yet someone I hate so they can get frustrated and pissed at this location. 

It takes A-LOT for me to leave a one star review, but this place has earned it."}
{"text":"Our waiter Aaron was excellent, one of the best waiters I have ever had. The food and beer is good as expected. I recommend this BJ's as it is not too far front the strip and is a nice break from the strip crazy..."}
{"text":"I've came here a couple of times but my last visit was disappointing. We started out with some artichoke dip and it literally looked like someone emptied the bottom of the chip bag onto the plate and stuck some dip next to it. I understand our appetizer was just chip and dip but the way it came out looked sad. My husband got the White pizza and I got the Parmesan crusted chicken. We always get there white pizza and it never disappoints. It's probably one of the few dishes that's always consistent every time we come here. My Parmesan chicken was ok. It came with two large sized chicken with a side or mashed potato and broccoli. I would have liked some more veggies with my dish because they gave me two pieces of broccoli and that was it. The chicken had a good crisp and it would have tasted better over pasta and not as a main dish. Everything from the start was just not great and I left dinner disappointed and regretting that we came here. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had a large group dining here tonight. Service was mediocre. What really went bad was the bill. We had 23 diners and were charged for 31. The manager (Jamie) insisted that we had contracted for 30. That would have been fine--adjust us down to 30 and we are good right? Well, Jamie insisted on accusing our guests that had dined separately on their own checks of potentially eating at the buffet we were paying for. Not only that but she became unbelievably rude. I would avoid this place at all costs. It's located in a center with many restaurants that are happy to have your business. Go to them instead of this BJ's. At least they are named correctly--because this place blows!"}
{"text":"While it is a pain that this place can get really crowded at times, typically it is worth the wait! I have been to this BJs location quite a few times, but had a pretty good experience when I last went here yesterday.
I went with my family kind of early which was nice, because we just beat the rush! We were seated right away, and our server was kind and did a good job. To start off we ordered mozzarella sticks. I can be picky when it comes to my m-sticks, but these ones were incredibly good, was hard not to eat all of them. Didn't come with enough marinara sauce.
One great thing about BJs is the massive menu, there are so many amazing options to choose from, it is hard! On Sunday I was struggling between going for the Avocado Eggrolls (used to order these all the time back in high school) or the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. My mom and I decided we would get both of them and then split them! I hate to say it, but the Avocado Eggrolls just were not near as good as I had remembered them. They were kinda too cream cheese-y and spicy. They were ok, just not great. The flatbread on the other hand was incredible! I think I may have tried it once before about a year ago, but it was so delicious. Wish I had only ordered that! 
For dessert we had to finish off with a pizookie..it is a BJs must! We just got a regular one. My only problem was that the cookie was all stuck to the pan! Had to kind of scrape it out. We destroyed it though, it was incredible. 
Nice, fun restaurant to go to, I will be back for that flatbread and to try other stuff, have never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"The sriracha queso dip was pretty good. The barbeque bison burger and the black and bleu house burger were both great. The Oktoberfest was ok, but i prefer the pirhana pale ale. Overall the food was good. 

The service could be better. The starter was brought out at the same time as the burgers and, and felt a little rushed.

-2nd-
The Peruvian quinoa bowl with chicken was light and very flavorful (the tomatoes were great), it was very good.  The grilled chicken alfredo wasnt bad either.  The boneless wings was kinda dry, and it was more batter then chicken.  The triple chocolate pizookie was action packed with choclate, and choosing vanilla ice cream helped balance it out.

The Jeremiah Red and Piranha Pale Ale the two that don't  disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a Anniversary lunch because we haven't been in a while.
Service was great food awesome as always and downloaded their mobile app.
Pay with Apple Pay on your phone check your rewards and reserve a seat on your way to the restaurant !! Now that's cool!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Over hyped and overpriced. With all the food options available in the Montrose area this is not one that I will probably return to. I have given it a fair shot visiting 3 different times and had 3 different meals. While all the meals were palatable, the value just is not there. $14.50 for a flat bread pizza is ridiculous, and $12.50 for a burger and fries is also on the high side. Two out of the three times service has been sub par. Next time I want mediocre service and over priced food I will stop sooner and hit up Chili's"}
{"text":"If you want below average this is the place to go. I do not think I'm being overly critical of this place because this has happened a good amount of times since I have been there. Long wait times and mediocre management  have more or less guaranteed me never returning."}
{"text":"It was late but we were looking for a place to eat.  It was 30 minutes to closing and they readily welcomed us in.  The food was good, we loved the dessert!  Service was great!!  I loved the ambiance...we will go back again!!"}
{"text":"pretty ah-ite place for american grub. bj's is never my first choice, but when friends want to go i'm down. 

i've had the pizzas, pastas, and pretty much everything pan asian and they are all do-able, but i never finished a meal and looked forward to my next visit. 

sorry bj lovers, i more of a cheese fac. fan!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! I can't complain about any of it. My son, who may be the world's pickiest eater, loves the kids chicken fingers and smiley face fries. He even asked to go to dinner here... that is HUGE! Again everything we have eaten has been so good! However.....
Slooooooooooow service. A couple of times coming here it has been slow, even the San Diego location has super slow service too. Ugh! When you dine with little kids, like us, slow service is the worst. Will we keep going back? Yes... but if we keep experiencing the slow service we will bring it to a managers attention."}
{"text":"Frequently my boyfriend and I come to BJs, I'd say 3 times a month or so. When we walked in on a Friday night it was packed and we were very nervous about getting in soon. Sebastian came right up to us, recognized my boyfriend, and seated is right then and there! He had amazing service and such a friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all... I've been here multiple times because I wanted to like it but I just can't, food is horrible especially the pizza and never once has my order been correct... I'm finished with this place."}
{"text":"First time there for birthday party. It was fun and busy!  We had a group of 11 and they fit us in the middle of the dining room. There are tvs with sports on all over which is great!! Our server was Tony and he was awesome!  Ask for him. He will take care of you. He was attentive and personable. 

The menu was stacked with different types of food. The prices were reasonable. We had the chicken Pesto Pizza. Delicious!  Others had different things off the menu and everyone raved. 

Parking is hard to find but that's because this place is amazing. The secrets out. 

Enjoy! And remember as for Tony's section!"}
{"text":"Great All American Food.  I am a fan of the pizza, the pizookie dessert, and the chicken dishes.  Very tasty"}
{"text":"BJs has really gone downhill. I ordered a chicken salad which included a cold grilled chicken breast, which seemed to have been refrigerated. Service is not what it used to be, we boxed up our own to go food. In the past our servers have always boxed up our food. The waitress was not famaliar with their drink menu and the drinks were not good. My husband ordered a \"drink like that' and it was not made lime it used to be.  Our check came to us wrong and had to be corrected.  BJs used to be one of my favorite places however the food and service are not what I remembered."}
{"text":"I don't know how typical my comments will be and I've only had one delivery order from this place so I might not be a good example, all I can say is my delivery was 42 minutes late and the food - supposed to be shrimp scampi - was just plain lousy. This is like blue collar style cuisine for people who drink and smoke a lot and have no taste buds - in other words, typical Pittsburgh food. Also it was more like very cheap fast food lo mein than anything remotely Italian."}
{"text":"Well, the place has been open for nearly 2 years now and we've never tried it so we thought we would give it a go. The parking lot is usually full so it had me thinking they are doing something right.

Anyways we get seated and take a look at the menu, we selected our choices and drinks. We were asked, \"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?\" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes, I realize this isn't a Mexican restaurant), so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you, I get home and take a look at the receipt, well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn't suggested as an appetizer, it was suggested as if was \"Would you like a glass of water?\" They didn't say, \"Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah..\" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint, she actually giggled at me!! She tried to make good and asked who my server was, but I said that I didn't blame the server I blame management for trying to \"up sell\" in a round about way. The \"manager\" then tried to make good and take if off my bill, I just said, \"I don't care about the $5.50, I am concerned about the way it got on to my bill in the first place\". What a unprofessional way to respond to a customer concern!

Pros:
Food wasn't horrible, but nothing outstanding about it.

Cons:
My 1/2 pound burger was kind of skimpy and makes me wonder what weighs 1/2 pounds? The entire burger weight? Also my burger patty  was crumbly and was in 3 sections, all holding together for the most part but in sections. The french fries? I really dislike this micro threads of shoestring potatos. 

Wife had Fettucini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken breast was sliced thin and was very very tiny, looked like 1/3 of a breast cut up as a garnish. The pasta was good, but the noodles had  what seemed to be heat lamp dryness to it. It was probably sitting and waiting to be presented together with my cooking hamburger. The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent, but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again.

Overall we won't be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about. My local neighborhood bars like Timbers or PTs can do better."}
{"text":"a great place...

quality of food?   excellent!

service?  fantastic!!

cleanliness:  superb!!!"}
{"text":"This is the 1st time we've been to BJ's & we've lived in AZ always.  It was a pleasant surprise when we walked in & saw the decorating of the interior; loved the dark woods & the industrial feel of the ceiling; it was warm & inviting & felt like an Old World theme.  The food we ordered was very tasty; no complaints.  We had Rachel as our server; she was very pleasant & professional & helped me with choosing the right kind of beer!  The hostess was very sweet & seated us quickly.  I've read some of the other reviews before we went & was rather taken back by customers indicating the food was ok or the service was not good!  We had no problem & plan on going back once more to make sure & if we get the service we did this evening & the quality of the food we had this evening, we will bring back our friends to enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The place is clean, the service is good, and the food is good quality. The ambience, food quality, and beer selection is a step up from a PT's or similar chain bar. Overall, it is unremarkable, not bad, but not great. I go here because they have fresh bread bowls for their soups and their mozzarella salad is one of my favorites. I would never come here to celebrate an event, as it basically feels like an upscale local bar. I like imperial stouts or similar dark beers, and they don't have a wide selection of dark beers and the ones they have are not my favorite. If you like light beers, wheat beers, and hoppy beers you will find many options. Don't go out of your way, but if you are limited on options, this wouldn't be a bad voice."}
{"text":"We went to the Centennial location to celebrate a birthday.  There were 18 of us, and we called ahead to reserve a table and to give our servers amble opportunity to prepare.  The food was great, but it arrived at different times, so we didn't eat at the same time.  We would order drinks, and it would take a half hour to receive them. We asked that the tickets be separated when we ordered (each family sat together). They weren't, and although we said it was fine, that we could figure it out, our server insisted on separating them.  It took her over 40 mins to fix them.  She had to redo them 3 times!! The manager tried to make amends, as three of our orders were wrong (we got those free), but he shouldn't have had to.  If I were him, I would have a training class to show how to wait on large groups. I'm sure we'll go back, but never with a large group as we were there a total of 4 hours!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and specials! The manager John is awesome, he immediately noticed an issue with my dish right as when the server dropped my entree off and he went out of his way to bring me a new piece of fish without even asking. Highly recommend this place! It was by far a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"If I were able to, I would rate it 3.5 stars.  I thought it was a little better than okay but not great.  Our server didn't start off well as when our hostess was seating us, I overheard her say \"you better find someone else to take these tables cause I'm not doing it\".  That didn't exactly start if off right for us.  I was a party of 6 with my family so I was a little surprised to hear that on a Tuesday night that wasn't packed.  I would have thought this would be welcomed, but I guess I was wrong.

Anyhow, the food was okay.  We got garlic parm wings to start and they weren't amazing.  I have had some that were amazing and these were okay.  The flavor was a little lacking but all in all okay.  Each of us got the hickory brisket burger.  I thought it was again average.  It sounded awesome on the menu, but the bbq flavor I tasted was more from the sauce than the brisket.  Again, a little better than average.

So basically my experience was okay.  I would go back to see if it was more about our server rather than the total experience but also would like to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I've always liked BJ's brewery. They have great food selection at a reasonable price. Today I enjoyed a salmon and broccoli lunch very tasty very healthy. I also like the fact that they offer many gluten free options even their desserts come in gluten-free options. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to write an update solely because of the one sandwich on their menu, the hand-pulled turkey dip.  This is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  I have always been a big fan of regular French dip sandwiches, but never came across the turkey version of one until bjs.  The turkey is incredibly tender and the onions and horseradish blend perfectly together for an incredible flavor.  On top of the great ingredients, they use a great bun which holds up to the ingredients, as well as the dipping into the turkey au jus."}
{"text":"I came after watching a movie at downtown summerlin and they were so kind and our waitress let us try beer to see if we like it. Service and food is fantastic. Thank you so much"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at BJ's so I didn't know what to expect. A client took me to eat here with her family and we were on a time crunch, but the service was fast and the food was great. This location is far from me, but if I happen to find one closer, I might try out the rest of their menu! 

Sorry this one is short & sweet. :P"}
{"text":"I've never had bad service here, I've waited sometimes longer than usual, but they always take care of me. They've also never messed up my order, and constantly ask for refills, bringing any condiments and whatnot, and service is usually great! I love the food as well, whether it's their deep dish pizzas, sandwiches, or their incredible pazookies! I love this place, and I've only been to this location, so to me, it's a hit! Probably going back today!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual. SLOW service. The one bar waitress to all the tables is ridiculous. They have other servers for the resuraunt portions just standing around watching as the one bar area server runs around like crazy. Management should step in and get that girl some help and not let her get overwhelmed and customers become irritated at the lack of service. Our waitress still did an ok job for all the tables she had to handle. Poor management though."}
{"text":"This is an update to my original review. The last time we went to this location, we bellied up to the bar at the front instead of getting a table. You can eat your dinner up there too, which is convenient. The bartender doubles as your server. We went there on a Friday night, and while the restaurant behind us was busy, the bartender was amazing. She was very attentive and quick, and the drinks were perfect. Unless you're in a party of 3 or more, I'd definitely recommend sitting up at the bar!"}
{"text":"The last few times I've come, its been nothing but good. Today I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken and I was very much pleased.  Looking for something healthy this is a good choice.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Juicy and not dried.  And the barbacoa-spiced flavor was just ... mmmm.... good.  Chicken was tooped with the fire roasted tomato salsa which complemented well with the chicken and brown rice.   I couldn't stop raving on how good this chicken was.  I omitted the black beans.  The brown rice was topped with feta cheese, cilantro, and crema.  I honestly didn't care for the crema.  But other than that, awesome.  If I could make my chicken like this everyday, I could eat this everyday.  

Staff is friendly and service was great.  In the past I've tried their lunch Spaghetti with meatballs and that too was really good.  Although the menu is big with a variety of choices (which I hate only because there is sooooo much good stuff to choose from), everything so far has been delish and this is definitly a place to go too for your picky eaters in your group."}
{"text":"The fresh Atlantic salmon was great! Came with rice asparagus. The server was good and the place is clean. Not a huge fan of the parking area though but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Although I ordered \"to go\", it's apparent that this restaurant is very easy on the eyes inside. Looks like a great date-night type brewery. As for the food, it was a tasty burger; thick and juicy. Perfect-o. The service was as snappy as they were friendly, and they hook up the military and vets with freebies on Veterans Day, which earns them a star as well. Thank you BJs."}
{"text":"We love this place! We go there so much we have favorite waiter and waitress. We love Nate and Taylor (the student). They are so good. We love the food the people. It's so nice!"}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner with the monkeys and friend. BJ's has always been a random craving of mine...when its met...I don't need it again for quite sometime. This was one of those nights that I needed it and might have traded my kids for it (just maybe).

We roll in and there was a small wait...no biggie. I situate the kids with their DVD players and my friend grabs two beers from the bar (I had girly cider...I thought I was ordering their homemade berry beer...I guess they don't make it anymore...bummer) and my friend got some sort of IPA...quite good. BZZZZZ...our pager goes off (much to the delight of my kids) and my daughter rips it out of my hand to give it to the hostess (she's a tenacious little bugger).

We were sat at a lovely booth (perfect for kids) and decided to get the Ahi Poke to start. It was yummy with wonton chips that kind of reminded me of Sun Chips, big chunks of yellowfin tuna, avocado, cabbage and vinaigrette. All of it was good except for the avocado which could have been a bit more ripe but it was certainly edible.

The pizza was next and it was good but it didn't knock my socks off (pepperoni, mushroom, extra cheese and sausage). The stewed tomatoes were excellent but the crust was a bit gooey-er than I remember....nothing a side of ranch couldn't fix. I downed two pieces (no one could ever accuse me of having an eating disorder).

Lastly, we were all full but we couldn't leave without trying one of their famous Pizzoki and Creme. They have expanded their pazzoki selection and now offer a trio so you can sample more of what they have to offer. We went for the chocolate chip, Oreo and oatmeal raisin. Holy cow was that tasty. My son very much liked the chocolate chip and Oreo however my daughter just went for the ice cream. 

All in all I was a very happy camper. The service is fine but nothing to write home about. Will be back when the next craving hits or maybe sooner because they have a gluten-free pizza that my mom can enjoy as well."}
{"text":"I used to love BJ's. I went all the time when I was in high school and college, and when I met up with friends for dinner I was actually really excited they picked BJ's. But it wasn't how I remembered. They have changed their menu around so much a lot of my favorites are not there any more. There is still a great beer list which is awesome, and their appetizers were okay, but I was not impressed with my entree. Maybe I haven't been back in so long that the Parmesan crusted chicken is not a specialty anymore but it was just okay. 
Our pazookies were really good as always, but I think next time I'll just sit at the bar and have a beer and dessert."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to a BJs since there's just so many places for a late dinner in Las Vegas.

First, Krystle, our server, was fantastic. She knew her stuff.  As my husband was choosing his \"Pick 4\" beers (@$6.95 great deal), she could tell what kind of beers he liked and gave him some suggestions. He ended up changing two to try something new. And he was happy he did.

Because it has been a while since we've been to BJ's, asked our server what she would recommend as I wanted more of a dip. We went with her suggestion of the Pork chili verde Queso dip, and we were happy we did.

Dinner was good. My husband with with a rack of ribs, while I went with the shrimp and asparagus penne. However, because I'm more of a noodle person, our server was okay with me changing penne to spaghetti noodle.

And of course, we had dessert. Pizookie! With the amount of options, she suggested that we do a half-and-half. I choose the white chocolate macadamia nut while my husband choose Peanut Butter. Next time, we'll try not to fill up so much and go with the Pizookie Trio instead.

And lastly, be sure you get that \"$10 off $35\" deal. It ends on 4/6/2016."}
{"text":"My son and I just arrived in town to visit family...daughter and grandsons. Went to BJs for an early dinner. I did not receive my dinner as ordered, strike one. My daughter tells me that this happens to her meals everytime they go to BJs. My dinner comes back,the sauce was left off and minimal veggies are served, strike 2! Grandsons order a dessert each, the pizookie came before the rootbeer float. The pizookie was completely cooled and consumed and I had to ask about the float before it was served, STRIKE 3 and you are out. So would I go back to this BJs...not too sure about that..."}
{"text":"This is truly a five-star restaurant, as another person said their menu is packed, I cannot imagine them making anything bad in less it just was a bad day. My wife goes there often with her friend, for lunch and her friend goes there quite often with another friend, this would be my first time awesome great seating great service great food, priced Eddie awesome price, this restaurant has their act together in the quality of the food the portions the service and the atmosphere.. note their desserts are so good I got one to go and I had to eat it there before I left - how good it looked.."}
{"text":"Went there only once so far and we had a very good lunch. Prices aren't bad and the food and service was very good. Wanted to try the hard cider but didn't want to get a glass full, so the server brought me a sample, (Ugh!) Not for me. Ill just stay with the cold beer, Thank you. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The fact that I'm here all the time makes it a shame that I had it at four stars. This is my favorite place to be. The food and the beer are always great. All the bartenders are awesome. They're personable, engaging, and don't make you wait for a beer. 

My tastes have changed in that I pretty much always get the barbacoa chicken, double chicken, now. The seasonal beers always keep the selection fresh. Sweet sin chocolate ale?! This place is amazing to me."}
{"text":"Always a must stop when in town.  Menu variety is excellent and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Strawberry blonde is all I gotta say! Bartender offered this and man!!! I'm still dreaming of this drink! The name says it all, a hint of strawberry flavor. Not sweet just the perfect mixture of flavor to make you want to have one after another... 
I also had the North Beach Mahi Mahi!! 
This plate was delicious, the shrimp was cooked just right. The flavors all together are simply delightful! The Kalamata olives, tomatoes, and onions;all on some couscous. It kinda reminded me of a soup since it has lots of juice.
 I usually don't finish my food wherever I go, but this I finished it and was very tempted to lick the plate!"}
{"text":"Noisy and crowded on a Saturday night but our party of 6 got seated quickly. Service was slow. Of the six meals ordered only one was unsatisfactory. The turkey burger did not have enough patty to fill half the bun. However the Mediterranean Chicken Taco Pita was wonderful."}
{"text":"I've had nothing to complain about in previous visits to BJs but nothing to write home about either. But today we decided on BJs for my fiancé's birthday dinner. We walked in and the resaurant was pretty busy and we were seated promptly. When seated, we waited like 15 minutes for a hostess or someone for drinks and no one came. 
I finally waived down a waitress and asked about our waitress and soon after that we were greeted by Holly Turns our the hostess forgot to tell Holly that she seated a large party out of her section, so it was definitely not her fault. This woman was just the best. She totally did her best to make up for the mistake of another person. She was fast, on point, and kind as could be. 
She then gave us our appetizers for free. I love when people know more than just basic customer service and know how to make a negative situation positive. 
As for the food, I think of BJ's as one of those reliable chains where you know you'll get good food. Kind of like Cheesecake. I got the jalapeño burger and it was good, but not anything I would praise about. 
Whoever is reading this from BJs, please give her a pat on the back. Thanks again Holly!"}
{"text":"Went in last night with a party of 18. Donna and Courtney are amazing. Thank you for being so accommodating. Was a great experience."}
{"text":"First impression as we walked in, the staff was is rude, no where to sit and wait unless you want to wait in the weather elements if these room during rush hours. The allow customers to bring dogs in (not a service dog)"}
{"text":"Had the unlimited soup and salad which was awesome! I could only make it through 3 salads and 3 soups. Best being the tomato mozzarella salad and the tortilla soup. I was a bit disappointed they were out of their home made root beer!!"}
{"text":"I think it just depends on the staff you get. I look around and some waiters seem to be entertaining their guests but the few times I've been here I've had total duds for waiters. 
Let's start from getting seating. I have an app that takes up precious space on my phone. However, I don't really know what signing in on the apps gets you. One time I signed in and the app said wait time 45 minutes. So in 30 minutes we left and came in only to be greater with okay so it looks like it will be an hour and twenty minutes. We promptly left. The next time we used it the wait time was correct however people who got there and put their name in were seated before us so I have to question what the app really gives you.

Next the menu/food. Though the menu is large, half of it is booze- pricey booze. 6 bucks for a beer- no thanks. We ordered an app at 10 bucks a pop the most recent time, after waiting 40 minutes, yes after 40 minutes our waiter finally came over and we got to ask where our app was. He was surprised that it wasn't there so we just cancelled it. I guess the one good thing is they text you when your table is ready so you know how gruelingly long you've been waiting for to eat minus the time it took to order. The food that did come out was alright not great. We've had the burgers, the pizza, salads and the veggie burgers. 

We would probably recommend the burger 1st but gee doesn't Akron have enough burger places already?"}
{"text":"I am a fan of BJ's  for many reasons. First it  is nice to have  an urban  hip brewhouse in the northwest, so it is a great location. Two, I love the menu, it is  very well rounded and appeals  to carnivores, vegetarians,  seafood lovers,  small plate eaters, light plates and gluten free like me! Beer lovers will love the vast choice of on tap beers! Three, they have a great Happy Hour and rewards offers that makes it affordable, and even without  your meal will not  cost you a kidney.

Last night  I met a friend at 6pm and the parking lot was full and there were 20 people outside holding the BJ  your  table is ready box. We decided to eat in the bar and found two places. We were greeted quickly and given menus and  checked on right away to see if we wanted to order a drink. Excellent customer service for a bar and restaurant that was busy! Kim was our bartender and  she continued to take care of us for the rest if the night making sure everything went well. She suggested the Happy Hour menu items when she noticed what we ordered!  When our food arrived it was delivered by a server and she arrived promptly to offer extra fixings etc...  She has a following and  took care of  her regulars remembering their preferences! Great service!

I tried the gluten free pizza and it was really good. I believe it was made from a rice flour and  not the corn crust that tends to taste like cardboard. I ordered the sausage and  mushroom and it was quite flavorful. It did not have enough sauce and next time I will  request  extra sauce.  My friend ordered the  avocado rolls and  said they were really good,  the right amount of spice, they were crispy on the outside, and were cooked to order. It was very busy and I was surprised that our food arrived no more than 20 minutes later! 

I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"BJ's has a very large menu, too large I think. When you have large chain restaurants with huge menu's you already know that they are trying to cater to the masses rather than producing a really quality specialty item. For the most part I was pleased with my order. I went with the Creole Tilapia, which is on their under 575 calorie menu. I considered the Chicken A La Fresca but the waiter advised me that it wasn't that great. I was very appreciative of his insight and honesty. The beer they serve was pretty good as well. On tap they have everything from a light beer to a nutty oatmeal stout. If you aren't sure what you're in the mood for then BJ's is a good place to go as they have descent food and tons of it."}
{"text":"This was the 4th time we've been to BJ's and this place continues to disappoint.  Previous visits have been passable or just so-so.  Tonight can only be called terrible.  

Here's why...

First, there is an exceedingly long wait just to get seated.  Tonight took about an hour and a half and using their app to get a place in line is useless.  The BJ's app only puts your name on a list at the door but does not secure a spot in the queue as does restaurant's that use the NoWait app.

The long wait might be understandable if BJ's was a unique place to go but it's not.  There are several craft brew places that serve food around the South Hills with new ones opening all the time.  There are a lot of choices available out here offering the same repertoire of food and drink.

Secondly, the time it takes to get your food after ordering is ridiculously long.  Our order wasn't complicated.  We didn't order appetizers or adult beverages, only the entrees.  It took approximately 45 minutes to get an order of Fish Tacos and Fish and Chips.  The waiter was apologetic about the delay and sent the manager to the table.  We hadn't complained about the wait but the waiter realized it was excessive.  Maybe chewing the ice cubes from our drinks while tapping our fingers on the table was a clue?

When our food did arrive, it was lukewarm at best.  The wilted lettuce garnish leads me to believe it had sat under a warming lamp for a while.  I was highly unimpressed.  To make up for the delay in getting served, we were offered a comp dessert, their \"Pizookie.\"  We weren't expecting that and thanked them.  

And we started waiting AGAIN!

Finally, after waiting another 15 minutes for the \"Pizookies\" to arrive, and they never did, we got up and left.  I don't get how it takes that long to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie.  I guess I'll never find anything out.

Thankfully, we could pay the check electronically.  I would not have wanted to see how long it took to get our bill but I'm sure that is the one thing you'll get quickly.

So with the long delays in getting your food, it's no wonder why it takes so long just to get seated.  These delays essentially blew the rest of the evening as we were there much longer than we could have imagined for what was \"bar food\" where the quality is concerned.  

We won't be going back and if you are on a schedule, as going to dinner and a movie, go somewhere else or you'll be really late..."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not great, but it's kind of like bar food, so you can't expect much. The service was great, until the bill came out. He said he would be back for our change and never came back. Okay, then he came back and said he will be right back. Great! I waited another 10 min as everyone else is getting their checks and leaving. By this time we have waited about 30 minutes total for our change. I would have given him all of our change, but it was the principal, knowing the change exceeds the 20% and expecting more than that. So, we asked if we can get our change back. He says, oh, you wanted your change back?He was a bit surprised. Not sure why he was surprised when he said, he would be back for our change. When he came back  to give us our change, he didn't give us all of it back. I still left him 20% tip, but I was bit irritated that I had to ask for the change back and not get all of it back. Hence the 2 stars for trying to take my money."}
{"text":"Ok first off I just want to say FINALLY!!!! I've been waiting 2 yrs for BJ's Brewery to move here. I'm from California where they are in every major city and man oh man have I've missed you guys!!! All I can say is yummy food, yummy beer And ahhhh yes Pazookie!!!!!!!!!! You have to try this place they are Amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BJ's is a very consistent restaurant. I have been them all over the West Coast and they all taste great. It is a great place for beer lover's because they brew their own brew, that's actually pretty good unlike some brewery's. For the underage or non-beer drinkers they also have draft root beer which is absolutely amazing.  There specializes are massive potatoes and pizza. To be honest the pizza is good but not great. It is suppose to be Chicago style deep dish but comes up short for true Chi-town pizza lovers. The potatoes, which are there own meals, are unlike anything I've ever had. They are very filling and very good. My favorite is the Blackened Chicken which comes with a potatoes, spiced chicken, cheese, red peppers, and Alfredo sauce to dip your bites in.  Also the sandwiches are great. The French Dip and BBQ Beef is highly recommended. If you have room for dessert, the freshly made cookie and ice cream called poozkie is great.

A little secret is about BJ's is that all of the lunch specials that are said to be over at 4, are always available if you ask. The best is the half potato and soup/salad. I recommend the calm chowder, it is a hefty portion that can be a meal in itself."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great experience our server Jillian was very friendly, prompt and attentive to our needs. The menu has a great variety of choices at reasonable prices. The decor is very modern and clean. The food was served promptly and hot. 
This is a must try restaurant the desserts are fantastic and you must try the home brewed soft drinks if spirits are not consumed."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for dinner and had a bad experience all around. 

First, we waited a long long time (about 15 minutes) for the waiter. We had to go ask another waiter. 
When we finally order our burgers, the food take for ever to come to our table. 

It was almost like a nightmare. So, I asked for my burger medium cooked, right?, well they didn't just over cooked it, they burned it, it testad like charcoal. We didn't complain, we just are not coming back. why, there ara a lot of good options in Summerlin area.

By the way, the restaurante was not busy at all."}
{"text":"BJs, for a chain, is quite good. This location is at the Chandler Mall, so it can get busy during peak dining and shopping hours. As a local brewery, they have a huge bar, and you can see the brewery tanks  in the restaurant as you eat. 

The waiter was friendly and patient with us, as we took awhile to decide on our entrees. He was attentive during the meal.

The pub/bar food is actually good, unlike some breweries that have great beer but only mediocre food. I had the double burger loaded with onions, cheese, a house made bun, and a side of onion strings. They cooked the burger medium as requested, and it was well seasoned with the proper amount of juiciness. The onion strings were amazing!

For dessert, their chocolate chip pizookie is the best. A soft baked 6-7 inch deep dish cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream."}
{"text":"Food here is ok. I can typically get in and out quickly.  The servers are always pleasant.  The food is priced higher than the taste but that happens to often these days."}
{"text":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is what I'm sure most of us have come to expect from one of these chain-type American brew houses; good, not great. If it were up to me, I would change the name to BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant since the beers are definitely the stars of the show. 

I went on a Sunday evening with my girlfriend and was later joined by a mutual friend. We sat at the bar, had a couple of beers (their house IPA is really good) and dinner. The menu is too much. I chuckled to myself when the bartender said something to the effect of \"there's 120 different items on the menu, so we have something for everyone.\" While I'm sure he's just towing the company line, we all know better. A large menu doesn't typically translate into great food. BJ's was no exception. 

On the off chance that I was mistaken, however, I ordered the roasted shrimp Peruvian quinoa bowl. Trust me, I've been around the proverbial block a time or two, so I know better than to try to make a place something that it isn't, but I just had to see what would be served. In all honesty, it wasn't the worst \"entree\" that I've eaten in one of these types of places. The bowl came out with about a dozen shrimp piled on a bed of sauteed spinach, tomatoes and quinoa. While the dish had way too much lemon juice (or something?), and I'm sure the shrimp were frozen, and certainly overcooked, it really wasn't all that bad all things considered. I wasn't expecting a Michelin star dish or anything. 

The service was friendly, the bartender attentive, and the vibe of the place was pretty good. It's a bit out of the way for me, so I don't expect to be back at time too soon, but with that said, I would return, have a beer and maybe an appetizer or two. As for the rest of the menu, it's nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Customer service was fantastic. Food on par with most solid chain restaurants. (I had the baked ziti) It is all about the Pizookie, and this BJ's executes it as well as the others. Encountered a 15 minute wait at 4:30pm on a Sunday, so be prepared. This location appears to be pretty popular."}
{"text":"Parking is really bad... we ordered the speing rolls for app they were warm to cold....Deep Dish Pizza was dry and did not look like the picture in the menu....Beer was average...pizookie by the time we got it the Ice Cream was melted....was curious to see the place..... was just average inside kind of tight... Service was good got our food pretty quickly....never offered another water and waitress never asked how was everything"}
{"text":"Food was ok this time , service was alittle slow being not busy. Everyone was nice though."}
{"text":"Bruh. This place is awful. We made reservations and still waited a half hour. When we sat down the waiter was friendly and took our drink orders. 15 minutes later, he showed up with HALF of our table's order. (We had 4 people) so we told him and he said he would have them \"right away!\" 15 more minutes later, he shows up with the remaining two drinks and then takes our orders. I ordered some bacon guacamole burger and asked that they do not include the jalapeños. My beer tasted like someone had diluted it with water and my friends drink didn't even have the alcohol in it. Our food arrived 40 minutes after we ordered. My burger wasn't that great and it had the damn jalapeños on it. When we went to pay for our meal, we paid cash and the server never brought us back our change ASSUMING the remainder of the cash was his tip (which was the plan but it was rude to take ALL of it.) we won't be back. This place reminded me of why we don't eat at chains."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, decent all american food, 3rd time at this location, always crowded, no complaints."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience because Tate was a great server!  We sat at the same time as other people did, but that did not change Tate's great attitude!  He did a really good job making us feel we were important and took care of our order as fast as possible.  The food is always good at BJ's and we really like the beer selections!  We usually sit in the bar area since we can get seating right away, but if we need to, we use the app to have our name in ahead of time.  We don't mind waiting a little - we just take advantage of trying out the beer!"}
{"text":"my bf and I decided to stop in after visiting Whole Foods. He suggested grabbing some prepared food from there for dinner. I declined and said I'd rather go to a real place to eat lol. (no hate though.) 

I called to reserve but couldn't reach them. I also tried the Open Table and No Wait app with no luck. Finalllllly I went online and noticed you could reserve a spot from online IFFFF you signed up for rewards program. (all of this just to reserve a spot lol) The website gives you no est. time so we eventually went there. They had no info of us even reserving a spot. lol what a fail. The wait was an hour, so we headed over to South Hills Village to shop & browse while we waited.

we decided on drinks and apps. I went with the avocado eggrolls. They were fabulous! Gosh I wish I had their recipe. My bf went with wings. You get 10 wings for about $10.50. not the best deal but whatever. You can also choose boneless (1lb for same price). We went with the buffalo sauce. The wings were excellent. 

Since I signed up online for rewards program, I was given a free pizookie, which is a dessert such as cookie, brownie or monkey bread in a dish with ice cream. I went with monkey bread and it was delicious. 

For drinks, we went with a mojito. It was very fresh and tasted great. Our server was Chelsea and she did an ok job.

The atmosphere was cool and food was good. We will be back for sure.. maybe even the North Hills location (McCandless Crossing)

Their rewards program gives you 1 point for every dollar spent (before taxes and tip of course). For signing up you get a free pizookie. At 75 pts you get $5 off food and eventually prizes are $10 and $25 off of food. If you plan on eating here more than once, might as well sign up for rewards. 

I hope they find a better way to make reservations such as someone answering the phone, no wait app, open table app ect. I know BJ's has their own app, but aint nobody got time for another app on their phone lol"}
{"text":"Love this place, always busy, if u wanna come eat at night you should come early because you wont find parking anywhere. I ordered the grilled chicken pasta it was very tasty. It came with pasta, grilled chicken, with breadsticks, so good. Always love coming to this place, especially with friends. They also brew their own beer. Better leave some space for the pizookie. They have different ice cream flavors, with baked cookie topped with ice-cream and cherry on top."}
{"text":"I have been to several other BJ Brewery around the country and they all mainly behave like typical chain restaurant where the servers don't care and food is horribly prepared.  This restaurant is different. The servers are friendly and professional. Food is not too salty or greasy. I recommend this restaurant because they care that customers are happy. They show that they want customers to return."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and our experience in the restaurant has been great - great service, great food, and their beers are pretty good. However, experience in the bar was another story. We were sitting at the bar for 15 minutes without being served, while several other people who came in after us got served before us."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of BJ's restaurant and usually enjoy coming here. However this recent visit, the food quality was not up to par. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad and the fish was chewy and seemed to taste a bit old. A fellow family member ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and the meatballs ended up being burnt but the garlic knots were undercooked. I've never had an issue with food here before, so I'm wondering what happened this visit. Our server was wonderful and so helpful however and the manager also spoke to us about the food issues and resolved them."}
{"text":"Great place to get a brew and a burger the seating wasn't the best  but the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"We've been here again 2 nights ago and I must say, it's every time a really good experience. I tried a dish I didn't had before, the Parmesan crusted Chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes. It was so good! My daughter tried a different wings marinade, the Parmesan garlic and it was just the bomb. I wish the waiter had name tags, so we can better leave review about them, because there are some runners and they somehow do an amazing job, but never have the chance to be mentioned due of no name tag. So every single time we've been there, there is a young guy, Black hair, very nice, seam to be a runner and does an out of this world job."}
{"text":"I love BJ's Restaurant and their many variety menu and beer list. They are alway shaking with the newest brew flavored developed in their chandler brewery.  Happy hour is extended till 7 pm most days

I love the cherry chipotle salmon. I have had their salads and pizza as well. Their burgers are beyond amazing. They have shoestring fries that are sooooo good

Finish off the meal with a poozkie-cookie in a skillet with ice cream. They make a donation to charity each time you buy one regardless of the time of year 

You cannot go wrong with a great meal for lunch or dinner here"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this chain & we were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere & the menu selection. We were happy with the flavor of the hand crafted cream soda & impressed that it was served in chilled mugs (like A&W used to do before all the ones near us went out of business). We arrived for lunch around 2pm on a Friday afternoon & it was not too busy but also not empty. 
We noticed the prices were surprisingly less expensive than Applebee's (all you can eat soup & salad for $7.95 compared to Applebees which is $9.99 & we had a bad experience at the Gilbert & Baseline location recently & don't plan on returning there) so that was a good sign. As an appetizer we ordered the queso & white corn chips. There was a choice between chili & pork, we chose chili to compare it with Chili's. We enjoyed it more than any other queso we have tried (& we have tried a lot) the problem was there weren't enough chips & I didn't detect a hint of salt on the chips at all. Since there weren't enough chips & no one came to check on us we didn't get to finish the queso as we would have liked because it was good & we were hungry. For lunch my daughters shared: Deep Dish Ravioli (Creamy cheese?filled ravioli, Italian sausage and pepperoni, layered with BJ's signature five cheese blend, Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. Topped with fresh chopped basil.) which also was served with a garlic knot. When the waitress heard they were sharing she asked if they would like an extra one but they don't eat much so we declined. The waitress was thoughtful enough to bring an extra plate as well. My husband ordered rootbeer wings which were served with celery & ranch. I ordered the BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter (A pulled pork slider and a Jallelujah?spiced chicken breast, crispy?thin or wedge?cut seasoned fries, BJ's signature coleslaw garnish and BJ's Jeremiah Red® Ale BBQ sauce.) The chicken was well cooked & moist but was served on top of the fries which made them a bit soggy. For $7.95 I thought it was a good price for that much food. We then ordered a salted caramel pizookie with 4 spoons. We waited quite a while for the dessert to be delivered & in that time we had dirty dishes piled on the table in front of us which no one came to remove. Finally my husband took it upon himself to move them to a nearby table AFTER the dessert was served to us & we were having trouble reaching it in the center of the table because of the other plates littering the table (which should have been removed long ago, or at least by the person who served the dessert). Our bill came to $61 which includes 3 entrees, appetizer & dessert plus 4 hand crafted sodas which I find very reasonable. We also signed up for the Rewards Club but I don't much about it yet other than you get 1 point for each dollar you spend. 
We definitely plan on going back to try out more menu items & we are hoping the service will be more prompt the next time."}
{"text":"We came fairly late so it wasn't busy and we were seated immediately. We ordered a mini deep dish french pig, flatbread tomato basil, flatbread Italian market and a cheese and broccoli soup in a bread bowl. I ate the flatbread tomato and basil which has fresh mozzarella, cheese blend, basil and tomato bits. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Lots of good vegetarian options (including mine) and a gluten free crust option which is nice. All of the entrees were delicious! For dessert we ordered a pizookie which is pretty much an average skillet cookie. We got cookies and cream and chocolate chunk and they were good. We also ordered a beignet and that's where it 
Got kind of weird. The beignet had a weird taste that turned out to be salad dressing. We sent it back and got a fresh one that was delicious and the strawberry sauce didn't taste like garlic and vinegar. The manager came and paid for all the deserts. 

Overall: thin crust pizza is so good, waitstaff was average and the manager was very nice. Good place, will return."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. I live nearby and was a regular. Today I walk in on Wednesday afternoon. The place is empty. They seat me at a small table so I ask for a larger one. The woman frowns, then sticks me in the worst corner table in the place. I walked out rather than debate the situation. You have lost a patron. There are too many good places that offer hospitality as well as good food in this area."}
{"text":"Met some friends and sat at the bar.  Jessica was very friendly and very knowledgeable regarding the wines.  Was slightly dissatisfied with the spinach artichoke dip and chips.  More chips than dip and the dip was hot on the edges and cool in the middle.  I stirred it up and it was OK.  Since it was an appetizer, I thought it would be quick to come out, it wasn't.  I probably won't be ordering this again.  Not a very good appetizer."}
{"text":"I had a brew house blonde beer and it was very good.  It was very tasty yet still on the lighter side. I also had the seared Tuna salad and it was
VERY good.  The food was very good and served very quickly. This is a great place"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly service.  Food was okay-lacked seasoning.  

Menu closely reflects the same items as the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with BJ's. I walked in and asked for a gluten free menu and they told me that they no longer have menus that are gluten free but that I had to go online and look at it.  I was totally surprised and when I did go online you couldn't find the menu. It took me some time to find what might be the gluten free menu. I have never experienced anything like this and I wonder if they will stop giving menus to kids or just stop having menus altogether? I know one thing, I will never go back to a BJ's again. In my family when we go out we go to gluten free friendly restaurants since I have the medical condition to gluten."}
{"text":"Given this is a new restaurant in our area and its a busy Saturday afternoon, we may have to try again. Huge disappointment!! We were greeted at the door and seated fairly quickly. Walking back to our table, the floors are very slippery. I had flip flops and husband had tennis shoes on. The hostess agreed the floor was hard for her to maneuver with non slip shoes. After she walked away, we sat for at least 10min while plenty of tables around us had servers buzzing by. My husband flagged one down to get us a server. Once our server arrived, with no apology, we went ahead and ordered basic cheese burgers medium well. Food arrived quickly from a food service person, who plopped the food down and took off. There was no ketchup on the table for fries but figured our server would arrive and ask if we needed anything. She did arrive after we ate about half our food. The burger tasted good but was pink in the middle. Overall, a big disappointment and there are plenty of options elsewhere around here."}
{"text":"So I'm not one to call anyone out so I won't. .. But the two star review is due to service I had both times here from the same server. Not horrible,  just unfriendly and not very attentive (at one point we went to the bar to get refills). Maybe it's because we were sitting on the patio. 

Food here is good, nice selection, and i enjoy the in house made beers, but just kind of got the impression my being there was an inconvenience to the server. Solid three stars if not for the service. Womp womp."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times and have always liked the food and service. I like coming for their happy hour (and reverse happy hour). Their menu is huge (think Cheesecake Factory) but everything I have had is good. The ambience of the restaurant is nice, not a big place but it's cool to see the brewery through the glass next to the restaurant. I would recommend the pizza!! They also do a pizza cookie but I LOVE the fact they have a brownie...mmm! They also do a trio of cookies, which is amazing. The only con's would be price and their chips & salsa. Both can be improved :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place! It's always my go to... They have awesome low calorie options!! Like 20! Which is so rare! Also a good happy hour :) 
Kale salad is really great for like 410 calories. I was surprised at how good it is... Prob is my fav thing I've gotten on the low calorie meal list so far"}
{"text":"I often meet friends here because it is centrally located for us. I have been to this restaurant many times and am never disappointed. They provide an extensive menu for a variety of appetites. And while I'm not a big drinker, their cocktails and beers have been warmly received by my dining companions. I've also found each waiter I've met to be pleasant, friendly and attentive to our needs. The only complaint is that it gets very noisy and on weekend nights the parking can be a bit challenging. All in all, I like this place, and enjoy meeting up with friends there because the atmosphere, food and folks are great."}
{"text":"I eat here today. The service was good but not that I complain but we ask for four water and the waitress bring only three. Guess she is distracted. The food is good. I like it when my salad come with thousand island. Yes score! The nachos is okay with sauce but not with eating alone. I like mine salty. Otherwise, I don't have much complained."}
{"text":"This place is our go to spot if we are looking for something close to home. Service is a hit and miss, but food is good. I enjoy the barbeque chicken pizza, jalapeno burger, can't go wrong with a pizookie for dessert. Looking to get a buzz, they do have a great selection of drinks. Haven't had a dish that I've tried and wasn't pleased."}
{"text":"Cap'n Crunch French Toast = YES PLEASE!!!!!!!!

It sounded so fantastic that we ordered 3 for the table. There were 13 of us who met up for brunch......on Mothers Day! 

We tried and failed at Crepe Expectations, we tried and failed at Blue Island (it was going to be their last day of business as owners had bailed on business the waiter/host advised). I called Republic and they couldn't seat us til 4. I called here and they said it would be about 40 minutes. We got there about 25 minutes later and they told us it would be about 25-35 minutes. Mothers Day is quite the day for brunch/breakfast/lunch.

It was slow to start, the drink order took a while. Then we had to order our food, then wait for it. But, once one meal came out, they all came out pretty quick after that. 

Back to those Cap'n Crunch french toast.......they came out first. They were OK. I think we all dreamed of TASTING Cap'n Crunch in the french toast. But you dont. You want to, you know it's there, but it doesnt taste like it one bit. It doesnt taste bad, not at all, but it doesnt taste like you imagine it will. 

The table ordered a ton of food: Breakfast pizza, Surf n Turf, french toast, shrimp taco's, pulled pork sandwich, ahi tuna salad, breakfast sandwich and a few others I'm forgetting. The portions are nice size. The potatoes with the breakfast pizza weren't seasoned well. There was way to much omelette on the pizza. The cheese could have melted more too. I think everyone was so hungry, and the food was OK, we ate. But I dont think anyone had anything spectacular that I'd rush back for. Although, I did hear they have a dessert that's a cookie in a cast iron skillet that they bake fresh with ice cream on top. That sounded so good. But maybe it's like the Cap'n Crunch french toast. Disappointing :("}
{"text":"I came twice for food and once for the root beer.
They have a happy hour from 2-5 (double check that's the exact hours)
It includes food and drinks. Menu for HH is limited but they have one.
I got a growler when I was at beer fest, so I came here and for $8.00, you get a growler of fresh root beer.
It was delicious, however, I wish it had a little more bubbles. The taste was spot on, but I like the fizzyness the bubbles bring."}
{"text":"It is a chain but really good and very consistent. Great brews on tap and solid food makes this the best in mall option in my book."}
{"text":"This is a bar and restaurant. I had the ribs, good stuff and quantity. Best thing here though is their Pizza cookie dessert. I will kick a cactus to get a free dessert voucher for this place. It's that good. Just get the white chocolate one, the other ones are mediocre. 

J out."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the amazing food. The menu fits anyone's appetite.. salads, sandwiches, chicken dishes to homemade pizza. The selection is great too!! I like the crusted Parmesan chicken!! Great take option too."}
{"text":"This rating is strictly regarding the hostesses Sunday December 10 at about 4pm. Rudest hostesses EVER! No \"Hi, welcome to BJ's\" not even a \"How many, please\" and then one just grabbed some menus and proceeded to walk away. No \"Follow me, please.\"  Set the menus on the table. Never said a word. No \"Enjoy your meal\" Basically no acknowledgment at all for these two. Only sour or stoic looks. Need to train your hostesses BJ's. The ones we encountered would have been fired from my establishment."}
{"text":"Great lunch selection and pricing.  I had a cup of soup and a half a baked potato.  Soup was great.  Potato was decent.  I also had a beer, the Oasis seasonal.  Yummi!  They said it was like a fat tire, but smoother, and i totally agree.  I'd go back for sure.  They weren't too busy, but regardless, the service was great."}
{"text":"This.  is the second time my wife and I were here and both times we sat at the bar and had excellent service. First time, I had Jambalaya (second only to Emerils in Miami) and she had wings. Decent wings, leave it at that. Today we went. She had Calamari...decent calamari, leave it at that. I had the chicken fried burger...Amazing. Light breading on the burger, awesome black pepper gravy, fresh avocado, perfectly fried egg. I mean, come on...what's not to love?
 Both times, Darnell at the bar has provided amazing service and recommendations. Oh, and anyone that has had the pizookie..Forget about it. Only question is, which pizookie is most amazing? ..Macadamia nut pizookie is OFF THE HOOK. Love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"I came in here on a Friday night for a date. It was busy but not overly busy. It was a Cavs playoff game night. We sat in the bar area. ALL seating in the bar are self seating, including booths. See an empty spot? Grab it! There is plenty of seating within. Big TVs to watch a sports game. Good for large parties too. I came here last year for my birthday and they were able to accommodate a large party on a Sunday. I'm actually coming back tomorrow for a family get together for my birthday. 20 people reservation set!
The decor is really nice. I love that the bar is lighted with different colors. It's pretty when it's dark.
There are plenty of beers here to choose from. It is a Brewhouse. I don't drink so I can't comment on it.
Their menu is huge! Lots of choices and there is something to fit everyone's palate. I work at the Cheesecake Factory and their menu is similar to ours. We have better food though. Hehe
I choice the grilled salmon with rice pilaf and I substituted the broccoli for the roasted beets. The salmon was great and had a lil more char than I would like. The beets were peppery! They should take that out. They were good tho, they had small bits of goat cheese in it. I love goat cheese! My date got a steak and devoured it. 
Service was better this time around. Our server was attentive enough. Last year I didn't have a good experience. Service was terrible. It wasn't even busy and our group wasn't that big. My burger wasn't cooked the way I wanted and my fries were cold and soggy. It took FOREVER to get our desserts. I haven't been back since until last night. 
For a chain, I'd say it's a good place to meet up with friends and family. Nice atmosphere. Prices are a little high but not outrageous. There is a ton of variety in the menu. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Service was good, and lots of people in my group enjoyed my meal.  However, I got the chicken and bacon \"Mac & Cheese\" but was disappointed because it was really just pasta with cheese sauce.  If I had known that, I'd have tried something better."}
{"text":"Very frustrating experience.  We were a party of 5 including 2 children.  We arrived at 4:30 pm and were told it was a 10 minute wait to be seated due to shift change.  Once seated our waitress was good, immediately taking our orders and answering our questions.  The big frustration was that we were there with a gift card purchased on Amazon.  They restaurant was not able to figure out how to use it even though the pin and certificate number were right on the certificate.  Trying to figure this out took so long, and never did get figured out .  We ended up paying without the certificate .  I sent an e mail to the restaurant with my complaint.  I got a message to call the manager at the restaurant.  I called and was put on hold for over 10 minute's.  I called back leaving my name and phone number asking for  the manager to call at his convenience.  I still have not rec'd a call back."}
{"text":"The number one reason to come here is the pizookie. Sure, it's something that I can easily make at home, but I'm way too lazy. It came out in a fairly large (maybe 5-6 inches in diameter) metal dish. In it, a piping hot, moist and chewy chocolate chip cookie at least a quarter inch thick and topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's simple but when you combine two classics like cookies and ice cream it's a sure fire way to make me drool. It's large enough for three people to share, but my son and I managed to devour it quickly between the two of us.

The other food is pretty standard. They've got a big menu that'll make you think you're at the Cheesecake Factory. Full of items not high in quality of preparation or ingredients, but large enough to appease any hearty appetite.

The pot roast sandwich may not be good for the heart, but it's good for the soul -- slices of beef on top of toasted garlic bread. If that wasn't enough they top it off with mashed potatoes and gravy. Some random veggies on the side might fool others into believing it's healthier than it is. The wife went with a classic burger. Standard fare, but it hit the spot.

The place is great for families. It's loud enough to drown out the sounds of restless toddlers and plenty of tv's to distract you from the average food and service. The kid's menu is full of all the usual stuff -- chicken tenders, grilled cheese, burgers, etc. So, chances are there's something for even the pickiest eater.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's, but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a \"Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad\" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a \"Kids Pizza\" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! 

They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and decided to try this delicious restaurant! its hard to pick what to eat everything just seems so yummy!"}
{"text":"Zero! I have been here 3 times now as I work across the street. One time I walked out because it was 11am when they opened and it took 20 min for a server to come over as I was in a huge hurry on my lunch break. The second time, I sat at the bar in hopes to get noticed quicker and I still waited a lengthy amount of time to be served a beverage, and the third and final time was the night before thanksgiving when the place was vacant at 10pm and I still waited 15 min to be greeted! Every time I was sat by a hostess (including the bar time) and I just can't say anything great about the service. The food is really good though from what iv had (sandwiches, pot skins, and the fried asparagus is to die for). Just need to be a little more picky when it comes to hiring, because these people are awful who wait on your customers!"}
{"text":"Love this location!

This is one of the few spots in this area my wife and I actually frequent. We are huge fans of the orange cream soda, classic root beer, and avocado egg rolls. Every meal we've had has been a good experience with the excellent staffing.

I believe I saw a sign that said BJ's now delivers? Very stoked if thats right."}
{"text":"This place is not great during dinner time. I came here today and asked for a booth for 5. After a 20min wait we are seated at a table. We asked for a booth then we were told we can wait for a booth to open up. It's would of not been a big deal but I have had this happen 3 times in the past week so this made me finally give up on this place. I'll still come for lunch but not for dinner."}
{"text":"BTW, for those who care, this is my 100th review!!! Woot woot! 

Anyways, I Went here for dinner with some friends because one of them never had a pizookie and I just couldn't let that go on for any longer. 

Nothing too special about this place, but it is known for their pizzas. I ended up ordering the chicken limon pasta which was really good, but that could be because I was super hungry at that time. The pasta was filling, but it was also really buttery and oily. I don't eat that heathy, but it'd be nice if the fatty stuff wasn't just straight up obvious because it can be off putting at times. On the bright side, the two sticks of garlic bread they gave was pretty good and was a nice compliment to the dish.

My friends and I got the strawberry beignet and the pizookie trio (white chocolate macadamia, Oreo, and chocolate chip) for dessert. The beignet was pretty crispy which is a big plus and the scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry pieces made it even better.   I also discovered my newfound appreciation of the Oreo pizookie. If you haven't yet, you have to try it out when you get the chance. Just be aware that the portion sizes for each of the trio is pretty small so it would be a nice small dessert for 3 people to split. 

This place is a little overpriced in terms of the food and portion size, so just be aware of that."}
{"text":"Great food, service and price. The food is always good and the price isn't bad at all. Good casual dining!"}
{"text":"I love BJ's but they disappointed me and my entire family yesterday.
We arrived at 11:15 on Father's Day (Didn't know they took reservations) 
Told us it would be at least 30 minutes, we waited and waited. Finally after about 40 minutes,
trying to get an update from the front staff - (Lots of them standing around) said they were not
sure that it could be another 30 minutes - Screw- That!! We went next door to P.F. Changs 
and they seated us right away! Thanks BJ's you guys sucked the fun out of Fathers Day!"}
{"text":"I came in at opening to make a reservation because they are weird about making them over the phone. I was planning a birthday dinner for twenty-five and don't want to spend half the evening waiting for a table. 

They told me to wait for a manager so I sat in the entry way for twenty-five minutes before I finally left.  I came at opening to avoid a crowd and there were five tables in the entire restaurant occupied so it's it as if they were slammed.  

Hopefully I can talk my husband into having his birthday dinner literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!! I love how many options they have. All of them sounded so good at the time and I had a really hard time choosing my entree. I decided on the ahi salad and loved every bit of it. My brother and cousin also enjoyed their plates. Our waitress was pretty cool, checked up on us fairly often and made sure our waters were filled. Now that I think about it, I only reason I went was to use my gift card. I forgot to apply it so yes, will definitely be back soon for a happy hour. Also, their pizookies are bomb.com!! If you sign up for their free rewards program, you get a free mini pizookie. ;) You're welcome!"}
{"text":"Worse meal ever. Ordered the kale and Brussels sprout salad. There was none. It was all spring mix. Called the manager over and he stated the spring mix was kale. He does not know the difference. Had to show him what kale looks look. he has no business being a manager of a food restaurant. He needs to go back to school and go food shopping. If you go ask Terry about your choice. He will not know what's on the plate."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Always have a good meal and can't complain. The only thing that I had a problem with was, one time I had a burger and it was a lityle dry. But still really good. 
You have to get the app so you have a clue in seat times or get in line ahead if time. 

Beer cost are average. Pizza is the best around (my $0.02 of couse.)

I can't figure out why the possible negative reviews. Lo g wait time yes but that's it. Most all places around are about the same wait. So I ignore those people. They are never happy."}
{"text":"If you don't like something on the menu... no big deal... they have 100 other things to try.  This menu is quite possibly the second largest menu (behind cheesecake factory) that I have ever seen.  And this is just the food!  My personal favorite is the Parm Crusted Chicken.

Did I mention that this was a brewery that had some great beers as well?  There are very few seasonal beers I can tolerate but every season BJs releases a new beer (even if it's a repeat from last year) I am amazed at how delicious it tastes."}
{"text":"One star is to good for you! Well, this place is a joke!  First we placed an online order for delivery, the return email told us it would be here in about an hour and ten minutes.  Forty-five minutes later we get a voice mail telling us that they aren't delivering tonight.  (That is not what your brochure on you front counter says.)  Ok, we call to find out what the problem was.  The condescending manager then said he will have to talk to his IT department because we shouldn't have been able to do that.  Mr. Manager you may think that people are stupid but you are wrong.  Where is your IT department somewhere in California I am sure.  YOU are the person (or one of your minions) responsible for turning it off on the computer sitting in your office.  YOU screwed up!  Man up and take responsibility!  When you were asked to stop the order and reimburse our card you told us you couldn't do that till tomorrow.  Are you kidding me I can send money across the country in a few seconds.  What are you using Windows 95!  You computer systems must be way out of date.  (Some of us understand how computers work.)  If you don't know how to do something ask one of the high school students that work for you to do it for you.  I'm sure they would love to hack into your system for you.  We then had to come and pick up our order that should have been delivered.  On the phone, we begged you to make it right you throw a couple of things at us. When we got there you where no place to be found.  The food was awful no flavor, poorly made and it was cold.  It had been sitting there since you found out that is was a delivery and you weren't delivering.  Oh yeah, who got the drivers tip?"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. The food is pretty good. However, the wait - both for seating and then service - can be long. Don't come too hungry, because it could be a while. The last time I was here, I ordered a burger and the burger was not even warm. My dining partner ordered fish tacos and she said that the fish was cold and the taco shells were stiff and stale. Usually it's better than that. We waited so long for our food that we asked the server where it was and asked for the check with the food. Way too long. I don't care how busy a restaurant is, getting food where you have to wait that long and getting coldish food is not a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place to go for excellent food & top notch beer!  The BEST!  Look forward to going every time!"}
{"text":"So, I have given Bj's 3 tries. The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend and we shared a beer and a couple appetizers. It was the middle of a Saturday and we had no wait. The waitress was great! Food came out quickly as well as our beers. The pork fries on the app menu is delicious and the flatbread was just ok. I enjoyed my experience and encouraged friends to try it out as well.

The second time I went was with 3 girlfriends and it was less than stellar. I ordered a flight of beer and was disappointed when knowing nothing about the house beers could match them up to the appropriate name better than her. It was awkward. That was the first time I tried the personal deep dish pizza and it was probably the most amazing thing ever. Our waitress for the table was nice and sort of attentive but the amount of other people that come to your table to bring drinks, salads, entrees, is unbelievable and weird. It makes it hard to ask for refills or even an extra napkin. So, after this time, I understood the complaints about slow food and service from friends. 

The third time I went was with another couple. When we showed up, we knew there would be a wait since it was a Sunday night. The way they have the front set up is weird with 2 different stations. Even though I had already been there, I was unsure which station to go to. We put our name in and waited by the bar. After waiting for about half an hour, we asked if the booths in the bar area were seat yourself, they said yes! Why didn't anyone tell us this! So we sat at an empty booth and proceeded to have a pretty good time. I ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita which was delicious and my friend ordered a house made crème soda which she said was amazing. We all ordered different things, deep dish personal pizza, alfredo pasta, brisket burger, and another deep dish personal pizza. We all finished our meals and they were all very well made. 

In conclusion, I will keep going  back because the food is so good, just knowing the service is VERY hit or miss and you should pace yourself on any drink because you are unsure when it will be filled again."}
{"text":"Nice selection of house brews.  I like the fact that they have other breweries on tap too.  The pizza and wings are good and you can't skip the pizookie for dessert.  The churro pizookie although technically not a cookie is pretty fun to eat.  

I come here in spurts because the food tends to be lacking in consistency.  Sometimes the pizza is great, other times you wonder what happened to the toppings and then next time you're eating doughy under-cooked slices.

Service is pretty much the same.  One night outstanding, the next it's like a rookie is serving you and then on the odd occasion you get the what did I do to deserve this treatment."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing.  Parmesan chicken, spaghetti, chicken fingers, mac and cheese, and teo different type of pizza.  Although the price is high, the food was on point.  The beers are good, and the service was amazing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After an hour wait I had hoped that the food would make up for it, boy was I wrong. The atmosphere was loud and busy as expected and the table was clean and neat. After ordering chips and salsa and a round of hand crafted sodas for the table it took a while for the server to come back to take our order. The chips and salsa arrived and the chips were crispy and delicious, the salsa was pretty good as well although we found multiple french fries swimming in the bottom of it, the only thing that would have made them better was more chips as we ate all of the them within 5 minutes of receiving the plate. Next the salads came out and both were tasty, no complaints there. Then we waited for a long time for our food to come out..... My husbands ribs were hot but over done. They were chewy and the outside was crispy and hard to eat. I ordered the ziti, which was not the smallest I've seen but not huge either. The noodles were okay but some were either undercooked or burnt because they were very crunchy. The sauce was pretty tasty but not much better than a store bought and there was so little meat that I could hardly find it. Finally, our server took forever to bring us our check making our time at the table over an hour. Overall the entire experience was less than great and it did not make me feel like returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, good portions, nice ambiance, AMAZING service from our waiter Deleon (not sure on spelling).  Ideal location with many shops/theatre/entertaining around to walk off your meal OR build up an appetite! Thanks BJs!"}
{"text":"I am actually very fond of this place.
My best friend and I come in to dine as often as we can.

BJ's definitely has that very loud and social environment. We were seated very quickly and the first thing I noticed on the menu was definitely that half of it was about alcohol. I was not looking there so I cannot review on that part! Haha. There menu is quite extensive with a wide variety so anyone will find something they are looking for.

We started off with mozzarella sticks which very great but I wish they would include more dipping sauce. We decided to split a classic angus burger which turned out fantastic and it was very juicy. We also opted for the thin sliced fries and they were crunchy and fantastic.

Our drinks were refilled very quickly since she gave them a little hint by putting her empty glass near the edge of the table. Our server was very nice and kept coming back to check up on us.

The dessert! Order the pizookie xD They are AMAZING!

One of the times I went with my boyfriend, I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and that came out positively delightful. I could not finish it so I had to ask for a to-go box, haha. He had the miso salmon which tasted amazing but he did wish there was more rice for it. 

This place will definitely stay in my favorites."}
{"text":"Today put the icing on the pizookie. Over the past several years we have been eating here.  Our usual bill is almost $100 every time. For that kind of money I expect the food to taste better than fast food but not better than fine dining. I would have to say over the past six months that the quality in food and especially in service has hit rock bottom.  It seems to rank even below Applebee's or Chilis. I have vowed not eat eat there any longer and urge you to find somewhere else, maybe a locally owed restaurant to support."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and always packed. Despite the fact that their always busy we're still seated and with drinks in 20 minutes or less. Love that about BJ. First time at this location as we live in Avondale. My daughter won 2nd place in her dance competition and wanted BJs as her celebratory dinner. The sitting arrangements were a tad bit uncomfortable as they sat us in the back which was a little tight, but the waiter made up for the discrepancies with his awesome service.  Food was amazing as always. Girls had pizza (the reason we came to BJs) and I had the kale and brussel sprout salad."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food and service are usually very good.  Can get crowded on weekends but worth waiting a bit to get a table.  The noise level is not too loud like some other places.  Didn't care for their specialty drinks but the beers are good and they have a nice selection."}
{"text":"We got there around 7pm, it was happy hour because of the football game, we had a table at the bar. We waited for about 8 minutes & then were seated. We ate the traditional wings & avocado egg rolls, can't go wrong with that, they were delicious. Apple Martini & strawberry mojito were delicious. Taylor was our server, Nice server."}
{"text":"Went to BJ Brewhouse today for lunch.  A TWO hr lunch.  Terrible service, waited 45 minutes for two sandwiches.  Our server never offered us refills on ice tea.  When food did come out, not hot.  Manager came over apologized and got us fresh plates.  Never offered to comp our meal.  Need to learn how to make customers want to come back.  Not impressed, won't go back!"}
{"text":"Soo we came here for my son's  21 am We orderd the flight of beers , papas an drinks, even though We waited a half hour after making a 630  reservation. The food is very good  t her service was very good. The atmosphere  is very Good ,..im glad we decided on this place for my sons 21!"}
{"text":"First of please note, I'm a sucker for any place that has brewhouse in their name.  That being said I do dine here at least once a month.  The beer selection is very good with both house selections and guest brewers available.  The food alone would probably only rate 4 stars but the entire experience lifts them to a 5.  Service has always been good and there are a couple servers that are exceptional.  Even when dining in the bar, i have no complaints.  Their menu may be a little too big for me, but I'm pretty much a burger guy any way.  I will say their thin french fries are the bomb."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. The food is great and I also love how they've expanded their menu as of late to include dishes. I am a huge fan of their blackened salmon."}
{"text":"BJ's is just on the money every time. We've been going here for years and it never disappoints. The food is just off the charts and the menu has something for everyone. My favorite is their deep dish Chicago pizza though - it's just ridiculous. Don't pass this place up, it's a treat."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  Expensive burger and fries place. Server Ruben A copped an attitude early on.  Never made eye contact with me and never thanked me for the business.  He was \"coldly efficient\" and I would not want him as a server again...and frankly there would not be a reason to come back anyway.  Since this is our 1st time here...you never get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression.  Save your money.  Toby Keith's is just next door."}
{"text":"1st visit....our server T.D.  was excellent, great follow up and knowledgable. We asked her for suggestions, which were good delicious choices. 
A nice selection of beer.  Our food was unique, and delicious. I'm surprised reading the previous negative reviews, my experience was very good and will return again.
Only negative-parking. Opening your restaurant across from Trader Joe's and sharing the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Love BJ's Brewery! Always a great selection, casual atmosphere, and amazing service. Went in tonight with the family before the coyotes game. As usual service was great. Quick on re fills, food came out perfect, and very friendly. Food was delicious and I love the presentation of the food. They really care about their customers. 

We started with the buffalo wings and calamari. Their wings are my favorite. Their buffalo sauce has so much flavor and not too hot.  Got the ribeye which was delicious especially for not being a steakhouse. My family got the prime rib sandwich, buffalo chicken grill cheese, chicken club, and jambalaya. Everything was amazing! 

Highly recommend for any occasion. Great for families, date night, and friends. There is something here for everyone. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Hello to start this is a late review due to I travel a lot let's begin with the waiter (Darnell or something of that nature)
Well this waiter should not be working as a waiter or dealing with public he's very rude non helpful and full of slang words even tho I'm of color doesn't mean you talk to me like I'm from the hood. I watched him talk to all his customer near me the same way. He's really forgetful meaning he took my drink for refill and didn't return it til I was done with my food lucky I had water yes I tried to get his attention but he said hold on. I just had to laugh other then make a scene with someone that's seems to have less then a high school diploma. I ask for my check he took about 10 min to give me that. I also needed a Togo container he took another 10 min for that when he came back I needed Togo silverware which I asked for when I asked for container he had attitude walking away then he started to argue with front counter lady everyone started to watch that scene he was putting on as I'm still waiting for my things so I could leave.. please do not have this waiter service you He really needs to be fired I don't think training can help this guy at all. Worst service I've had ever in place or country I've been to please be advised of his service"}
{"text":"I had a pulled pork sandwich with potatoes wedges and wow I was surprised I was eating in a bar. Very tasty sandwich which I cut in half and enjoyed the next day.

It was a bit busy so we sat at the bar, great service."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful food. was there Friday around 8 pm, they served super bad quality and uncooked food. We had them take back the lentil soup as it was cold and tasted raw. The cauliflower appetizer still has the sulphorous smell of raw jnwashed cauliflower. Either the cook does not know even the basics of how to cook or they are being treated very bad and they are showing it in their work. Will never return."}
{"text":"I dig their pizza and root beer. I do the pepperoni and mushroom with basil tomatoes on top. The root beer is good and House made. Always a good choice even late at night. The staff is not as friendly later, but still a good choice. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Came in first time customer and Nicole N was my server and she was a. Deaths of fresh air super kind to my kids which is a breath of fresh air because they were super busy and she was so pleasant.
 I will always ask for her and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I am no stranger to BJs - I grew up in California, which is where this chain originated from.

I'm not a fan of this BJs. We live about 10 minutes away from it, but I find we go to the one on Superstition Springs more often. We go to BJ's for the food, never the drinks.

Hubby's a huge beer lover. When we lived in San Francisco, we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness.

Anyway, we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here, more specificially, their brewmaster. He'd read rave reviews and thought, \"why not?  we're practically around the corner!\"

Off we trotted and he ordered the beer and I ordered a salad...and he was angry.  Angry at beer. What?! Not again. It's ok.  I was angry at my salad and the slower service.

He finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino, across the street from the Apple campus (yes, as in iPod). He and his best drinking mate, Matt, went for beer...one they ordered tasted like Juniper. The second one he ordered \"tasted like how sweaty gym socks smelled\". His exact words.  *gags a little*

He thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistaken

BJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer, I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven!

My salad pissed me off.  There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don't want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke.

My suggestion?  Seriously? Skip this BJs and go eat at one of the other restaurants. This one won't do it for beer...or food."}
{"text":"I actually find myself driving out to this BJs instead of going to the one in Chandler. It's more of a trek, but I don't have to deal with crappy mall parking.

Ok, this one is next to a PF Chang's (don't get me started on that...I HATE that place), Chipotle, Red Robin and a very defunct Krispy Kreme (*cries*...maybe it's best that it's closed).

The reason I always go to this BJs is...the salad. The BJs at the Chandler Mall makes me angry. Very angry. If I am going to fork (no pun intended) over $10+ for a salad, you had damn well better give me more friggin lettuce. I've been to the one in Chandler a few times and will write a review on their beer.

I'm also a fan of their regular pub fare-ish food - burgers, chicken wings, fries, etc.

But it's their salads that keep me coming back. I'm a huge lover of their Garden Medley with grilled chicken and Field of Greens.

This BJ's can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I went into bjs with one of my friends after work yesterday and sat in the bar. That's where we met alan. He is the absolute best bartender in summerlin!!! He was so helpful with the extensive drink/food menu and definitely made my experience a one of a kind! Will keep coming back for sure!!!!! A++"}
{"text":"We come here constantly and have had other servers, but John is hands down the best. SO attentive and fast. 
The food is also very tasty. You can never go wrong with the avocado eggrolls."}
{"text":"Its a cross between Yard House and Cheesecake Factory.....Better beers at YH, The food selection is okay at BJ's, but even better at YH and CF....service is pretty lacking here, waitstaff tries to be more \"buddy buddy\" (playfully cursing F this and F that with the table inches away from us???)  and you can keep your pizookies(overrated), I'd rather have a piece of cheesecake or a kona coffee sundae....

Sorry BJ's, bottom line, all show, no go.....ALOHA!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(40/365) \"The Yard House/Cheesecake Factory Wannabe\""}
{"text":"Worst meal I have ever paid 80 dollars for in my life. Appetizer was tasteless, waited forever for our order then the Pizza was cold. Ate one piece  and now my stomach be rockin. Save your money."}
{"text":"Good, fun staples, like burgers, pizza, and ahi tuna on sesame crisps, or soups and salads. The cookie dish for dessert is scrumptious.  (And a death-blow to any diet). Of course, seeing your favorite sports teams on TV are a great accompaniment to any dining experience. Great takeout menu.  Call ahead and they can even bring it to your vehicle.  Prices are average, and the crowd is pretty laid-back.  This is not innovative dining, people, but it is largely satisfying and reliable.  The tables and chairs are comfortable, and the temperature is well-regulated.  You are not going to want to cross town to try it out, but if you are tired and hungry after a day of shopping or work, and in the neighborhood of Summerlin, sure, why not?"}
{"text":"We went that for lunch around 2pm.  The place was pretty empty, but it still took our waitress 10 minutes to come over and acknowledge us.  That is ok, sometimes a waitress has other stuff going on.  However, ordered a bison burger and it came out rare.  Asked for it to be cooked more and after 40 minutes of waiting, the new burger again came out rare and the salad that comes with it sat under a heat lamp for the 40 minutes.  The manager and waitress were unapologetic.  Will not eat at this location ever again."}
{"text":"For a sports bar its very sober, which i liked the most about it. A good place to hang out with friends, have a few drinks and spend some good time. The food is average but the drinks are different."}
{"text":"Generally, I like BJ's,  however during our last visit our beers were warm, service was slow and when we said something to our server she didn't offer to correct any of the issues and we ended up leaving to get dessert elsewhere as we were aggravated with the experience.  Not the first time we have had issues with our servers here."}
{"text":"Yes, it was Veterans Day and yes it was busy. However, there is no excuse for waiting to be acknowledged at our table, the server taking our order before our beverage order was ever taken, serving Fried Calamari cold twice, a soggy Santa Fe Salad that was mixed with the dressing so far in advance that the Romain lettuce was soggy. A fresh tossed salad looks like it has been freshly tossed when the lettuce is still light and crisp not in a heaping mound that resembles a salad in a doggy bag I brought home from a restaurant the night before. When the server took our order I asked for extra dressing on the side. It didn't come when the food was delivered so I asked for it. Never came. I asked another server. It never came again. I ordered the Santa Fe with the salmon option. After taking several bites I see that instead of removing the chicken for the salmon I got both which was not a tasty combination. My guest ordered the clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl. The soup arrived in a plain dish. We told the server it was suppose to be in a bread bowl. He said to start on this one and he would bring another in the bread bowl. It came shortly after. Then to our surprise another server shows up with a clam chowder in a bread bowl ready to set it on the table. By this time I was so disappointed with this restaurant and quite embarrassed I even suggested bringing my parents here for Veterans Day. After this EPIC FAIL saving $$25.95 was no bargain. They made a poor first impression to new customers and changed a previous customers desire to ever return. The server took the calamari and clam chowder off our bill. Still the whole experience was a disaster! By the looks of things, I bet they did a lot of \"taking the item off the bill\" tonight. Management, cooks and servers will be chalking this up at the next preopening meeting."}
{"text":"We are usually good with everything at BJ's, fine service good deep dish yummy cookie pizza, but this last visit the service was the only good part (which he really was, so he gets props!) But they not only made our pizza wrong, they were sloppy and rushed about it, the ingredients were piled very uneven, not cooked right, some were even left off and we paid for them, our server did a great job helping to correct the situation by remaking our pizza for us, but even the quality seems to have shot way down, I am gonna have to look elsewhere for my deep dish fix..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, but this review is based upon my experience today:
Positives: 
Waitress was outstanding - right amount of checking and staying away, a true pro
Sat promptly once both in our party arrived for lunch
Everything was very clean
Negatives:
Only one - if you are putting a sandwich on the \"lunch menu\" at a \"reduced price\", I still expect it to be a decent sandwich.  2 thin slices of ham on a ham and grilled cheese does not cut it, especially at the low, low price of $9.50, c'mon. Sorry, but I go out to eat for the food, so this significantly drags down my overall experience (flavor was ok).

I would still recommend this restaurant, but avoid this paltry sandwich."}
{"text":"My parents RAVE about BJ's. I'm not always a huge fan of chains, but I did like this place. The building is huge, and has a lot of seating.  The bar is seat yourself.  We grabbed a booth in the bar easily during the dinner rush.

The menu is massive, so prepare to be a bit overwhelmed.  We started with a brussel sprouts appetizer.  Almost half of the sprouts were charred and over cooked. The sprouts that were cooked well were delicious.  We didn't say anything because they were very busy.  Our server was very attentive, and always there to help us!

Next, a few of us had caesar salads.  It was a bit overdressed for me.  The dressing was very potent, and the salad was soggy.

Finally, we had pizzas all around the table.  Gluten free and regular.  I can only speak to the gluten free pizza.  It did the trick, but it wasn't the best GF pizza that I've ever had. They also have GF buns.

I'll certainly try this place again, but wasn't overly impressed. Again, the service was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Who DOESN'T love BJs??  Great food, never a long wait even when there is a line...cheerful staff and a game playing on TV.  I LOVE the flatbread pizzas!!  Try them all!"}
{"text":"This place has everything to offer in the choices for food & beer. I just love the options. Kid friendly and the staff is awesome. Reservations maybe a good idea if you are going on the Friday or Saturday night as it can get very busy."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and pretty much everything else, me and my boyfriend go here at least twice/ three time a month! :) service is a little slow but I've only been there when they're really busy"}
{"text":"Wish I could comment on the food but had family in town and wanted to try this place out and take them somewhere near our home since we were going after a long day at work. Waited over an hour and 45 minutes and still no table ready. Maybe would have continued to wait but there definitely wasn't a lot of food coming out of the kitchen and the staff seemed to be too busy socializing to get the place in order. Probably going to avoid this place for a while!"}
{"text":"It hurts me to even write this review but I feel like I should at least give a little heads up to someone who might be trying their lunch menu. I had the barbacoa tacos which consist of three super small tacos filled very conservatively and a side of black beans. Flavor was moderate. My GF had the fish tacos which looked normal size and pretty delicious. Sadly the appearance didn't match the taste. When I had a bite it tasted like a frozen fish stick stuck inside of a bland tortilla. Our other friend had the dinner jambalaya and they thought it was really tasty. We had the pizookie trio for dessert and it as always was awesome. 

As for the service, started off ok but ended pretty bad. We were waiting for our refills and thought it was taking a bit long when we noticed that our waiter was standing back in the servers holding a conversation with his friend. Luckily another waitress came by and pretty much took over our table until he finished his conversation. 

From what I can tell this is the type of place where it's best just to eat off their dinner menu no matter what. I thought lunch menu meant same quality smaller portions but apparently it means smaller portions and no quality. As for the service I still think there will always be a few bad apples no matter where you go and it seems that I just have bud luck at this location. 

Probably going to drive across town next time and see if I can better service and order my delicious buffalo chicken pizza and rootbeer."}
{"text":"What a huge menu. With that much selection, you would think the food is average, but its actually much better than average.

Their pizza stands up to dedicated pizza joints.
Burgers are nothing to complain about.
Beef dip sandwich is also a solid choice.

They serve a good ice tea and also have a herbal drink that is really good - the name escapes me.

The desserts are the place they might be a bit weak. I guess here too much selection hurt quality."}
{"text":"Have been to this location 3-4 times now and things have got better each time. I try not to review new establishments everyone needs some time to find good dedicated staff and to work all bugs out. They have been open 7 months now so things should be close by now. Spoke with the GM and they are still working out some bugs but things are getting better. We attended the Guinness beer tasting event the Food and service was excellent. This was the first tasting so they needed to work out some bugs but nothing occurred which would make me lower my rating.  The GM ran the tasting and came in on his day off to do so he seems really vested in the success of facility. 
Remember it is Mentor and you need to expect to wait for some time if you go on a weekend. I recommend a week day evening or for lunch when you can walk right in.  I also recommend the  fried artichoke hearts as an appetizer.  Two out of our party of three stated before they tasted them they do not like artichokes.  You know where this is going not one left on anyone's plate. Would definitely order again"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and unfortunately, the service is not consistent. It's not that it's bad. Sometimes it's very awesome and other times, the staff wasn't very attentive. One time, they forgot what I ordered and came back to clarify... you have notepads for a reason, right? 3-star because it's hit or miss depending on who's staffed that night. Nothing wrong with the food though! It's good as they come."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is called BJ's. Once you've had it in your mouth, you won't want to swallow! For some unknown reason, when my coworkers want to go out for lunch, they always want BJ's. Every time we have gone there, the service was atrocious. We wait forever for our food and some of us get served 10 minutes before others. The food is mediocre and generic at best. One time I ordered baby back ribs and they were literally the worst ribs I have ever had. They were undercooked and tough (ribs should fall off of the bone) and had absolutely no flavor. There was very little barbecue sauce on them and I ended up leaving hungry. My wife ordered a pasta dish (how hard is it to ruin a pasta dish?!) and it had no flavor. She had to dump a large quantity of salt on it just to make it palatable. On top of that, the waitress was very rude and inattentive. 

Another thing I hate about the place is the TVs everywhere. When I go out with friends, I want to spend time talking with them, not watching TV. TVs in restaurants are very distracting and you find yourself looking at them even if you have absolutely no interest in what is being shown (our brains are actually wired to focus attention on movement). 

My advice is to avoid BJ's (at least this particular location) and go to McDonald's. At least it will be fast and you know what you are getting!"}
{"text":"Always seem to be on top of their game ... made room for an additional guest (7).  Very timely on service and refills ... this is a regular place for us ... Thank you for making our meal special."}
{"text":"Seems like this is always good ... we will return ... we try to eat here every time we are in town"}
{"text":"So here's the thing about BJ's. The food is absolutely incredible. They always have great beer selections. The tavern cut pizzas, the burgers, the sriracha queso - all staples. BUT - it's nearly impossible to eat here because of how terrible their waiting system is designed. Particularly around dinner. They have a \"preferred waitlist\" that serves basically no function. You put your name on a virtual list using their app, yet it essentially does nothing. Multiple times I've gone with my family for dinner and we've had to just leave because of the wait. The app will give you an estimated wait time, but the time doesn't actually start until you get to the restaurant - which makes no sense. It's really a shame because the wide assortment of food and great beers would have me eating there a few times per week - if I could get in. So my best advice? Go for lunch, as long as it's not a normal lunch time when there's a chance it could be busy."}
{"text":"BJ's is a really good place.  I went there after a round of golf and had a great meal.  The fish tacos are very good,

Good beer (had the Porter) and even better mixed drinks.  The BJ's Rootbeer float drink (Rootbeer, Schnapps, Bailys, Jameson's) is absolutely delicious.  I dare you to just have one, just be sure to have a designated driver!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Great for bar food and the self made beer was good to try but honestly not the best service. 
The value was good for the price and that is the best I can say about BJs"}
{"text":"BJ's has been under construction for awhile and it finally opened the other day, and I'm so happy that it did. Right from the start, you can tell that BJ's is a legit place. 

I thought it looked nice on the outside but once you walk into the foyer, you know that this place isn't messing around. Such a sophisticated yet casual environment. You can go for a casual lunch with friends or a classy dinner with some co-workers. 

They have a huge bar area with a wall of liquor, planked by two massive televisions. Perfect for any sports go-er. 

In general, it IS a brewhouse and they have an endless list of craft beers. They even have a ranking/rating system of the beers on the menu that tells you what each beer is well paired with. 

I thought the Cheesecake Factory had the biggest and best menu... but I must say, BJ's is going to give it a run for its money. It took be awhile to figure out what exactly I wanted, which is a good thing. They literally have anything and everything: burgers, tacos, deep-dish pizza, fish, fried chicken, etc. 

At first introduction, the staff was a little too up-front and personal with me but my waiters ended up being super nice and sociable. Very knowledgable about the menu and especially the beer!

They even have a mobile app where you can pay right on the app, rather than with your server. The app also utilizes a point system that earns you rewards over time. 

I recommend this restaurant 100%."}
{"text":"We had planned our family lunch at Red Robin since they usually have no problem seating our family of 16. This particular day we were told by the
 hostess that the wait for Red Robin would be 1 hour if we wanted to all sit together or 45 mins if we were willing to split into 2 groups. A few minutes later the manager came to us and said it would be at least 1 hour 45 minutes if we all wanted to sit together.  Understanding it was a busy Sunday we said ok but walked over to BJs to see if they would have a table sooner.  The hostess immediately called the manager up to see how long it would be since they had just sat 2 large parties.  The manager was very pleasant and genuinely wanted to find us a place, not at all like Red Robin's manager. She quoted us a wait time of 1 hour but said she would try to get us seated sooner.  We were seated 30 minutes later- all together.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This will be our new spot for large family dinners."}
{"text":"For the price, atmosphere and selection... cannot complain... this is new addition. BJ's decided to add in Vegas from 2 to 3... GREAT!"}
{"text":"Update: They are consistent with the food and service and are a dependable dining option. I am still a fan of their brewed beverages and the Ahi Salad is awesome! They really shine in the Pizza department, their giant cookie desserts, ''Pizookie's'', and their awesome beers and sodas! Keeping it dependable BJ's, and the masses are thankful!

Final Note: Clean Restrooms! Seriously, both noticeable and appreciated."}
{"text":"Ordered out after some friends suggested them. My friend picked up the order and they forgot to put French fries in the order.  When I called they said they had ran out of extra boxes or something and were supposed to put it with the burger. They offered a gift card for the price of the burger and fries which I thought we nice and said they would email it to me. Well never received it. I didn't call back because I had a busy week and by now I'm sure they forgot who I am. Just really lacking on the customer service and the food was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times, I just can't LOVE it.  It is ok.  Decent service, decent food, large menu selection, large drink selection, but nothing fablous about it.  =(  

Mac & Cheese = Yum, the goldfish crunch on top is good
French dip = good
Burger melt = good
Baked Alfredo Chicken Potatoe = good
Half baked cookie with ice cream = good

Maybe it is because I have had the some items else where and those tasted fablous!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and the last!!!! I posted a pic someplace on here. I don't usually yelp but this i had to. Very disappointed. 
...Chicken tortilla soup looked like dish water with a scoop of guacamole floating around! Service was horrible.....every single drinking was glass empty most of the dinner. No joke, this was one of the worst experiences ive had at a restaurant! The manager was called over just so i can show him the bowl of \"chicken tortilla\" soup i was served. All he said was it looked over cooked and he would talk to the person who preps the avocado...."}
{"text":"As a large chain I will say that I am a fan of BJ's. One of the nice things is that this location is just like every other location, in that its the same menu and same food. 

One thing that i love about BJ's is that I have always had good service, they do a great job of training and making sure that it is done right. Sometimes during busy times there can be issues with not getting your food as quickly but that is what is expected. Sitting at the bar is also a prime spot with the large amount of TV's and a solid selection of draft beer. When it comes to their \"craft\" beers they are hit or miss. As a huge fan of a good beer I cant say I love BJ's brews but they also offer a decent other selection.

When it comes to food they are pretty solid all around. The \"deep dish\" pizza is good, i enjoy the BBQ and the pepperoni. You cant go wrong with any of the sandwiches or burgers they are all solid. During my last visit i enjoyed the wings as an appetizer and used the wing sause and ranch as a dipping sause for the crispy thin fries. Delicious! Best part about all the food i will say is the pizookie, i love the pizookie! you have to try it. 

Overall, BJ's is good a little bit pricey for what you get but they do a quality job on all the food and service and are fairly consistent in all their locations. Good place to go for a family dinner, beers with some friends, or just a place to go and have a decent meal."}
{"text":"It's a good place. The food was pretty decent but the soup my wife got was luke warm and pretty boring. I had the spicy pig flatbread which was really good but even the waiter admitted the jalapeños were out of a can and lacked some heat. Their beer was excellent. I had their IPA and their Double IPA which were stronger IPAs that are the best local IPAs I've had. 

So yes, I'd say go and try this place out. The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are delicious. I love the pizookies (pizza cookies with ice cream) the waitstaff and the hostess were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service-had gone here on a Saturday night around 10:20pm. Service was horrible as there were maybe 10 people in the bar/restaurant area total.   It took us forever to even get our salads-as we asked the waitress while she planning on walking right by us after sitting there just waiting & waiting-she then walked right into the back & seconds later came out with them (obviously they had been there for some time).  Our pizza was uncooked & we seemed to be more of a hassle to our waitress than a customer.   I since have contacted the corporate office by e-mail with no return & also verbally left a message on the corporate number with no return, this is definitely bad customer service on many levels."}
{"text":"This place is good.  I have nothing bad to say...it's your standard brewery type place...although the menu is the like the size of Cheesecake Factory's.  Depending on how busy it is, service can be really good, to fair.  We don't go out of our way to go here, but if we're in the area, we'll drop in occasionally."}
{"text":"awesome food, excellent service... every. single. time. consistency is very important to us and this place is probably #1 on the list! whether we do delivery, curb-side pick up or dine-in we love us some bj's"}
{"text":"BJ's is a great spot to grab a bite or even catch a game.  The parmesan crusted chicken is so yummy and they brew their own root beer!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious as always! Had a very friendly and efficient server. Overall great visit"}
{"text":"They brew their own Root Beer, cream soda and other soft drinks. I get my sugar fix every time.  This place has one of the biggest menus there is. So many sides too.  something here for everyone. The food is good, Pizza not so much.  So you can't figure out where to go\" just go to bj's\" it's that place. :)"}
{"text":"Ok so I went here with my bf and our lil man for dinner one night, I hadn't been their in like 10 yrs so it was pretty much all new to me. 

We were sat immediately.  Our waiter who was super nice took our drink orders and we also decided to order an appetizer.  We ordered pot stickers for the appetizer.  The pot stickers were very tasty.  As for my main course, I decided to order the baby back ribs.  The ribs were very flavorful, and very meaty.  I had a baked potato (loaded) as a side which was also tasty.  My son ordered mini kids corn dogs, which he enjoyed.  My bf ordered a steak which he devoured quickly so I guess he liked it.  Than again he devours everything quickly.  

Overall this place exceeded my expectations.  I would come back again.  The food was delicious, good quality, with huge portions, and our server was awesome."}
{"text":"We took the family out for dinner here, because they are close, and we can all get something we can eat (gluten free pizza for me, vegan spaghetti for my vegan kid, beer for the hubby, etc). They were having issues with their pizza oven on the night we came, which resulted in a long, long wait and impatient kids. However, the manager was super nice, and because he realized how difficult waiting for food with hungry kids can be, comped our entire meal, drinks, dessert and all. We were very, very pleased with the service, and will return for sure. Hopefully there won't be any oven issues next time."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here the other night, and enjoyed my visit as I did the 1st time! This spot is very convenient if you plan on going to Red Rock for movies, bowling, etc afterward. Come here if you're looking for hearty American Food. I prefer coming here more so than most other American chain restaurants especially since their vast and unique selection of craft beers is great. 

What to Buy:
- The Pizzas! Both Deep Dish (BJ'S Classic Combo and Chicken Bacon Ranch) and Tavern (Garlic Chicken Pesto and The Italian Market)
- Avocado Egg Rolls
- Craft Beers 

I didn't particularly enjoy the Enlightened Seared Ahi Salad (the tuna didn't taste fresh, it was heavy, and there were bites with chunks of wasabi in it)- not a fan. I can't speak for the other dishes, but I've always had great pizza coming here. The service here is always on point and we never have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza! For some reason I thought the smaller pizzas off the bar menu tasted better than the same type of pizza, but larger size off the reg menu. Go figure."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service. Server was especially nice to my aging father. Food very good (not the best ever but good) Nice selections of beers and they gave us nice beer glasses for Father's Day gift (thanks!). Convenient location."}
{"text":"You must try the Captains Mug - Captains Morgan and BJs homemade rootbeer, delish! 

The steak was good and the potatoes were huge. The fish and chips came with a generous helping, but were on the salty side. The pulled pork was also very salty

Good service but a tad slow."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this establishment. The deep dish pizza was delivered to our table barely warm. Not sure it was completely cooked as it arrived in about 10 minutes. Margaritas were really weak. Cheese curds were good. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first BJ's experience and I fell in love. I have since been to many others and I love their beer.  But back to this one, the location is super sweet! Its a big reason I love this Brewery being next to the mall made it perfect. Let me explain...

Ok so it was Christmas time and I went out to visit my sister and I still need to get some presents. So my sisters boyfriend took me to this mall and he said we need to stop here first. I was like well ok I guess, and man oh man am I glad we did. It made shopping so amazing (I hate to go shopping during this time period as should anyone) it quickly became my favorite way to shop... slightly drunk! :)

So as amazing as the shopping experience was I was very glad to have had a chance to discover one of my favorite beers Tatonka Stout."}
{"text":"The beer here isn't too bad, but nothing spectacular. They have about ten or so house varieties to choose from.

My hickory brisket and bacon sandwich was excellent. 

Service was excellent and everything was clean and in good order."}
{"text":"Update: I can now officially say I am completely disappointed by this place. The case of BJ's is why I generally hold off judgement of a place until some months pass and their true colors come out. We went there on their burger night and they simply could not do anything but char my burger after two attempts I said I'd just get something else. Third attempt mahi mahi tacos. Guess what that was overcooked too. This place just kind of is not great and is way over priced for what you get. It is unlikely I'll be back. 

The place has exciting sounds and visuals. The server we had was wonderful and generally seemed to care about how much we enjoyed our experience. I do however echo some of the sentiments of other reviewers. The menu is huge which is good for choice, but you know all that stuff isn't made fresh. Also, it is a little pricey the \"Bj's\" brew i had was nearly six bucks. The food was ok. Overall I think it is an ok place. I am glad to have another option close by. 

Just visited again and got a \"sweet baby Jesus beer 7.95 WHAT? Get out of here. The beer prices are jut insane and at least part of the reason I am not a regular.

I will say I respect their desire to make things right. I cannot always say that about other places."}
{"text":"It was an absolute delight to have Alicia B. as our server today!  Her bubbly personality and unending smile made it clear she valued us and our business.  She could not have been more attentive in addressing our needs, always anticipating them before we requested.  As a regular, regular guest at this location since July 26, 2005, I can tell you that today was one of the best experiences I've ever had at BJ's!   It was so obvious that Alicia was taking pride in passionately connecting with myself and my neighbor.  She provided flawless and relentless execution of every detail throughout our visit.  Thank you, Team Mesa, for hiring such a seasoned professional!  I plan to return to this location in the very near future and you can bet I will be asking to have Alicia as my server once again!! :-)"}
{"text":"I tried their cookies and cream pizookie last night and it was absolutely amazing. I was so filling and delicious. The ice cream that came with the cookie was perfect. Even if you are stuffed after their delicious meals, order a pizookie and take it to go."}
{"text":"I really didn't have a problem with the service or the restaurant itself. The building is actually BEAUTIFUL! The spinach artichoke dip was decent but my rib eye was bland. Even though it was cooked to perfection it had ZERO flavor to it. The couscous Mac and cheese was... weird and the insane amount of broccoli seemed like they were warmed and not cooked. My wife's steak was the same. The ceasar salad leaves seemed like they still had dirt on them since they were very grainy. Her potatoes were fine however. My sons apple sauce and fried chicken were fine... kinda hard to mess that up.

You get a solid 1 Star because low quality food do not meet your high quality prices."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, love the format and layout of the place. Many options for food, almost too much! We have tried and tried many different meals here, and nothing seems to be good. Disappointed with flavor of food. I do, however, love the way they serve the children's meals with a fruit starter and bread."}
{"text":"I've been here a few time and got ok service but this last time I was there was so bad. Right when we got in the host was eh. Wasn't feeling welcome at all. We got seat and our server came and took our orders but he was not friendly what so ever. When our food arrived we had no utensil. Had to ask for it. Every time he came back to check up on us the was talking and walking away from us. Like what the f!  When he brought our bill he accidentally hits out friend on the face with it. The apology he gave was so fake. Anyways beside him ruining our lunch the food was good. The best part was the dessert. The pizookie ! Overall restaurant it was very family oriented, place was clean. Hopefully they can up the standard on costumer service a bit. At least fake it good."}
{"text":"Service here was fantastic. Destiny was such an amazing server. She was so bubbly, cheery, and very attentive. She sure knows her brewskies! She helped me find a good brew of choice, and she also made light conversations with us. Such a sweet waitress. Also, I left forgetting my keys on the table and the nice busser flagged me down and gave me my keys back. Thank you sir!

The food is a-ok. I think for a lunch special that is $5.95, I really can't complain. I had the chicken quesadilla and my friend had the bottomless soup and salad. the good part about that is you can switch off your soups and salads if you want to try something different. I honestly come for the pazookie. They have the best pazookies, and they bake the cookie the way I lllloooovvveee my cookie! Soft and doughy. My ultimate favorite is the macadamia nut pazookie. I'm really tempted to try the red velvet, but my heart just can't let go of the macadamia nut. I guess I'm just not ready to let go yet...(It's complicated).

I also had the Nutty Brewnette which had the very carmelly sweet and nutty. I also must warn you that this brew sure's got some HOP to it. After one drink I was getting quiet and I'm never quiet.  If you are all about a strong roundhouse kick in your brew...try the Piranha...I was about to choose this one then Destiny kind of warned me that it's got a really strong spicy taste to it, and it's got a whole lot of hop to it. So, I backed out on that one. But if you are one who is all about the IPA intensity..go for the Piranha."}
{"text":"Probably by far top servers we have ever got definitely top 10 for sure. The pizza is good which is why it gets three stars but when we went last night I just couldn't believe how long it took when she was not the only server working. You would think when you are serving so close to your managers or leads that you would be working better to show your strengths but this was terrible. She not once ever refilled my water even after asking and putting it out for her to see. She never once looked at how I never touched my Awful margarita and said hey I noticed you haven't touched your margarita is everything okay? Nope not once. My fiancé asked for a side of ranch and we definitely never got that either. I seriously couldn't believe how little this server cared.

Definitely will not be back anytime soon. Maybe a different location is better or just order to go from now on for their specials."}
{"text":"Very happy to have one so close to us. We love the one in Mesa Arizona and this is the same excellent quality. Staff is great food is excellent. Very happy there here!"}
{"text":"Every time I have been here I have received great service and the food is always amazing no matter what I order! This is definitely my go to spot for a great meal at a decent price!"}
{"text":"Used to be where my wife and I went for dinner....To many mistakes lately...Found a new place."}
{"text":"BJs is a nationwide middle to higher restaurant chain with a focus on beer. They brew their own. This specific BJs has about 8 of them.

BJs has really wonderful service. The waiter was helpful, polite, and visited our table with the right amount of frequency.

We had spiced salmon and Mediterranean tacos. Both were very healthy, but not too filling. a cookies and cream pizookie (Pizookie is the BJs classic dessert- ice cream on a warm cookie bottom) at the end of the night was a great way to finish. it tasted great!"}
{"text":"Went there on the 16th of March . Service was awful and slow . Staff was sitting around eating and talking when they should have been working . Manager that night came out several times and did nothing . Food was awful cold fries , out of the special and orange soda ( don't get it really ) ribs were awful my husband said . Ordered a sangria did not finish it , it was that bad . 
Save your money"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner here. Kris was our server, and she was absolutely wonderful! When visiting this location, be sure to ask for Kris and you will definitely get great service.  Be sure to sign up for emails to receive special offers."}
{"text":"My friend I recently came here for a \"cheat\" meal. They have great healthy options as well, but boy they sure did satisfy the cravings we were having for some delicious food! 
We started with the extreme pepperoni flat bread. It was so good! Crispy crust, two different style pepperonis! It wasn't too greasy and it was quite large. 
We then split their crispy chicken sandwich! That bun.... It was so light and airy! It had pickle and the best honey mustard sauce ever. The chicken was so crispy!
Last but definitely NOT least was dessert. I can honestly say that I have found my new most favorite dessert ever. Drum roll please...... The peanut butter smore cookie was the absolute best! It was a chocolate cookie with peanut butter and then toasted marshmallow on top!!!! Oh. My. Gosh!! It was so sweet but I couldn't stop eating it! It was SO SO good!  Just dreaming about it now makes my crave it! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"BJ's has been our go-to spot for years, and this closer location is our favorite! The staff and service is SO great and the food can't be beat. We're here almost every weekend, sometimes more often. Favorite favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We love BJ's, it's our favorite spot. However, my husband and I regularly eat at the Centennial location and are very impressed with the staff, service, and quality of food. On our wedding day in November, we were in this part of town to take pictures and stopped in to treat ourselves to our favorite spot. We were dressed in our full wedding getup and received zero special treatment. We didn't expect a free dessert or anything (though I'm positive the Centennial location would have given us at LEAST that), but we weren't even wished any congratulations. The staff were hardly friendly. We get more special treatment on a regular basis at the Centennial location. Won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"This was the first time here that was not a 5 star review. 
Came here with my family and my sister does not eat chicken.  It was my fathers birthday.  All started well. 
But we orders drinks and I orders a AMF it came out looked amazing. Normally I love amf's. but this one tasted like well tequila. It was horrible.  Only had about 3/8ths. 
Enjoyed some wine and our food came.  It was amazing tell my sisters order came out.   She told the waitress clearly no no chicken.  She only eats seafood.  So she orders a shrimp salad. And got a chicken salad.   
We had to complain 2 times. Normally love eating here.  They have us 2 free deserts for our large table.  That's what saved the rating.  It would have been a 2 star.    We will be back again"}
{"text":"Always good food & good service. They were very busy and still bussed a table just so we could move to a booth as requested."}
{"text":"Eine unbedingte Empfehlung, wenn man in Vegas und Umgebung ist.
Vom Strip ist dieser BJ's eine kurze Autofahrt entfernt, aber dafür bietet sich ein netter Service, süffiges Bier und leckeres Essen.
Es gibt in der Umgebung noch weitere BJ's, aber der war wirklich der Beste.
Was ich an BJ's besonders mag ist, das du neben Burger und Co. auch gesündere Sachen, wie sehr gute Salate oder auch Lachs bestellen kannst.

Die Karte ist für amerikanische Verhältnisse sehr umfangreich und bietet für jeden Geschmack etwas. 
Daneben gibt es rund 50-60 Biere im Angebot. Vom Fass oder aus der Flasche und rund zehn selbstgebraute. 

Probieren kann man die Fassbiere alle und es gibt auch einen eigenes Bier-Menü mit Erläuterungen. Das BJ's ist für Craft Beer Lover also ein Paradies.

Spare Ribs und Burger Fans sollten hier ebenso hin, wie Pizza Liebhaber und Low Carb Freaks. 

Als Nachtisch muss man unbedingt einen Pizookie probieren. Einen warmen Cookie in der Pfanne mit Eis und Toppings. Ein Traum in unterschiedlichen Geschmacksrichtungen.

Ich gestehe ich bin BJ's Fan und wenn jemand irgendwo in den USA einen BJ's sehen sollte, einfach hin, man kann nichts verkehrt machen und bekommt für US-Verhältnisse eine super Range an leckeren Essen und Drinks.

Täglich gibt es auch noch Aktionen, die Preisnachlässe auf diverse Sortimente gewähren. Was will man mehr! :-)"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waited 20 minutes for a cold spinach artichoke dip. Then waited another 30 minutes for soup and salad. After that we ordered a pizookie and it took longer than 15 minutes. I have never waited that Iong for any of that simple items I ordered."}
{"text":"Had THE worst experience in a restaurant in a very long time. I go out because I don't want to cook for once. Brought my mom from out of town and she had hair cooked! Yes cooked into her onion strings! It was hanging out of her mouth which i saw which is why she knew. My little sons pizza I ordered just cheese it came with Tomatoes in it which he won't eat so she offered to make another which was very nice. He was very hungry though. When the new one came out it was burned and all the cheese was baked off!  My moms chicken looked like they microwaved an old breast and was dry! Not wor u the $12! They kindly discounted those 2 items from the bill. Offered the kids and us ice cream on the house... which I was still charged half for! And mine never even came out. I will never return. And I'm sad because the pzookies and wings are usually good. Horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"BJ's is consistent. The food is always good. No matter how crowded they are, the orders are delivered in a timely manner. The servers are always very attentive. 4 start instead of 5 stars because we had to track the server down a few times like the 5 minutes I had to wait for a silverware setup. I finally went to an unoccupied table to fetch it for myself."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and today. The food is definitely solid, probably a 4/5. Enjoyed my grilled cheese and club sandwich, fries are a bit bland. The best part is absolutely the in house brews. That Jeremiah Red is delicious! Unfortunately the service at this location leaves a good deal to be desired. On the slow side, quite a few dour faces. It's very confusing as I had separate servers seat me, take my drink order, take my food order, bring my drink, and bring my food on both occasions. Tried to tip moderately cuz I had no idea who it was going to, but I'm not a fan of the musical chairs approach to service."}
{"text":"Was running around all day and by 9pm I just wanted to have a beer and a little pub food.  I've had some BAD pub food last 3 restaurants!  I've ordered take out from BJs before but haven't sat at the bar.

It wasn't crowded.  Tracy immediately came up and offered me a menu and asked about drinks.  I wasn't familiar with any of their beers so I got a few tastes and then decided.  Then I realized they had and did that.  (Thankfully before she poured the big glass... which turned out to be my favorite of the flights)

I ordered guacamole and chips and I swear it hit the bar in front of me in 6 seconds.  Thin, fresh warms chips and great guac.  I nibbled on that.  Explored the massive menu.  Worked on my beer flight and decided i was still hungry.  Ordered fried artichoke.  Again... 60 seconds and piping hot.  Amazing.

It was fairly slow so I noticed everyone was cleaning.  I don't mean just wiping down the bar I mean the stuff that a lot of grubby places don't do every day.  

The experience was great.  Tracy was fast, friend, knowledgable.  I asked a lot of questions and she patiently answered and since I was alone she came by and chatted a bit when she wasn't totally busy.  (I even asked questions about the spoon hanging from the tap because I was curious and other kind of dumb things that interested me.)

The whole experience was as good as it gets for just walking in and wanting to nosh and drink.  I love the pizza.  I'm going to have to go back and try something more substantial.

Thanks Tracy!  You made it a very pleasant visit for me.
(Manager... give the woman a raise!)"}
{"text":"Well, I don't drink beer. That being said.  I'm a big fan of BJs.  I've eaten there a couple of times before, but never at the Desert Ridge location.  I found the atmosphere great.  Nice and open, clean and plenty of flat screens viewable from all locations.  
The service staff was nothing amazing, but friendly and efficient.  Great menu, with lots to choose from -and the dish I got, the Piranha Pale-Ale Chili Cheese Burger was amazing.  The Pale-Ale Chili had a great flavor.  I'd say I couldn't stop eating it, but it was so big I had to.  
My wife had a regular BJs burger, which was boring, but she said was tasty.  Daughter ordered off a good kids menu - lots of choices for a reasonable price.   And of course...the pazookie.  
$40 for a family of three that doesn't drink beer isn't cheap, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. This is prob the worst place I've ever ate at. And it's not just this specific one. It's literally every single one I've been to. Not only is my order incorrect every time, it's always cold.  And I get it being cold once and a while but literally every time. You want to charge me 59$ to eat dinner here but deliver my food cold, and not even what I wanted? I seriously wish they would restart with the staff, I've never been so pissed off leaving a place. And it's annoying because they say oh we are so sorry, if you were so sorry why does this happen every single time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Well, this place seemed to have gone downhill at a rapid pace. We come here occasionally since living here, and it is not what it use to be. 
Today's experience alone was enough. We come in for Sunday lunch, and we wait a few minutes to be seated. The hostess apparently doesn't hand out silverware when they pass out the menus, so after we ordered our entire meal, all at once after our server was finally able to make it over, and I get a salad, I guess the expected me to show them how I eat at Medieval Times, because it took a few more minutes to get some. Then our kids pizza comes out, and the server warns us that the plate is extremely hot (from the heat lamps I am assuming). WHO THE F^# is going to put a scolding hot plate in front of a toddler to eat off of. Maybe they should have just handed him a steak knife and some fireworks to go along with his meal. Then our meal comes out, and my pulled pork sandwich came out cold. Seriously?!?! So that was sent back, but right before that, our drinks from the bar that were ordered when we placed everything finally come in, and it was only a tap beer and a flavored iced tea. I watched a lot of the servers come and go from the bar pickup, and not a single server chose to help out our server by bringing out two drinks while they grabbed their table's drinks. Then the manager came out with a stone face and brought me my reheated sandwich and simply asked \"is that better?\". Didn't ask anything else or really talk at much. 
I didn't even bother talking to the manager about this, since he left his bag of F^#s at home. Despite all of this, our server was real nice and she was doing the best that she could, but it didn't help that none of the servers seemed to work with each other, and that is the manager's fault!! 
If a manager or higher happens to read this and would like to reach out on here, go ahead, but I will most likely not be returning to this certain establishment."}
{"text":"I highly recommend great service, great food, and the deep dish pizza is to die for! The menu is large and they have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"It took an hour and 20 minutes to get our food!  Enough said. I would give one star but the food was good, once we finally got it. Of course we were starving by then and had each had two drinks, so maybe it wasn't that good. We complained to the manager and he tried to blame it on us!  The server was friendly but never apologized for the situation either. There was no effort to retain us as customers, like a discount on the meal or a gift card. A simple apology and explanation about what happened would probably have even been enough for us to come back because we've always really liked this place. Oh well, time to find a new favorite place."}
{"text":"Let's be real guys. This place is great. If you haven't had the pizzucci you need to try one today. They're epic. Each bite explodes with melted goodness. The beer on tap is a great selection. The pizza and other food items are amazing. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough of this place!!!! Ammmmmazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"The turkey burger is very good. It does not taste like a hamburger, but that is not the point it is a very good turkey burger. 

The house brewed root beer is worth the sugar."}
{"text":"The WORST !!!! Had delivery ($71.00) they delivered burnt ribs that were tough NO SIDES __Rice-NO Salad-NO  delivered skimpy roast beef sandwich- Fries-NO Slaw -NO desert ---NO just a scoop of ice cream Charged 4,99 del fee -- 3.74 tax --- 14.28 tip -----What a rip-off ---when I complained the sent me a $10 gift cert (like I would ever order here again !!!!! ) I tried to call the manager and was put on hold 10 minutes -Twice ---- Save your money and time -- go to Houlahan's or Bravo !!!!"}
{"text":"Bj's is just ok. They have some good dishes and some bad. I do have to say there wings are very good and i could eat a lot of them. They are breaded. Normally I'm not in to a breaded wing but these are good. The breading is so light and the sauce is delicious. I have been here many times for meeting with friend for a beer and apps. I have ha d a steak, it was good, the california chicken sandwich was ok, it would be better if it had bacon on it. They have shoe string fries and wedge fries. Its always good to have an option. The decor is nice,  upscale sports bar is the best way to describe it. The host and server s have always been nice and knowledgeable, but on more than one occasion after the food was served they never came back to check on us to see how the food was or to fill our drinks. When you serve the food you have to make sure the drinks are filled. I like there blond brew and there amber brew, but did not care for the others I tried. They do have a good selection of lunch specials ranging from $6.95-8.95. Overall I feel this place is hit and misss, some good some bad."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the condos at Desert Ridge and decided to go here with friends for dinner. We had a 30 minute wait for a table but a server came by and got us drinks while we waited and another came by later with some pizza to try.
We were seated and our server was very attentive. 
My wife had the chicken pasta and asked them if they could throw some cajun spice in it. Wow it was amazing, it should be on the menu.

I had the pork chops, the apples and potatoes were good but I ordered the pork chops medium and they were well done. I was halfway through them by the time the server came by and I didn't mention it to her because I didn't want to wait for them to cook more.

Our friends ended up having Pizza. It was good, not great. To be honest I am more of a thin crust guy and this was a thicker crust.

All in all I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrible service, ordered grilled chicken with all topping when I repeated three times what I exactly wanted only and second time they sent it on a hamburger bun not even cooked when it says it comes on sourdough.  Jaime the manager then blamed me for the mistake cause she said I repeated it to you like I'm the idiot. Avoid this place at all costs like I will in the future. Their are too many good restaurants on Eastern avenue to choose from to spend your hard earned money. I wish I could leave zero stars because they failed tonight 8/16/15."}
{"text":"BJs menu has a wide variety of food. Great for drinks too. Their app is great for rewards and getting in line on busy evenings. 

I love their soup and salad special for lunch."}
{"text":"Wait staff is always pleasant and the food is consistently great. Full bar and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Having been a waiter at one point in my life I can give an honest opinion about the wait staff at BJ'S.
Terrible... Only one waitress is even good as I have been here multiple times.  None of the wait staff care about what food they present. If it looks terrible, a wilted salad, well done when you ask for medium rare, not coming back to ask how it is, no refills on iced-tea, Nada. But have an expensive drink and then they hover. 
The seating is ridiculous,  empty tables and they tell you they can't seat you for no wait staff for the tables in that section. We always took over tables until other wait staff arrived. I am 6'5, 240lbs. Bigger tables available and yet they always try to cram me into a extra small both for two?? I have to argue with the hostess to get a larger table, even when there a lot of available tables left to go."}
{"text":"We've passed this location a thousand times and finally decided to try it.. besides our server being friendly, and the dessert being good, there really wasn't any other perk. For an appetizer, we ordered the fried brussel sprouts, which arrived stone cold, like they actually just came out of the refrigerator. For dinner, I ordered the quinoa bowl with salmon. It was good, (hot at least) but not anything memorable. My fiancé ordered the BBQ Brisket burger, medium rare. The burger was cooked to well done, and yet the sweet potato fries we [also] cold. We had already sent back the appetizer, so we didn't send anything else back, plus we were starving. The manager never came to our table, did not apologize for our awful appetizer (though it was taken off the bill), and never asked how our experience was. The pizzoki (pizza/ cookie) dessert was good but not good enough to make up for our awful dinner/ experience. First and last time at this location!"}
{"text":"I know this is a chain,  it it is actually pretty good! Lots of vegetarian options and kid friendly. Huge beer selection. Also open fairly late for the south hills area. Service is hit or miss but the food is consistent."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey burger which came with a salad. It was really good. I only going to give it a four because the bun was a little stiff. It would have been better with possibly a softer wheat bun to go with the healthier concept of the sandwich. Overall I enjoyed the restaurant. Nice atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat. Me and my family went there last night and had a great time. The waitress was so nice and our food was pretty good. The only thing was my frys were over cooked. Other than that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Slow service and food wasn't as described on menu. Waitress was not happy to do her job. Wouldn't bother returning."}
{"text":"We made a reservation as we had a large party with four kids. Nate was our server and he was outstanding! Smiling, had multiple tables and our huge, needy group. Never once had to ask or wait for a drink refill.  Very impressed by his superior customer service! We are new to Summerlin. We will be back as Nate made our evening a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Pizookies & killer rootbeer!!! The foods good too btw...."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst meals I've had. Almost everything was pretty much burnt. We were told it was a 20 mins wait but we got sat down in around 5 mins, that's probably about the best thing that happened. We got our order taken, my bf got iced tea, the guacamole burger cooked medium, mashed potatoes and a side of Brussels sprouts. His burger was good and mashed potatoes as well. The Brussels sprouts were almost all burnt, as crispy as kale chips(not roasted, just burnt). Although he still ate most because he was starving and we were waiting 20-30 mins until our entrees came out(honestly don't know why they brought the side out first). I got the beer plater, (mango, zitrus, bourbon, piranha) they didn't have the bourbon so they took it upon theirselves to choose a beer for me rather than letting me know to choose another. Mango was bitter, the replacement they chose for the bourbon tasted like I just made out with someone who recently smoked a cigar and ate steak and the other 2 were alright, regardless I didn't finish any. I got the \"juicey\" ribeye medium well, mash potatoes and turmeric cauliflower. Once again mash potatoes were good, cauliflower was okay (didn't like the sauce much) but the steak.. it was mostly burnt on the outside and well done on the inside. I don't mind well done but it was dry. The sides were so burnt that some bites were so bitter I just couldn't eat them. I questioned why I even took it home. Waitress was nice in the beginning, don't know what happened we were nice customer (even after bitter/burnt meal, we kept shrugging it off) but after she poured him water and I pointed out he was having iced tea she was just strange. She would come to the table and not say a thing and hand us our bill ect. She only said goodbye after that incident. Unfortunately I doubt coming back here will even be an option."}
{"text":"Was once a great place to enjoy a great Happy Hour. They had good priced appetizers and a good selection. They changed all that. Prices are higher and portions have shrunk. With over 50 Happy Hours to choose from we won't be going back to BJ's."}
{"text":"I AM a fan of BJ's Restaurant.  This is a go-to place for me as I eat alone many nights and as a woman, always feel comfortable sitting at the bar.  The bar tenders are all very nice and engage in conversation when they can.  The food is always great and very tasty...they've perfected the signature dishes.  The flatbreads are to die for and the burgers just could not get any better.  Salads ( fav: honey-crisp chicken) are the best.

Thanks to the staff for all you do!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are in the area we visit BJ's. Although the noise level is high, the service is always good. The menu has a wide range from appetizers, pizza, burgers, to full dinners of Parmesan crusted chicken, salmon, and steaks. Food is good quality and tasty. Has the right amount of pop flavor in each plate. I highly recommend the turkey burger. Best anywhere. They make their own beer, which is good. I wouldn't go there just for the beer, though. Be prepared to wait  , everyone knows a good place."}
{"text":"Went with some coworkers to just have a leisurely lunch. Ended up grabbing a BLT sandwich and the others grabbed the Mac and cheese and salad. My BLT sandwich was great tasting and crisp (not soggy). The fries were pretty good as well. Both my coworkers loved the salad and Mac and cheese. The staff was really nice and attentive. The only complaint I really had was the wait time for the food. It took a decent amount of time for the food to come out and the place wasn't that busy so was curious why the long wait (30 mins for the food approximately). Overall, I'd come back but would probably push on faster food service."}
{"text":"Reverse happy hour 10pm until close! Excellent deal on deep dish pizzas. Pretty good too!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had at a BJ's. Seriously. I will not step foot back in this particular location..EVER.

My wife got the $10 calzone and it was not longer than her fork. I added the photo so you can see no exaggerations. I got the boneless wings which was another huge error in judgement as they were not even up to par with something you would see from wendy's. 

Now....I used to friggin live at the location up in Summerlin and never had issues BUT I usually only got apps. , the happy hour pizzas, pazookies, and BEER (and their beer isn't all that either but their Pumpkin one is great..) and never had any problems. But if this is the norm for these other dishes.....I am disgusted. 

Will I go into the Summerlin location again for pazookies and such? Maybe..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. All the bartenders were very attentive. Their own beer is fantastic! The bartender got my food order incorrect but he quickly fixed it. Overall great experience will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience at BJ's last night. It was National FREE Pizookie Day and I was craving one so we ventured out. After waiting almost 50 minutes when we were told it would be 30, we were seated. Ordered basic things along with a \"sprite\" (that is not the brand they have) which we were told the syrup was out and they had no more - we got one from the bar... - anyway, our food came but we waited another 6 minutes before we got utensils so food got cold. Not totally blaming the server but MAN service was bad. Our drinks ran out and other servers noticed and were pointing - 10 minutes later we got a refill. That was the theme of the night - waiting. On the table was a \"flyer\" that said if you download app and pay with it you get a free mini pizookie, we asked if we do that can we get a mini and the free regular. Our server said \"I will just bring you 2 regular ones\" - OK, great! We figured he was making up for our LONG, cold food night. After ordering pizookies then waiting another 20 minutes to get said pizookies - happy at last. I got the reward I was looking for. Finally the bill was dropped off - our server charged us FULL price for the 2nd pizookie we would not have ever ordered. We could not find him or anyone else and it was now 9:pm. I just put the exact amount of bill down - and left. Last time they ever get my business. Horrible service! Not sure if the food was any good as it was cold by the time we got to eat it. The pizookie was awesome - as always but the price was not!! Never again BJ's."}
{"text":"My family goes here quite often, and it's always got a healthy amount of people. The food is always good, as well as the service. The only complaints I have are sometimes it takes 30+ minutes to get your food, and that it is a bit pricy. Other than that it's a great place for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Okay so to start things off I ordered the avocado egg rolls which were very good.. It's served with a sweet soy sauce based sauce .. Surprisingly sweet but it really worked well with the egg rolls.. Now about the service .... Employees seem happy and on top of things for the most part.. Our server I believe was relatively new.. She seemed uncomfortable in social interactions.. Our entrees took a good 35 minutes to reach the table .. Which is unacceptable from a chain like Bjs. I get it.. It's Saturday .. But Christ.. Anyway.. I'll come back ..maybe on a Tuesday afternoon though ."}
{"text":"Good Food, Usually good service...I love the Seared Ahi  on the Small bites menu, and the California Club Flatbread pizza."}
{"text":"We recently visited this location and had the best experience and most amazing food ever. To start, I thought I'd try the Ahi Poke. What an excellent decision. The Ahi Tuna was a great portion and had soy sauce lightly drizzled on top (you didn't notice it - you only tasted it). It came with about seven cheesy chips and avocado as well as cabbage. I highly recommend this for a quickly-delivered bite to eat while you're trying to find your main course in the menu.
For my main course, I had a pizza called \"The Italian Market.\" It was amazing. Tasted like pizza from Italy itself. Very little sauce - but you could definitely taste it. Very thin crust - but perfectly cooked so as to not dump your toppings on your lap (and it tasted of a great toasted element).
To drink I had BJ's own Root Beer and it was perfect. I'm not a big fan of black licorice and most root beer's leave a black licorice taste in your mouth. This one did not. It left a sweet root taste in your mouth that worked well with the food choices for the evening.
Matt served us and he was a great waiter. We were able to download the brand-new BJ's app, pay with it (using Apple Pay) and got a free mini pizookie on our next visit!
Needless to say, we'll be back to claim our free mini pizookie and I might just order the exact same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?!"}
{"text":"Good eats and great service. I had a burger, sounds pretty mundane and typical but it was good. Cooked the way I ordered it. Service was very efficient too. Good selection of house brews too. Their Oktoberfest was very tasty, crisp and clean, as was their ale. Been here many times and it's always good."}
{"text":"Bj's food  is comparable to chili's...not great but definitely not bad. How they set themselves apart from the list of mediocre food establishments is their service. I have never had a bad experience at any Bj's locations. The staff is so helpful and attentive. I've come during happy hours and peak dinner hours and have always received great service. 

And even though nothing that I've ever ordered from Bj's has ever stood out to me, I have to acknowledge that they have put together a very extensive menu together for their guests. Their is a dish for everyone in your party.

They have a great beer selection... a variety of in house and craft brews for you to choose from. Their cocktails are also great...especially the watermelon mojito.

Bj's is a great neighborhood spot to go to if there is one in your area."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a late night dinner. Their steak was surprisingly good and fair priced unlike another steakhouse I visited in Downtown Chandler. Food was spot on. Service was even better. And it's so close to everything I loved it."}
{"text":"I went there with my wife tonight. We order iced tea, brussel sprouts. And a thin pizza. The sprouts were delivered by someone who was not our server.  We got the sprouts before anything else, and by anything else I mean water, iced tea, any thing. I asked to speak to the manager who was standing right behind our table, and no such luck. What ever he was doing must have been earth end important because he never came. The tea finally came but I had to tell the waitress that i no longer wished to dine at that establishment. I felt bad for the waitress as I'm sure it was not her fault but we never set food in that business again."}
{"text":"I had a deep dish Ravioli and it was excellent. Service was decent except for the hostesses who were a bit rude. Other than that, I had a very enjoyable dinner. Very nice restaurant in an upscale area."}
{"text":"Thank you BJ's for keeping your entire restaurant open during the hours posted on your door.  Your neighbors (twin nasty peaks) closes their kitchen an hour before they close the actual restaurant.  Makes no sense...but thank you for the great food and service at 11:30pm."}
{"text":"BJs is as close as you're going to get to pleasing everyone.

Neat subtly communist decor in a very large restaurant. Came in on a Sunday afternoon and got right into the bar. Lots of TVs with sports, and bizarrely clustered taps. They have a spectacular selection of beer; including their own which is usually quite good. They have several different samplers, including one with enough sizable samples to tranquilize Nancy Grace during a double murder trial. And they really mean full bar. In fact, they mean full everything.

The secret of BJs is it's menu; everything is really pretty good, and that's a feat because they have a huge diversity of entrees. If you have that friend in your group who has specialized diet concerns and can only eat blue foods from islands that don't feature indigenous amphibians BJs can feed them. BJs is great for large groups for exactly that reason: everyone gets what they want. No matter how stupid it is.

Mega Bonus: The waiter split our check with no muss nor fuss. Always impressive in the land of the unified restaurant bill. 

It may not have a ton of personality, but if you need lots of either different types of food or a huge selection of beer it'd be hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"My friend and I are here on vacation from the Midwest. Both of us have serving experience and I have to say I've never been so impressed. Our server Brady was amazing! He was around our age and was super friendly throughout the whole meal! If I ever make it back to this side of the country I will definitely be coming back here. Amazing food, amazing drinks, and even better service!!"}
{"text":"BJ's continues to be a family favorite. The monzarella, and tomato salad is to die for! Their new brussel sprouts with the sriracha sauce, it's okay. The sauce is delicious, however I would suggest blanching them first, and then put them on the grill for more tenderness.
My husband had the portebello swiss burger. He said it was really good, less the balsalmic vinegar. 
We will continue to come to BJ'S. I love how they are always adding new menu items. Their craft beers are really good. 
Our waitress, Rhonda was very attentive, and helpful.
Thank you for a  wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Service can be a tad slow but the selection is awesome! Desserts are  too!. I wouldn't necessarily come with a big group of people. I've done that once and it wasn't a great overall experience even though I planned that a few weeks in advance."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. The dessert is even more AMAZING. I became obsessed with this restaurant when I was pregnant, that was the first time I ate here. I think the rewards program is amazing, we are almost to the top reward 25$ off . they have so many selections, makes you come back to try it all!"}
{"text":"The pizza is to die for and everytime I go I get the pizza without the diced tomatoes. They have really good chicken bacon ranch pizza!! They also have very good sandwiches and steak are really good too!!"}
{"text":"ok so the food was awesome.... but our waitress completely sucked. we saw her twice in and hour... but the food is awsome"}
{"text":"Fantastic food but I have only had good service one of the many times I have visited. One time I  visited with my mother at 9pm and we waited to ve sat for 5 minutes. There was no server or employee in sight. We stepped in and looked around to ask someone for help but saw nobody, so we left. 
Whenever I have gone with my friends we always have at least one mistake with our order. Every server except one has taken 15 minutes or more to refill our drinks. It has regularly taken 45min to an hour for our food when the restaurant is not busy. It is terrible terrible service. But 2 stars because the food, when correct, tastes amazing and that one server (Melody?) was fantastic.
(Note: I have come here at least once a month for the past year and a half)"}
{"text":"We always come here love the food love the service love the rewards program you get a lot for your money and the food is always good also Britney is a great waitress, goes out of her way to be very accommodating , do yourself a favor and come here , you'll thank me oh and ask for Britney"}
{"text":"We get take out often from here, and the menu is sort of hit and miss for take out.  

So far, we have found that the deep dish pizza, the tortilla soup, the pot stickers, the burgers, the chicken lettuce wraps, and the root beer ribs are great!  

Not so great - wings of any kind (always soggy!) and the flat bread pizza (does not travel well).

I love their homemade cream sodas too!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about BJ's! First off, the menu is literally 20 pages. They have everything from burgers to pad Thai! They have a ton of beers to choose from, and the Blonde Ale is the best one in my opinion! Our waitress was SO nice and really treated me and my friends well! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love the Peruvian quinoa bowl. It is beyond delicious. I get it with shrimp. There are a lot of shrimp on this dish. There are other proteins to choose from but shrimp is my favorite. 
My hubby always gets the pasta. It comes in the tins and baked. I wish I would have taken a picture before we destroyed the food. 
The menu is quite eclectic and sure to please everyone."}
{"text":"This location is just down the road from me and I'm usually there on a Sunday evening for our date-night. We sit at the bar because honestly the 2 bar tenders that usually serve us are great. I feel so bad that I can't remember their names (considering I go at least 4 times a month!) but I'll be sure to ask next time! 
The girl makes great margaritas and the guy is really good with food recommendations. They just have a great energy and are very amusing, just as bar tenders should be. We'll see you soon for pizza and pizookie...try the salted caramel one, it's the best (and I usually fight my man til the last bite)."}
{"text":"Today a good friend and I were both tempted by the WATERMELON & FETA SALAD. It's in the small plates area of the menu & is the perfect side for a starter salad! The presentation was beautiful. I wasn't sure if it would taste as good as it looked, it is an interesting combination, but it sure was! The watermelon was chilled and considering we'd just come in out of the heat it was exactly what was needed :)

Oddly enough, we drank coffee :D 
In our defense, this was a late brunch for us, so it was almost a must. The coffee was good! Not too weak and not too strong."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Food quality and service didn't match up to the price. Next time I would skip the meal and go back for dessert only."}
{"text":"What isn't there to love about BJ's?  The menu may take a few minutes to read if you don't know what you love there since it's large and has so many options - but I promise anyone can find something to eat here!

The Pzookies are to DIE for - get one.  If you don't, you'll wish you had.  Promise."}
{"text":"Place is a bit over priced and over-rated for the menu that they have, but the food is solid every time I come here. If I were rating this place just based on the food, it would be 4.5 stars, but other things kind of deflate my score of it:

-usually long waits (excess of 20 min) on evenings
-service, though waiters can be nice, are extremely busy and have little time to attend to each table.  You can totally tell that they're overworked.
-it takes about 15 -20 minutes until your waiter comes by to get your orders for food, then you wait about 20-30 minutes for food to arrive--it's all a waiting game

I ordered a steak, which was pretty big considering, and I'm always a fan of the calamari.  Also ordered a raspberry pazookie, which was pretty amazing, gotta admit, especially if you're not too into chocolate--this makes for a nice alternative to a rich dessert.  

As a place to chill, grab a few drinks and side dishes and catch up with friends, I would choose this place, but for a dinner experience, be prepared to wait, wait, wait."}
{"text":"I walked in to BJs expecting mediocre service as usual. After a long week at work, I just wanted decent food and a good beer. I have to say I was blown away for the first time here. Paula, our cocktail waitress made my day! Her suggestions were spot on, she was welcoming, and I felt like she cared about our experience. Honestly, I will make sure I sit in her section every time I dine there again. I will be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This did not thrill. Pork chops overdone, mashed potato glue, chicken fettuccine only so so, the burger was over done, the fried chicken was good per Lexi. Not a place we will return to. ;o{"}
{"text":"Went to eat here with my husband and another couple. The wife had the pepperoni extreme flat bread. She said it didn't have as much pepperoni as the location in Canton. The husband had the blacken salmon and he said it was good. My husband had the brisket burger and fries. He said it was good. I had the triple decker sandwich with fries. The sandwich was to have Italian dressing on it. It was on the hoagie bread but not on the meat. Very dry. The fries I had were very good. I asked for water with lots of ice and that is what I received. The restaurant didn't seem crowded, we were seated right away. But we had to park almost to the exit driveway to Brookpark  Rd. There was nothing outstanding about the food."}
{"text":"Me and some friends strolled in on a Sunday afternoon.  They were serving brunch and the regular menu.  Oh-my, brunch, you say?  So I take a look at their brunch menu, but nothing I saw looked inviting so I decided to order the gluten free pizza with pepperoni, jalapenos, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms along with the beet arugula salad side.  The pizza was tasty and better than some gluten free pizzas I have had, but it was a little small and they were a little too greedy on the toppings - there was even one slice that had looked like it had nothing but cheese on it.  

The beet arugula salad side was really just that - a side, but for $4.95, you'd think it would be more than 5 bites, right or is it just me thinking that it should be more like 10 bites?  It's just arugula, beets, some kind of nut, and dressing - so I would think they would be more generous.  

All in all, it's a brewery - with \"ok\" food, but I did expect that."}
{"text":"I wouldnt know what the food's like... after 30 minutes after placing our order consisting of a burger and salad... we left. Never got our food. Ambiance ok... service sux!!!"}
{"text":"We came hoping to take advantage of happy hour before it ended. With about 5 minutes to spare, Kim (server) quickly sat us at a bar booth & offered to get an order in for us. Unfortunately Thea app we chose didn't count as HH pricing. So, we order our drinks, a small plate app & our pizza. 
Kim states she will get our app (queso & chips) out first to enjoy before our dinner. After waiting a very long time for app, I start to get concerned they are going to bring our app & dinner out together, we tell Kim it's taking a long time for chips & dip & if they're going b to bring them out back to back, we don't even want the app at this point. She stated she would go find out what's the delay is & let a manager know of the issue, and come talk to us. A few minutes later, our app comes out...and sure enough, a couple minute after that, our pizza comes! The guy who brought our pizza didn't even say anything. He quickly out it down & left. Not even a \"do you need anything else?\" Actually we did! 
Kim came over, we reminded her we wanted ranch on the side. She quickly brought it & said she was going to remind the manager to come by the table. Seriously, your manager needs a reminder?! The place wasn't that busy! 
Eventually the manager decided to stop by. I don't know her name, because she never told us. She squatted by the table as if she had no idea why she was there. I tell her the issue, her response was like, \"oh bummer\". No effort to see how she could improve our experience. 
Management should know how to handle a situation & attempt a customer happy. The evening continued to go downhill from there. 
As for the food, the queso was just ok. Deep dish pizza was good."}
{"text":"My vote for best late-night beer in Henderson. Great atmosphere and super-friendly service, extensive bar selection. 

The sticking point is the menu. Food here is over-engineered and ok quality. 

I'd love to see BJ's throw out the menu and do fewer traditional bar & grill items better."}
{"text":"This is rapidly becoming one of my favorite places to have lunch on Sundays.  They have Happy Hour all day long during the NFL Football games.

This visit we ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders ($5.75 happy hour price) and BJ's Favorite Mini Pizza ($5.00 happy hour price).  To wash it down, I had an IPA.

The food came out quickly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and dove right into it.  They were awesome!  The combination of Pulled Pork, Onion Ring Strings, and tangy BBQ Sauce went well together.  The Onion Ring strings had a nice sweet taste and the BBQ Sauce was tangy and balanced the palate.....the Pulled Pork was very juicy and full of flavor.  Sooo good.  I ordered Wedge Cut Fries with the Sliders and they were cooked just right....not under/over cooked.

My Mom couldn't finish her Pizza, so she gave me the last couple of bites.....it was very good as well.  The thick crust was soft & buttery with the edges slightly crispy....hmmmm!

Overall, another awesome experience @ BJ's!

Will I return?  Hell ya!"}
{"text":"I went here during the first week of training, service was good considering that they were in training and pretty packed for the night. I ordered the Angel hair pasta with shrimp and feta cheese it was delicious plus a large portion. I also ordered the chocolate chip pazookie w/ vanilla ice cream...... mmmm it was good!!

I want to go back to check it out again in a few weeks..... hopefully the service remains the same."}
{"text":"Have to say I was very disappointed overall. The place was very noisy; so much so that it was difficult to have a conversation at your own table. Our server was good once she got to us. We waited about ten minutes for her to come by our table. 
We ordered a large pizza and several sides. The pizza came out about 30 minutes later. It was LUKEWARM at best. The crust on one side was so soggy it was pathetic. The manager was called over. He asked if we wanted another pizza (another 30 minute wait?? Not likely!!) He then left the table with no other comment. The waitress came by and said she would take off the cost of the pizza. It took two tries to get the ticket adjusted. 
Too many other good pizza places around to give this place another chance. Life is too short!"}
{"text":"Went in expecting typical pub style food and instead food was amazing!  Was a first time visit here - but would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So I go to Bj's to have lunch with my Family on my day off, I get greeted and asked if I am a rewards Member I said yes! The Waitress come over and asked the same thing I said yes. I place my order she states I have ZERO POINTS before I get my food! I never asked for a discount so totally messed up my day already! Things should end in a positive at the end of your meal, thank you so much you have earned 1 point towards your future rewards card! is that hard. Plus the fact that her long hair was all over my food  I went to have a real meal friends sorry Bj's not cool."}
{"text":"Why cant you find a place thats good every time?  like.. you can count on it.  I went here 2x and it was great.  The last time I went was enough to never go back. Service was horrible food wasnt the best. Its a shame. Everyone kept telling me that they weren't impressed and I couldn't figure out why.  Now I know :("}
{"text":"Going to this establishment in person is a lot better than ordering take out from them!  I warn everyone DO NOT order food for home delivery!  The service is terrible, always late and the food delivered is ICE COLD!  Unless you love soggy, cold fries and burgers I suggest you go to their dine in establishment!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years with my girlfriend because of the top notch service we receive. Jillian, our bartender there, always greets us and takes our order promptly and knows regulars by name."}
{"text":"12/17: UPDATE
We came at lunch and had an enjoyable experience. Our server Rob was personable and attentive. The food runners brought our food out while it was still fresh and then multiple staff hurried to get us anything we were missing. Our glasses were kept full. Hopefully this place has turned the corner and I'm raising my rating. My burger patty was made too thin and wasn't holding together because of that fact. Pieces were crumbling off when I picked it up. The other two burgers at our table were much thicker with integrity enough to eat. The flavor of the burger was excellent and I appreciate they obviously make them fresh. The soft buns were perfect and fresh. I wish they'd offer fresh cut fries instead of frozen. Great job on improving the service!

4/17: UPDATE
I'm disappointed to not be able to change my rating on this restaurant. They've been open now in this location long enough to work out the kinks. While the food is somewhat unique and a lot of it is good, it's not all good and the service is still VERY poor! We sat at the bar on this visit during happy hour. We had to flag down the bar tender every time we needed to order something. The menus were sticky between every page! The sliders were small (with about 1/3 of the bun empty), boring (only a tiny patty and a couple pickle slices and shredded iceberg on the side), and dry and we needed to ask for ketchup to make them worth eating. The potato skins were decent, but didn't come out hot. The root beer wings were good. Tried their German beer this time and enjoyed that. I just cannot believe the number of staff they have on and how hard it is to get any of their attention!"}
{"text":"Great beer, menu has something for everyone, and prices are reasonable.  What not to like.  Had the grilled pork chops -- but prepared like the new low calorie dish.  These were excellent. Great spicy sauce. Red potatoes were good too.  Abbey Normal season beer was great."}
{"text":"Seriously just left this place and had the best experience. Kim was our bartender and was the best service I've had in a while. She was very casual and professional. She knew so much about the menu and recommended some many vegan options. I would recommend her to anybody. Thank you for the outstanding service Kim"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times were really good!! Tuna poke is awesome! Pizza is awesome! Guacamole is amazing! I love their French dip sandwich. There's a ridiculous amount of options and usually that scares me on a menu, because I think well they can't make EVERYTHING well, they should specialize in something, but I've tried a variety of things each time and have not had anything I wasn't a fan of."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I was super excited when I saw this new plaza going up on 99th Ave and Northern- super close to home and the prospect of a cool bar within the plaza (because Westgate and I aren't really friends).

The plaza is still under construction, but BJ's didn't excite me very much.  It is your everyday chain brewery.  I hadn't been to one before but I might as well have been.  

Positives:
*The beer I tried; the nit bit or bit nit- I can't remember  which way that goes, was pretty solid.  It tasted like a very light hefeweizen.  
*The cute little chandeliers.
*Service was friendly and quick.

Negatives:  
*My nachos lacked cheese.  I never understand how restaurants can mess nachos up by not giving you enough cheese.  COMMON SENSE.
*Nothing particularly special about this place.

Because of proximity, I am guessing I will be back at BJ's.  I think I'm going to put the pizza on my to-do list and hopefully that will earn a star or two."}
{"text":"Busy place but since there were only 3 of us, we got seated right away. Menu- found it disorganized and descriptions were in tiny print. My husband snd I split a full rack of ribs- tender, with a nice peppery rub. Glad the sauce was served on the side. A little on the sweet side. The clam chowder we chose for one of the 2 sides was a tad salty and not as hot as I would have liked. The wedge salad was good. Our friend said the Thai noodles he ordered were perfect."}
{"text":"This location is pretty solid on service and food quality, so no real complaints. I really like BJ's for what it is: a chain restaurant with a thousand options that's open kinda late. Happy hour could be a little happier on the pricing I think.

Pizzas are good, but not grand. Tomato bisque here is the god, though. Get the bisque! Monkey bread pizookie is also a winner in my book. Glad to see that option has stuck around on the menu for a while now. Love their fries, too.

Totally worth it to sign up for their emails. Free pizookies and decent dollar amount off promotions all the time!"}
{"text":"Kiddos to me server Kris, she made this experience bearable! 

Came in starving, only to find out Bjs has changed their portions on the salmon. Lunch is now, an appetizer :-(.  It was Dry and salty 

Next time I want to leave hungry, I'll come for lunch"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised b y this place. 

I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants. But, I was literally about to eat my arm and I had never heard of this place so, we decided to give it a shot. 
So glad we did.
I got the seared ahi tuna salad and it was fantastic. So packed with flavor, like seriously so many flavors I couldn't put my fork down. The tuna tasted delicious and I loved the seasoning they used. The pickled cucumbers were a crunchy delicious sweet surprise.

We ordered some dessert as well. I forgot what they were called. But, we ordered 3 of them.
Warm gooey cookie types. One was monkey bread with vanilla ice cream, the other two were peanut butter with vanilla and the last was salted caramel with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips. 
I have never enjoyed something as much as I enjoyed those 3 little deserts. Lol.
My sister was actually laughing and saying she would like to motorboat them.
Bravo guys, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain-but it's a great chain!  The food never fails to disappoint, and there's something for everyone on the menu.  It's a very family friendly atmosphere, yet you wouldn't hesitate to take a date here.  It's always busy, but service is on point :)  The avocado eggrolls and pizookies are a must-do.  One tip-do check your take-out before you go home.  Once, they left out the very important sauce for the avocado eggrolls.  Ugh! Try the red velvet Pizookie!"}
{"text":"I order take out from here frequently and Jake is the waiter who works takeout during the day; he is the best! He has to be the best employee for customer service and thoroughness I have ran across in a long time. Go here! Order from their low calorie portion of the menu too! The ahi salad and Chinese chicken salads are amazing. And takeout is also one of the best in the city. The presentation is phenomenal, quality amazing, and service top notch."}
{"text":"Great food and spirits I usually sit at the bar and always a+ service Emily is the best bartender in this place."}
{"text":"Good if you're looking for someplace local and safe. The entrees are a step above TGIF, Apple Bee's or Chili's.  They do offer a nice selection of brews. The menu offers a large selection for the person who eats vegan, vegetarian or diabetic diets.
The grilled brussel sprouts were very good. If you're not a person who enjoys brussel sprouts I suggest you try another item. I happen to love them.  I also enjoyed the tomato, basil and mozzarella salad.  It comes with a balsamic glaze dressing that is very tasty."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and watch football. The Bloody Mary's are super delicious! Roy is a great bartender and goes the extra mile to remember orders of the regulars. He makes our dining experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"Visited this location at lunch time.  The server was unattentive and didn't even refill my water. This location will not be visited by me again.  I am accustomed to great service at BJs especially when its really empty like at lunch."}
{"text":"The food is unique & good. I have eaten there for lunch and dinner and it seems to be a popular place. My husband had a burger and I had the chicken salad. Good service and decent meals. I enjoyed seeing many of their dishes trying to infuse different flavors."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. I mean from the minute we got seated you could tell our group was the least priority. I was the dd for the night and I got my non alcoholic drink last. It actually came after the appetizer. Not sure how that's even possible? Then a couple of the beers out of the taster were warmer, two out of our group got it and they both said that. Next, the steaks were chewy and could not be cut with their steak knives. The only good thing to come from this place was their fries. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Bad choice all around."}
{"text":"Great restuarant!  Always had good service, meals delivered timely and hot!   The blackened salmon is great!  Always a hit for us!"}
{"text":"Kim was our bartender Sunday night and was the tits! The pumpkin beer is awesome and she gave us amazing recommendations. If you come here ask for KIM!!!  Excellent customer service! 

This is DJ, I agree, Kim was the tits. The service was exceptional, the salsa was enlightening, and I feel like I truly understand the meaning of life."}
{"text":"Wow! I moved out of Bethel Park a few years ago and came back into town to visit for the holidays. At my dad's recommendation, we checked this place out. Boy we're we disappointed! Let me count the ways:

- Shortly after we received our drinks, as we were looking through the menu, my stepmother spilled a little bit of her drink. When she asked the waitress for a napkin, motioning towards the few drops that had spilled on her menu, the waitress declined to bring them, saying that it was no big deal. So my stepmother sat there with a wet lap. 

- When our appetizer (chips with sriracha cheese) came, the cheese was so cold that there was a layer congealed on the top. Since we'd still not been brought napkins or silverware or plates, we ate it hunched over the middle of the table. 

- My dad is lactose intolerant, and he even had a brief conversation with the waitress in which she explained that she didn't eat cheese either. As such, he ordered his burger with no cheese. But even despite this conversation his burger arrived covered in cheddar. The runner (notably NOT our waitress, who at this point we had not seen in some time) apologized and said that they would have a new one out in a few minutes. When we finally caught the waitress, she told us that she had pressed the wrong button on the screen.

- I ordered the vegetarian pita, and the pita was so dry that it broke into tiny pieces as soon as I picked it up. So that became a fork meal.

- My stepmother's mushroom salad came with no dressing whatsoever. Her burger was cold and the fries were burnt to the consistency of potato chips--and no warmer!

- My stepmother and I were completely finished eating by the time my dad got his burger, and yet all of the plates remained on our table until shortly before the waitress brought the check. It was at this point that she asked how everything was, and I explained a few of our issues.

- When she finally brought the check, the waitress engaged us in a long conversation (by far the most time she had spent at our table all night) about how she had to make her car payments, etc.--clearly to \"suck up\" and try to recoup some of her tip. She also told us that she had removed the pita and chips from the bill...but in reviewing it I discovered that she had even mixed that up, and in fact she'd removed the chips and the salad. Better than nothing, I guess!

I absolutely understand that kitchens get busy and people make mistakes, but the fact that literally every dish we received was problematic strikes me as a little overboard. Despite this fact, because my dad and stepmother are great people, we tipped 20%. But I can say with certainty that none of us will visit this place again. Although I doubt that matters much, because BJ's is very clearly a quantity-over-quality type of establishment!"}
{"text":"I got the clam chowder, which was good. Others in our trio got the Cajun pasta dish and a cheeseburger, which they apparently enjoyed. We had to sit outside because the restaurant was so packed, but BJs has nice heaters, so it really wasn't a problem. 

Our server (Jeff) gave us lots of attention and was quite friendly and courteous. BJs was very accommodating."}
{"text":"Got seated quickly, double pork chop was delicious, but not so kid friendly establishment. No complaints on the service.  Dessert is out if this world! Perfect end to a long day!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant but very loud and dimly-litinside which  makes it hard to read the menus. The menu is too large and that makes it hard to decide what you want. A hamburger which was I have had the barbecue chopped salad which I probably would not get again my husband has the BJ's Pizza which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"First of all the BJ's Mobile App is a good tool to have if you plan on dining here.  You can add yourself to the waitlist, order ahead for dine in or take out, see your rewards points, and actually pay on the app.  Being able to add yourself to the waitlist before you get there comes in handy since there seems to be a perpetual wait at the Eastern location.   

This review is for our last two visits because they were so close together.  Both times we were seated within a couple of minutes because we used the app waitlist and on both occasions we had good service and flavorful food and libations.  However the comfort level of their seating varies greatly depending on where you are seated.  The larger booths are roomy, but the smaller 2 person booths don't have enough space, especially if you order a pizza that takes up most of the table.  I wish they would only use these tables if they don't have any other open spaces.

Beverages: LightSwitch Lager (4/5) & Top Shelf Margarita (3/5)
Appetizer: Crispy Fried Artichokes with lemon garlic aioli (4/5) and House Salad (3/5)
Pizza: Vegetarian Signature Deep Dish (mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, onions, seasoned tomatoes) 4/5
Sandwich: Roast Beef Dip (5/5)
Burger: Crispy Jalapeno (4/4)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was pretty relaxed and they have a wide selection of beers, which is always awesome. Every time I come here the service is always excellent and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Always love coming here!  The staff has been great, and the food is pretty good. We don't normally have to wait long to be seated, and we enjoy the environment.  The fish and chips were definitely worth the Weight Watchers points and heartburn.  Yes... it was worth it.  I don't normally eat like that but I don't eat out a lot, so when I do, I endulge!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY disappointed, came here for my birthday dinner asked for a booth and waited for it.. Got seated at a table.. Asked to be moved to a booth the waiter Justin was TERRIBLE we waited like a ridiculous amount of time to just get water he wasn't very friendly or personable. He catered to a table that came in after us which was extremely frustrating he brought our drinks separately every couple of minutes so we asked for our check and instead of apologizing for the crappy service he gave us attitude and just dropped the check off for the drinks we ordered. I'm not one for getting free things but seriously a 12$ tab for shitty service and drinks we barely drank should've been comped.
Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Our trip to Vegas ended with neither a bang nor a whimper and that was fine by me. After spending time at Red Rocks Canyon, we wanted a simple dinner before heading to the airport to catch our flight. We initially went to The Vintner Grill, but that was way too upscale for what we had in mind. We'd been hiking all day and I wasn't feeling (or looking) swanky. While I prefer non-chain options, this brewpub clearly has their act together.

BJ's has a sports bar feel and an enormous projection TV above the bar as well as multiple flat screens throughout the large restaurant. Sunday night brought out people in droves, and I can understand why, since this place seems equally enjoyable for families, singles and groups. It was a great place to watch some football and the restaurant just hums with activity.

The service was incredibly efficient and we saw the entire staff hustling. What is unfortunate is that the food isn't nearly as special as the atmosphere and service. Mr. K ordered a beer and I had to be different and chose hard cider, but neither was great. One of their specialties is deep dish pizza and again it was only OK. For the standard entrees, portion sizes are enormous and I was happy we shared dessert since the BJ's Brownie is served piled high with whipped cream.

For the food alone, this is a three-star joint, but it really doesn't give this place enough credit. It would be a semi-regular hangout if they were located in my home town. Funnily enough, my local sports bar has a very similar name."}
{"text":"Lots of choices around when it comes to this type of restaurant but this place outdoes them all.  About as good a burger as you will find anywhere.  My favorite, the Black and Blue, and I don't usually even like blue cheese."}
{"text":"BJ's Henderson has really very good food, lots of variety, well trained staff and is apparently well run.  Many Yelp reviews indicate a successful dining experience is very likely here. Somebody may have had a less quality experience, but ours was VERY GOOD! Those less than good results may be \"an off night\" or just bad luck, I can't say, what we saw and experienced was all positive.  
Judy was our server, perfectly attentive,with sound recommendations. I would, and will come back without any hesitation."}
{"text":"5 stars all because of our server JAMES!

James was excellent. James made recommendations, very professional, had a great sense of humor, constantly checks to see how we are doing, refills our water, there was never once a need for us to ask for anything, James was always attentive. I have got to say, James provided the BEST service I have ever received! 

This BJs is not close to where I live but my friend and I just happened to stop by since she had a gift card and while doing errands this was the closest BJs. I would come back because of James amazing service.

We ordered the avocado egg rolls. Yummmmo! Jam packed with flavor. Defiantly must order again.

I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad, which was very refreshing. Would defiantly recommend trying this salad dish.

Overall, had to review this restaurant and give a big THANKS to James for being amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  

Appetizers came long after entree.  Entree was not cooked.  Appetizers were overcooked.  Slow service from disorganized and frazzled waitress.  Only the beer was right.

Manager never came around.


Never again.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I like BJs because I like options... and boy does BJs have options. The menu is a mile long and they have a little bit of everything. Looking for pasta? Pizza? Chicken? Fish? A burger? They literally have everything. 

I've tried quite a few things including their pastas and fish. Their mashed potatoes are really good and I also really enjoy their asparagus. My favorite thing at BJs, though, is actually their in house crafted cream soda. It's the perfect taste. 

The salmon on their low calorie menu that comes with the rice pilaf is delicious and not over cooked, has a lot of flavor. I've also had the cherry glazed salmon which is equally as good.

Their pizza cookies are really good too. And again. Options. A ton of them. They even have a churro Pizza cookie at the moment. Two perfectly yummy treats in one!!!"}
{"text":"Like any typical chain restaurant, it can be pretty loud during their peak hours. The menu has a ton to offer and everything that I've gotten there has been delicious. The prices aren't bad for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. However, the manager is a power tripping jerk. It's part of the rewards programs perks that you can gift some of your points to another person.
There are many websites, and groups where people share their rewards with others. I am part of many such groups. 
I had gone to this establishment, and cashed in many of my gifted points on 6 different occasions without issue. 
On the last trip, the manager shamed my son for cashing in loyalty points rather than paying him in cash for the order. He then cancelled my sons loyalty account, as well as mine, and my husbands. 
The manager felt that since WE didn't earn the points, he had the right to take them away. He didn't. Those points were EARNED by many other people across the US who were kind enough to share them. 
By deleting the points, he was saying that the hundreds of dollars these people had been spending to earn those points didn't matter. 
I see what he did as theft. 
He took EARNED points (used like gift cards) that weren't his, and three them away. 
All while PUBLICLY SHAMING a teenage boy for being poor enough to have to rely on points to pay."}
{"text":"We like to try new places.
We are not too impressed. The service was so so, prices pretty high, food ok, but I expected more, and the ambiance wasn't to my liking."}
{"text":"So we went in the other day for lunch, we waited 10-15 minutes before our waitress came to the table for our drink order so we ordered our drinks and avocado egg rolls, then about 10 min later we ordered our food, 45 minutes later she stopped by to bring refills and brought the wrong drinks and said our food should be here soon. She went to the register and looks like she put in our order then 20 more minutes then our food came but was wrong. Then she took $5 off our bill really I don't need a discount maybe you should pay attention to your customers, I mean there weren't that may people in the restaurant and most of the servers were just standing around."}
{"text":"Spinach filled mushrooms - super YUM. Also had the cherry chipotle glazed salmon which was delicious. Loved the sweet and spicy flavor."}
{"text":"We went here last night to grab a couple drinks and snack on food. Sat at the bar and Alenka?? Was our bartender. She didn't really care about providing a great dining experience. She did cater to her regular customers giving one of them part of our shot that we ordered. The shot glasses that was used to make a Washington apple was definitely not big enough to hold a mixed shot. It is better to use for just a straight or chilled shot. So she gave us the half shot of the Washington apple and  gave the rest of our shot to one of her regular customer two seats down. (I bartend so I know this). That's fine! When we received our pizza she didn't care to ask if we need chili flakes or parmesan because she was busy breaking the bar down at 10:30. I've dined her before and I have to say this is the worse. I do love the food though. Will be back just not sitting at the bar if she's back there."}
{"text":"Everything was AMAZING. Rachael was so great made sure we kept having drinks. Very busy but great. Didn't miss a thing. She was very nice friendly and welcoming. I told the manager how great our service was and how delicious the food was. Can't wait to come back again great job everyone"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome food and a lot of different drinks to choose from. You can order pricey wine, or a good local beer. Their is also very good and always well done every time. Good place to hang out with friends, not such a family place, but definitely friends. Love the atmosphere as well, they display their drinks in a very cool way."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. Food is amazing, the pazooki's are to die for, service is usually pretty good, decor is nice, great looking bar. Not a big drinker but i hear the beers are great! This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been back a couple of times, to a couple of different locations, and I love this place.

Busy - for a reason!  But I never have to wait very long.  The service has been very good, the food consistent and the quality very good.

Very happy with the beer selection, I don't remember the name of the \"Red\" but it was awesome...

4.5 stars.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was good. But I don't feel like our server paid much attention to us until we had to call out excuse me a few times. I came with my niece and I myself look pretty young so I felt like she didn't care much about us cause she thought we were just kids or something. Lol. But nonetheless I'll probably be coming back to try other items, hopefully I won't have that server again!"}
{"text":"This BJ'S satisfies with their wide variety of foods. Everything I've had there has been satisfactory- soup, salad, pizza, burgers, pasta, dessert, even their gluten free items! The cons is that it can get insanely busy and, as a result, service can be so-so."}
{"text":"Bj'a is my cheat day destination. If you are looking for a menu with low calories stay away. Literally everything in their menu is delicious. For the appetizers, I recommend the avocado egg rolls they're really good! A bit spicy and the sourness of the dried tomatoes gives it a really unique taste! Another favorite is the deep dish pizza. I've been here many times and I've been always satisfied with the service!"}
{"text":"I came here my my hubby bday. We came for dessert and both were delicious. They cookie was fresh and chewy. The ice cream was delicious and added to the cookie made it amazing"}
{"text":"I was not aware that Orwellian 1984 double thinks were made into a concept restaurant. But they are and it is called BJ's! Everyone will tell you how great this place is until one day you walk into their shiny establishment in Centennial Hills. About 30 minutes later you will realize that all of your friends actually hate you for suggesting that you dine here.

All the service people are nice but in a really vacant Stepford wife kind of way. It's all lip service and no actual service. For example, our server was super interested in up-selling fancy beer to me... so we had to have a really long discussion about why I should try another kind of beer as opposed to the one I wanted. Once \"we\" decided that I would stick to drinking what I want, we must have also decided that the table would wait for 20 minutes before said drinks would be delivered. 

If you've ever read 1984 you will know that questions are also pretty unacceptable. I wish I had known that it was a 1984 concept restaurant before I asked about vegetarian options on the menu! I had planned on ordering some pasta or something, but it turns out that all the pastas and salads include meat and are priced accordingly. One question about that and she was off for another several minutes.

And the fun didn't even end there! I ordered soup and salad as my entree and both the soup and the salad were delivered to the table at the same time several minutes before anyone else was served. But I guess they did not consider this a problem since there was no silverware. So it's not like I was going to eat it before the rest of my party's food arrived, anyway NO BIG DEAL GUYS!

And so I stared at my food until the rest of the party got their food delivered, too. And still there was no silverware. The random hostess that delivered the food nicely asked if we needed anything else and when we asked for silverware, she walked away. Then we all got to stare at our food TOGETHER!

When we finally did get some silverware, I ate my Denny's quality food while feeling angry about the empty service and impending bill. This place is really Applebee's quality with Cheesecake Factory prices. My throat almost closed when I saw that the $12 avocado roll appetizer was actually only THREE avocado spring rolls. Not that it mattered since we never got appetizer plates even though we were asked if we wanted some when the appetizer was delivered. (Here is a tip: probably you should just bring appetizer plates instead of asking if the table would like some and then never bringing them causing another \"lets all stare at this food\" situation.)

Try eating a whole meal with an anger lump in your throat. It really takes the enjoyment out of eating. BJ's was a big fat $60 disappointment that ruined the pleasant experience that eating usually provides to me. That is a big deal considering that is why restaurants even exist.

Note to the management: I think that I would have given this experience 3 stars had the server or staff, who KNEW that this was a messed up dining experience for a number of reasons, had even tried to rectify the situation or notified the manager that the meal had been timed and executed very badly. But no one wanted to fix it and that enrages me more than anything else.

Vegetarian Side note: I didn't try the pizza even though it is supposedly really good for vegetarians, but be warned unless you want pizza, you probably won't find anything else on the menu that you want. All the pastas and salads include meat, and I don't see the point in paying $16 for a salad and then asking that they remove the most expensive ingredient. They have a veggie burger which is your standard garden burger replacement. And it was soggy. 

I will never go back to BJ's. It is over-priced and overhyped. If anyone I know ever tells me how great this place is again I will drop kick them so hard that they will need a kidney transplant in their face."}
{"text":"Good food!! Prices are pretty good, I also enjoy the atmosphere it's a pretty restaurant. They have a lot of choices on the menu, good amount of beer on tap and TVs to watch the game in a not obnoxious environment."}
{"text":"Good family restaurant! Celebrated Father's Day here with the family and had a nice meal. They even gave all the fathers a souvenir beer glass."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that we have come to this location for many years, but this time was our last. The experience here has slowly declined over time. Our previous two visits were an insult to the restaurant business. I, myself, am a server and therefore understand when certain circumstances arise that problems may happen. That being said, our last two visits made me never want to return. 
We had the same server, Jennifer S., both times. Her initial approach to the table took exceedingly long both times ( over 15 minutes). Once we got out drink and appetizer order in the waiting only further continued. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come out (soft drinks) and the appetizers never came out at all. Spoke with the manger, he apologized, and said he would make sure everything went more smoothly.  He could only compensate so much for the lack of abilities from the server. Once our food came out, she, along with anyone else, besides the manager once, never checked on us again for the remainder of our visit. 

We decided to give them another chance today, assuming that maybe it was a fluke. However, once we were seated and again started waiting, we knew there was a reason why we didn't want to come back. We had the same server as last time. This time, she greater us and it only took ten minutes. Drinks and appetizers came out in another ten, but we were without silverware. Our food came out in another half and hour, but we were still without silver because nobody had checked on us since we received our drinks and appetizers. So now, with salads, appetizers, both untouched because of no silverware, we had more food. Silverware came out when it decided it wanted to apparently. After speaking to the manager again, and explaining the events on this occasion and the last, he apologized and we received silverware. Our server came back once more before the end of the meal, and that was to drop off the bill. We had no refills or boxes until right when we were going to walk out. 
This being said, the food here is excellent and has always been.  Our service, and our server, were the worst I have ever experienced. Every time we would ask for something, which surprisingly wasn't that often since she rarely made an appearance at the table, she would say \"thank you\".  Even when she forgot something, there was no apology, only a \"thank you\". She obviously doesn't care about returning customers or customer service at all for that matter. She is bringing the restaurant down single handedly. I can, in no way, speak for others who she served, but I did hear other tables around us complaining at the same time. 

We would love to have a reason to come back here, but due to the lack of service quality, follow through from management, and overall poor dining experience, I don't know if I will be returning. 

If you must eat at BJ's restaurants, please choose another location at the very least. You will be disappointed if you cone here expecting a nice experience. \"Thank you\""}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Worst lunch service ever today!  In fact, I'm still waiting for food and silverware as I write this. We were offered a free kid starter which never came out until we asked 20 minutes later. Ask for a water and got a dirty glass. Still no server to check on us.  This review will be 0 stars in about 10 minutes.  Our kid is about to melt down from boredom after almost an hour sitting here."}
{"text":"Hmmm the service was really bad the night I came ... We got our appetizers before we even got our waters ..!! The food tho was decent ... If you come sit at the bar ... Otherwise you'll be totally ignored by your server!"}
{"text":"I had the super salad with grilled chicken and my bf had the lemon thyme chicken (he shared lol) and it was bomb!! The chicken wasn't dry and you can tell they we're prepared well and wasn't frozen. The salad was fresh and the dressing wasn't overwhelming. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the strawberry lemonade- it was too sweet. Oh! And the server was very nice and checked up on us :)"}
{"text":"The food was okay at best.  Service was not very good.  The only gluten free option was a pizza."}
{"text":"Great place awesome pizza and great beer oh and the red velvet pizookie is out of this world and speedy friendly service"}
{"text":"First off, started off with the BEST server, his name is John... and he was spectacular! Explained things well, and even said it was only his 3rd day!!! (: well done sir, wellll doneee! 8)

And food was off the wall amazing, of course their own brewed beer from Chandler is great as well... couldn't beat this experience truthfully! 

Hats off to ya. Fiances and I first time! 
Needless to say, we shall be back! ^0^"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and the food is great.  But the SERVICE is terrible.  You guys are a busy place hire more employees.   It's terrible you get your appetizers before your drinks. After our meal all of our dirty plates are still on the table.  Bad bad bad"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been here many times and this was one of the worst experiences I've had here. It took the server a good five minutes to acknowledge me and then another five minutes just to bring me my iced tea. During the course of my meal, my glass was empty several times and she had to walk right by my table to get to the kitchen, so I'm not sure why she couldn't refill my glass on one of her many trips or while she was just standing around. Also, she never stopped to check on how my meal was or if the food was alright. Then when I went to pay, I gave her my rewards card and she didn't even bother to give me the points from today's visit. Also, the manager was too busy watching the baseball game on TV to pay any attention to his servers or guests. I'm just very disappointed with this visit."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to BJ's Restaurant for dinner.  We came pretty late, around 7:45 pm. We were surprised that there was still quite a line at that hour and we were quoted 15 minutes until seated.

I was frustrated because I was starving and I told my SO that even if we get seated it's going to take forever to get our food because the restaurant holds a ton of people and it was packed!  

I can say I was completely wrong; we were seated quickly, our orders taken promptly, and our food came out one after the other (appetizer, then salads, then entree).  We hardly waited at all, yet our food was fresh and piping hot.

We got the provolone sticks appetizer, which was a bit pricier than I'm used to. Well, that's because there were 8 sticks to an order! They were hot and delicious and the homemade sauce was tasty. 

I got the gut-busting Baked Ziti and it was delicious, but definitely a guilty pleasure!

My SO got the small deep dish pizza and it was still too big of a portion; one person should get a 'mini', especially if you order a side like a salad. 

I definitely enjoy coming here. It's kinda like the Cheesecake Factory in that they have a TON of different menu items - all are unique and inventive. They also have a large beer selection (including their own recipes) if you're into that sorta thing. 

I also suggest trying to hold back just a bit to save some room for dessert because they have warm deep dish cookies & deep dish monkey bread that is to die for. 

Next time you're at the Village, give this place a try. EVEN if you see people waiting to be seated, they will surprise you with how efficient they run the restaurant."}
{"text":"BJ's Brewhouse Chandler is located at the mall. We met some friends here for dinner on their suggestion.  Being at the mall during spring break is not my idea of a good time, so there's that. Parking was a nightmare.

Wait time was very short, and the restaurant itself was busy but not too loud.  The.menu was great. We started with calamari and salads. The calamari was very salty, but was cooked well, so as not to be rubbery. The Caesar salad was great.  Before the main course,  I ran out of water. Where's the server? Who knows. Eventually I see her and beg for some.

The entrees arrive with perfect timing. Our friends order jumbalaya and the shrimp asparagus penne. I also chose the penne, and my husband the Mahi Mahi with shrimp on couscous. He really enjoyed his meal, as did I.  Then, I ran out of water. I steal my husband's. I run out of his water. I don't see the server until everyone is dine and she offers the dessert menu. I drink my water refill in one second flat.

We're not quite ready for dessert, bit are chatting and randomly glancing at the menu. For all the mad - dogging and dessert preasure, you'd think that I could get a flippin' glass of water!

We eventually order the Pizookie trio, sampling the macadamia nut,  Ghirardelli triple chocolate and the salted caramel. Holy chocolate balls these were good!  

And then I ran out of water. She drops the check before the dessert comes. Some other dude brings dessert. She promptly collects the check and we never see her again. I have imbibed everyone's water. The server was nice enough, but seemed more intent on rushing us through, maybe to get off in time? I'm not a pain in the butt, and I've been a server, so I'm polite, not needy, and tip really well, so I don't think watching the beverages of your tables is too much to ask.

And then...the restroom.

Going into the restroom felt like a transporter into a bus station bathroom...in Mexico. It was beyond gross. One stall was locked but appeared empty. A staff member had locked herself in another and was on the phone professing her love to her man in Spanish. That left the hc stall. Feces covering the toilet seat, toilet paper everywhere like a bomb went off...just gross.  My husband said that the men's room was worse. He said that is was flooded from a toilet and also in severe disarray.

While we enjoyed our food and company, we will not likely come back. They need to do some major examination of cleanliness and service practices."}
{"text":"I'm prejudice against chains already but I just don't understand how this place stays busy.  The pizza dough is literally the old Pizza Hut pan pizza recipe.  It's expensive and nasty."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service . I love the tomato soup and the burgers!! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Food was good as always but our server Ryan W. was less than courteous.  He was arrogant and rude, just about ripped my husband's plate away without asking if he was done, and never even asked about redeeming points before he brought our bill until I asked and challenged me even on that asking if he took my rewards slip or did I.  Needless to say, little  tip.  Spoke to manager, Norris, and he was very accommodating and listened to our concerns.  Will go back but will be sure not to have this server at our table.  We have always had excellent service and experiences so will shake this off."}
{"text":"I love their deep dish pizzas and pizookies - their signatures! This place can get busy, but wait times aren't too long. Also, the servers and whole staff are very friendly. I did order take-out last week and my order was wrong. I'm a vegetarian, so part of my order was a vegetarian mini; however, we got 2 BJ's Favorite minis. It was a hassle that we had to go back to get my vegetarian pizza, but at least they upgraded it to a small without charging. My friend got to keep the second BJ's Favorite mini, too. My only disappointment was that the hostess/cashier claimed that she checked the pizzas to make sure they were the correct ones, but the meat was quite OBVIOUS and couldn't be mistaken. We are human and everyone makes mistakes, but please do not lie to me. Especially to my face.

Well... I do not hold grudges, so 4 stars!  :)"}
{"text":"Well we finally made it through the doors of BJ's! It looks bigger inside than I expected. We sat at the bar since it was pretty much wide open there. They make their own beer and of course I had to try their hefeweizen. It definitely passed the test.

On to the food. My wife had a personal sized pizza and said it was the best pizza she ever had. That says a lot because she never says that, so it has that going for it. I had the brewhouse burger. I was kinda miffed because I failed to notice that it didn't come with cheese. Not a big deal but it made the burger boring. 

The bartenders were nice and refilled drinks when they were empty. Overall it was pretty good, nothing fancy but a decent place to eat. Just be aware that this place gets packed especially in weekends!"}
{"text":"Great food, been there a few times, and I will be back. Menu has great selections and the staff hustled"}
{"text":"Took 5 kids and a friend out for dinner.  Although it was only 5:30PM midweek, the place was packed! 
Seated quickly, Service very good,
Food above average.
Price was fair.

We had everything from a burger to pasta to tillapia and it all looked tasty.  Nothing was marvelous but everything was well cooked."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints - great variety if you happen to be vegetarian-- menu is always open to modifications. 

We come back weekly for Holly, who serves us in the bar area amazingly. 
On her days off- we enjoy sitting at the bar with Darnell.  
Other servers are hit or miss, but never deters us from returning.

We thoroughly recommend BJs overall."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Gotta love a server who continues to refill your glass when you've ordered a pitcher. Have never had a bad experience coming here."}
{"text":"For the price, competitors cannot beat the food and atmosphere of this place.

I eat at this location with a group of friends regularly. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and plays along with the stupid things that are sometimes said by our group. I'm not proud of this, but we sometimes stay here for three or four hours until closing time. The staff never seems to have a problem with this either. Kudos to them.

The menu is surprisingly extensive, and the food quality is great for the price. I enjoy the salads, and the deep dish pizzas are incredibly tasty. Also, get the Pizookie Party Platter with a small group!

At the end of the day, the food is good, but the staff is what makes me give this location five stars. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Place is wonderful. Both times, the service was wonderful, and the food was amazing. Good happy hour and daily happy hour specials. We had a wonderful time and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Been here a few times..always had a good time with good food. Tonight my fiancé and I sat at the bar and ordered two alcoholic drinks, avo egg rolls appetizer and the pizooki dessert with 3 pizookis (yum). Food was awesome and service was great. Bartender was Tracey, and she was very friendly!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in my neighborhood and went there for a fund-raiser event.  Service was polite, but ultimately crappy, because we had one very nice, very kind waitress who was in charge of over a dozen fully-loaded tables all by herself (not her fault, but strike one star).

Had the mozz sticks (meh) and the Sriracha-drizzled Brussel sprouts (something new), which I probably would have enjoyed more if they hadn't lost that battle with Smaug before they came out (practically charred black).  What wasn't burnt black was very tasty, but they clearly swore revenge as they went down (the aftertaste lingered for HOURS after and the gas was...  OMG it required apologies).

Anyhoo...  my main entree was the mushroom-swiss burger and fries with a side of BBQ sauce.  The food was accurate, but we waited forever, and everything but the fries came out room-temperature, due the above-mentioned service/staffing problem.  The bright spot?  The fries!  The fries were a wonderful surprise: long, salty, super-thin straws of crispy, potatoey goodness. Om-nom-nom!!  Oh, and that side of BBQ sauce was amazing.

All-in-all, I recommend going and will try this place again myself, but make sure that it's during a time when they're not so understaffed."}
{"text":"I went to BJ's on Friday with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. We wanted a casual dinner and this place was ok for that. It was loud and really busy, but we were seated within 15 minutes.
Our serve was nice, but you could tell she was a bit overwhelmed as there was a large party next to us.  To get drink refills, I had to push my empty glass towards the end of the table, etc
I got a tropical tea to drink, which was nice as it wasn't sugar sweetened, the only downside is they brewed it very weak. 
My husband had a steak and a HUGE baked potato. He said it was pretty good. I had the French dip with fries. It was ok, but I requested the thin fries as you have a choice of thin or seasoned. I think that was a mistake, they were on the plate, under the sandwich and were pretty limp and greasy. I asked for Ranch to eat them with but the ranch was just eh as well. The sandwich itself was pretty good.
For dessert I really wanted a pzookie, but didn't want a large one, so my serve requested a mini one, for 3.00 it was quite large actually and pretty good!
The woman next to us got nachos and they looked huge and good! So that might be an item to try in the future.
All in all, it was alright. The bill was a little over 50 dollars w/ tip and I thought that was a bit high as there was no alcohol in the tab, but hubby ordered a steak, so not totally out of line."}
{"text":"This is our third straight Friday eating at a BJ's. First time it was the Summerlin location, the follow Friday it was the Henderson location & this Friday it was the Centennial location & third time was not a charm. 

My wife put us on the call ahead list & she was told it would be 15-20 minutes when she checked in. She informed the hostess of her desire for a full size booth, not the little, barely enough room booths they have. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our little booth & we only got seated after she went back & asked how much longer.

There was an empty full size booth across from where we were seated & when we inquired about sitting there we were informed that a 4 person party was being seating, which was a lie. They seated two people 15 minutes before the other two people in their party arrived. Which restaurant sits half a party at rush time, BAD ONES!!!

So we're seated & order a pretty simple dinner, two salads & boneless wings. Well the salads came out without dressing, no lie neither salad had dressing on them & the wings had the wrong sauce. To top it off one of my pet peeves happen, my glass sat empty for a while, empty until the waitress finally came back with our salad dressings. Instead of going into the kitchen for our dressing when she notice it was missing she filled ordered & came back with a tray full of glasses & our missing dressing. 

Lastly they ran my card twice, but good thing I get alerts each time my card is charged. 

As I said we've been to BJ's on three straight Friday & we will not be coming back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant in Columbus before but it just recently opened in North Olmsted. The food is pretty good, especially for a brew house, but definitely American, regardless of what you order. The menu is quite large but don't let that fool you- its half beer.

The Mahi Mahi and Jambalaya were both delicious. Reasonable prices and its massive inside."}
{"text":"A few old friends, my older brother and myself got together here for dinner. Other than my brother, we had not seen each other literally had not hung out together since High School. 40 years? It was AWESOME. The food was great, the Wait Staff, when they found out it was an unofficial 40 year reunion, made a big deal about it and made it even more fun. I remember mostly the friendliness of the staff. They were ALL great, the food was delicious, the atmosphere is terrific. It is like a 'Cheers' kinda place. They treat you like family!"}
{"text":"We have been to BJ's three times now as it has quickly become one of our favorites. The food is excellent; from the burgers & fries, to the Parmesan crusted chicken, the wings are some of my favorite, too!! Their beers are delightful! We have always had the absolute best service from friendly hosts(esses) to waiters!! We will definitely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service in regards to seating disabled people! They disregard the disability and seat you where they want not to the needs of the customer. No attempt to accommodate! One star due to I had to rate otherwise it would be a zero! Contacted manager who was more interested in reservations then a now former disabled patron!"}
{"text":"I went to BJ's yesterday for lunch with a group of 11 people.  There were four parties, including ours, with 10 or more people yesterday and the staff handled it well.  The kitchen was a bit overwhelmed so our orders took longer than normal, but it was fine because we weren't in a hurry.

I ordered the soup and 1/2 sandwich.  For soup I ordered the tortilla soup.  The sandwich was the turkey Cobb.  The soup was outstanding.  The tortilla strips are in the bowl and the warm soup was poured overtop so they retained their crispness.  There was also some pieces of avocado and the flavor of cilantro was very present for a wonderful flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the sandwich.  It was billed as roasted turkey.  Well, it was, but it was luncheon meat roasted turkey and sliced thin for the sandwich.  It also says with blue cheese dressing.  It was there but the blue cheese flavor was not.

As for our server, she was really good.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass when I got low.  She did commit a cardinal sin with one of my friends.  He ordered another beer and when she brought it, she picked up his unfinished first glass and removed it before he could stab her with his fork.  That's a big no no!!  She didn't do that with the little iced tea that was left in my glass when she brought the fresh glass.  Wow, were we surprised.

Summing up BJ's, it's OK.  It's not a place to which I'd go often.  There are just too many good places to go in this town and this area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything about the meal. From the drinks to burger. Only bummer was I didnt have room for dessert so, no pizookie. If you're a rootbeer or cream soda fan, try one here. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Very good dining, I was having a little trouble with my food and Jennifer offered to change out my meal which was more than I was expecting! Atmosphere and service was great (:"}
{"text":"Food was great. We had the avocado egg rolls and pizza! So delicious. Service is a bit slow but it's a huge place. Felt bad for our server because he was running around all over the place. Although you could tell he was exhausted he was always very friendly."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly but she neglected to bring us silverware with our appetizer. We tried to catch someone's eye but no luck. When our meal came we requested silverware which arrived quickly. My bison burger was good but they put a slaw/salad on the plate with hardly any dressing. I left most of the \"salad.\" Unless they improve this salad they might as well omit it. My daughter ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. She's had it elsewhere and thought it was just okay here. It only included 2 pieces of avocado. 
Like others have said I wouldn't suggest this place but I also wouldn't turn down a return visit. The atmosphere is great and with a few improvements it could be a really great restaurant."}
{"text":"Our friend highly recommended this place, and it lived up to every expectation. The food was reasonably priced and the portions were great! The burger we ordered was delicious, and the deep dish pizza was fantastic! We did not try a pizookie, but they looked delicious. The service was great and the staff was friendly. The atmosphere was great as well. We did not try there brews, but they had many special beers on tap from local breweries as well. I would highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for somewhere to eat around Chandler fashion center that gave a mall employee discount, and really no place does. But when we asked at BJ's the manager said he'd give us 10% just because we asked. Can't promise they'll do that everytime, but it was pretty cool and we decided to eat there. We got the fried artichokes and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers, which were very good. Then we split the calzone for two and promised ourselves we'd pace ourselves and take some home. But it was too good and we ended up finishing it.
Our server was pleasant and attentive. 
I have gone back roughly once a month and sit in the bar area killing time until my husband gets off work. The staff never minds and I usually have fun chatting with them on their slower nights. I prefer this location to the one at Park West in Peoria. The staff is much more friendly and apparently the location in Peoria does not have the same deals on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the service has been sporatic. Reuben, our first server was awesome. We had a few others who got the job done, nothing spectacular. Tonight was horrible! My father ordered the double burger and I had the balsamic chicken. We received our orders and my father asked for ketchup....15 minutes later we had not received our ketchup.  He then noticed the burger was not a double like he had ordered. So...after waiting for our server to make her way back to us, we informed her of the mistake. The manager came over and had my father's order refired. I had to wait for him to get his food...my meal was cold when his arrived. Very dissapointed to say the least.  We will call ahead for Reuben from now on. If he is not working we will go somewhere else. Hope BJ'S works to fix the sporatic service."}
{"text":"Quality control is bad here. Three people in our party ordered the clam chowder and all three soups were not even warm. I received a dirty spoon with my soup and ended up waiting 5 minutes for the server to check on us. My soup was cold when I finally got a spoon so I ended up not having any of my soup. My entree was the prime rib and it was one of the worst prime ribs I have ever had. It was over cooked and overly peppered. Terrible!! The broccoli was under cooked with no seasoning whatsoever. How do you mess up broccoli? The only thing semi edible was the baked potato that had obviously sat around all day. The only plus about my meal was that my dogs will have a great dinner tonight.

I don't recommend this location, it was a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night , i  waited in line for like an hour and I ordered the jambalaya all that wait and it tasted like out of a can! For the price they charge!! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Amazing pizza, Endless menu and such great drinks. My absolute favorite though is the pizookie!! It is always crowded so I do the call a head seating"}
{"text":"Stopped after the Black and White Elite event for the after party and some dinner.

This is another brewery restaurant chain, similar to Gordon Biersch or even Yard House.  They have a large selection of house beers from very light to very dark.  There is also a very large selection of non-house beers on tap and in bottles.  I didn't drink any beer that night so this review is just for the food and service.

Again since this is a chain, so I feel there is nothing special about the food.  It is your typical brewpub items such as artichoke dip, potato skins, buffalo wings, pizza, etc.  The food wasn't bad by any means, but nothing really stood out.  The staff was nice enought to let us partake in late night happy hour specials (2200 to close) 15 minutes early.  The specials were $2 off all apps and 1/2 off all the mini sized pizzas.

The service was efficient and friendly.  My ice tea was refilled frequently even though I wasn't sitting at the bar.  Total bill for my mini pizza and chicken fingers was $18 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Blonde hostess has no people skills and rude as fuck. Great food and huge menu. Everything is delicious. Get rid of the hostess though."}
{"text":"The menu is huge looks kinda like the cheesecake factory menu. The pizza was descent. I had the darkest beer they serve and it was amazing!! Artichoke fried hearts were okay but they were pretty cheap. Will be returning to try the infamous cookie dessert. I LOVE THE CAPRESE salad and for only 3.95$ this place is great!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for quick bite at 4pm and half the restaurant was empty and still a 20 minute wait. Staff accordingly for a weekend."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!  Had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with house salad and blue cheese dressing.   Huge portions of chicken breast, enough to have lunch for the next day.  Mashed potatoes and broccoli with meal were tasty and blue cheese dressing was on point!   Make sure to try their thin cut fries - had to sneak a few from hubby's meal!!"}
{"text":"We had some challenges tonight at BJ's. The manager Jairo went out of his way to check on us and make sure everything went better. Did a fantastic job. Thanks Jairo! By the way the monkey bread desert was beyond awesome!"}
{"text":"I went to bj's today and there service was very good and the food was delicious, there was so much to pick from it was hard for me to make a choice because everything looked good."}
{"text":"Great food, big menu to choose a variety of foods, great service. If your looking for a place to go to eat or drink, go to bjs"}
{"text":"I suppose my score would teeter in the gray area of a 3.5. This place has it's great points: good, brewed beer; incredible deep-dish pizzas loaded with toppings; and, from what I saw, attractive wait staff (always a bonus). 

My short-comings list would be: the Applebee's-esque environment; and horrible placement/identifying of the facilities. Those don't seem major, but when you need to go number 1 between well-crafted home brews, you don't need to make laps around the place. Especially weaving your way around the islands of high schoolers who are enamored to be there. Also, given that this place attempts to combine the sports bar with a family place to dine, it clashes too loudly and, on a packed-out night, I could see this place being overkill.

I know this might be coming off harsh because they do have some magic working for them. Their pizzas are bomb. In this new age of pizzas with thinner crusts, these pies kick it old school with their Chicago style crusts. Complimented by their over-abundance of toppings, these pizzas rock. That is all I can say for their amazingness. You will have to try the pizza for yourself.

As far as brew goes, with me being a beer snob, this was a good brew. I ordered the Kolsch and my broseph selected the Porter. Both had a good consistency and overall taste. The Kolsch was a little reminiscent of Four Peaks kolsch, perhaps with less vanilla. It had a some characteristics of a red ale to it. Overall,  I feel like they can put out some good beers.

So looking back over this, I will bump up my teetering score to 3.75. You will just have to experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the pizookie was the best! Every single flavor is so delicious. You have to get one even if you're full and can't fit no more, just make room haha! Over all our waiter was AMAZING! Shout out to James for making us have such a wonderful time. First time meeting him and it felt like we have been friends for a while! He was on top of everything for our group, especially with the surprise bday pizookie for my bestfriend! Never been so happy to give such a big tip. Thanks for the great food and service from James BJ's!"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted.

Came here today for an early lunch with the hubby, our first time at this location. Loved the way the restaurant looked. Everyone was welcoming and friendly. We got seated immediately and handed our menus including a flyer for $5 appetizers for every $20 worth of food items. Our server, Susan was nice, helpful and prompt.

Ordered fried calamari for our appetizer, a southern fried chicken with a side of clam chowder for my main and boneless sriracha rubbed chicken wings for the hubby. For our drinks the hubby had  a pint(or3) of Jeremiah Red and I had (Tito's)Vodka tonic. 

The calamari was really good. Lightly battered and cooked perfectly. The clam chowder was a little thick but it was ok. The fried chicken was moist and went well with the mashed potatoes and corn, the chicken wings were tender but nothing special. The drinks were refreshing. 

Everything was going well, we were actually planning our next visit until it was time to pay. Our server brought our bill and we asked if they offered military discount . When she said yes, of course we were delighted and thankful. She brought the ammended bill and I noticed that we were charged $11.95 for the appetizer instead of $5 so I brought it to her attention. She said she'll have the manager adjust it but doubt if we can still get military discount. She came back with the final bill which reflected the $5 appetizer but no military discount. When we asked why, she replied that their computer won't allow it because the appetizer's price was better than the discount anyway. It's perplexing. 

We paid the bill  just to get it over and done with. We were in no way demanding for the discount but why take it back just because we called their attention on the price discrepancy? Very disappointed. Sad to say, we won't be coming  back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now and it's been good both times.  I was with large groups both times, and even I was getting frustrated with my friends' inability to decide what they wanted... The staff was more patient than I and were great both times.  I tried the peanut butter pazookie dessert this last time..  soooo good!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Very nice atmosphere. First time, ate in the bar area and the service was good. Good food and draft selection. Their own beer is just ok. Second time ate in the dining room- Service was poor. Had to ask for things multiple times. Seems like they still need to work out the kinks in their system."}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite place, but the service has gone completely downhill. Slow and inattentive. Hate to say it, but we might find a new spot."}
{"text":"If you are over in the West Valley and want to stay away from the Cardinals stadium and all that craziness, just up the freeway a couple exits is a row of restaurants/bars right off the Northern Exit. Easy access and lots of parking. 
To be honest, I have only ever had drinks and appetizers here. One time it was late night (after 10 PM) and the place was pretty empty. Great service that night. The other time it was happy hour on a Saturday. CROWDED!! and service was slow, but only because our server had tons of tables to deal with. 
Overall, I like the food. We had flatbread pizzas, artichoke dip and sliders. Not bad bar food. The place is nice, clean and large."}
{"text":"Last night was a huge disappointment. My boyfriend and I walked in and grabbed an open table in the bar area. The table still had several empty glasses and the server's tab on the table. No big deal, we assumed someone would be by to clean everything up momentarily so we could eat some food. After a couple minutes, the server stopped by and picked up the payment made by the last party and then took two empty wine glasses of our table. There were still several empty glasses on the table. We assumed that she would be back to pick up the rest of the glasses, provide us with menus, and start our drink orders. We never saw her again. In fact, she never even said anything to us during that one visit she made to our table. We shoved all the empty glasses to the edge of the table in an attempt to make it clear to staff that these were empty and were not our glasses. We were completely ignored. Becoming frustrated, I decided to start the timer on my phone to see how much longer it would take before anyone would even acknowledge us. During the next 5 minutes, we were completely invisible to everybody. Two bussing staff members repeatedly walked by and never stopped to remove the glasses, along with several servers (although not the one who was assigned that table), and we even noticed that what appeared to be a manager had walked by our table a few times without noticing that we had already been sitting at a dirty table for about 10 minutes. We gave up and left. I guess our business wasn't wanted. Why did this happen? Why were we ignored? Did the server assume that we were only sitting there while waiting for our name to be called to a table? If that's the case, she was very wrong. I've been a server, and making assumptions like that is not acceptable. We were there to eat dinner and ended up going elsewhere. And yes - we could have flagged down a staff member and told them that we needed help, but why should we have to do that? Why should we have to tell someone how to do their job? Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is almost always great, and our lunch today was really good. My husband had the bacon avocado grilled cheese and enjoyed it. I had the Caesar with sirloin and it was yummy! We sat at the bar and the service was slow, but she was busy. Get the member card so you can get rewards and free desserts!"}
{"text":"We really love the food, atmosphere and beer!  Watched the NBA finals the other night and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Redemption! 

We stopped in for lunch which I recommend since there are less crowds compared to dinner time and it's easier to find a parking spot-which is only one reason I've stayed away.

However, on this visit we were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated right away. The loud music and TVs are expected and this way you don't have to listen anyone else's conversation but your own.

Our waiter was friendly and we ordered up a draft beer and and spicy egg rolls and wow what a presentation! Flavors were all there and this was the perfect starter dish.

We split the California burger which was loaded with avocado. We ordered it medium and it was a bit undercooked. The bread was sourdough but they used a sliced version which for me on a burger was a let down since I was expecting a bun.  Nonetheless the burger and side of stringy fries was delicious.

Overall high return factor."}
{"text":"Finally got around to going to this BJ's close to my neck of the woods.  Would always pass by it on Centennial and see it was near constantly busy with cars.  Whaddaya know, we like it!

Nice building, very reminiscent of the one on Charleston (my guess is that's the point).  Lots of dark wood, intimate lighting in some parts, lots of room at the bar with multiple TV's.  Nice flooring and high ceilings too.  I like the rotating door at the front entrance, good touch.  

The night we came it was on a weekend so it was busy at a nice clip.  We didn't have to wait long for a table though, maybe about 5 minutes.  Aisles are pretty spacious so I had no problem getting to my seat.

Our server was courteous and well-mannered, took care of us really well.  Even if we weren't first-timers to BJ's he still gave us a nice review of the menu and the specialty types of pizzas they create.  Informative, nice.

We've been to BJ's before so we had a good idea of what we were ordering.  There were four of us in our party and we got:

*Piranha Pale Ale Nachos - Topped with BJ's Pale Ale Chili, jack and cheddar cheese, tomatoes, green onions, olives, cilantro, and sour cream.  With a side of fire-roasted salsa and extra jalapenos.

*BJ's Favorite Signature Deep Dish Pizza (Large 14\") - Meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, olives, onion, and tomatoes.

*Baby Back Pork Ribs - Flavored with Big Poppa Smokers' Sweet Money Championship Rub, topped with BJ's Jeremiah Red Ale BBQ sauce, and served with two steak sides of your choice (we opted for steamed veggies and the Wedge Salad).

Luckily on this day we had a coupon from Facebook where you buy an entree and get another entree of equal or lesser value FREE.  We bought the pizza and got the ribs gratis!  Not a bad deal at all.  Especially considering a large pizza will set you back between $20 - $25 depending on what kind of pizza you order.

The food?  Not bad!  Definitely reminds you of a Cheesecake Factory type joint.  The nachos were good, lots of cheese everywhere, and that fire-roasted salsa had some great flavor.  The pizza was good, definitely fits up to being a signature of BJ's.  The crust was thick but still light and airy.  Nice crunch on the outside with a good chew on the inside.  Loaded with good toppings.  After two slices I was done!  Definitely not a NY pie (which I kinda prefer).  The wedge salad was excellent, and would only be that way IF you have a head of very, very fresh Iceberg lettuce.  Topped with creamy bleu cheese dressing, bacon bits, and fresh black pepper, it was a good accompaniment.  The surprise of the night was the pork ribs!  Someone did it right - enough smoke, generous rub, enough sauce (with extra on the side), cooked just right to near-fall-off-the-bone, I couldn't get enough!  I finished half the rack myself.  

With that coupon our meal was a near steal.  For the four of us, we managed to get away with an under $50 check (with tax & tip), and leftovers for a midnight snack.  I like a value meal!

We were too full, but one should try and get a BJ's Famous Pizookie.  A warm deep dish cookie, topped with two scoops of cool, creamy ice cream?  Yeah you're gonna want one.

I'll be back again BJ's, I'll have to try your Happy Hour that goes from 3 PM - 7 PM M-F, or 10 PM - Close Sun-Thur.  That looks like some good eats for cheap!"}
{"text":"I really love my NY style pizza...thin, crispy crust...not too much toppings to weigh it down.  But man, BJ's Chicago style pizza gives it a run for its money!  I enjoy the pizza here and apparently a lot of other folks do too.  This place is always packed for dinner!  Very happening.  

Went here with the fam, and we had a blast.  It was great hearing the game on the TV, people congregating and laughing, plates and glasses clinking.  The atmosphere is pretty inviting, lots of dark woods and high ceilings almost reminding you of a gastropub.  BJ's has a very large menu that includes appetizers, salads, sandwiches, Angus burgers, sliders, giant stuffed potatoes, pasta, and even a gluten-free menu (no gluten, in a pizza joint?  Come on!  It's pizza!)...but the Chicago pizza is the star.

I pretty much perused the main menu and went straight for the heart, BJ's wonderful deep dish pizzas.  They usually have at least 8-9 different pies on the menu and of course you can make your own with any of their ingredients.  Every pizza comes with their special blend of FIVE cheeses.  Their pizza creations include - BJ's Favorite Pizza (The Works w/ meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, peppers, olives, onions, and tomatoes), Mediterranean (Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta), Sweet Pig (Pineapple, tomatoes, and roasted ham), BBQ Chicken (BBQ chicken, red onions, tomatoes, hickory BBQ sauce, and cilantro), and the Southwestern (Blackened chicken, green chiles, chipotle sauce, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and cilantro) just to name a few.  They even have calzones, and yes...a gluten-free thin crust pizza!  I feel so sorry for you people that can't handle gluten.  No deep dish for you!

We ended up with a large BJ's Favorite pizza for all of us to share.  Just to let you know they aren't cheap, probably around $10-24 each depending on the size and type of pie you get (Mini, Small, Medium, or Large).  Mind you, these pizzas don't look large when they get to the table but they are DEEP.  It's like a good almost two inches thick!  I thought our family of four could finish the entire pie in one sitting but I was wrong!  Our pie had six large slices and we could only eat a slice each!  You definitely have to eat this pizza with a knife and fork...no folding slices in half folks!  The crust is buttery, not too heavy, and completely cooked through without being soggy.  The ingredients were fresh, and the veggies still had a light bite to them.  The sauce was tangy and sweet.  Overall a very delicious slice of pie!  Yes, like pie!  Very good pizza.

We rounded out our dinner with a few appetizers, the Crispy Calamari ($8.95) with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli, and the Garden Medley Salad ($8.95) with romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onion, feta, and balsamic vinaigrette.  Both very tasty.

Although we were stuffed (ha ha...like pie?) our server told us we had to try BJ's Famous Pizookie ($5.95).  After rants from the kids on how we never have dessert it ended up being ordered.  Funny how they win and you don't even realize it.  This thing ended up being delicious!  Like sweet crack!  Not that I've tried crack before.  The Pizookie is a hot out of the oven, fresh baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and served in it's own mini deep dish tin.  We got a chocolate chunk cookie, but you can also choose, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal raisin walnut.  So good!  They bake the cookie dough until it's just a smidge underdone so your cookie is still gooey on the inside.  Goes great with the vanilla ice cream on top!  Good way to go to end a calorie busting meal!  

I wanted to try one of their hand crafted micro brews but I couldn't fit it in on this trip.  I hear they also have a great happy hour M-F from 3 PM-7 PM and also on Sun-Th from 10 PM-close.  They have $1 their draft beers and cocktails, $2 off most of their appetizers, and 1/2 off all their Mini Pizzas.  I will have to go check this out on maybe a game day!  

I definitely want to go back here again soon, good food, good service, good times.  Go here, and enjoy yourself before the crazy holidays!  BJ's has made me a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza.  NY pizza I love you so...Chicago deep dish, you can be my secret mistress!  SHHHHHH!!!"}
{"text":"Date night with the wife started great. Only had a 3-5 minute wait (rewards program is awesome & has its privileges) to be seated. We were put in front of an entry/exit door on a cooler evening. Asked to be moved, management tried but to no avail as they were pretty busy. He did, however, turn it into an exit only door to cut down on the amount of times it would be opened, (it only leads to the patio) since there was another enclosed door patrons could use.
Server was very attentive and usually appeared out of nowhere to fill water and check on us. She was simply amazing. If you like clam chowder, pay a little bit more and get it in the sourdough bowl.....so worth it! An absolutely wonderful time with great food, good drinks and a wonderful wife!"}
{"text":"I go to this place all the time. They have good  tvs to watch the games. For happy hour they have good deals and good food. They have a rewards program that I use to get free stuff."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Excellent Chicago style pizza. Crispy on the edges...chewy and gummy in the middle. Yum. 
We also had Italian market salad. It was a little overdressed and a bit salty but hearty and flavorful. 
I personally love the berry burst cider on draught. Crisp and refreshing. 
I don't know when this happened  but they now offer a pizookie trio. This was perfect when the three of us couldn't decide on flavor!  We got three individual smaller versions for $9! Yippee! 
4 beers, a salad, a pizza and the pizookie trio cost us $78 with tip. 
Always busy in there so expect a wait. The trick is to seat yourself in the bar."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and have always sat at the bar. Ordered appetizers and drinks.  Both have been great. Loved the brussel sprouts! Bartenders were very friendly and attentive. Love the decor of the restaurant.  All the beer we have tasted so far has been great too. Would recommend."}
{"text":"It's BJs, what I would expect, not like I haven't eaten there before. 

Only 4 stars because of the problems with the bill. We, a very large group, were at a conference and BJs was there hyping their restaurants. 

I can eat a BJs at home, why would I want to go to Vegas to eat at a hometown chain? Well, very large group and they offered us a 20% discount... 

Still, I would rather have spent the same 4 figures at restaurants on or near the strip. 

When the bill came, they did not want to honor the discount promised. In the end they finally gave in, but still it was more than a half hour fighting with the manager."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars but....the service is SLOW and it seems that the host/hostess seating process seems quite chaotic.  The food is good, but going with children for dinner? better take a snack or 2, as the wait is always long.  We have spent upwards of 3 hours just for a meal.  Go during a slow time so you can enjoy the food.  The parking is horrible, and take out is nearly impossible because you can never park.  Needs to be in a different area, its good and always packed."}
{"text":"Service was THE WORST!  Food wasn't much better. We will never return. Two hours of our lives wasted."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant.  It has a microbrewery if you enjoy different beers.  I go there for the food and I love just about everything I have tried.  The avocado egg rolls are a must try appetizer.  The rack of ribs is the best for any restaurant in this price range.  And if you have not had a pizookie for dessert you have not lived yet."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. Can you say Pizookie?! Giant Stuffed Potato?! Seriously some really good food. Great prices. Currently they have a 2 for 19.99 special: 2 soups or salad, a medium specialty pizza, and a pizookie! I was stuffed, and when I left, my wallet still was. I go here at least a few times a month, and never have been disappointed! Better than Chili's, and come in at a tie with Cheesecake Factory for best cheap, date night eats :)"}
{"text":"Every time I have come here I always get the avocado appetizer and it fills me up so I have yet to try anything else. My wife usually orders a salad, but the beer is what we go here for. While we're not always in the mood for beer, there are only two places in all of Vegas I'd recommend, the first is Chicago's, but this is a close second. Ok, I guess a third would be Gordon Biersch, but whatever."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight because my roommate said it was great.  Let me tell you she was right ! My server Anthony was a complete doll and on top of his game. Would recommend anyone to try this place out ! The avocado egg rolls are to die for"}
{"text":"Got the Holiday Share Dinner for 2 for $39 and is definitely worth it!! We each got soup or salad and entree of our choice and we share a pazzoki!!! On top of our meal, we enjoyed their signature drink called Jeremiah Red. Also, our server was on top of things!! Best service in my life time!! Great experience tonight! Our servers name is Brittany J!! Good job, Brittany!!"}
{"text":"Food is always so good! I order the parmesan crusted chicken and the lemon butter sauce is fricken amazing."}
{"text":"Another \"warehouse\" brewery with exposed pipes, air conditioning, and light fixtures. Time to retire that look, it's been done to death at the Rock Bottom, Dave & Buster's,  and hundred of other chains. Want to see a beautiful ceiling while drinking beer, head to the Church Brew Works. 

BJ's is located in the new McCandlis Crossing off McKnight road. Another giant hodge podge of Ethan Allens, Super Cuts, Trader Joe's (this is Pennsylvania, no two Buck Chuck, TJ Brew or Trader Joe's Cafe) and other boring chain places that dot the western Pennsylvania landscape. BJ's is new to Pittsburgh, a brewery/restaurant/bar miss mash with their beer as the star of the show. Stopped in with a friend, had a double IPA, not bad, tasty, hoppy, floral in the front, hints of lime, grapefruity finish. 5.75 a pint, my friend loves stouts and enjoyed their version. We'd eaten before stopping in for a nightcap but did look the menu over. The large menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory, lots of choices, lots of calories, a few lighter menu items caught my eye like the salmon over quinoa & vegetables, at 1050 calories, I didn't find that very light. Fish tacos, flatbread, deep dish pizza, and burgers make up the bulk of this menu. 

One thing did catch my eye though, they carry brews from other breweries, including the Pius Monk Dunkle from Church Brew Works. Kind of odd to carry brews from other local brew houses, IMO. In a world of chain restaurants, when something new pops up give it a try."}
{"text":"Overall this was a pleasant dining experience.  The staff was friendly and frequently checked on us to make sure we were taken care of.  The establishment is clean and had a very casual, relaxed feel.

Our party of four were able to share a single large pizza, which tasted very good.  Although the meal was somewhat heavy, that's what you get when you order gormet pizza.  Okay, onto dessert: we ordered a Pizookie.  It's a cookie baked in a large dish with ice cream on top and it was delicious!  Eating here wasn't the healthiest choice but it sure was satisfying.  Would I eat here again?  Yes!  Will I go to the gym afterward?  Yes!"}
{"text":"I was here two days ago for lunch and was very happy with the food and the service , I love their crispy fries. I had a cheeseburger with guacamole on it and it was to \"die for\"!
I also had their lightest Craft beer which was perfect with my burger. The waitress was so accommodating and friendly! 

I have only one suggestion: don't serve a burger that will get messy on top of a paper napkin because it almost disintegrated and mixed in with the food so you are apt to eat some napkin along with your food. 

I will definitely go there again and it is close to my home so that's a plus! I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"BJs is a classic. Everyone knows Bjs, this is one of those places you go to after a football, basketball, game or your little sisters recital. Place is delicious and satisfying! 
The pizookies are so good you let the ice cream melt in your mouth like ice cubes! The burgers are flame flame. The juicyness and the flavor zaps your taste buds like an alien zapping you to outer space! The pasta is nothing but delicious! Don't forget the beer! The finest beers of all the land man they're good!
Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place, varied menu and pretty good chain resturant formula food. This night they were out of ribeye (whaaat?) so ordered sirloin and had to send it back twice because it was overdone. Even 3rd one was overdone but my fellow diners were already finished eating so...
However resturant was apologetic and didn't charge me, so I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible the food was over priced and tasteless . It was not just our table but everyone in our section had complaints of wrong orders and skimpy servings. The steaks were tough the hamburgers were tasteless. The drinks water downed. I could honestly go on, yet you get my point.. Do us a favor and close your doors."}
{"text":"Once again they knock it out of the park. If you've never had a wedge salad from BJ's then drop what ever your doing and go get one. My lovely wife and I shared the ribs with some green beans. Had a server named Julio that did an incredible job!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  I liked about half the food.  They changed the recipes and removed some of my favorites.  Our last visit we experienced slow service although friendly.  I'd give the server 9/10 for trying, but the kitchen seemed to be slow or something.  The fried food was especially greasy the other day when I was there.  Every other time the place had really good food.  The portion sizes have also shrank.  I'll give them another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Wow, this place exceeded my expectations. I give their appetizers 5 stars. I always look for healthier appetizers and most places don't seem to have them. So sick of chips and dip and chicken wings for appetizer. We had the ahi pieces and the stuffed mushrooms and I really enjoyed both of them. The pizza pies were really good too. We had half Mediterranean and half Alfredo. So bad/good I don't have a sweet tooth and actually didn't enjoy the Pazooki, waaayyyy too sweet for me."}
{"text":"We never go wrong with BJ's. They have the best selection of very affordable and delicious appetizers (the tomato mozzarella salad and the stuffed mushrooms are my favorite). 

Their entrees have never let me down, from their wraps and sandwiches to their signature deep dish pizza, there is something for every taste on their menu. 

We last went there on veterans day and service was fantastic although the place was very busy. They were super accommodating of our very active toddler as well and our server even went the extra mile to bring her little crackers without an extra charge.

Food is always good, the beer selection is awesome, desert won't let you down- what else can a girl ask for."}
{"text":"We had a great experience on Sunday.  We ordered the chips & guac, Brussel sprouts ( my personal favorite ) and the club sandwich.  All items were delicious.  Our server was awesome - checked up on us many times.

Next time we'll order our favorite pizza."}
{"text":"I hate myself for loving you! Once again a chain has stolen my heart and 
kept me coming back. They don't do anything remarkable they just do it remarkably well. The staff is always great and fun, even when it's busy they are on point and always make it look easy. The food is never getting a James Beard award but it's really solid every trip. I am such a chain whore when did this happen?????"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at BJ'S. I used their app to do call ahead seating. We walked in and we're seated right away. Everything worked like is supposed to. 

I had two Piranha drafts and we both had the salmon and keanwa.  The food was great and the service was excellent. The salmon was cooked perfectly. 

This is definitely a great spot for great beer and great food."}
{"text":"As a family we love BJ's.  Every time we have family members or friends visit us from another state, we bring them here.  Service is amazing, staff is knowledgeable and fun, and the food is always hot and fresh and delicious.

But here's why I recommend them and what prompted this review:
BJ's is always busy. (Use their call-ahead program where you can add your name to the wait list before you arrive.) One Friday night, we were waiting in the small reception area for a table, a wait we expected and didn't mind knowing that the food and service would be well worth it. Unfortunately, our wait began going over the initial wait time quoted to us by the hostess.  In fact, it was beginning to be significantly over and the very, very, very, very tiny waiting area was now becoming quite packed with other families and people waiting for their tables as well.

Looking over the dining room it appeared that it wasn't the servers' or restaurant's fault.  Many tables had paid checks on the table and were cleared, except for some napkins and lingering drinks.  The guests were just camping out at tables, ignoring the growing group of families with whining, hungry kids.

But the managers didn't ignore us.  In fact, two different food runners were sent out to the group of waiting people (both inside and outside the restaurant) with trays of pizza cut up in small portions for the kids to munch on while we waited. Napkins were provided and no mention of payment was ever made. 

This act was by far the kindest, most thoughtful gesture I have ever witnessed by a restaurant. As a parent, I was deeply appreciative of this simple, yet thoughtful gesture on the part of  the restaurant. As a 12-year veteran of the industry who has worked as a corporate trainer for two major national chains and is married to a chef, I was greatly impressed by the amazing attention to this matter and quick resolution. 

We had been entertaining the idea of leaving and going somewhere we didn't like as much, just to get some food in our crabby, hungry toddler's tummy. But this act on the part of BJ's staff kept us there and our money in their hands. Great job!

We were huge fans of BJ's before this event, but whenever asked about a good family restaurant, I quickly recount this story and lay on the great reviews.

Thanks, BJ's. We're fans for life!"}
{"text":"Located right across from Red Rock Casino and Resort.  Everytime I've eaten here, it's never by plan.  It's always been because either Yard House (at Red Rock) is too busy or I happen to be on that side of Charleston.  

As for the food.  Probably tried almost everything on the menu at some point.  My favorites include their Spinach Dip, Salmon, Lasagna, Pazookie, and their Great White Pizza.  If you haven't tried their Pazookie, then you must try at least once. I prefer the Peanut Butter Cookie Pazookie over the Chocolate Chip.  

My favorite dish is the Great White Pizza.  Chicago deep dish style pizza that taste like a pasta alfredo.  I love it when they burn the crust a little.  Sometimes I request it. 

Service is just average, but really good during lunch.  I have to say, service is better than Yard House across the street.  

Any BJ's is a safe bet when your with a group and everyone is undecided where to eat.  One things for sure, getting a table is a lot easier here than in the one's I frequent in California."}
{"text":"They need to up their take-out customer service and not act like robots. I've come here a few times to dine in or do take out. But lately, the take out dept has been slacking. I don't need to go to details other than then needing to be more consistent and improve their service. 

It's like they're in their \"I just work here attitude\".  Well if that's how you're going to represent a company/brand chain restaurant then maybe customers should look the other way for something worth far better than what they would experience here.  Maybe I'll give them a month or so to improve and then I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Very good food but very poor service. Not the first time we have had poor service here. This time, it was the worst service we have ever had. We had a table of 5 people starting around 5 PM for a birthday celebration and the restaurant was not busy.  I'm assuming that the server Alysha P, was having a bad day. She was very short and almost rude to each in the group. We had to ask her multiple time for more cocktails, water and such. We even waited for a couple of minutes to get silverware napkins and condiments after our food was brought to the table. Nothing was a priority to her. Four of us are self-employed business owners and the 5th person is a restaurant manager. None of us could believe that management has re-trained her or let her on her way out the door.  Hopefully better luck nex time."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch Saturday, December 9 , 2017.

We were able to get a table easily. The restaurant has a pleasant contemporay vibe. The decor is modern-bland, but totally acceptable. 

We looked at the beer menu, and found it to be overpriced with 16oz setting you back +$6. Beer from other breweries were similarly priced. So, they have elected to overcharge for their own brews, favoring high profit margin over promoting their own brand. Compare this to 16oz at my local Rivertowne brewery for $3.50. Wine prices are average. A glass of Kendall Jackson chardonnay is priced in the mid $9 range.

Food: we elected to split a California Chicken Club Sandwich (our appetites aren't what they were in our 20's). The sandwich arrived promptly, and that is where the good experience ended. It looked fine on top. I bit into my sandwich to encounter a bitter taste. I turned the sandwich over to discover that the bottom of the sandwich was totally black ... having been carbonized to a uniform layer of glossy black charcoal. I considered sending it back, but time constraints stopped us from doing. I wanted to take a picture, but my hands were so covered in grease at this point, I didn't want to reach into my pocket for my phone ... anyway, to visualize it, think of the glossy sheen of Darth Vader's helmet. I scraped the charcoal off the sandwich, my wife simply discarded her burned bread, and found the remaining product to be tasteless and bland.

We will not be returning to this restaurant. They obviously have poor quality control, and there are plenty of better choices for your restaurant dollars."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service, i ordered a shrimp pasta lunch plate and at the time of delivery i got no shrimp when i realized it i told the waitress who apologized (which wasnt needed because the chef messed up) and told us shed bring us some shrimp. 3 minutes later the manager comes by and tells me that that plate was on the house and apologized for the minor food setback. The waitress was awesome i unfortunately do not recall her name."}
{"text":"I come here quite often for lunch and business meetings,Amy the bartender is hands down the only reason I continue coming back. She has treated my girlfriend and I like family from day one. Amy you rock and thank you again for outstanding service."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Great food, great beer, and great service! Server Jon was excellent, providing just the right amount of attention at just the right time."}
{"text":"great selection of beer and food. Love NITWIT and if your feeling froggy for dessert the pizookie is bomb"}
{"text":"Normally love this restaurant but last two times my wife and I have come to this location it has been sub par. The table that they placed us at was completely covered with the previous occupants remains. After we had to run down a waiter to have the table wiped down he did it very quickly which left us with the food gone but a sticky table. We just used our napkins to lay over the table so we didn't have to deal with the stickiness. After we finished it took us 15 plus minutes to flag down our waitress for our check (which she did not even ask to refill our waters once the entire time we were there) and the place was not even busy. Needless to say probably be the last time we attend this brewery, the extra 10 minutes it takes to drive to San Tan Brewery is worth it."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in a while. We came for the first time on Friday, January 8 at around 6PM for my birthday. I picked it because it looked like it had a few items my picky husband and 6 year old would like. There was a small crowd waiting to be seated when we arrived. The hostess told us the waiting period would be around 35 minutes- not too bad. We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes to finally be seated. It seemed like everyone who arrived after us was being seated before us. And from what I saw, most of them seemed to know what to expect from this place. Everyone and their grandma had reservations that night! When we finally did get a table, my husband and I placed an order right away (we had plenty time to memorize the menu during our long wait). Our dinner did not arrive until about 50 minutes later.  My husband ordered a burger and fries. Son ordered the mini pepperoni pizza. Both thought the food was decent, nothing to rave about. I ordered the chicken, shrimp, and sausage, Jambalaya. It tasted like one of those frozen meals that come in a bag and you can just reheat in a skillet.  Idk what seasoning were in it, but it was definitely overpowering. 

I will say that the waitress was attentive and apologetic for the very long wait. She's the only reason I bumped it to 2 stars. She offered us a free salted caramel pazooki (?) I'm so glad I didn't pay for it because it was overly sweet and the cookie was hard as a rock. What a bust! What would have been a little over an hour experience turned out to be around 3 hours long! As a result, we didn't have time to make it to the Star Wars movie we'd planned for after dinner, so we headed back home. We all agreed we'd be crazy to come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I recently went to Bjs Restaurants to try it out and I absolutely loved it. I sat at the bar to watch the game and the bartender Emily greeted me promptly and sincerely. I tried one of their beers that she recommended, I think it was called the Pirhana and it was delicious. The food was great and came out quickly. Emily made sure I was happy the entire time and I was. It was a great first experience at this restaurant and I definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"What a truly great experience! Daniel T was genuinely pleasant and very attentive without being intrusive; a rare and desirable trait among servers in my opinion!  The food was timely and quite good. From ribs to pizzas and salads to weekend brunch, there was something to please everyone!"}
{"text":"The environment is pretty cool, but I was deeply disappointed with everything else. I ordered the grilled chicken Alfredo, and it was SO dry. Also, it looked like they just threw on the cheese in one clump. For a drink I ordered a blood orange pom sangria and it was OK. All the other flavors were overpowered by cinnamon. Even though the food wasn't that great, I must say that the service was great. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try last week and I may or may not ever go back. The food was good (I ordered my food low carb: a double cheeseburger without a bun and a side of broccoli instead of fries). The kitchen was very accommodating and didn't give me a hassle about the substitution. The burger was really good and had a nice chargrilled taste to it. My problem was with the portion size of the broccoli. I know veggies are more expensive than potatoes, but COME ON! I was served 5 little florets of broccoli; one was cut in half to try to fill the empty space more. (See the photo I uploaded). I took a picture of my plate the minute it was served to me. Was there a broccoli shortage or something? I thought that was ridiculous. 

The menu isn't too varied but they seem to have lots of pizza options. The \"brewhouse\" element of the place is really played down. They have a few beer tanks in the far back corner that are hidden out of view. 

The food was good, the ambiance was fine, but the service was absolutely horrendous! We weren't greeting when we walked in the place for about 10 minutes -- on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 pm! This is a busy time and restaurants need to have on their \"game face.\" When we finally were greeting, we got a nice table but then we had to wait and wait and wait for a server to greet us. Finally, after 15 minutes, we were approached. We ordered drinks...and then had to wait and wait and wait to get them! Finally we ordered our food, which took over 30 minutes to arrive. People at adjacent tables were all complaining (loudly) about how bad the service was. Our waiter disappeared for the entire meal, and we finally had to get up to go find somebody to ask for our check. It was abysmal. There were plenty of employees around, but our waiter was HORRIBLE. I don't know if I'll ever go back because the service was just so bad."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my niece and son today. I had the California Club with wedge fries, my niece had the baked ziti and my son had the kids hamburger. My club had nice thick pieces of carved turkey, it was perfect. The kids meal was on the large side and came with two burgers. The only leftover we had were a few of my sons wedge fries. The servers were very attentive and kept our drinks filled. We plan on returning for my birthday, so we can try some of their desserts."}
{"text":"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants in the east valley (and I'm shocked to read the negative reviews done before mine). Over the last 2 years, I've probably been there for a few dozen visits with my biggest complaint being that they are extremely busy during your common weekend meal hours. The servers have always been more than attentive and will even offer free samples of their made-in-house microbrews if you seem unsure of your beer selection. Personally, I get excited each fall for their seasonal selection called \"nitwit\"- it's a wheat beer, similar to a hef, with a hint of orange just gives it a unique coloring and taste. 

They have many options for meals, with some of my favorites being their salads (very large size, I have yet to finish one), their baked potatoes (over a pound, then stuffed with your favorites), chicago-style stuffed pizza, and signaure sandwiches (the crispy chicken is my favorite, by far). And, of course, you can't pass up dessert at BJ's- they have pizzookies. For anyone who might not have already been introduced, a pizzookie is a big cookie (in a personal pizza sized pan), baked to be slightly gooey with a couple scoops of ice cream on top."}
{"text":"Terrible service all around. My server was so rude, he was too busy trying to hit on another customer than get our orders correct and at one point, I heard him tell another coworker he was trying to \"hit that\". Our food took nearly an hour to come out and then it was cold. Asked to speak to the manager, the server sent out one of his buddies pretending to be the manager! The server literally tossed our bill on the table and walked away without saying a word. Needless to say, his tip went to the busboy. Would never eat here again or recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved everything we ordered...salmon, pizza and dessert! Our server, Shawn was incredible!  Ask for him when you go there!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Their moscato mirrasou is the best white wine I've had in my life. Goes amazing with the white macadamia pizookie. Love how they have good deals with half off wine and appetizers! This location has been my go to always. For seafood lovers try their cherry glazed salmon it's so good, I get it with mashed potatoes and asparagus."}
{"text":"This was fun. Parking is horrible. There is literally no where to park where you aren't walking across a driving path, afraid of being hit. We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait. They took my cell# and I rec'd a text saying it would be a 25 min wait. TWO minutes later I rec'd a text saying my table was ready! It's a noisy restaurant with high ceilings and many tvs. The menu is many pages long, with 40 choices of beer on tap, I had an Irish Root Beer - excellent! I ate the grilled chicken alfredo and my daughter had the roast beef dip. Both were excellent and of good portion size. The service was slow, the waiter lacking skills. I asked for water; he brought one, for me; none for my daughter. When our drinks were empty he asked if we wanted refills. I would have had a 2nd, different drink, had he stuck around for my entire answer. When I answered no for a refill, he not only took off, lightning fast, but left the empty glasses on the table. He did return to ask if we wanted dessert. We declined and he left to get the checks. But, again, he left the dirty, empty plates on our table. After I paid and we left, the dirty, empty plates and glasses were still on the table. He never removed either of them. We will return, because everything except the waiter was wonderful."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me, went here thinking the reviews are allright, wrong the food is really disappointing. Not good at all, gave it a couple of tries. I'm not the pickiest"}
{"text":"Great food and great pazookies!  Menu is insane...lots to choose from.  Highly recommend on Tuesdays - half price wine AND $3 pazookies!!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Huge menu! Nice staff, but can get very crowded however so plan accordingly. Definitely call in if you have a big group"}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and have never had a bad time. Everything has always been up to par. I literally have no complaints.

AND - I recently dropped a personal check made out to me while getting cash out to pay my bill. The manager found it and mailed it back to my client. Talk about honest service. 

BJ's is our go to place for an easy weekend lunch. Their home brewed root beer is super good."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night, a Thursday, with four other guys for dinner.  We were planning on eating at 7 and one of our party arrived there at 6:45 and was told that there was a 50 minute wait.  That ended up being almost spot on as the text message came in at 7:30 telling us that our table was ready.  The inside of BJ's looks quite nice as it is large and fairly open.  On one side of the restaurant is a large well lit and well stocked bar while the rest of the restaurant is for seating.  They also have a large chalkboard menu for their beer selections, a large number of TVs and some random open garage doors as dividers.

To start off the evening I went with a sampler of their beers and picked their Irish red, imperial stout, pale ale and IPA.  All of it tasted pretty good with my favorite of the bunch being the pale ale which had an interesting flavor to it.  After getting our drinks we all put in our entree orders and I went with the sriracha chicken macaroni and cheese.  In the meantime I pulled my silverware out of the napkin and put it on my lap.  The napkin was wet and would ultimately end up getting my jeans uncomfortably damp.  I didn't say anything at the time but at a later point it came up at our table and we found out that four of our five napkins were this way.  Our food ended up taking almost an hour to get to our table.  I chalked it up to the place being busy but whenever we looked around we discovered that no one in our section had food.  Whenever the food was finally delivered it was quite the disappointment as well.  The chicken in my macaroni and cheese was cold (thankfully precooked) while the rest of my dish was luke warm at best.  So I asked the table whose dish we had waited on as one of ours ought to have been hot.  Bizarrely everyone's food was pretty cold and even the deep dish pizza pan that they had carried out to our table with tongs was at room temperature.  My buddy next to me had the wings and took one bite before sending them back because they were cold.  Another friend ate half a shrimp taco before noticing a grey shrimp and stopping.  In the meantime I plowed through my luke warm pasta and cold chicken.  The flavor of the food actually wasn't that bad as i loved the cheese and sriracha with the chicken.  It would have been so much better if it was hot though as who likes cold Mac and cheese?

My buddy who got the cold wings ended up calling the manager over and politely informed him of the issues and asked if there was a problem in the kitchen that night.  The manager informed us that they just got backed up and didn't really say too much else.  His whole visit to our table lasted around 45 seconds and he ended up comping every meal at the table which was nice.  So in the end, all that we ended up paying for was the beer and tip.

The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here again in the future.  My friends strongly urged me to give it a 1 star review and I considered it.  While this was certainly one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I have had recently, at least no one that I know of got sick and there was the positive aspect of good beer."}
{"text":"To start out, the only BJ's that I have been to before this is across the street from MGM Grand. So to come to this compared to that, this place is impressive. 

I came for a baby shower for a friend and we had a section in the back side area, where there were other bigger parties. They had set-up a buffet table so when the food was ready we just went up and grabbed what we liked. I'm usually not a fan of potato skins but it was really good because they were crispy. The other food items, such as wings, pizza, and salad were nothing special. 

The best part of the restaurant is the service. The servers were so nice and I felt like it was my very own neighborhood restaurant. I would def come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Happy hour was packed, but Gloria was friendly and made great beer recommendations."}
{"text":"My brother and I came to bjs to try something fresh, after hitting the gym and we ordered the Santa Fe and the Asian chopped salad..we loved the presentation, it looked so delicious and it was so flavorful, we are definetely coming back next week. Great service, great food with an outstanding food presentation that makes you want to get more."}
{"text":"I love BJ's restaurants but I have to shout this one out. The staff is always so accomodating and attentive!!  A bunch of friends, about 10 of us, were celebrating a birthday and came in one saturday afternoon dressed up as zombies and they didn't bat an eye! We were taken care of and not rushed at all. 

Another Monday afternoon I had lunch with a friend and our server James was so great! No rushing through the lunch crowd, he treated us like we were his only customers. This BJ's is a great place for dinner before or after a movie at Red Rock; or anytime! BTW they have great drinks and specials :-)"}
{"text":"Went back to BJ's today for lunch and received excellent service. Food and staff was great. Just as I gave a negative review regarding my first visit I wanted to follow up on my second visit which is only fair."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The staff has always been very friendly. I've gone to this location many times and I've always been happy with the outcome."}
{"text":"One word: Pazooki. If you dont try this dessert you are missing out!

Prices are great, quality and taste of food is excellent, happy hour prices are decent, and the staff is outstanding."}
{"text":"I didn't see myself coming back here and trying the pizza again. However, with a group dinner scheduled for this place, I had no choice in the matter.

It took a while after our reservation time, but we were finally seated in the dining area on the street-facing side of the restaurant. I found out that the food was presented buffet-style for us, and it was right up by the wall for us to access. I guess no enterprising neighbors bothered to try to filch some extra food, but we ended up with extra food at the end.

Our menu included a house salad, with an Italian dressing and a ranch dressing, a grilled chicken pasta with creamy white sauce and broccoli (and apparently not enough chicken at all), and various pizzas. The pizzas were way better than last time, mainly because the crust was not soggy. I guess they know how to cook the smaller pizzas than whatever gigantic monstrosity I experienced in my last review. I didn't get to try the combo, but the pepperoni and the chicken (with mushrooms and tomatoes) were both very solid.

Most of us also ended up ordering mini pizzokies. My choice of the triple chocolate was a super sweet potentially-diabetes-inducing assault, and I enjoyed it aside from quickly gobbling up the Ghirardelli chocolate square because it wasn't going to be easy to break into small and even pieces.

The one thing I didn't appreciate was that we didn't get refills on water until long after dessert. I didn't find any of the foods particularly salty, but I had a problem when I simultaneously craved and lacked water at the end of my meal. Thankfully, we got additional water refills even while we were just lounging and chatting after dessert, which made the night less uncomfortable in the end.

Owing to the improvement in pizza, I'm comfortable in bumping my rating up to four stars. Although my first choice on Eastern Avenue wouldn't be a chain, I wouldn't mind coming back here at all."}
{"text":"I reluctantly gave 3 stars but probably 2 might have been more accurate.  We sat at the bar while waiting for a table. The bar person was one of the rudest people I have ever come across.  Usually people in the US are so nice and friendly but this guy made me feel like I was imposing by being there.
We got a table.  The server was lovely and very obliging.  The food was fantastic - we were there on half off pizza night.  However my daughter ordered a salad with dressing on the side and it took over 20 minutes from when the salad arrived to when the dressing arrived.  Disappointing.  As much as we like the food, I would think twice before putting myself in a situation with such bad bar service."}
{"text":"I've tried to go to this place many times, but the days and times where always  a mistake as it can get really crowded. 

Spoiled for so long with 4 peaks, I had to give it a try no matter what. They have a long list of their own beers and that was the best. I had the Grand Cru seasonal and it was just fine. 

Food is ok too, but they seem to fill your taste with the presentation of massive dishes. I had a BBQ sandwich that was ok but nothing I would order again. French fries are good, but sorry I'm far too adapted now to the ones at 4peaks. 

Friday night or Saturday are the best days to go and frustrate yourself looking a spot to sit. Sunday for lunch worked much better."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Portions are reasonable.  The staff was okay, not the best but I think working on it.

Too bad they decided to put it where they did.  Parking is lousy."}
{"text":"Nice patio which is open seating!  Pricey but join their club and you'll get some BOGO coupons sent.  Makes it reasonable. Decent beer but during Happy Hour, buck off."}
{"text":"First time ever going to this place, honestly never heard of them. We decided to go for brunch which is on the weekend (Saturday's and Sunday's) I was excited to see breakfast menu. I got me OJ, French toast with eggs and bacon. Really good! My husband had the classic burger with their secrecy sauce and potato wedges. He even said the lemonade was delicious.  We liked this place we ate it again in CA. Great food and our waitress and hostess were really nice :)"}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service. We ordered the bjs favorite deep dish. Pizza was cut poorly in uneven slices. Toppings were clustered in separate sections, one slice was bare of all toppings, even cheese, peppers and onions were raw. We then ordered a pazookie for desert, 45 mins later we finally got it and was raw. Server didn't check in with us at all while we were waiting and wasn't even on the floor for us to track her down. She said someone else took ours, had she checked in she would have caught that earlier. Management did remove from bill but did not visit table, did not see any management presence on floor."}
{"text":"Ok, I now I just wrote about not patronizing franchises, but this menu is great.  The sirachi Brussel sprouts are to die for.  They even honored a $10 off coupon I found on line.  The McCandless crossing location has been a favorite of mine 3 for 3 tries."}
{"text":"3 stars is only cause we went on Friday night. Now why does Friday nights suck...well happy hour does not come back at 10 pm like Sunday thru Thursday and Friday night has no dinner specials. So skip Friday nights unless you just love full price drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Beer choice is good that's about it. 

Long wait to be served, parking lot is too small for the amount of restaurants in the area. 

Food is just not good, poorly cooked 

Really not worth the time."}
{"text":"BJ's has good food and a nice environment.  Been here many times.  But I write now because of their incredible server CHAD.  This guy deserves high praise.  Yes, he was efficient and courteous and patient with us waiting for a 3rd person, but he actually stopped my friend when she said the rest was his tip. He said \"I think you need to check your change\" So she took it back and realized it was about $80.  She misread the bill while chatting away, and this amazing, wonderful, HONEST gentleman realized that. We are so grateful he pointed that out. This employee is very RARE and should be very VALUED. Thank you CHAD and thank you BJ's for hiring such an ethical person."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here a few times and had good experiences.  So when my family was looking for a place to get together over the holidays I recommended BJ's.  This was a big mistake.

Our reservation was for 6:30 but the table was not ready until well after 7.  No problem, a few members of our party were late anyway so no harm no foul.  We had 16 people and it was busy that night so a few small errors in service would not have been a big deal.  Though, almost everyone had complaints.  Twice I ordered one of their beers only to have a server try to give me a mixed drink.  My cousin asked for a dish (cant remember) and was told they were sold out only to see the same order leave the kitchen numerous times afterwards.  One of our family members received the wrong dish, multiple items were forgotten and when the check came the servers proved completely incompetent in dividing the check between 3 groups.  While my sister tried to assist them in separating the bill one of the mangers stood there and did nothing to assist his struggling employees.  

On our way out my sister approached two of the \"managers\" only to have one turn face and walk away from her and the other (younger guy) offered no explanation, no resolution, no nothing.  When she inquired further he at least offered to take her information and have someone follow up with an apology and possible gift card for our troubles ($500 bill by the way).  One month later we have heard nothing.

The food here is excellent and I may be back in small groups, but large groups should avoid BJ's like the plague."}
{"text":"This place is SO hit or miss(mostly miss), their menu items are delicious but only when they are made properly. Example: I LOVE their watermelon feta salad but my husband just brought it home for me to go after a long day. 
1. There was no mint
2. There was no arugula 
3. They sent olive oil instead of the citrus vinaigrette 
4. There was only one chunk of watermelon and a couple of pieces of tiny tid bits.

It was almost nothing like what I had a week ago dining in  

We live about a mile away and we usually just go to yard house because BJs is just too inconsistent with their food. My husband and I do NOT like to make a fuss over little things but there have been a few times that we sent our food back at BJs. I've gotten a hair in my food, taken it out and kept eating, so saying that we have sent our food back is saying a LOT for us. I just can't understand why the kitchen would send food out that only halfway matches the menu description  or is obviously burnt(different occasion at BJs) unfortunately it's late and I'm not dining in so I just ate my disappointing salad ."}
{"text":"I went to the location in the centennial area. and we had an amazing server named Anthony. I go to this restaurant about 2 times a month and this by far the best waiter I have had."}
{"text":"I get the same thing every time, and I love it! Parmesan crusted chicken, white cheddar mashed potatoes and finishing with a pizookie is a MUST!!"}
{"text":"Beer was great! Food was almost great! Service was horrible. Almost three hours to get out of this place.  Probably 30 minutes between seeing our server. Pointed to what I wanted and was brought something different."}
{"text":"Bjs in Houston was one of our favorite places to eat so we decided to go here for a family celebration. We were two of us with our am year old baby. 
After we were seated our server introduced herself n took our order. It took her 40 mins to bring our appetizers. We decided to ignore that part as the food was delicious. We didn't get our main course for almost hour. Can u even imagine our frustration. My baby got all cranky and fussy as his food was also not served. He was hungry. We planned our visit as such so we all could eat together and it wasn't the most busy in there. 
Super disappointed. 
Bad service."}
{"text":"The food and beer here is the same as at any other BJ's location--consistently solid. The customer service at this location is excellent, however. My friend spilled her beer while trying to maneuver into the booth, and the manager not only replaced the beer, but found her a BJ's t-shirt in the back to wear home.  Totally above and beyond the call of duty."}
{"text":"Another restaurant Kevin and I frequent when we are out and about in Chandler. Good prices, and the food is consistently good. I love the vegetarian pizza. In fact, their pizzas are all pretty good. Kevin got the nachos last time, which he enjoyed. I am no beer critic, since I pretty much hate it, but since it is a brewery, I can only assume the beer is up to par. The service is also good, and I love how lively it always is, even at ten on a Monday night. I always walk away satisfied and with the confidence that I have not just wasted my money on mediocre food and drinks. Thanks for being a friend, BJ's!"}
{"text":"We been going to BJ's for a long time but this place is better than any of them. James P. took awesome care of us, he went above and beyond to take our order to serve and in the end he made sure that we were able to is my rewards even after their system changed and did not recognize it. He is awesome, and all our food tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I enjoy this N. Olmsted location. The table with the fire on the outside patio is a nice touch. I love the service and food. The chicken dishes are really good. The stuffed mushroom appetizer is amazing. I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Large dining area dominated by an attractive bar. Lotsa tvs showing games. 

Crazy huge beer & mixed drink menu- it may be bigger than the food menu (which is also impressively large). 

Friendly staff. 

Our food was prepared to order and very tasty. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Now I normally like this place but my last visit here was in a word - Yuck!!
We went around 8:30pm- we noramlly eat lunch here so I don't know if at dinnertime the cooks are just too tired or what? Anyways, Our appetizer was Fried Calamari and it was not good at all and oh so cold. This should have been hot but we were so hungry that we dug in and we shouldn't have our tummies paid the price later...That was another thing there wasn't many people in here(Thursday night)  but the service was so slow. 
Fish Tacos- Horrible, the BF took one bite and it was cold inside the fried fish- the guacamole was sour- so this dish was sent back and Tomato Soup was ordered....
Chili in Bread Bowl- Chili had a bitter taste to it, almost like Raid. Now I have gotten this before and enjoyed it so I know how this dish should taste here when it's good.
Clam Chowder in Bread Bowl- My daughter enjoyed this dish and actually the rest of us ate this too as we were waiting for our meal replacements....
My Orange Cream Soda was good as usual but I was just so surprised at the outcome of the rest of the food, very disappointed to say the least!!

I must say that even though the food sucked and the service was hella slow our waitress when around was very nice and accomodating.
I am not going to say that I'm never coming back here but I'll just count this evening as an off visit for whatever reason and hopfully I'll never have to experience that again or anyone else for that matter...."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and The NBA Finals. Our server Garrett was a pleasure. He was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. Our drinks never were empty and he was overall a great server. He recommended appetizers and drinks to pair with. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5 times and have never had good service. Sorry, but the food isn't good enough to keep me coming back. Tonight was the last straw when I was seated in the patio and sat there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged by a waiter. I ended up walking out. I was with a party of 3. No waters, nothing."}
{"text":"I I really enjoy BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  I had actually never been to one until I met my hubby a few years back and boy was I missing out!  I'm glad he showed me the light!

The menu for BJ's is quite extensive and has something for everyone in your group.  Their pizzas are fabulous and come in so many different varieties or you can design your own.  My fave would be the White Pizza.  Anything with Alfredo sauce and I am in love.  My husband disagrees and always goes for the Classic Combo pizza.  It is good too, but not as pretty as the White Pizza.  Looks aren't everything, I know, but it is true in this case!

They also have a ton of other things from burgers, sandwiches, steaks, brunch (on the weekends), lunch specials Monday-Friday, and even low cal choices.  I don't anything about those because I am a full fat kinda girl, which is probably why I'm not a size 2.  They even have  french fry options!  Now that is just awesome because sometimes you want skinny fries and sometimes you want wedge ones.  GENIUS!

And of course, they have a ton of beer!  They make about a dozen different beers and even switch it up throughout the year in the different seasons.  For you non-boozers, they also make their own root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda, and black cherry cream soda.  I always go for the cream soda and I am always happy.

The service is usually ok, but it does waver, which is why I gave this location 3 stars.  Food alone is easily 4 stars, but the service knocks it down.  Sometimes you go in and your server is on it, but sometimes, like this past weekend, it was a diaster.  Our food took 40 minutes to come out.  Some of it was hot, some lukewarm, and one had been under a heat lamp for way too long.  We were all so hungry (Warning, do not mess with my family when we are hungry because you WILL get hurt!), we didn't send it back because we were afraid it would take another 40 minutes and we had plans afterwards.  We were not the only ones with this problem either, as I heard the tables around us all complaining about the same things we were talking about.  The manager on duty wasn't particular helpful either and we didn't even see him until we were already 35 minutes into the wait.  We asked him about the food situation and he tried to make a joke and then blew us off.  

I would say 80% of the time you will have a great experience, so definitely try it out.  And get some cream soda too!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday around 5 pm . This was our first time here , and it was a very happy find ! We were seated immediately , and had drinks served right away. I tried the very berry cider (very refreshing) for dinner I had the fried fish and wedge cut seasoned fries . It was served steaming hot & fresh . My bf ordered the turkey club and wedge cut seasoned fries . He was thrilled with his dinner as well. We will 
Definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love BJ's!  I had been to the Summerlin location a couple times but hadn't been to the newer Eastern location.  An old co-worker suggested we meet for dinner here.  I fell in love!  I had the Tomato and Mozzarella salad with a Chicken and Pesto flat bread pizza.  I raved about it so much that my mom and I went the next day and split the same salad and pizza.  Then I continued to rave about it so my mom, husband and I went the day after that and tried the appetizer sampler....so good!  Then my mom raved to my dad so my parents, husband and I went to dinner there!  We all ordered separated dinner entrees.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal!  We've all been back for lunch and happy hour.  Their tomato bisque is to die for!  I haven't had anything bad here.  The beer is great and the servers are pleasant! I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a table. It's a great \"go-to\" place if you're looking for an easy place to eat with tons of options.  I'm excited to try their brunch!

Without a doubt, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at BJ's a few times when in the area and it has always just been okay. Last night was no different. The beer selection on tap is great and the cocktail menu is pretty good.

Service last night was not the best. Our waiter forgot about us a few times throughout the night, and I watched another waiter tell him to check on us before he was once again going to go into the kitchen without checking on us. We ordered two side salads before our entrees and I must say they were a sad excuse for a salad. Iceberg lettuce, a few carrots and watery ranch. Yuck. I ate a little and decided to wait it out for my entrée.

I ordered a mini bacon cheeseburger pizza and my fiancé had the jalapeno pepper jack burger. The first few bites of my pizza were pretty tasty, it had a combination of cheddar cheese, dill pickles, ground beef, bacon and a special sauce. I had eaten it before on a previous visit and really liked it. After the first few bites the pizza seemed very doughy and not cooked all the way through. I might have sent it back but service was quite slow and I did not feel like waiting another thirty minutes. My fiancé's jalapeno burger was okay. It was not bad but not great. The fries were very tasty.

We did finish off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie. That is the saving grace to the whole meal. Warm cookie with ice cream mmmmm..... 

I might be back if it is a late night and I am coming out of a movie. I don't think that I would get to adventurous with the menu. I would stick to beer, apps and a pizookie."}
{"text":"Their call ahead feature sucks but the prime rib was excellent and the pizza is deep dish and delish! They actually put stewed tomatoes on it which makes it nice and juicy. The chicken tortilla soup was thick and not the best. Apps aren't that good. But entrees are actually!"}
{"text":"Not super impressed. I mean, it's a chain and a busy mix of families after soccer practice or a oddball mix of guys watching sports on TV. 
After about 15 minutes of waiting, our blinking remote went off and we were seated at a booth. About 5 minutes later our server arrives and takes drink orders, and returns 5 minutes later. We place our orders and about 15 minutes later the food arrives. Ordered; 2 kids sliders with fries, BBQ chicken salad, Dijon mustard chicken salad. Dessert was chocolate chip pizookie and Oreo pizookie. It was all okay, but just okay. Nothing wowed us. Our server was nice. Noise level was really high, but it's a sports bar place, so that's to be expected."}
{"text":"1st time ever being to a Bj's location, and was blown away. Our waiter Nick was absolutely on top of it the whole entire time we were there. To be honest it looked like all of the staff was working their butts off and getting things done. I just really have to say how awesome our waiter Nick was, super friendly and very informative!!

The food was very flavorful, and not disappointing in any aspect. They have a portobello mushroom salad topped with goat cheese and cranberries that just exploded with flavor. The clam chowder in a bread bowl, don't even get me started. The bread bowl was toasted, I mean toasted golden brown awesomeness with clam chowder that definitely had plenty of clams in it. Not to mention their prime rib, was rubbed with the perfect amount of seasoning that was not too overwhelming. Plus you have to top it off with just a simple pizookie! 

Great food, awesome staff, and just a great location!"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month. Pazookies are hands down my favorite dessert item. It's worth coming to BJ'S just for the Pazookies. Pizza is also great deep dish."}
{"text":"My parents took me BJs on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant is huge and equipped with a full bar and ample seating. BJs was busy but we were seated right away and greeted by our waitress. There were so meal options I was overwhelmed but in a good way. I wish I could have sampled everything! My parents and I chose stuffed mushrooms as our appetizer and burgers for our meals. The food was cooked to perfection and I was sad when the meal was over. My only complaint is about the waitress. We had to ask her for refills and another server for other items that we needed. All in all a good experience and I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Gabe and his team hosted my department's annual Christmas Luncheon. It could not have gone smoother. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. 

I would not hesitate to hold another event here.      

Great Job BJ's!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Frank. I appreciate you taking the time to take my call. Glad to see you address problems like this rather than ignoring them. The shift manager did honor the coupon after I pointed out you can't impose restrictions that are not specified on the coupon. By the way, the chicken tenders and the thin cut fries are excellent."}
{"text":"Great menu. Service not so much. We told the waitress we were ready to order after getting our drinks and she said \"well, I'm not ready\" and walked away. Seriously????"}
{"text":"The food and service was very good.  I had the Hickory Brisket and Bacon burger.  It was cooked to order and delicious.  The waitress was friendly and the food was served quickly.  I will return to this restauarant."}
{"text":"I think It's a fairly well known chain so there's probably not much I really need to say other than the food is enjoyable the service is really great and this is a super well managed location at least every time I've gone. Hard to ask for much more."}
{"text":"I love the BJ's chain but this restaurant is very hit and miss.  I have had some of the worst service in my life at this place.  Last winter a group of seven sat down for lunch and it took 30 minutes for the drinks and then another 20 minutes to order.  So 50 minutes before we ordered our food.  The pizza at this particular BJs is terrible, they put almost no sauce on the bread and over cook it."}
{"text":"The best BJs in Vegas! They are always packed full but super fast. I've never had a bad experience at this location and make it a point to stop by when on the west side of town because the pizza is so good.  The sweet pig is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Its hit and miss with this place.  I had avocado egg rolls and they were brown.  My husband had spaghetti and the meatballs were soggy and under cooked.  We sent the food back and all they did was put the spaghetti in the microwave.  My egg rolls were burnt and refried.  Some times the food is great but today it was horrible.  Might not come back."}
{"text":"It's easy to understand where they get their name from. Truly the only thing better than BJ's Oreo Pazooki is going all the way. At first you start to question if it's as good as your neighbor Steve said it is. Luckily for you, your server just walked by to suggest taking a bite into the heavenly swirled Oreo mousse. Now that your world is completely upside down you find yourself contemplating other areas of your life that could use an Oreo Pazooki upgrade. Forgot that special anniversary? Oreo Pazooki. Your kids hamster just died? Oreo Pazooki. Uncle Dan is getting married for the third time? Oreo Pazooki. Have a pulse? Oreo Pazooki. Just remember kids, when life hands you grocery stores, you buy milk and reassure yourself that BJ's will be serving tins of greatness for you to eat your problems away. Except for student loans.. You'll be paying those off until you die and no Pazooki will save you from that."}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I have eaten here and it was AMAZING.  We are originally from a touristy west coast city and in the hospitality and customer service business, now living in Las Vegas and in similar industry. We have made a habit of at least once a week trying a place we haven't eaten before and then we can pass our opinions on to our customers who may ask what's a good place around here.
This visit was on a Wednesday around 6:30.  We expected it to busy, it's the dinner rush, and it was very busy, a mark of a good restaurant.  There were plenty of people waiting to be seated but the hostess greeted us the second we walked in the door.  She told us wait times for booth, table, and bar then gave us a buzzer.  Our wait time was going to be 20 minutes, but all people waiting were seated quickly and it turned out to be less than 10 minutes.  
Our drink order was taken as soon as we were seated by a hostess, then our waitress introduced herself as she delivered our drinks a moment later.  Her name was Heather, and she was THE BEST SERVER EVER!  She made some good recommendations, stayed right on top of filling our drinks and clearing any empty dishes.  The food we ordered was perfect, even special requests were done right. (Ranch on the side, substitutions, etc.)  Heather was even good enough to chat with us for a minute when I asked about how long she had been waitressing, and she kept an eye on her other tables without being rude and didn't ignore anyone.  
We will definitely return and sample other menu items, and all of our customers will be encouraged to eat here as well.
THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for a late lunch with a group of my girlfriends! We spent about two hours there and our server was top notch! Patient enough to let us chit chat but still attentive with refills and orders. I ordered the Santa Fe Salad and it was fantastic! Chicken was moist and all the flavors blended really well together. The group of us split the appetizer combo platter and... please stay away from the avocado rolls. They are mushy and just about flavorless. There is no contrast in texture... adding chicken or corn or anything in addition to avocado would have truly elevated the roll.

Now... on a serious note desert. The seasonal snickerdoodle pizookie is FANTASTIC. Now, I swore whenever I came here to always get my favorite classic, chocolate chip. But, the girls forced me to try something new and I now have a new favorite! The flavor is out of this world, and when combined with the ice cream, dare I say.. life changing. lol. Do yourself a favor and order this!"}
{"text":"This is a SERVICE based review. Our food and drinks were both good but our server, Bryan, was possibly one of the worst servers we've ever had. Not only did he wear his \"I dislike my job\" face, but also he treated us like we were interfering with his personal time. We had pizza with no plates, didn't hear the specials until we were ready to order, passed us 5+ times after we had asked for water and boxes without giving us either and made our overall dining experience bad. Would come back for the food but not for the service."}
{"text":"Why go here?   Seriously.   Everything here is about as exciting as the Cheesecake Factory.  And by that I mean there is no taste, no excitement, and no flavor.  But for those of you who like safe dependable food that fails to deliver an iota of anything unique, this place is for you.  As I struggle to find something good to say about this place, I guess I will mention that the service is always bright and cheerful.  Of course bright and cheerful service is over rated in my world.  For those of you who enjoy unblemished mediocrity I encourage you to eat here."}
{"text":"Went here about 2 weeks ago, manger came over and talk to us like we were children. (I was with myself and two others) Very unprofessional for a new opening restaurant in the area. I can't say anything bad about the food. Just the fact that that happened would really make me think twice about returning."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner yesterday around 5pm. Service was as expected not fantastic, but nothing to complain about. I have visited this location before and love bringing the wife for dinner dates. The food is always good. However I cannot recommend the deep dish pizza. Mondays are half off pizza so I ordered the classic combo and it was very disappointing. The crust was thick, nice and soft, but the toppings were terrible. The crust is so thick you have to overcook the toppings to finish the dough. It was so bad the sauce was dried under the cheese and the amount of oil/grease used in the pan is insane. It is rare that I throw away pizza but this one is in the trash. I will continue to visit, just will never try the pizza again."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my girlfriend and daughter. My girlfriend got some type of shrimp and asparagus bowl (I think) and a couple of hours later she was complaining about weird lower abdominal cramps. Fast forward a couple of more hours and shes throwing up all night long,here it is the next day at lunch and she is still puking her guts up. Sadly a couple of months prior I had the same problem when I took my parents there to eat at the same location. I woke up in the middle of the night and threw up for hours and hours. Called the next day to let the manager know and shes like oh this isn't food poisoning or bad food it takes around 24 hours for that to happen... me not knowing any better I just passed it off as a \"fluke\" and didn't waste anymore time on it. But now since the same exact thing happened to my girlfriend and after reading more reviews we definitely arent alone in our bad food experiences. Daughter got the kids spaghetti and it was basically noodles with what looked like a little bit of ketchup on top of it..a 7yo complained about how it was so plain and no flavor. I had the chicken Parmesan and the mashed potatoes were cold and the chicken was very chewy and had me worried again that I would get food poisoning like my prior visit so i didnt even eat half of it. This really is sad because BJS used to be one of my favorite spot, not anymore, not worth puking my guts up for hours/days"}
{"text":"To me this is one of the worst places to go. The beer is good and that's about it. 
I've gone to this location several times and it gets worse every time.
First off we were seated handed menus and the server was talking to another and I guess they switched tables. He comes up before we even open our menus and says can I get you guys some drinks, beer or anything. I say sorry we just sat down can you come back in just a minute or two. Well, that turned into 15 minutes. 
He comes back and we figure ok we should probably place our entire order just in case. About 15 minutes later he brings our drinks. Then 10-15 minutes from then he brings one of our appetizers. Avocado egg rolls. The avocado was almost brown. Not from being cooked, but from sitting. He says that the station that makes the other appetizer is backed up, but he didn't want us to get hungry. After a fee minutes another guy shows up with our ahi crisp, and another avocado egg roll. I say we already have our avocado egg roll, and he says oh ok kind of confused. The ahi was cut into cubes that were Huge, no sesame seeds or any hint of seasoning basically huge chunks of ahi that smelled like warm raw fish. We finished what we could. 
Dinner wasn't really any better. I really don't want to write any more. Just know that I will never be going here again. The food isn't good. The service isn't good. This place is really not good."}
{"text":"Ouch. Fries were cold.  Burger charred and overcooked. Wife's wine glass dirty. 
Stick with the beer and don't eat here."}
{"text":"I'm visiting my Dad this weekend and we stopped in to get some drinks, lunch, and watch the ball game. 

The place was fairly crowded for a Sunday afternoon and they only had one bartender. She got very backed up and my Dad had to wait a good fifteen minutes for his martini. I ordered a Diet Coke which came out flat. 

We ordered chips and salsa to start, which were originally delivered to the wrong table. When we asked for a refill (as indicated by the menu) it took a while and they only brought out a half plate of chips and no salsa. 

We opted to go elsewhere for our lunch instead of continuing to torture ourselves. 

Note to BJ's: I don't live here and I'm not interested in getting anything for free or you doing anything else for me to \"make it right.\" This is just a warning to others to take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"A+ for the hostess but a big F for the server who never greeted us.  My family and I went on New Years Day and had two little kids with us.  The hostess alerted our server twice about us and he still never came up to us.  Waited about ten minutes then walked out.  This place was not busy either! Pretty sad because I have loved BJs on the west coast."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Regina, was phenomenal! Very attentive and nice!

The food was average. I had a full rack of ribs-they were tough and not fall-off-the-bone tender. Either they were overdone or were under the heat lamp too long. 

My dining partner had a pulled pork sandwich which she liked. The fries were also very good.

She capped off her meal with a pizookies which was yummy! 

All in all the meal was a little above average. I would stick to something other than the ribs when I come back."}
{"text":"Yelpers, you seem to have this one right on the money. Three stars is a pretty accurate rating for this middling restaurant.

We came here with some friends the other night. In general, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I try to keep an open mind. Chain or not, if a restaurant has good food and service, I'm game. 

Unfortunately, BJ's Brewhouse doesn't excel in either food or service. On the Saturday night we were there, it was quite busy, and apparently is usually that way. With so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, I can't quite understand why, but some mysteries of the universe don't have a good answer. We grabbed drinks and an appetizer at the bar while we waited for our table. Our appetizer, the chips with sriracha queso dip, arrived quickly, but it was lukewarm. Lukewarm food is always a punishable crime, but it gets elevated from misdemeanor to felony any time cheese is involved. Because it wasn't hot enough, the queso was thick and semi-coagulated...quite unappealing. Also, despite its name, there was no sriracha flavor in the queso at all (which was so disappointing, as I love me some sriracha). 

Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to refresh our bar drinks and take our order. And unfortunately, it was this way throughout most of our meal...our server was largely absent, and we had to repeatedly flag him down when we needed something. As for our food, we all ordered different things, with mixed results. One friend ordered fried artichokes, tomato soup, and a mozzarella and tomato salad. She reported that the soup and salad were good....fairly standard (as she pointed out, it's pretty hard to mess up tomato soup and mozzarella salad). The fried artichokes, however, were disappointing in that they didn't have any discernible artichoke in them....she said they pretty much just tasted like fried breading. Another friend got the spinach-stuffed mushrooms and thought they were tasty. My husband got the California Chicken Club, which came with a mountain of fries. He thought the sandwich was way too greasy. The bread was very heavily buttered, which made this light-sounding sandwich much heavier than it needed to be. I tried a few of his fries and they were decent....very thin cut and crispy. As for me, I opted for boneless wings with Peppered BBQ sauce. The portion of wings was HUGE....I clearly failed to notice the menu description stated that it was a pound of wings. Uh, whoops. A pound of fried anything for dinner is never well-advised. So needless to say, a doggie bag was needed. The wings themselves were crispy and meaty (thumbs up), but unfortunately there was barely any sauce on them (thumbs down). I wanted to ask for more sauce, but couldn't find our server. So most of the wings I ate were dry and largely devoid of flavor. Total bummer!

As for drinks and dessert....my one friend ordered a watermelon basil margarita and found it to be sweet to the point of being undrinkable. To our server's credit, once we flagged him down and told him that she wanted a beer instead, he took the drink back and didn't charge her for it, so that was good. My husband ordered a couple of their porters and thought they were okay, but was expecting more from a place that brews its own beer. For dessert, we of course had to try their famous pizookie, which is a freshly-baked cookie with ice cream on top. We shared the pizzokie trio so we could try several flavors (we chose salted caramel, cookies and cream, and peanut butter). My friends went nuts over the pizookies and thought they were insanely delicious. Personally, while I thought they were good (I mean, you almost have to actively *try* to make anything with cookies and ice cream taste bad, right?), I thought in general they were a bit too sweet and the individual flavors of each pizookie were drowned out in the overload of sugar. So all three mostly ended up just tasting like generic cookie with generic ice cream to me. Also, the edges of the cookies were overcooked to the point where it created a very unpleasant tough texture in those spots. I dunno...I guess I fancy myself a bit of a dessert snob, so when something is hyped up to the extent the famous pizookie is, I expect it to deliver. This was just so-so for me (but again, my friends loved it, so different strokes).

The above rambling dissertation essentially boils down to the fact that BJ's is quite average across the board. While it's not terrible, it's not a place that I will seek out, and it's certainly not worth waiting for on a busy Saturday night. Go elsewhere, my hungry friends."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, the Ahi salad is my personal favorite. They are not a perfect restaurant but I don't think that there is one out there that is perfect unless you want to pay several hundred a plate. That being said I would still say that BJ's is one of my Favorite places to eat. 

Breakdown my Favorite's

Apps -
Flatbread Nacho's are awesome
Crispy Calamari are also great, I love the bits with the tentacles 
The boneless wings are good, the regular wings aren't the best but they aren't horrible
the Avocado Egg Rolls are bomb, a little spicy but super good. 

Small bites
Salsa, Guac, Queso, and Salsa are all on point
the stuff mushrooms are really good, the sauce is yumtastic

Entrees
Fire Roasted Barbacoa chicken is pretty good
Spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles...bad-a** pad thai 
Asian chopped salad i think is ok, my friend loves it
cherry chipotle glazed salmon is super good 
Mediterranean chicken tacos are really good
the turkey burger is one of my favorite turkey burgers in the valley
barbacoa cauliflower pita, sounds weird but is pretty good, kinda tastes like chicken lol
Maple salmon tacos are so good, sweet and tangy 
the Ahi Salad, is my utmost favorite, i order that all the time, its so good, tangy sweet spicy (with copious amounts of wasabi i add) 
Shrimp and asparagus penne is not bad, i am not a big pasta fan in general but I killed it. 
The super salad, not one to cheat on my ahi salad but this one holds its own.

Sandwiches
the hand pulled turkey dip is awesome, the horseradish sauce and the au jus make is yummy
California chicken club is pretty decent
mahi mahi taco's definitely one of the favs, super good.

Desert
who can go wrong with a gooey cookie still warm that it melts the icecream on top... people they literally invented the pizookie..."}
{"text":"Call ahead seating!!  

LOVE, LOVE BJ's!  It's one of few places that we can go to as a family and everyone is happy and content.  It's less than a mile from my house which is super awesome and I've never been disappointed!!  Yes, I know this is a chain and I am personally more a fan of the local eateries, but BJ rocks!!

They have a kid's menu that the girls know like the back of their hands and I like that it includes celery & carrots and ranch or applesauce or a small salad.  Not just fries (since those don't go over well with my kids).   The happy face potatoes are awesome too, but they are not fans. 

They now have a great ENLIGHTENED menu if you want to keep the calories down -- my personal ENLIGHTED fave is the chicken ala fresca, but  the Garden Market Salad w/Blackened Chicken is a close second!  We love their pizza - if in the mood for a thick pizza filled with goodness. 

Hubby loves their fried shrimp, chicken fried steak and many of their sandwiches.  

Breakfast is good too - not what brings me back every time, but it's noteworthy.  

Come on your birthday and get a free b-day sized pizookie!! Yum!  They don't sing either which is a bonus, but their pizookies are amaaaaazing!!!  I've never seen one disappear so quickly as they do when placed in front of my kids!!"}
{"text":"Took forever just to take our drink orders. Table was dirty and the waiter had attitude when I asked for it to be cleaned. Took an hour for the food to come. The deep dish had little to no cheese. Garlic bread was forgotten with another dish. One of the managers on duty had no recover skills. Fix the issue don't keep apologizing for it. Tried to give this place another chance after the last time I went. They failed again."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I we decided to try out for the first time in BJ's.  We get there an its a  20 minute wait it's understandable It was 7 o'clock at night we waited. First of all our waitress didn't introduce yourself.  I work in Food and beverages and that's the first thing you should do. We start ordering our  appetizer  but in between ordering appetizer and entrees I ordered  a thousand Island drink. Tell me why my appetizer my entree came before my drink . We order cherry chipotle salmon in the Peruvian quinoa and  s... when we ask for our bill they were charging us a prime rib and some salads that we never order. And they were charging twice the original mount. I was  disappointed about  this restaurant"}
{"text":"Mediocre food/ sloppy service

I really wanted to like this place. It looks like a neat brewery but is more like a generic chain. Too bad because I miss Gordon Bierch's beer since moving to Pittsburgh...BJ's is not an equivalent substitute. 

We went on 2 separate occasions...both times the restaurant was busy and there was a wait for our table. 

Our waiter on the 1st visit was slow to take our order and slow to bring our food. The table next to us ordered after us but was already on dessert while we were looking for drink refills. Their waiter checked on them more often.  Food was okay. I had a salad with grilled salmon. The salmon was a tail section and over cooked so a bit dry. We tried a few of their drafts. I liked the brown ale \"Nutty Brewnette.\"

Our waitress on the second visit didn't know much about the menu. My husband asked questions and then didn't get what he thought he was going to get. I was trying to avoid a cocktail with pre made mix but ended up with a sickeningly sweet one. 

With so many options around, we might skip this franchise in future."}
{"text":"I remembered that they have a pre call to put your name on list. 
1. When I called I ask Kiki how call ahead worked?
She said \" give the front your name and they will take you right in. WRONG Cuz
When we arrived there we gave our name , they told us it would be 10 mins we thought oh OK
WRONG ....we waited the 10mins .....but it was really 20mins more )))
2. When we did get seated the Guy we thought was our server pass by our table 3 times before we realized he was our server (Brian) came over to take our drink order, that took 10mins now...
3. When I order pizza cuz this is a BJ( PIZZA )
Place . I asked with out pizza sauce .... Brain told me that all the Pizzas in the back are Per made . 
(( Now I have worked in the Restaurant business for seven years . I know that there is a guy back there prepping pizzas all day for BJ (Pizza)all they would have to do is ask the prep guy to make it.
The manager said that she would go back and see which pizzas had the least sauce. The reason I gave it one   because the food is good. Service lousy, terrible"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service wasn't. We ordered the orange glazed salmon w/ asparagus and the chicken pitas. I would give the food a B. It was brought to our table without much wait.

Our waiter was not real attentive and messed up our dessert order. He brought our bill before we received our dessert and we noticed he ordered the wrong dessert and asked him to make sure we received the correct dessert. Shortly after, the manager came to our table and apologized for the mix up with our dessert.

We ended up waiting an extended time to receive the correct dessert, which was fairly tasty (macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream on top). The waiter took our bill and cashed us out and never apologized for the dessert issue, even though he or the manager took it off our bill. Kinda sad that the waiter didn't take advantage of an opportunity to apologized and let us know they comped the dessert because of the mistake."}
{"text":"Always good. Get their app, it allows you to get on their wait list, order take out, and decent discounts."}
{"text":"An absolute disappointment. We came here for the beer tasting/dinner and it was sub par. $30 per person for one slice of pizza, half a chicken entree and 5 shots of beer. Overall, our group of 6 spent upwards of $180 and we left feeling like we needed to go somewhere else for dinner and a beer.  We were told prior to the event that we would leave happy but we definitely left the feeling the opposite! Avoid this at all costs!"}
{"text":"Had a GREAT salad and clam chowder soup. Awesome customer service. I LOVE this place and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I am a Vegas native and was a long time customer of this restaurant. I would like to share with you my terrible, and last experience, I will have with this establishment. I met two important people for dinner and we were \"served\" by Cinnamon O. We are familiar with outstanding service.. being connected with several five star establishments and companies. At the end of our meal we decided to mention the profoundly dismissive attitude and lack of regard for our experience with Bjs Brewery. The manager apologized and we appreciated the responsive communication, however, I will not be returning to this restaurant. Please take into consideration that body language, such as rolling your eyes at customers and having a  blatant lack of manners is not what this company expects of its employees. Head over to Yard house or the BJs in centennial area where we have never been mistreated for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been to BJ's in a while and we went last night for the Pary for Two special they have for Sept.  My first time for pizza, the BJ Combo was excellent, couldnt finish it.  I usually have Jeremiah Red but decided to try the Oktoberfest last night, Loved It!  And after the Pizookie, yummy i wanted to sleep.   I love the food, service and atmosphere at BJ's especially the BEER."}
{"text":"BJ's is a nice restaurant. If anything, this reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory but not as dark. We came here for dinner and to my surprise, they make their own beer! So this is a two parter. One for food, one for the beer. They have a huge menu. They will have something for everyone.

Reason it's only 4 stars is we did have to wait for our waiter longer than normal on several occasions. Also this place wasn't packed. Busy but not packed. Bonus points for they give out little pizza pieces to the guests that are waiting to be seated.

Food- starter was the potato skins. Would have preferred they weren't deep fried vs baked. They were tasty and they could have always used more bacon!! Wife had a bacon cheeseburger. Huge burger that's plenty juicy with all the fixings. I had the ribeye with a baked potato and a bowl of clam chowder. Chowder and the potato were very good. No complaints. The ribeye was cooked to my liking (mid rare) but the seasoning was missing. Felt like it was missing a bump from being a really good steak. I will probably get a burger next time I'm here. 

Beer- I got a flight of beers. Cost about $7 for 4 of them. This time they are 5oz beers vs the normal 2oz. I got the...

Lightswitch Lager- there version of the bud light. But this one is very good, crisp, highly carbonated and clear. Excellent!

Harvest Hefeweizen- another great quality beer. Smooth, clean, went down way too easy. Would get a pint of this any day.

Jeremiah Red- surprise of the night! Malty and sweet. Has just amount of kick on the taste buds to wanting more. Well made quality beer.

PM Porter- I'm a sucker for porters and this didn't disappoint. Smooth, fragrant, great mouth feel. Well made Porter.

This place knows their beers. Period. Can't wait to return and try the other craft brews on the menu. I would come back here before I go to San Tan Brewery."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's amazing how bad service can be at places.  I'm not sure if it's management/staffing or if it's the bartenders / size of the bar at this place but the service is ridiculously bad/slow.

For example, dropped in to catch the SF/LAD game on the nice TV's they have in the bar area.  Took 10+ minutes to put an order in for a beer, asked if they could put the game on and by the time we'd finished our beer they still didn't make an effort to put the game on.  Never mind, we'll watch somewhere else donks.

The kicker is it was a Tuesday and the place was like half full.  LOL.

All in all it's a chain that operates like a chain.  Go to PT's where the service is better...I will!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The night we were a party of 4. The wait alone was a nightmare, because it took 40 min to get a table. We were finally called and had to walk past vomit on the floor. That should have been a fore warning to leave. But, the franchise has the great reputation so we stayed and ordered. The waitress was a little too talkative after she learned the couple in our grouo are from Germany.  After receiving my chili before the rest of the table, she learned they entree they ordered was taken off the menu.  Tacky, tacky. Smh They had to wait another 15 minutes to get served.  Overall, not a good first impression."}
{"text":"BJs in Las Vegas was great. In fact, BJs anywhere is great. One thing to note however that the server perhaps forgot to bring the drink order right after it was placed. Now, it is not a big deal, however it slightly needs to be improved, as I didn't think the restaurant was busy enough. When it gets busier it is understandable, of course. I had a chicken sandwich meal which was great and very substantial. Their draft beers are amazing. Will definitely go back to BJs anytime soon."}
{"text":"I like their deep dish pizzas a lot! The freshly chopped cilantro on top of the bbq chicken pizza is amazing. I love cilantro on anything! The best part is on happy hour the mini pizzas are half off.  Also for a place that does pizza mostly their chicken wings are darn good as well. 

If you like deep dish pizzas this is one good place to get one. They are on the pricey side of pizzas so don't expect pizza hut 5 dolla specials here. Again the best time is to get one on happy hour!"}
{"text":"We had the Mediterranean tacos and they were outstanding! Also ordered the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was tasty and served with thin tortilla chips!

The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My gut became suddenly, explosively ill in the early morning hours after eating their supposedly all-natural (menu gave no explanation of what that meant) bison burger and their recommended (but bizarre) root-beer whiskey for dinner. I'll never enter this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The service was good however we came here because the pizza was supposed to be amazing and it was good if you like 20$ bread sticks. Lets just say we wont be going back for \"pizza\""}
{"text":"I wish they would've kept the pizza the same. Been coming to BJs since I was a teenager. I always order the same thing. I can taste the difference. I hate when people ruin a good thing. Glad the strawberry lemonade and Pazookis never changed"}
{"text":"The truth is I have experienced way better for the same prices they have there. Just on 01/02/2015 me and my wife did a order to go, for us and some of our family and kids. The order wasn't big, it was a pretty easy straight forward order.

     I spoke to a girl name Brahel if I even spelled it correctly, she was very polite on the phone and took our order, so after ordering she read back what I said to her and then she gave a price and had no problem with it. 

     We went to go pick our food up and when we came home, the food we ordered wasn't there, only a portion of what we ordered was there, so I looked over my receipt and they charged me for exactly what I ordered, so I called them up stating I was missing items the girl Donna who answered the phone was very rude and said \" don't complain to me I didn't take your order \". She immediately sent me back to the ordering Department, so I was speaking with a manager. 

     The manager was polite and understanding, he said he would have someone deliver the missing items to our home. I called within 2 minutes of being home and noticing what was missing, we had to wait over an hour just to get the same wrong food....  

     The company doesn't obviously train people and specially have people listen. I called back and I had to explain again to the same manager that the items that I told him I paid for were still not there and he apologized again and said he would have them delivered, I said forget ir I just won't return."}
{"text":"Sat down @ 6:52   , ask waitress for 2 beers happy hour she looked at her phone said sorry it's 7:01.... I told her we were here but waiting till now.. She could not honor the happy hour price, I come her 2-3 times a week.. Just had catering done for work.. Not a happy camper.. We were here before 7:00. Management needs to look at this policy."}
{"text":"My family & I come here often! Their Parmesan crusted chicken is delicious, as well as the roasted Brussels sprouts! The servers are always friendly & helpful with the menu. I enjoy their rewards program. The only down side is there is almost always a wait at dinner time. BUT worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection, great appetizer options, great happy hour, great menu selection with many options from burgers to pizza and a lot of other options.  It's a chain restaurant so you get what you get but you can certainly do a lot worse than BJ's in the franchise restaurant department.  Recommend the avocado egg rolls, queso & chips, or boneless wings for appetizers.  All the burgers are fantastic and the pizza is excellent!  Jeremiah Red is one of the best beers they have and Hopstorm IPA is exceptional!"}
{"text":"What a great place for Sunday funday! Food was great, service was amazing! However was REALLY disappointed in the host staff, we had a little bit of a large party and they wouldn't accommodate us. We had to wait for our waiter to come around to ask if we could push some tables together so our group could be together. Even when I asked the host if we could  push some tables together he got a major attitude, and walked away without getting his manager like I asked. Not a fun start to our Sunday funday watching football.  Other than that mishap, I love BJ's and there great beer selection."}
{"text":"Went there for my wife and her sister's b-day. Great food. The triple chocolate pizookie was delicious. Danny was an excellent server and was on top of our every need. He made sure our food came out promptly and correct. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is for their chicken tortilla soup ONLY! YUMMMMMMMMMMMM is all I can say. I love how they come out with the bowl filled with the tortilla chips, avocado, lime and chicken and then they pour the broth in your bowl at the table. That way the tortilla chips are never soggy and it's just cool to see. 

I ended up ordering the half potato (grilled chicken) and soup. It definitely filled me up for $8.00-$9.00? There was a lunch rush, but everything seemed to come out quickly. Overall, I have always been a fan of BJ's and now that its walking distance from work I will be here more often."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at BJ's was last week. This is a busy business, but has adequate seating between the bar, the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night, but definitely worth it.

Sometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook, which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes, but also a pain because you want to eat everything, as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good, too! 

Another great thing is the dessert menu, which has a lot of good options, especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here: http://www.bjsrestaurants.com/menus/desserts). Opted for the Baked Beignet, but they were out of it, so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious. I joined their rewards club and always get e-mails for deals, so I suggest signing up, it's worth it! Cannot wait to go back, just wish it was closer to my place!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here.  Everything we've tried is absolutely delicious!  The absolute best menu item is their deep dish pizza.  It's surprisingly light, and comes in a ton of different varieties.  The spinach and artichoke dip is good, and a decent sized portion.  And you can't forget about the pizookie dessert! (Warm cookie with ice cream, comes in a bunch of different combinations)"}
{"text":"I usually order from the small plate menu but decided to go with a shrimp pasta dish the last time I was there. Unfortunately it wasn't great, or good, only blah. Too little shrimp and way too much pasta. The flavor was bland, so bland that I had to constantly pepper each bite. I'm going to stick with what I enjoy best, the small plates."}
{"text":"Another large chain and another meal that was just okay.   The perks were that our server was great, they make their own beer, root beer, and cream sodas, and they have a large menu so there's pretty much something for everyone.  However, service was also very slow and the food wasn't even piping hot when delivered.  We all ordered a version of their grilled cheese and all were pretty good.  Unfortunately, two of them were pretty soggy underneath.  We also shared an appetizer platter, which was full of typical bar food, also delivered on the not so hot side, and wasn't really anything to write home about.  So, if you aren't in a hurry and want something familiar along with a cold beer, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Service slow, messed up the order twice.  One of our party did not get their food til after the rest of us were done.  No apology.... Just excuses."}
{"text":"Food is great, service has been awesome - vegetarian options are a huge plus and no more needs to be said than PIZOOKIE!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My husband had never been so one evening I talked him into trying it. He was impressed by the menu and especially the beer selection. We have had nothing but great food and service at this location!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and enjoyed everything, but we never had such horrible service as we experienced tonight for dinner. I had mentioned to the hostess and the manager that we were celebrating my Dad's 83rd birthday and that we would be ordering desert for him, (hoping they would at least put a candle on it). My father ordered coffee with cream and sugar, the waitress (Patricia) bought the coffee and cream but said she would be back with the sugar?? She bought him extra coffee in a little stainless steel teapot which did not keep the coffee hot. When he was ready for more coffee she bought him a cup but forgot the cream and said she would be back with the cream?? He sat for at least 5 minutes waiting for cream before someone else finally bought it. We wanted to order desert before we were done eating but she never came back. So when she finally took our dinner plates away we ordered desert and waited. She gave us our check before the desert even arrived and when another server brought the desert out--no candle--no have a happy birthday--nothing.
The food was very good, especially the Barbecue chicken salad, but the service was not acceptable.
And bring a flashlight to see the menu, some of the tables are so dark you can't read the menu. We watched other tables struggle to find some light to read the menu also."}
{"text":"I liked the pale ale. It was exactly what you would expect for a micro brewery. Full of flavor.

The appetizers were pretty good to. I would recommend the egg rolls.

Overall the food was a bit pricey.

The service was pretty slow though. It wasn't very busy but it still took really long to get our food."}
{"text":"So this wasn't my first trip to Bj's, but this was the most impressionable. It is close to my sister's house and makes for convenient dinners with the family. Last night was probably the worst experience we have had at BJ's so far and it left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth. 

First off, my husband ordered some pasta with lemon butter sauce, feta, chicken, olive oil, and some other stuff in it. He asked for no tomatoes or red peppers because he is a wuss like that. About 10 minutes after we finally ordered (and I mean finally) the waitress came out and informed him that the kitchen said his meal would be bland without the tomatoes and it would not be the same dish at all, then asked him if he wanted to order something else. After the award winning sales pitch he just received he said of course and asked for a menu. The waitress then disappeared, took another table's drink order, then made her way back with a menu. 

Secondly, our waitress was spacey, non existent, and never really checked up on us. Typically I would not be a stickler for something like that but one of the people in our party was given entirely the wrong meal. Somehow fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken turned into grilled chicken pasta with broccoli. The manager came and apologized but that was 15 minutes after the food runner went back into the kitchen to see about the order. Our waitress passed our table 4-5 times during this time and never once asked why a large plate of food sat untouched and every person in our table was turning to make eye contact. She never even apologized for the mix up later. 

Then they brought my niece's food was brought out about 20 minutes before our food. We were a little concerned when our food did not follow and then about 10 minutes later the waitress came to explain that she sent it out early since \"kids eat slow.\" In reality it just lead to my niece being finished with her food before the adults and had plenty of time to frolic in the left over mac and cheese. 

Finally, when the bills were brought out she boasted that she did not charge our table for our non alcoholic beverages (an ice tea and sprite) and acted as if she had done us a favor. I would of much rather preferred that I didn't have to flag her down to ask for a beer (which ended up being watered down) and management would of taken some sort of responsibility for the long wait (35-40 minutes for food- pasta and a burger), poor customer service, and total mess up on an order."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service however was completely horrendous. Glasses of water went empty, that's if you were lucky to get one. Food came out without the necessary condiments. Example: a baked potato with nothing in it. No butter, no sour cream, nothing. Just the potato. Meals came with dessert, that never arrived. 

I've had bad service before, usually it's with new waiters so I am usually understanding. This guy just looked like he gave no shits about helping anyone.

If you want good service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wait a little long for a near empty lobby. 20 minutes. Ribs were good, along with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  California club flatbread was less than stellar, very slight on all toppings for$10! Golden asparagus was way too greasy, i had to pull the asparagus out of the breading to eat it.  Wait person, Breanne was not very attentive. After being served she disappeared. We WERE going to have dessert, but after waiting and waiting for her return, I simply was turned off by having to ask the hostess to find her. The table next to as well were waiting for her to bring the check.  It was also quite chilly."}
{"text":"First time here. Not a long wait on a Monday. We sat in the back corner which wAs nice since it's loud in there. Finally a waiter arrived, nice kid, talked it up and took our order. Had calamari - it was good but they could have drained the oil better. I had a burger- it was good. Fried are thin and could have been hotter. Husband had the jambalaya spicy...it was. Got a free dessert because I mentioned it was our anniversary. Overall not a bad place if you don't mind the noise level."}
{"text":"I never have a bad experience at Bj's.  I love everything about it from the layout all the way down to the Pizookie!  The microbrews are great.  I really like how they suggest certain foods with the different beers they offer.

The pizza's are great.  I have never been to Chicago, but it's nice to be able to get a deep dish only a few miles from where I live.  The pizza's may not look gigantic but don't let that fool you they are feeling.  The staff are awesome the place is always clean and there is always A nice buzz in the place.  There hasn't been a single time that when someone suggests Bj's I say no.  The place is great."}
{"text":"We come to this place often and just went for dinner last night. When the food is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's pretty bad. I ordered the grilled tacos last night and got one with grilled fish and one with grilled shrimp. The shrimp tasted awful. Seemed like they were cooked for 20 minutes too long. A piece of leather probaby would have been easier to chew through. The fish was also very over done but was a little easier to stomach than the shrimp. Our waiter never came back to ask us how the food was, in fact we didn't see him again until he was ready to give us the check. We had waited 30 minutes for our table and I was starving, so I just put on my big girl pants and ate my meal. We will be back because we've also had good experiences here and we do like this place overall, but I think I will skip the grilled tacos next time."}
{"text":"Don't ever make the mistake of going to this place to watch your football game on Sunday!!! I have never experienced such rude people - the bartender and the manager. I could go on and on, just save yourself the aggravation. This place clearly doesn't know anything about football and it's fans."}
{"text":"The root beer that they make is should be considered CRACK! I go there just for the root beer. Everything in this place is good they have a few floor managers whom walk around asking you if your food is ok. If its not they will take it back and then something else is back to you in 10 mins. 

And its right next to a comic book store to boot. Its a good area to go and eat. I would visit again and again."}
{"text":"Every October I visit Phoenix and always make a special trip to BJ's. My mom and I love to grab a seat at the bar,so we can converse with the friendly bartenders. Everyone is always so pleasant and conscious of making sure we are completely satisfied. 
We have never had a bad meal and the drinks and dessert are spectacular! I wish we had a BJ's near my hometown"}
{"text":"This place is your typical microbrewery restaurant small chain type place. They feature their beer as well as others.
Some of the Pros:
- Excellent beer selection.
- A Variety of items to choose from on the menu.
- Reasonably priced.
- Large seating area.
- Friendly staff (that I dealt with)
Some Cons:
- With this being a new location and new staff, they seemed to be still learning the menu and drinks. (Should know both fully before completely opening).
- Music selection while eating was poor. 

Other than that it was a great experience.

I got the brisket burger and it was really good with alot of flavor and their endless fries (I do not eat fries often) are really good, but they are salty. We also got the Sriracha queso with chips and let me tell you, that for $5.XX it was well worth it for 2 people and they have endless chips also. The queso was very good and just a hint of spice.

We will be a return customer."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time Is a pleasure. I love the burgers here however they do have a huge menu with something for everyone. This is more of a bar/restaurant vibe which means it is pretty busy and loud but the food makes up for that. 

Let's talk about beer... they have it all! They have a wall full of taps and kegs all over the place. If you cannot find a beer here that you like, you simply don't like beer. 

Whether you are looking for lunch, dinner or just a drink, you cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Been in here a few other times and was okay at best. But this time was different, we walked in and when up to the hostess Kiara who completely ignored us for about 3 minuets. Then when my boyfriend was like \"excuse me is the bar open seating\" is when she finally acknowledged us and she said \"yes, did I get your name?\" Like obviously not lady? She acted like she didn't ever see us when we were both standing there. We sat in the bar and took forever to get service and when we did it was shitty. Ordered spinach dip and that was okay, I got a mojito and was disgusting. My bf got a Pepsi and was flat. We both got Santa Fe salads and both salads were bland with not a lot of chicken either."}
{"text":"Wonderful restruant! I come here with my family for special occasions and it is perfect. There is lots of choices in alcoholic beverages for the adults, but they also have fresh brewed soda off the tap! Lots of choices as far as eating goes. I've gotten the brewhouse burger (Great with buffalo sauced dumped on top), and the buffalo chicken pizza. Pizza here is greasy, but I don't mind so that didn't change my opinion on the pizza. The pizookie is really neat too. Warm fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top- completes any meal!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening its was a little crowded, not too long of a wait, but a wait well worth it! Brewhouse Blonde beer set the pace along with the Roasted Caramelized Brussel Sprouts that were AMAZING!!! Fried Artichoke Hearts were good too. Then I had the 5 Meat Deep Dish pizza with Jalapeños, onions and Roasted Garlic, OMG!!! The pizza is off the Richter Scale!! The Menu has so much to choose from its hard to decide, but BJ's is a happening Spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing like being lied to about the wait! Got here at 5:44 & was told that the wait was 25 minutes, well it is now 6:33 and no seat. I don't mind a wait just hate being mislead- won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's boss recommended this place, so we visited last night.  Our waitress, Katelyn, was wonderful and very attentive.  She checked on us quite a bit and was always friendly.

The food was not as good as the service.  My boyfriend ordered a deep-dish pizza and it was very disappointing!  We named this the \"Just a lot of dough\" pizza.  If you are from the Chicago area or have ever visited, do not order this deep dish!  There is hardly any sauce and the dough is about an inch thick through the entire pizza.

I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone and I was not impressed.  The noodles were overdone and squishy and most of the dish was very bland."}
{"text":"They have their own microbrews which is pretty cool.  I've only tried a couple, but I really really enjoy the harvest hefeweizen.

I really only go to this place for beers and clam chowder.  There's lots of other stuff on the menu, but I haven't bothered with it too much.  I like the clam chowder so much I feel like I'm missing out if I try anything else.  With that said, I have tried a burger and a pizza here.  Both were pretty good if my memory serves me.

The clam chowder in a sourdough bowl.   Its good clam chowder; thick without being too thick.  The best part is the bread bowl though.  They butter the hell out of the \"lid\" and toast it.  It's amazing.  The bread is flakey on the outside and soft on the inside.

The service is about average but they do seem to get overwhelmed during happy hour times."}
{"text":"Decent food but sometimes there's a long wait! She's not a huge restaurant but she's big enough. They have an area in the back that you can have a large party.

When I was a wedding planner, one of my brides wanted to have their rehearsal dinner here and they fit roughly 25+ people in the back room. It was pretty tight and rather than being sectioned off, it was one long table. It wasn't very comfy but it was good enough for what was needed. Buffet style menu and then drinks were ordered and paid individually. BJ's is very accommodating with their catering options and if they can't, they'll try to take care of ya the best way they can.

BJ's is great for a night out to have some drinks and a meal (if you like) to catch up with old friends or a gathering place to be with family. It's low lighting may put you to sleep (as it does for me sometimes) but it assists when you're trying to have a little more intimate/private mean/drink as it makes it harder to see those around you lol."}
{"text":"Good place to eat, lots of selections.  I had one of the salads on the lunch menu and it was fresh and adequate."}
{"text":"Great pizza!   I ate here tonight and thoroughly loved their signature deep dish pizza - absolutely fantastic.  

BJ's has a great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"How low this restaurant/franchise has fallen. I used to greatly enjoy coming to BJ's when i lived in California. Haven't gone to one since moving, visited this location in Arizona to see that certain items like the portabella mushroom pizza is gone, the menu has blown up 1000% in size, and the food has gone to total crap. You couldn't drink enough of their overpriced alcohol to make any of it taste good. The crust on their deep dish pizza used to have a golden crispy accent to it. Now its bleach white, like it never even saw an oven. Absolutely no flavor. Pzookie was tough, no longer that freshly baked soft texture and it had a hint of fishy flavor to it like it was cooked in the same vicinity as seafood. What an absolute mess. Will definitely never revisit this franchise!"}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday and Alberto was our server. He was very welcoming and patient with answering questions about the menu. Very kind."}
{"text":"Paula P. Our server was friendly, quick and efficient. Best service all the way around that we have had in a long time. Our dinner was delicious! We have ate at BJ's several times. The food is always good. Today my husband and I both agree that our service was exceptional and of course our meal was great as always."}
{"text":"We frequent Bj's a lot. I could see why people have said everything good and bad about the place. Sometimes there service is dead on, sometimes your on your own. Some menu items are fabulous, they have the best chicken wings in the valley in my opinion. Also there cheeseburger pizza is great without some items for me (pickles onions) The salads are always fresh, the chili size is good, the pot roast is some of the best I have ever had! On the contrary, The club sandwich is soggy and gross, and the meat taste really cheap and store bought. The wedge is kinda plain, and other items could be better.The beer is good with lots of different choices. But it is super cold in there sometimes even when it's 65 outside it's 60 on the inside, so bring a sweater for your bj expierience.  (by the way this is way cheaper than yardhouse, with food nearly on the same level)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. Their pizza is excellent and their blackened salmon is amazing. I have been several times and wait times are usually very short. Also save room for their pizookie, delicious. They even have a gluten free pizookie that I think tastes better than the other. Overall a very solid place to eat."}
{"text":"What the h*ll?

We had just finished up a conference in the Mesa area and with few dining options available at 11:00 pm, other than Denny's, and that was NOT going to happen, we opted for BJ's Brew House.  As a adamant hater of chain restaurants, I did not have high expectations of this establishment and, well, still don't.  Yes, it's cheap, the food offerings mediocre and boring and the service disinterested, but when the choices are between Denny's and BJ's, I'll opt to fast for the evening next time.  Really, it is a small wonder why those who live in the suburbs are so overweight with so few healthy dining options."}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere for casual dining. Considering I went around lunch time, we were seated right away and our server was excellent, very attentive! I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls that come with a delicious dipping sauce, and the juicy stuffed mushrooms as starters. For lunch I had the BBQ Chicken Salad but I substituted the chicken for blackened salmon  and it was prepared just right! 

Also, if you're totally stuffed but you have a sweet tooth... They make scrumptious mini versions of their pazokies, its just the right portion workout pushing you over the edge. This would be a great place for happy hour with all the different TV's and the fully stocked bar."}
{"text":"Food was great
Service... Yeah not so good
Typically come here at night and the servers are great. 
But today during lunch 
We had this waitress named \"Anna C\"
Things she did wrong 
1. Not attentive (restaurant wasn't busy)
2. Forgetting orders (ordered a salad and she never brought it) 
3. Laziness, which she spent 20 minutes cleaning one small table which just needed whipped down
4. Took forever to return my credit card 
5. I asked for a drink almost 20 minutes later \"sorry we dont have it, bad batch\" 

Things she did well. 
1. Got our drinks right 

If you are to go to this restaurant 
Don't let her serve you, she was pleasant with a passive aggressive attitude. 

Ive been in the food service industry for years, and it seems to me this server didn't care about her job."}
{"text":"Today I went in & ordered. We ordered ham & cheesesanwich deal, hot Nashville chicken, & corn dogs with fries. So all seemed to go well when they brought my child's meal out right away.  Once our meals came everything looked good but they forgot ranch. I asked for the 2nd time to the person that delivered when they asked what else I needed. 15 min went by as I sat with my meal waiting for my ranch. I asked my husband how his meal was& he said it was missing something. Someone came by again & asked if we needed anything besides our refills & I declared the ranch again because I hadn't gotten to take a bite of my chicken yet. Once the server was gone my husband realized there was a sauce that came with his meal.  They finally came Ruth ranch & I wasn't worth mentioning because he had already ate 2/3 his meal wondering what was missing. My chicken was cold by the time I got my ranch that I ordered with the meal. My child was flipping out towards the end & im not sure I tasted much. I like this place but I feel like if you're going to charge the prices that you do...I should have this occur. No one even acknowledged their mistakes & no apology at all. I'm not one to complain so maybe that's my own fault."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat when we stayed in Akron. They wait was short service was great, the beer selection was off the charts. Food was good but I think that was more on the selection then the food itself, we had deep dish pizza. It was ok, nothing exciting."}
{"text":"We go often and the last time it was really bad.  Pizza had no to very little sause and the crust was doughy.  They also changed the crust.  There are better places around.  Staff is nice, but not worth the risk of another bad meal. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The ribeye was cooked to perfection and was mouth watering delicious.  I would place this steak at the top of the food pyramid.

We sat at the bar due to crowding, and enjoyed every moment of our time here.

Great food, great service, great folks.  If I had ten thumbs, I would give it a \"ten thumbs up\"!

Highly recommend the Sante Fe Spring Rolls as an appetizer.  They were simply, \"Oh, my!\".

Can't say enough so I'll shut up, a terrific meal and a good time abounded!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PAZOOKIES. The best is the original chocolate chunk. The small bites and snacks are great for a late night great. All the food is spectacular. My go to treat to celebrate birthdays or just to celebrate the love for chocolate chip cookies with ice cream!"}
{"text":"I've been to about 5 different BJs and this is by far my favorite. The food is the same as at most other BJs, although this one has honey breadsticks that I haven't seen anywhere else. What distinguishes this BJs is the brewer. In addition to the usual BJs brews, this brewer concocts new original brews all the time, found only here, and brewed on premises. One time I had a BJs Belgian style Grand Cru here that rocked my world. The only problem is that it's super crowded and there is usually a wait. Plus it's at the Chandler mall, so it's...mall-ish."}
{"text":"If you're pleased with Chile's, Olive Garden and Applebee's then BJ's is for you. We prefer more unique and intimate restaurants. BJ's falls into the \"nothing wrong but nothing special\" category."}
{"text":"BJs is hit and miss...I've had good food there, and I've had mediocre food there. I've never had a \"great\" meal, but that's not really what you're paying for or should expect. 

Everything is pretty ordinary, salads and appetizers are alright, entrees are alright. Service and environment is good typically, and they have some really good beers and good specialty items. Their draft root beer is amazing, and I would end every meal with a BJs pazookie if doing so meant I wouldn't drop dead from heart failure at 35. I like their burgers pretty well, but they took their classic burger off the menu, which was a bummer. It was really good, so that's too bad. 

It's a good place to watch a game or to grab a bite if you're in Chandler, but it's never going to wow you. I'm sure I'll be back soon enough, because it's a solid, reliable place to get a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4 stars because the beer and food deserve it. The disinterested bartenders and total lack of customer service deserve 2 stars. They appear to be more interested in congregating near the service area then waiting on paying customers.  They lack personality and people skills and are better suited for a service only bar then one with actual patrons who want to grab a drink and have a meal. Not sure we will ever return."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!! Service was great, food was wonderful and I highly recommend the cookies and cream pizooky! I've been to a lot of restaurants and am a stickler about service, friendliness, presentation and overall taste and experience! BJ's got it all! I can't tell you enough that I and everyone I know is inlove with this place! Everything from the style down to the bathrooms are fantastic! A+++ to BJ's and its staff!

To the ppl below me... idk what's rong with you saying all those negative things about BJ's! You must be smoking crack! 

If you haven't eatin there before give it a try! I promise you will NOT be disappointed! 

                         I LOVE YOU BJ'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, and great foods. Great selections of drafts. I was amazed they had Kona Brewery's BIG WAVE. My favorite. Few tv's to kick back and watch some games. Awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for dinner with the hubby - loved the food but the service could have been better.

 I ordered the sampler of beer which was fun. I always love getting the sampler at Yardhouse and was happy to see they had one here as well. As an appetizer I started with the Ahi poke bowl - it was perfectly dressed and the tuna was super fresh. I always order this dish  anywhere it is on the menu and I can say this was the best I have ever had. I had the mini caprese salad next also fantastic - they used a very creamy mozzarella and it was the perfect portion for a midcourse. For my entree I had the buffalo chicken pizza -super thick crust and a nice drizzle of ranch on top. Not only did it look like a work of art but it tasted fantastic too. 

Now my husband was not as happy with the meal as I was.Ffirst the waitress convinced him not to order the beer battered shrimp that he wanted and talked him into a pulled pork sandwich which he didn't really enjoy. The biggest issue however was the timing of the food delivery. Or salads were brought out before the appetizers were even half way finished and the entrees came out not even 3 minutes later. We were sitting there with 6 plates of food on the table. W e enjoy going out once a week for a \"date night\" and like to take our time and enjoy our meal. We definitely felt like we were being rushed.

Overall the great food way outweighed the lack of basic service and I would go back again. Next time I'll request to space out the courses."}
{"text":"Just had fathers day lunch and everything was great. Kids meals came quick to keep them occupied and the server gave my husband a BJs pint glass as a fathers day gift. Great food and a nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"We absolutely love BJ's Brewhouse. From the hostess to the wait staff and the food, everything is fabulous. I love being able to use their app to get my name on the wait list as I leave my house. 
Will recommend to others and definitely will be going back often."}
{"text":"Big, chain restaurant with a huge TV in the bar. Happy hour prices are good and the bartender was nice while we waited for a table. We were there for a birthday party and the server did a good job handling a big party. The food was average for this type of restaurant and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Great menu food soup was cold .. They have us another the strawberry martini is to die for lots of liquor lol"}
{"text":"So happy that they have weekend brunch with $4 bloody Mary's and mimosas. Large and varied drink and food menus with lots of trendy and healthy options. I really enjoyed the roasted brussel sprouts salad. I added blackened salmon to the salad. The salad and salmon were a generous size. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We've been there 2x now and had a good experience both times. Well technically 3 the first time we left because the wait was too long - def call ahead! Large menu can be a little overwhelming. We've tried the deep dish pizza and it was very good! My husband and daughter raved about the siracha Brussels sprout appetizer. We also tried the artichoke spinach dip which was good but not great wouldn't order it again. Two of us tried the prime rib dinner (weekends only) comes with soup or salad and their cookie:pie dessert. Everything was very good, although order towards the rare side the med was really med/well and the medium rare was medium but tastes great. Overall a good experience would definitely recommend it. Large dining room
 And fairly noisy good for families and larger groups - prob not for a date! 
Service was good and so was the food!
My only complaint was a glass of wine was really $$ - maybe stick with beer instead!"}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner and ordered the Pot Roast Sandwich. The vegetables came and were not cooked. They were raw, I ate the meat which was great. I told the waitress and she commented that that is pretty normal actually and offered to give me another side vegetable. I am glad that she did that but at the same time was a bit subdued by the fact that this was a regular thing for them. My husband enjoyed his chili burger loads. The drinks we ordered were very strong as well. This place is always busy but perhaps we ordered the wrong food for this place!"}
{"text":"We arrived early in the evening at about 5pm and were seated before the dinner rush. Parking is a bit nutz - not enough spaces! 
Servers are new and eager but some kinks need to be worked out. Great positive attitudes though so, no doubt improvements will happen over time. 

Beers and hard cider were great and large amount of selections on menu. 
Calamari came with two dipping sauces that were tasty separately and together 
Crusted chicken dinner was wonderful but side dish veggie of broccoli was skimpy on amount. 

Tortilla soup is amazing - definitely get some just make sure you get a spoon with it lol. 
They make a great presentation of pouring the soup into your bowl which contains tortilla strips and a few other things but forgot my spoon - not a big deal but it took three requests just to get a spoon and it was darn worth it with that soup! 
Jambalaya is awesome and pretty spicy. 

Will try this place again. Especially because my fiancé loved the craft beers. 

Oh, I really liked the decorations of framed pics with a vintage vibe. Nice place! Happy vibe."}
{"text":"It took me 5 in a half hours to drive to Vegas from California and this is the first place I stopped to get a bite to eat.  The waitress was great and the service she gave was attentive.  The food on the other hand was average and there was way too much cheese in my pasta for my fork to pick up an average size bite.  I enjoyed myself with the friends I was with, but if you go here, tell them easy on the cheese in the pasta."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here after a recent interview I had in the area. There was a bit of a wait so we grabbed a beer at the bar and I was happy to see that they had a large selection. Lots of craft choices were available. Once sat, our waitress was very attentive and answered a few questions for us. We placed our orders and got another beer each. Everything went quickly and the service was great. We put in for an appetizer which came out very fast. The Avocado Egg Rolls were very tasty and a great starter. I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger with fries. The burger was decent but I had to ask for extra sauce. There wasn't enough to even taste initially. The fries however were of the shoestring variety which I like but the were cooked to a crisp and were stiff and crunchy. Way overdone. I asked for a side of Chipotle Mayo to dip them in which helped a bit but over all they were just bad.  There is a lot of potential for what I ordered but it just missed the mark a little bit on this visit. I do like the atmosphere and beer selection. I will make a return trip and try something different on my next trip."}
{"text":"Last two times we came here the food wasn't great and both times I had hair in my food. :(   Don't get the deep dish pizza - no sauce of cheese. The regular pizza us pretty good."}
{"text":"Came to this Bjs twice today. In fact, I come here every time I'm in town, which is several times a year. Everything about our dinner experience tonight sucked. I could go on and on, but in a nutshell we paid for drinks we didn't drink and food we didn't eat cuz it was so bad. Service was questionable. Management was abrasive. Food came out wrong. Cocktails were so poorly made we couldn't drink them, even though we were there to celebrate a birthday. Our server was not a redeeming quality, by any means, for the lack of quality tonight. Wouldn't be back if tonight was a deciding factor, which I suppose it could be at some point. HOWEVER, lunch today was amazing!! One of the best dining experiences I've had at a Bjs in a very long time! 
It was busy from the start. They started getting busy when the doors opened, my son and I were part of that early lunch herd. Our server was absolutely fantastic! The food was great! Management was present and extremely pleasant. Turns out, the sever Krystle that made us feel so welcomed and appreciated was actually the bartender. She was picking up tables to help the team out because the servers on the floor got so busy so fast. Being a server and a bartender myself, and being in the hospitality industry for 25 years, I know how difficult busy lunch shifts can be. Kuddos to Krystle and the entire day crew today for really knocking it out of the park! Such a great experience! Thank you! 
Would give 10 stars if I could based on my first trip today!!! Thank you Krystle!!!!. Would give 2 stars on my dinner trip, which literally left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. 
If you're staying at red rock, walk over for lunch! So great!! With Vegas being a dining mecca, you may want to consider going elsewhere for decent dinner & drinks"}
{"text":"Loved it!  This was my first time to this location and they did not let me down.  If you ever go here - GET THE avocado egg rolls!!  WOW amazing, and they give you this sauce that is like candy.  My niece went with me and she does not like to try anything so I got to eat all them suckers by myself!!!  haha..

I had the sliders and wedge fries and there was so much food I had lunch to bring home to my wife too.  Great service and friendly cool environment!  I will be back to try other stuff - their pasta looked delish so I wanna try that!!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Can't say enough about the sampler plate & pulled pork sliders.  YUM!  Very fun place, lots of TVs and of course SPORTS always on!  Love going here."}
{"text":"Great food awesome beer. Definitely recommend this place. Huge menu. Lots of light food. Everything taste so good and fresh.  Big thank you to bartender Megan, she bring amazing professional service."}
{"text":"This place was recently opened in Akron and I decided to give it a try.  BJ's offers about 12 homemade beers in a variety of styles and flavors from hefeweizens to IPA and even a holiday cider. The menu aims to be a cut above standard bar food (think siracha infused brussel sprouts) but  wound up being just okay. I had the parmesan encrusted chicken prepared with heart stopping quantity of butter. The chicken was a little underdone; unfortunately I didn't discover this until well into my dish. The server and manager were gracious enough to remove my dish from the bill. Excellent service all around and decent beers. I'd probably dine elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"First off the two stars are for the food otherwise i would give one star. 
Just had lunch here with my best friend and I definitely regret it. It was lunch hour and I understand it gets busy. Out server was Jose R and he seemed very nice at first. He took our drink orders and gave us time to look at the menus. When my friend ordered, he implied there's no lunch special for pasta on the menu. 
If there isn't then why is it on the menu saying there is? He must of been offended by our question because he only came by once after that. It took 25 minutes to get our food and we were limited on time so it made the experience worst. for TWENTY minutes we had yet to see a waiter pass by. Not one came and refilled our drinks. We had to get the attention of another waiter to tell our waiter to pay attention to us. Our lunch was ruined by bad customer service. Definitely not coming back to this BJ brewhouse again."}
{"text":"Had the small pizza and salad.  Pizza was very good.  Mozzarella,tomato with Balsamic dressing salad was awesome.  But the best part was the service. Wait staff could not have been friendlier and I could not ask for better service.  This was my first time but definitely not my last."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but it has just ran completely downhill, and I will not return. Yesterday (Saturday) I went to lunch around 4 o'clock and was so disappointed. First, upon walking in we were greeted warmly, which was nice. Then, when I requested a booth the hostess seemed put out, but we were seated at a booth regardless. We waited 7 minutes to be greeted by a server. Once we were finally greeted, we were informed we didn't get greeted because the hostess put us in a section that didn't have a server and failed to inform someone to pick our table up. Ok, I guess. At least it wasn't the servers fault. When we finally order, I ordered their enlightened turkey burger, and asked for our sever (I believe his name was Steve or Steven) to ring it in just as a turkey burger with lettuce, onion, and avocado. My guest ordered the California club. When our food finally arrived, we both take a bite out of it, as we were starving. To our dismay, both of our orders are wrong. My turkey burger is not a turkey burger at all, but a veggie burger. (Granted, this veggie burger was tasty. I definitely recommend for vegetarians.) My guest takes a bite out of her sandwich, which doesn't have the bacon or tomatoes on it it is supposed to have (and that is pictured.) I send my not-turkey burger back and her sandwich. The server apologizes, and we wait. My burger finally arrives, and it is still wrong. The toppings that are supposed to be on the burger, are not. My server goes and gets the toppings that are supposed to be on it and returns a few minutes later. Situation rectified. My guests sandwich finally arrives, with the bacon and tomato, but they didn't replace the sandwich? They bring back the same sandwich with her bite still taken out of it? I'm not sure how sanitary that is that the cooks are touching foods that have been partially eaten and sending it back out! 

Although all three mistakes were remedied, I'm severely disappointed a manager did not stop by the table to at least apologize or table tough at all. Our server was not bad, as I'm sure these were errors in the kitchen. Ultimately though, I'm disappointed and will not be returning to BJs due to the consistent errors."}
{"text":"Love this place! Menu is huge and can make everyone in your group happy. Gluten free menu is awesome! Sports always on the TVs. 

Great wine, beer, and craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Yes please! The ambiance, service and food are all up to par. Deep dish pizza was great, fried artichoke and the mahi mahi were all delish. Service is very personal and managers walk around and ensure quality. Not to mention the extensive beer menu."}
{"text":"So it's been a long time since my wife and I were blown away with a restaurant. 

First, there was a 20 minute wait for a 2-top in an almost empty place. Our hostess said there were \"a few... problems with staffing.\" Her pause, not mine. Our waitress Madeline looked frazzled but she took good care of us and the rest of the section as it filled up around us. 

The food was great. The service was great. And we couldn't have asked for a better time. If the management reads these posts, I urge you not to whip the horses that work..."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing, waitstaff was expected and food was subpar. The appetizer needed to be sent back to reheat it and the Brussel sprouts were burnt."}
{"text":"Never had a horrible experience while dining in and their food is amazing. One of my favorite places to go get burgers and pasta. But whenever I order takeout online (which I do A LOT more often than dining in), EVERY single time they always forget one or more items! I'm not even being dramatic. It's literally every single time. Whether it's utensils, ingredients, sauces, sides, etc. For example, I ordered three burgers tonight. One of the burgers didn't come with onions when we added it online, only one burger came with a side of ranch when I specifically added three, they didn't add as much bleu cheese on the second burger than they normally do, and only gave us forks when I asked for take out utensils. Another time they forgot two sides of our fries. There has been more experiences of them not fulfilling my order, but those are just some examples. I order their burgers the most out of the rest of the menu and I kid you not, every time I go in to pick it up, they always ask me what fries I want when I always put it in online. I don't know if there's something wrong with the website or what, but as a busy person, it's annoying to have to wait. They're not even apologetic. I always tip well because I'm a hostess/takeout person myself, but the fact that they've always forgotten a part of my order and have me wait makes me not want to tip them at all. I don't know how they do it at BJ's, but at the restaurant I work at (which is a very big, chain restaurant that is very similar to BJ's), I pack everything (sauces, entrees, desserts, sides, etc.) and check everything twice to make sure I have everything. So either they do it differently at BJ's or the takeout specialist doesn't know how read and check the order. This really makes me not want to order takeout from BJ's anymore."}
{"text":"I have been to this BJ's a few times, and unfortunately, my experience has gotten worse each visit.  This last time was actually for my birthday.  We waited 20 minutes after being seated for our order to be taken, waited another 30 minutes with our food (had to request fruit and crackers for the little kids because they needed to eat SOMETHING while waiting for their meals), and when the food came, our salads came WITH our meal (with the exception of the 2 salads that were completely omitted), and a steak and a burger were prepared incorrectly.

The manager was nice in trying to rectify the situation by removing things from our bill and comping dessert, but the experience overall was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was just today. They were really busy when we came in on a Sunday night. The last time I came here the portions were HUGE! Now it was a lot smaller. We ordered an asparagus and spinach dip, clam chowder, California Burger, and a bunch of other stuff those are just ones I really remembered. 

The server looked nervous and rushed when he greeted us. We asked for a refill three times on our drinks and never got it. 

Our appetizers, asparagus and spinach dip, came after 10 minutes after our main dishes. It tasted bland. And my brother who eats anything even said it wasn't good. There was no taste. My moms clam chowder was way too salty. My burger was not a burger but rather a sandwich. The vegetables along with the avocados was slipping out."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from this BJs. Delivery was promised at 12:15. At 12:30 I called to check on the order and the manager Ron answered and started making excuses that there was confusion with the order and that it was still at the restaurant. He never apologized and there was zero service recovery on his part.

As a Summerlin resident who frequents this location, they have lost a loyal customer when all it would have taken would have been for the manager to give a sincere apology and ask how he could make things right. If you can't offer an effective delivery program you should discontinue it."}
{"text":"So I had lunch with a friend at 1145.  I had 1/2 sandwich and salad. I had the chicken club. It had an oddly sweet sour taste and I quit after 1 bite.  I ate the frys and the wedge salad so I was good.  Didn't send it back or complain cause I am not really a complainer.  A few hours later I was sick, throwing up no fever.  I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing it was the bad chicken.  Not going there again."}
{"text":"I actually wish Yelp offered a half-star rating, because this place should really get 3 and a half in my book. I came here last night for dinner and left pretty pleased actually. I had a couple of hefeweizens which were quite good but I really prefer mine with a lemon. I had the grilled turkey cobb which was very good and finished it off with a white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie. The pazookie was good, though not as thick as I anticipated. I really enjoyed the vanilla bean ice cream topper though - very nice touch.
Service was good and fast. They also have a take out entrance. I'll eat here again, though it was a little pricey for me. I do think the beer was a little overpriced, but it wasn't happy hour either."}
{"text":"This place is always great to eat at!! Service is good. Only reason they get a 4 star is the wait is always a little long.  If you can wait this place is worth it.  I always come and get the pizza and make sure to leave off with the cookie"}
{"text":"The food quality here is always consistent and great, the beers are great and the atmosphere is typical BJs. The main problem lies in staffing. The management or corporate must really be trying to cut costs nowadays. We were here on a Saturday afternoon as a 3 top and our server was exceptionally friendly however she was deep in the weeds. Not her fault. She had two three tops, a four top, a eight top and a seven top. That's just piss poor management. Don't spread your staff so thin. My three top had intentions of putting in some work on beers but only got 2 after flagging her down. The other big parties waited for at least 10 minutes just to get drinks. The worst part was seeing the manager bringing 1 lemonade to a table and discussing the vast intricacies if each pizzookie with another party. Sheesh dude just staff more servers. They'll get a better turn over, more drinks on the tab and you'll bring in a higher profit. Like I said this was an afternoon around 2pm'ish. I can't image what it would be like for dinner. 3 servers and 25 expediters with nothing to do?"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Don't place all your order at once or you will get your salad first and then your appetizers and entrees at the same time. The servers have no way of timing your food for you. Other than that everything was delicious."}
{"text":"So if you can past the semi obscene name of this place, you are in for a great selection of food and beer. They also have a loyalty program worth joining. To be clear this is not fine dinning but it is often better than the other chains in this space. So if you want to get out of the casinos and go to a casual dinning restaurant and pretend like you live in a normal town, this is a good choice. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant,but a very good chain restaurant. I often have to explain when I give this restaurant 4 stars, I am comparing it to other joints in their space, not to a fine dining or even a fast food place. Ok so now that we got that out of the way (until the next time I have to explain :)). Great burgers, great pizza, very great beer! Not so great french fries, yes I have had both kinds. They have the think cut, more like potato wedges, and thin, more like match sticks. Other than that everything is great and so is the service. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, great prices, friendly staff. Not to loud but still lively. Can't wait to go back. Nice place to watch sports. Their stout is creamy. Next time I'll get it as a desert beer. Steak is good but could be better. Good for the price."}
{"text":"Everyone loves BJs.  Well, men particularly.

That's right--I went there.


Thanks!  I'll be here all week.  So, the restaurant--solid three stars.  Good pub grub, good beer, great happy hour, friendly service.  Nothing out of this world but a reliable place for a night out."}
{"text":"Been coming to this BJs for about 7 years, so I can't believe it took me until now to write a review! BJ's quality is always there when it comes to the brews and deep dish pizzas. My fav item on the menu used to be the calzone until they took it off--bring it back guys! They also have some bomb salads if you're not in the mood to go carb-heavy. But of course, the star of the show is the famous Pizookie! I've had all different kinds but the original chocolate chip is still the best. If you haven't been to BJ's yet, you need to do yourself a favor and head over! Your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"There are very few restaurants open late, and thankfully BJ's is one of them, giving them a bonus star. I've been to this location a few times and it's consistently good. Good service, good food, good drinks. Nothing special stands out, but we've never had any issues either (other than that one time a couple people in our group got into a yelling match across the bar area and were asked to leave...but that's a story for another day and had nothing to do with BJ's itself). Nachos with Blackened Chicken & a Berry Burst Cider = win."}
{"text":"Lunch date with my love turned into regretting the choice of where we went. Service was meh and the food was not very good. The place could use a lot of work. It's a huge disappointment when the experience is horrible from the every angle."}
{"text":"Trendy brewhouse!!  Great staff!  Delicious menu.  Lots of seating.  A feel good atmosphere all around. Great place to watch sports and to try the extensive list of beers.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We were at a fund raiser and they were handing out this amazing chicken salad with all kinds of fresh and delicious ingredients.  We asked where the salad was from and we were told BJ's.  So, after the fundraiser, we head over to BJ's.  We were told that there was a 15 minute wait so we sat out on a bench right outside of the restaurant.  The dancing water show is really cool to watch and helps quickly pass the time.  After a few minutes of waiting, a waiter came out and offered us a sample slice of pizza.  Wow!  That was the best, melt-in-your-mouth pizza my taste buds have ever been introduced to!  Now, I had a serious dilemma!  I was there for their yummy salad but the pizza was so awesome that I wanted the pizza too.  But, I didn't want to leave 20 lbs heavier.  When we sat down, my wife and I ordered a beer...the root kind.  Amazing!  If you like root beer, this place has a very smooth and great tasting \"homemade\" root beer.  I ordered the Chicken Barbecue Salad (I think that what it's called) and sure enough, it was just as good as it was at the fundraiser.  The atmosphere was great too!  My wife and I were hypnotized by the brightly lite bottles on display at the bar.  When we were finished with the meal, we were really bummed that we were full.  We wanted to get Pazookie!  So, our waiter went the extra mile and made it portable.  Yes, Pazookie to go was awesomely delicious even if you eat it for dessert at home.  

If you're in the Chandler area and you need some excellent food.  Try out BJ's!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, the beer was excellent, did not eat but overlooked the menu and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! Went to this location for the forst time and it was a great experience. Happy hours lots of options and great value. Wings, pizza, spinach and artichoke dip. They also have pear cider which is hard to find and it was all great food. Five stars because the food was great, happy hour and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Started with a wedge just to pick something simple. Theirs is really good because their blue cheese is savory blue. Their root beer is smoothe too.
I believe that I may  need to re-visit the place soon so that I can really say more about this that does not just sound stereotypical. What I recall is that I loved the food and that there were some service faux pas.  So, I want to give it another go.  Yelp lovers...bear with me.  I usually do not wait so long to follow up on my reviews that I start.  But I can confirm a really good wedge."}
{"text":"I can sum up my experience at BJs in one word...Fail! 

First off, we called ahead on a Saturday night after a Coyotes game, and were told 30 mins. We show up with 5 mins to spare and were told we would be seated in 5 mins...right on time. Only 5 mins in BJs time is 25 mins! At the 15 min mark I asked how much longer it would be, but was told they simply \"don't really know\". While waiting for our table we were repeatedly told by the staff how tired they were. 

Once seated I was firmly told by the waitress that they do NOT have Dr. Pepper, Pibb, or anything similar! They were awful proud of their root beer! :(. I hate root beer. 

My wife and I decided to split a large bacon cheese burger pizza at the reasonably low price of $24!!! Although the pizza was good, by no means was it worth that much. Way too greasy, and although we asked for no tomatoes, they seemed to put double the norm. It would have been sent back, but again BJs time is about double normal time. 

I wanted to like this place, but the experience was just too poor to even give them a second chance. Take a pass if your in the Park West / Westgate area!"}
{"text":"We went opening night and haven't been back. It was busy so clearly things were going to go slow but we waited over an hour for our appetizer after ordering. And then it came out cold. The food was ok but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza and it was essentially a pizza hut pan pizza. And I don't like pizza hut. I forget what my wife got so if that helps at all... 

We did thoroughly enjoy dessert. We got the beignet with strawberries. Very, very good."}
{"text":"THE RAITING IS FOR FOOD... NOT FOR PLACE...

This is one of our  GoTo place for awesome family dinner... We visit this place often and always have positive experience.  Place is always busy so reserve a table ahead of time else you would be waiting for 30 to 40 mins.  Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is awesome but my humble suggestion is....if you are hungry, don't be adventurous and order new things...stick to what you know...list you know you will finish it and fill up the belly! We (daughter, wife and i) ordered completely different food then we usually get and all we could finish was frys ordered by my daughter... It was not their fault at all... it was our fault... but what we ordered was tasteless... food has no Salut or any kind of seasoning... It was Madeterion Taco...and what ever was on side....Yaak!  Would NOT recommend that to anyone..."}
{"text":"So I don't really frequent Desert Ridge or malls in general.  Desert Ridge is particularly crowded and annoying, but I was meeting a friend in the area so I found myself there.   This is one of those places with a 10 page menu. Annoying to say the least.  After I read through their dissertation.. I mean menu.... I opted for the Thai Mango Chicken Salad.  I was pleasantly surprised and loved it.  Massive salad that I almost couldn't finish.  I mean it had an avocado, chicken, mangos .. what's not to love?  A waiter went past us with a pizza that looked divine. 

This is a family friendly, sports watching, casual place to eat. Would I go there for dinner? No. Would I purposely seek this place out?  No. But did I have a good lunch? yes."}
{"text":"I love this location! Been going here for years and I know the menu by heart! My favorite dishes are the cherry glazed salmon, Parmesan crusted chicken, root beer rubs, clam chowder in bread bowl and pizzoookie!! The shire chocolate and monkey bread are the best!! Best place to go if you're in the mood for anything or with a big group. Also really great service every time I go :)"}
{"text":"Best food and service!!!! I sat at the bar and at a Deep Dish Favorite (mini) and got another once to go to eat the next day for lunch. The trio Pizzokie was super yummy as well. Because I started with the mozzarella and tomato salad (ate it all), then ate favorite mini pizza and ended with trio Pizzokie, I was more than full. I washed it all down with a Blonde. Incredible food, prompt and courteous service, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I've never be disappointed in anything I've had here.  I had the Prime Rib French dip...very good!  It had the perfect amount of meat, melted Swiss cheese, great Au jus...French fries w/n ice tea...perfect!
Hubby had the fried chicken w/mashed potatoes, lots n lots of flavor.  Of course, he enjoyed the test tasting of different beers.  
We've never been disappointed, whenever we come here.  They're pretty consistent so, we know we'll enjoy our meals, always.
Our waiter, Scotty, was great!  He was funny, pretty knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  He suggested the beer and food, he was right...fabulous!"}
{"text":"Waitress is great... The dry rub siracha wings are my favorite here besides the pazookies"}
{"text":"It is Hit or Miss with this Place,Either you will get a great waitress and horrible cooks to mess up your food or you will get an annoying waitress that ignores you and the food will come out decent.

Rib night is a deal,the spicy Brussel sprouts are the best.
Pizza night is worth it if the cooks actual cook it right and don't take 40 mins to cook sauce less burnt cheesy bread. The chicken sandwiches and burgers are pretty good."}
{"text":"I waited forever for my app and when I did get it, it was cold (spinach & artichoke dip) and then my entree took another 15-18 minutes and I got a soup and salad combo"}
{"text":"I have been to the particular location many times.  Except for the wait, we have always had a good experience. I just love that deep dish pizza. I am sure it is on slice away from stopping my heart, but not here for the health food."}
{"text":"Since joining Lifetime Athletics, my cravings for carbs have intensified immensely. Growing up in a Vietnamese house hold, you'd think the first thing I go for is white rice or noodles. But you're wrong! My craving is for the Chicken Parm with Spicy Marinara served with garlic toast. It's really the spicy punch of of the sauce and the crispy flattened chicken that scratches my itchin'.  If you can make it out of the restaurant without ordering the Pizookie, you can call it a healthy success with dining out."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere-good pizza, good size small appetizers, good tomato and mozzarella salad and Excellent pie-zookie (warm cookie with ice cream on top)."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 having a 6:30 pm dinner (Wednesday).  Tomato bisque soup was very good with subtle flavor.  Our meals: bacon brisket burger, pizza, blacken salmon and triple deck sandwich were all good and tasty, but nothing really special to rave about.  The bbq sauce on the burger was very good. The pictures at the top are just what our meals looked like when served so I think they represent very closely the look of all the meals served.  
Tho the restaurant was not crowded, as others have noted, finding a parking spot within 3 aisles of either side of BJ's is near impossible with the mall entrances so close.  We finally found a spot near the shopping center entrance on brkpk rd.  
Our server must be new as she couldn't answer some of our questions on drink prices or menu items. Food was presented in a reasonable time after we placed our order.  The menu is a tome about the size of war and peace...and took us a bit to look it over. Meanwhile our server kept coming back every couple of minutes asking if we were ready to order.  I guess she thought we'd been here before and would know what they offered.
So in my opinion, this is just another chain restaurant in the area to choose from.  Nothing special other than the beer selection to set it apart from other restaurants in the mall area."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe only their pizza is good. Had their bruschetta small bites and gourmet Mac and cheese. Bruschetta bread was way too thick and nothing great. Mac and cheese - although \"gourmet\", I thought my nieces' Kraft Mac and cheese with their kids meal was better. My other friend agreed too. Ironic how the one thing that we adults liked the best was from the kids menu AND something we can make at home from the box itself!  Guess what I went to buy at the grocery store later that day?"}
{"text":"Their 2 for $25 deal is amazing! It happens a few times a year. Ask for Amber, she is real cool. 

I love their BJ's Favorite Pizza with jalapeños instead of olives. I also love their Cesar salad. Their Hickory burger is delicious! Their Jeramiah Red beer is to die for! That's what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"I think this is place is SO SO DARK. well the food is ok. Though it is little pricy compare to the quality. I would go back to try different menu. Maybe i will find something i love. =)"}
{"text":"My family and friends love to gather at BJ's - convenient location and, usually, good food and service.  However, the last three times we have gone, the service has dropped dramatically.  Last night, 10/15/15, might have been the final straw for us at this location.  The wait wasn't bad, thanks to the app wait list button, however,  that was the only plus. Our server was inattentive and rude.  If we had any complaints, she was prompt to pass the buck to her coworkers - Service is slow? oh that's because she's busy doing the work of others and there are huge parties.  I understand, there were a few huge parties there last night, so everyone was slammed.  Maybe warn us before we sit down that things might run a little slow or the kitchen could possibly be backed up - we would have come back another time.  Food wasn't up to par (and it wasn't, two kid pizza that just had a sprinkling of cheese, no tomatoes/sauce, two very rare bison burgers that were requested as medium, one very well done steak that was requested medium rare, and two dried out mahi mahi tacos drenched in sauce to cover it up).  We pointed all of this out to her and the fact that it took over 45 min to get the food-- her response, \"oh, well, if I was the cook, this wouldn't happen\", and then she walked away.  No asking if we would like to have it taken back, or offer to get a manager, nothing.  Luckily we were smart and all ordered our kids' food as soon as we sat. It still took almost 20 min to get their food though, and then it was still another 20 minutes for our food.  After that, our server messed up our bill 2 times (this time she blamed it on the computer); at this point, we were just done (it had been 2 hours at this point with three little kids at 745pm), so we just paid the bill and then had to fix it among ourselves.  She didn't even remember to apply the bill to our rewards after reassuring us she had done so. 

The times leading up to this, the waits have been longer and longer once we've been seated, the food has been incorrect or served cold, and the staff seems disinterested.  We've even had a few occasions where we've needed to speak with the manager on duty and that hasn't gone well.  I'm very disappointed that this location just isn't up to par anymore as the pizookie makes the world go round for my kids and they'll actually eat their dinner just to have one.  Hopefully the other locations are decent so I can continue dine with BJs."}
{"text":"There was a staple in my husbands salad! After we ordered it he was chewing and noticed it. I am so thankful that our children didn't get it. I notified the manager and he proceeded to give us a free meal. I was incredibly thankful however... CLEAN UP YOUR DAMN KITCHEN"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! From the breaded asparagus, the fried brussels sprouts, the sandwich with pulled pork on top of a bbq bacon cheeseburger, the salted caramel pizookie, everything was out of this world!! I cannot wait to go back!! My mouth is watering just thinking about all that amazing food!!

My boyfriend and I ordered all that to share and a flavored sparkling water, and our bill was about $35. We left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Also highly recommend their burgers and their strawberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"If this place could get 0 stars it sure would. I have been to a few bjs that have been incredible both food and service.  
Today was some of he worst service I have had in a very long time. I went there today with a girlfriend and my 2 daughters. We wanted to honor our girls day tradition of getting to have dessert before our meal. 
We sat down in a not to busy restaurant only to wait 15 mins to even have our server show up to great us. That is where she left one small drink napkin. We ordered our drinks and our dessert. She returned with drinks and quickly left to tend to the table of four business men behind us. Our dessert came and we only hand the spoons given to us to eat with and a single tinny napkin to clean two small children with. Then my friend decided that she wanted a berry hibiscus tea which I guess just came out today. The tea was totally forgotten then when we asked about it there was major attitude like she never ordered it, but it was the server who forgot about it The sunset peach and the berry tea were so bland with little to no flavor. We got our appetizer and still had no napkins or silverware. By the time we finally got them our avocado egg rolls were very cold. Food came and was missing things or had things we requested not to. The Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were ordered with on onion and came with them. My salad the BBQ chicken chopped salad came with no dressing at all. We finally got the manager and asked for her to help correct the wrongs. We told her that we were sorry to bother her but our server did not seam to be able to attend to us. The manager said sorry and that was it. By then I was just ready to leave. The server came with the check. She had to swipe the card at the table and leave to retrieve our paper to sign. She was gone like 5 mins. The manager stopped once more and asked how it was we responded with ok I guess. And she left again. We left and stopped the manager once more on our way out. We told her that the food was ok and the service was the worst since our server wanted to ignore us and pay attention to the businessmen. She said well come back and see me again ask for me then as an after thought gave me her name. I can tell you that im not rushing back. I fell like I could have lit my money on fire and gotten more pleasure from that then spending it here."}
{"text":"I come here frequently and usually do the curbside which is solid but tonight I came with the family and dined in. Anthony is AMAZING!! Didn't skip a beat and even brought us sides of ranch and caramel with our dessert! My chicken Caesar salad was awesome as well as chicken pitas!! Great service made this dinner tonight though!!! He is five star!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the value and quality of the food you receive !  I wouldn't go back here. There are far better places at this price level."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and only a couple times for a reason.

Last time I was here I had the parmesan crusted chicken. The crust was too hard and the chicken was dry and hard to cut through. The mashed potatoes had that cardboard box taste and they were cheap with the broccoli.

The other times I've been here the food wasn't impressive either. Baked mac and cheese was bland as was the salad. 

Getting the order right is also another challenge for this place. My brother had ordered salmon teriyaki, and they came out with shrimp teriyaki instead.

Service was lacking. The waiter I had barely ever came to our table.

When my mother came to meet up for dinner once i had finished taking a bite of my dry chicken, she asked me what specialties they had.. i believe i told her \"nothing.\"

So for someone like me who isn't really a picky eater, this says something about the place. I will take my money and enjoy it somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable! 
The salad I ordered was overdressed even after I asked for it to be lightly dressed. The waitress immediately offered to have it remade. It wasn't very long, but my husband had already finished his entrée by the time it returned. The manager, without requesting him, arrived at our table and apologized for the salad (which was fine the second time around) and the fact that we didn't share our meals together. He offered us dessert on the house! That's how customer service should be!
And the food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Average service, no one was really hustling to get people serviced. The food was really good. The deep dish is a can't miss item. We also had the classic wings. Try them dry, with the sauce on the side. You stay cleaner dipping in the sauce."}
{"text":"Definitely hit or miss. I love their deep dish pizza and pizookie however any time I order an entree with fries they're always cold. I like to go in groups and they're very accommodating to that so I love it. I had a server and I wish I knew his name, absolutely amazing however he gave me like 5 names so I couldn't do a shout out for his amazing service."}
{"text":"This will likely be our last visit. While we've been generally pleased to this point with both the food and the service (which can often be hit or miss), I simply cannot understand the constant and unnecessary meddling with items on the menu that have long been staples. You removed the Italian chop salad for an Asian one? Why? 

The only redeeming thing about BJ's is their craft brewed beers and they're not all too special. So very, very disapponting, guys... but I guess it's to be expected when you're a corporate chain that has little interest in what's good in YOUR location versus what's good in an entirely different state."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food and really good beers....  Place was packed on a Friday night but staff was positive and friendly....  Food/drinks came quickly....  Rootbeer glazed ribs appetizer was very very good!!!!"}
{"text":"I dined at bjs tonight, I ordered the chicken bacon club sandwich with fries. When the dish came out the fries were cold so naturally I sent it back asking for fresh fries. The second time around the fries were still cold and after eating my sandwich I found a hair hiding from where my sandwich was, I will not come back."}
{"text":"Totally delivers on what it advertises....good locally brewed beer and pretty good food.  Service, cleanliness and decor is great....we feel very comfortable there...a step above TGIFs and similar places.  Been several times and will continue to patronize.  Recommend the Piranha Ale."}
{"text":"had a chance to go and try the pazooki that iver been hearing about and it was crazy good"}
{"text":"Our waiter: I wish I knew his name. I could barely hear him when he spoke. He was whispering/mumbling and we had to ask him multiple times to repeat himself. 

We all ordered burgers, which a couple of us sent back. I have never seen a hamburger patty like these. First off, they weren't even circular, so they were falling out of the buns and all over the place. They weren't thick at all, but smashed down and falling apart and so thin in some places. They sent us new burgers after we told them, and the second round came out exactly the same. They hadn't even listened!

We left a little disgruntled. Don't get the burger."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Thursday and it's busy as hell. Not my first choice for lunch given the number of options around here. We came as a large group (20) for lunch. Given the number of us, service was decent, albeit food came slow.

Food is mediocre. My tomato soups seemed more like spaghetti sauce. My pizza was okay and I enjoyed it again for dinner. The one thing I've found with BJs to be both its advantage and downfall is its large variety of a menu. Two things I can always count on are the beer and their pizookies. Also, their raspberry lemonade was pretty good too.

My only other issue is the YELP check in coupon. The servers don't seem to know the details of this BOGO lunch. I was told I needed to sign up with their rewards program or something to get it. The fine print doesn't say anything of that sort on the coupon. Unfortunately I came into the restaurant ready to split costs with a coworker but they didn't honor it."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. 
On this visit we were there on a Friday night, bar area was full (bar itself was not) and they maybe had 2 servers covering it. Our server did a great job, just feel like he could have used some help...some delay getting his attention as he was busy. Beer selection gets this from a 3, to a 4 star review. The wifi wasn't working while we were there."}
{"text":"I shared the Ahi tuna salad and Jambalaya! !!!
Nothing short of spectacular like our Cleveland Indians! !!!"}
{"text":"Options for vegetarians are few but good. We ate the California club flatbread pizza as appetizer which was nice and crispy. For entree we ordered the toscana with no meat, fish or eggs. Along with spinach filled mushroom.  Will give a 1 out of 5 for spinach filled mushroom.  2/5 for toscana and 5/5 for pizza. Over all we are happy about the decision to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BJ'S! 

Food: I love the Cajun Pasta, Usually when I go out to eat I'm not very adventurous. I like to stick to what I know but for some odd reason I decided to try something new. Cajun pasta, hmm first off I wasn't to sure how I would like this because I love Cajun spices of on my seafood but I wasn't to sure how I'd like it on my pasta. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. The creamy tomato sauce with the roasted blacken chicken breast YUMMMM. The portions are even great, once me and my boyfriend went and we actually just ordered 1 Cajun pasta and when asked them for an extra plate because we were sharing they offered to just put it together in the kitchen for us & it was perfect for two! 

Desert: If you haven't tried Bj's famous Pizookie your missing out. A cookie that's freshly baked right out of the oven warm topped with Vanilla ice cream is to die for. Even when I'm stuffed from my entree i'll still find room for a Pizookie. Some how! lol

Drinks: I love their wide range of beers on tap, unfortunately they didn't have the blue moon pumpkin beer because it's only a seasonal beer. Tap beer is always better then bottle or canned Just saying...

Service: I  usually go pretty late like 9:30-10ish? & I'm usually 1 out of 5 tables there. So its not busy during those hours but the waitress that we got was super nice. The hostess seated me and my boyfriend at a table that was just way to big for us and it made it difficult for us to kind of talk and dine together so the waitress noticed this and asked if we wanted to change tables. Other than that and when ordering she offered to tell the cooks in the back to split my Cajun pasta into two plates because I was sharing. I've never been to a restaurant where they offered to split it in the back for me. Usually they just hand me my extra plate so I really appreciated the extra effort to help :)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, many choices and great beer selection. Service is terrible though...been here 3 times about 3 months apart each time thinking it'd get better...it didn't...slow, they often forget about your appetizers....just bad service all around. A manger did buy dessert for us and like I said the food is good....solution=get take out!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Prime Rib Dinner with the starter salad and also included a regular size Pizookie, gotta say it's a good sized piece of Prime Rib!

Server Beni is a very well rounded and knowledgeable server, great in all areas and knows how to treat repeat customers! 

Service and food overall was great on the Friday evening that we visited."}
{"text":"BJs is the place to be! 
Two words:: HAPPY HOUR 3-7pm 
Smaller portions but very filling..
Sliders & fries: add cheddar cheese & the option of bacon
Lettuce wraps: two sauces in which the mustard one has wasabi I think: SPICY
Santa Fe Rolls: adorable small sizes but lots of them with fresh salsa *must have
Flat marg pizza: ok, a bit dry & Blah tasting
Spinach Artichoke: please::: order like 2 super delicious & creamy.. Add a lil salt 

Now Drinks .. List of all kinds of martinis, beers, fancy drinks!! Me & my best friend ordered strawberry & a wild berry mojitos! 
Great summer drinks but needed more alcohol 
Can't go wrong with $5, $6, $7 meals & drinks.. Cheap & delicious at the same! Total bill $62.16... I'll take that for all we had..
Ask for Julio S.. He's very nice, informative, & patient :: Us girls talk a lot! He went above & beyond to make sure we had all we wanted/needed.."}
{"text":"We eat here fairly often.

It is consistently good, and I like the variety.

I like the \"house\" beers as well, I am a fan of the Tatonka Stout.

The fish and chips are above average, and the size of the dish is large. My wife and I often split it.

The potato skins are good as well, nice large crispy potato skins with cheese and bacon. They are not soggy and shriveled like at some places (Fridays....)

I order the burger often, and it is above average. The crispy thin fries are excellent.

I have had a few friends eat the steaks here, and they both enjoyed them.

They have a strawberry shortcake like desert that is very, very good as well. 

All and all, a well rounded place to eat. It is also usually relaxed with an acceptable amount of noise, and many TVs if your dinner date is boring."}
{"text":"Walked in got a quick soup and salad before a movie. After about 25 minutes server told us \" food should be out soon. We are down a cook\". 

Really?! It takes a cook to get a house salad and soup? We decided to walk out. 25 minutes just seems like a long time for a soup and salad."}
{"text":"They blew it...

Hit BJs the other night for dinner with my family.  Wife and I ordered steaks, kids ordered as well.  Service was slow, the appetizer was so late they comped it.  Meal arrived and once glance at my wife's steak I knew it was toast.  It was mishapen and overcooked.  Surprised and disappointed that the servers even brought it to our table.  We sent it back, adn they brought another steak that was tiny, but cooked properly.  Wife was disappointed but ate some.  My steak was the right color, but was dry and chewy.  

They comped my wife's meal as well, but it doesn;t make up for the poor experience.  We are done with BJs."}
{"text":"[Visited on Wednesday Feb 8th] I'm not big on chain places but our food was pretty good. I had chicken wontons with thai sauce and spinach stuffed mushrooms. My hubby had an \"under 575 calories\" meal that was very good. Lots of textures and flavors and moist chicken breast to satisfy the gastronome whose counting calories. But I ordered the small bites so that I could save room for one of those famous deliciously decadent pizookies. If you don't know what it is, I'm going to leave you guessing. Get curious and try it out - you won't be disappointed. The place gets a four on dessert alone.

Did I mention that they MAKE delectable sodas - root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda and at least one other? We rarely order non-alcoholic drinks cuz we're stingy when it comes to what we spend our dining money on - but this was well worth it plus we got free refills. We also ordered a happy hour drink, mango mojito, which was like $5. During happy hour, they also have $2 off full-size appetizers and 1/2 price mini-pizzas (which really aren't that small; they're deep dish). It was a good deal. We spent more than we usually do because we ordered drinks and dessert but it was still a good deal.

We'll definitely go back if only to sit in the bar and watch sports on one of the tvs. Also, we didn't have to wait at all for a table like Matt C. apparently had to. It was about 4pm on a Wednesday, so I guess it was a good time to dine. I'm sorry Matt C. didn't enjoy his experience, but we really liked it. I'd say try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this chain, you probably should.  Great beer selection and a huge menu so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Nope, not a fan of this pizza at all. It was not only expensive, but VERY disappointing. I live out of town, so I'm pretty certain that I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"My significant other and I have been eating at BJs for the past 5 years, usually multiple times per week. We are disappointed after tonight's visit and unfortunately will never return. Things have gone downhill for the last year but have been really bad the last several months. We miss the excellent personable waitstaff and management that used to run this restaurant. Other reviewers have recently talked about the food coming out COLD and lacking in quality control. After waiting an hour, the first time our food came out, it was obvious it had been sitting there for awhile. The mushroom appetizer was cold, the lettuce wrap appetizer had cold chicken and the jambalaya was luke warm. We asked for the food to be remade from scratch because mushrooms taste horrible warmed up in a microwave. Then the food came out again 30 minutes later and the food was the same, not hot! The manager on duty argued with us saying he personally witnessed the cook making it and he kept saying it was hot although he refused to touch my mushroom when I asked him to in order to feel how cold it was. He then accused us of \"always\" complaining when we have been there literally over 200 times and he has only been managing for a month or so. And here is where I have an issue, he slipped and said, \"do you want me to warm these up AGAIN\" when he just had said he had the cook remake the dishes from scratch and witnessed it. He was overly condescending and not friendly at all. We miss the manager Gunner who was so personable and had excellent control over the restaurant! He made it feel like a tight knit family atmosphere and made an effort to come talk to us every time we came and knew us by name. And just for the record, we loved this place, the food, and the service for many years and tipped the staff upwards of 40% each time and never had problems with anyone, even the waitstaff knew us by name!"}
{"text":"The Beer is good, most of the food is ok, but I have a big issue with BJ's.  They advertise their pizza as Chicago style deep dish.  When you order one, you'll know right away why there isn't a single location of this chain in Illinois.  The Pizza is more like something I'd expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I've had growing up in Chicago.

Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door.  Other than that, there's way better places to eat in and around Chandler Fashion Center Mall."}
{"text":"Service is always slow at every BJ's I've been to, but this one seemed a little better. Food is always amazing though. Try the eggroll appetizer and crispy jalapeño burger."}
{"text":"The waiter (Carlos) was hovering over my table with a check, pressuring me to leave so he could seat more people. He was very flirty and made me feel a little uncomfortable. You are there to WORK, not use BJ's as a dating service. I will probably not be back. I said something to a female hostess and she acted like it was normal and didnt seem to care. Very disappointed. The food was good, service poor."}
{"text":"Just an absolute awful experience.  I have been to a couple of other BJ's and have never had issues like this, so I will say it could only be this location and after reading the reviews, it sounds like a management problem at this particular location.  Our party of three ordered a soup and a salad.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waitress, our entrees arrive, no soup, no salad.  Not only that, my baked potato came cold.  After asking for the manager to express our frustrations, our salad and soup decided to arrive at the table, maybe it's new for the soup and salad to come after the entrees?  The waitress went back to get a new baked potato, which amazingly came out COLD!  Seriously?  The first one was unacceptable, I don't know what to call a second cold baked potato, maybe asinine?  Needless to say we will never go back to that BJ's location ever again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the wait to be seated took forever. Friendly, fast service otherwise."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Pizza is a must and the poke salad is a great surprise!"}
{"text":"The food took almost thirty minutes, in spite of us being one of only a handful of people eating at the time.  When it did arrive, it was soggy, the fries were completely cold and after taking a few bites of my chicken wondering why it was so chewy, I saw that the middle was pink.  Needless, to say we both stopped eating at that point and told the waiter after which he disappeared before we could get the check.  We waited again and only after the manager made his way over did we actually get the check.  I love BJ's but this location disappoints on all levels."}
{"text":"Usually four stars and the three are probably my fault for trying something new.  Almost always get bison burger which is a delicious low cal option.  Today I went low carb and got the wings.  They came with the sauce on the side and I am a wet wing fan.  The sauce was ok....may have been franks red hot.  Bleu cheese was very thin and no celery came on the plate.  Tracy the bartender always remembers my tea order and is very friendly."}
{"text":"I came to BJ's for a beer tasting dinner. I like the ambiance here; clean, dimly lit, gorgeous big booths for seating and high ceilings. 

I had a blast at the beer tasting and enjoyed trying a variety of IPAs! The experience was awesome... the host walked us through the history and type of each beer we tasted and we also were served a course of several small dishes. They poured generous samples of each beer and filled us back up if we requested. I was a little buzzed by the end, but that was expected, right?

I've been here a few times since then for drinks and have tried their pizzas and some appetizers. The food isn't anything to rave about and they are known for their pizzas but I've tried much better. The service is always good, can't complain there. I don't come back too often but I would definitely sign up for their next beer tasting dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time was New Year's Day and even on the front door it said that they were open until midnight. We arrived around 10:45 because I was starving and had gotten off of work early. The girl who was the hostess told us that they were closing in a couple minutes and they were not seating new customers. She walked away without apologizing and we just stood there kind of questioning the door.. They had just opened a couple months prior.. Shouldn't they know their holiday hours? The manager came over and apologized and seated us and then proceeded to tell us the specials, walked away.. And no one came back for 15 minutes. Food was mediocre for how expensive some of the dishes are. Second time around I went with the same person, my fiancé, and I was just grabbing something small for lunch. My fiancé wasn't getting anything because he had eaten prior so he just got a water. No one wanted to help us at all. Service was so terrible that I did not leave a tip. I got my food before we got our drinks, which was just 2 pops which is ridiculous that the kitchen made an entire plate of food, another waitress came by and dropped it off and then about 30 minutes after we first ordered our drinks, they finally came. I was halfway through my meal. I'm honestly not sure if I would want to come here again for good service, because they are definitely lackluster in that area. Save your money and go somewhere nicer in Fairlawn."}
{"text":"I went to a group dinner and there were 25+ people. It's hard to get a true feel for a restaurant based on this situation. I'll do my best.

I guess they don't have a separate room for large groups so we had a very long table in the dining room. This was ok because we didn't have much \"business\" to do (such as announcements, etc). We did have a raffle so nearby tables who weren't part of our group may have been disturbed for a few minutes.

I looked at the menu online before arriving and I am glad that I did because they have a large menu and I found what I wanted without any rush. I ordered:

CHERRY CHIPOTLE GLAZED SALMON*
Oven-roasted atlantic salmon | sweet, savory 
cherry chipotle glaze | roasted asparagus | 
fire-roasted red pepper, tomato + spinach 
couscous 
(cal. 580)
15.75

I substituted double asparagus in place of couscous. I love salmon but I didn't love the cherry chipotle glaze on the salmon. I thought it was too sweet and over-powered the salmon flavor. This being said... I didn't hate the dish... it was \"ok\" (I ate it all). I wouldn't recommend it but it was edible. This is personal taste and I acknowledge that there are probably people who love the dish. I don't think it was done poorly... it just wasn't for me.

On the service: I think that it was a difficult group to serve b/c we all didn't arrive at the same time; there were multiple tickets; and we were socializing a lot so we were there for about 2 hours. Fortunately, they did a great job. The service I received was just as good as if I was a small table of 4 people. My order was taken promptly, the food arrived within a normal amount of time and was fresh. My water was refilled without having to ask.

I would go back to this restaurant and I recommend that someone tries it."}
{"text":"The wife and I had our Friday night dinner here recently.  We are not a stranger to here, with this probably being our 5th visit or so...  The wife was having a hankering for their Berry Burst Cider...  For me, BJ's is probably to a 3.5 than an 'a-ok' 3 star...it's just there isn't anything terrible memorable about this place for me.  I mean, on the car ride over, I was trying to figure out what I like there, but couldn't figure it out.  I think it's that BJ's makes a lot of things that are good...but nothing that is particularly memorable to me.  I can't recall ever having a bad meal there, yet I can't recall having a great meal.  

The service was good, friendly and fast.  We were lucky to get there early enough to not have to wait to be seated, which was good since they filled up pretty fast.  I had a french dip sandwich with fries.  Standard french dip, though I must say that the horseradish cream sauce had a decent bite that I liked.

As noted above, 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars.  I wonder if the real thing that will hook me on this place is the pizookie, which I've never had...  (Oh yeah, I didn't like that happy hour was only in the bar, which it would have been the whole restaurant...at least it is decently sized (3 - 7pm)."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the barbecue chicken chopped salad with fried onion rings on top. Salad was huge so took most home. The freshly made chunky guac dip was delicious, a good sized portion that was inexepensive. Dessert was cookie and ice cream, a special three dollar deal to benefit those affected by TX hurricane. I hardly touched the monkey bread portion of my dessert, that was too much bread,dry and flavorless, but polished off the generous 2 scoops of ice cream."}
{"text":"S'more Pizzokie, Nuff Said! 

I mean.. I wish that was all there was to say. I'm lucky to have friends that love dessert, so we met there late night with a purpose. And that was to devour these delicious cookies we'd heard so many delightful things about. Delightful they were (albeit a bit smaller compared to others) but they were indeed delicious. The problem, however, had everything to do with our experience outside of dessert. 

The service was slow, and minimal at best. We waited quite a while to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant, only to eventually seat ourselves. We then waited some more before somebody finally took notice to help us. And then waited some more (a ton more) for them to take our order and eventually bring our food. We realized that during the wait happy hour had kicked in, so we ordered a few more things. BIG mistake. Big wait for a big let down.

Just an underwhelming experience all around, and our server was grumpy to boot. Not happy that I recommended this place, and it's highly unlikely that I ever would again."}
{"text":"Gianna had great service and served us with extreme happiness. Glad to have her bring us our food each time(:"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  First had to send back the paint thinner tasting Jeremiah Red than on to the worse than frozen pizza and my wifes prime rib sandwich stayed a little too long.  Barf!"}
{"text":"Silverware and plates were dirty (had leftover residue from hard water? or were not properly dried). The food runners kept bringing the wrong food to our table bc the server input the party next to us as our table, so we had to keep sending them away. Service (everything from refills, checking up) takes forever both times I've been to this location.

Three of us tried the unlimited soup & salad (+$2.95 for the massive bread bowl) with tomato bisque & clam chowder. Loved the tomato & mozzarella salad over the Caesar salad. 

+1 star bc if you do a quick Google search, you can get a free pizookie or appetizer :-)"}
{"text":"For a Saturday night, not bad. 

Arrived at 7:30, told it would be a 30-40 min wait, but got called up at 20 or 25 min. 

Wasn't too loud inside, which surprised me, since it was packed. Clientele made up of families, groups of women and men sharing drinks and food. Essentially, your typical Pittsburgh suburb population demographic.  

Our waiter, Canan, was friendly and attentive. He came out to let us know our food was coming very shortly after we ordered, which happened as scheduled. 

I ordered what I believe was the enlightened Salmon Quinoa bowl; although it's listed with salmon alone, mine had shrimp as well. Tangy, tomatoey deliciousness characterized the sauce. Fish a bit bland, simply peppered on top, but the shrimp was deliciously savory-a buttery little addition of flavor. 

Will need to come back and try other entrees, as well as sample that deliciously tempting Pizookie. Slightly underwhelmed, but optimistic!"}
{"text":"Food was good enough, but went on a Friday and their wait staff was spread way too thin.  Apps came out after 30mins and only 3-4 mins before dinners. Oh and they messed up my check so I waited another 10 unnecessary minutes with kids for a managers approval.  Look elsewhere if it's a weekend. I've been fine eating here during happy hour for what it's worth."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that's all over the place and has no idea what it wants to be. Huge menu with a little bit of everything for everyone. They do a lot of things just ok but don't anything very well. Ribs were dry and over cooked and not very tender. Mashed potatoes were bland and cold. Asparagus pasta was bland and completely forgettable. Probably the biggest disappointment was the draft beer. I tried two selections and both came out with that sour, metallic-tasting, semi-flat taste that is probably caused by dirty lines, incorrect temperature, improper co2 regulation etc. It was so bad and skunky that I didn't finish my second beer. I wouldn't recommend nor would I go back."}
{"text":"BJ's is an unexpectedly well-done restaurant chain. With a classically oversized and all-inclusive menu, I was a little skeptical. But after a couple visits, I have to say, everything I've had was quite different and really yummy! Just give yourself a lot of time to mull it all over...you'll be satisfied with what you get.

Less than satisfactory, however, is their own beer. I would more likely go with one of the other big craft guys on tap. I know they're a big chain, but I think a brewhouse should be able to round up some local beers too.

It's always packed, given the fact that it's one of the very few restaurants in Upper Saint Clair, so be prepared to wait or make a reservation. It's a really open echo-y building which makes it very loud and really supplements the \"big box\" chain feeling."}
{"text":"Good place to have an unplanned, spontaneous dinner at. My wife, son and I had the opportunity to do just that and we all had a fun time. 

Our server Destiny, was great! She had great recommendations, especially with their seasonal Pumpkin Ale, which was absolutely delicious! 

For apps we enjoyed crispy wontons, with tai dipping sauce & fried artichoke fritters. Wontons definitely won that battle.

For entrees, my wife enjoyed a classic Bacon Burger, and I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was great. Its rather large, so just remember that when ordering. 

For dessert we wanted a trio of Pazookies, and received 2 of which we ordered, and 1 which was not. They corrected the situation immediately which was nice.

The one suggestion I will make is, I would love a brief description on the food after its delivered to the table by the food runners. Always nice to be reminded of what was ordered. 

We had a great, laughter filled evening and will definitely come back. Thanks Destiny!"}
{"text":"I really like going to BJs when I am in town visiting my family. They have a HUGE menu so everyone can get exactly what they want. But much like the Cheesecake Factory, everything on the menu is not great. In my opinion, the pizzas and pasta dishes leave much to be desired. The sandwiches, soups, burgers, salads, and appetizers are very yummy. My favorite is the clam chowder in a bread bowl. So. Good.

This appears to be a great place for groups.The staff is very accommodating, and attentive, and the restaurant is very big. Friday and Saturday nights are generally packed with people, understandably so with the good food, relaxed atmosphere, and the beer/drink menu. If possible, I would call ahead or be prepared for wait a bit.

As I mentioned before, this place has an extensive beer and alcohol menu. My dad and uncle love this place for the beers, and I love this place for the cocktails. I have not been for happy hour, but I hear it is great. 

Definitely A-OK place for lunch/dinner in Chandler. I think as far as places go in the area, this is top notch."}
{"text":"Great service kaitlyn was AWSOME very pleasant and  attention to details ,I had the bbq chicken it was very good also the staff are very friendly I highly recommend Kaitlyn to your server ."}
{"text":"Thought it would be a good fathers day to grab some food and a cold beer.  I'm familiar with bj's just not this location.  We say 1st the bar sheet I kept hearing this very loud thumping noise.. at first I thought it was just a quick kitchen anomaly and would stop.. no such luck it's the server for from they kitchen do you are stuck hearing this annoying thumping every 5-10 seconds.. not a relaxing atmosphere at all.  If I do bj's it will not be this location.."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends.  The pros:
Food is delicious. I especially love the mozzarella balls and tomatoes and the shrimp Peruvian quinoa salad.  And of course, their pozookie. WOW!  Location is right off the I-215! It's very easy to find.  Everyone was friendly and kind.  It took awhile for the waitress to get our order because they were very busy.  However, we didn't wait very long for our food. 

The cons: If your are going here to have a quiet meal, you may as well leave now.  It is very noisy.  I could barely hear myself think. Lol.  

Overall, I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"First of all, the hostess who sat us was very rude and inefficient by not providing us with utensils. When I asked her to bring them, she rolled her eyes and took her time to the point where I ended up asking someone else. Her name was \"Brianna\". Heard she was new so she is still a long way from showing appreciation of her job by showing great customer service with a smile and having a great personality. Luckily, we were waited on by a very friendly waitress named \"Jennifer\". She was very attentive and eager to serve us with outstanding customer service. Too bad that the chicken wings that we ordered was still cold on the inside (kitchens doing). We didn't eat it and made sure to let her know. She was able to take that off our bill. Awesome! If it weren't for the great service provided by Jennifer, it would have been a very disappointing visit with our favorite family restaurant. Thanks Jennifer! Two thumbs up to you!:)"}
{"text":"Our waiter was Bryce Z.  on 10/7/17 and he was really great! Such a positive attitude, even though they were swamped with patrons because of Homecoming. He was very attentive and served us at a timely manner. Awesome guy!"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the worst BJ's I've ever been to. Service was slow. Root Beer tap was broken. Spinach and artichoke dip was cold when we got it. Pizookie was not fresh. Just not the best. My sandwich was still great which is why this is a 3. Could have been worse."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant the selection of food is huge you can literally spend 20 minutes trying to decide what to choose from that huge menu. Very nice and welcoming environment and the area is good. You must try the pizza here I ordered it once just to try something different and now I cant get anything else."}
{"text":"There's just so many options here and I've never had a bad experience here with food nor staff. Just a great place for food any time of day. However, I particularly like to go here later at night for a drink and a great meal followed by a chocolate chip pazookie. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I dined here after work today, Monday. Not crowded but still a good number of people in here. This place is huge. Open and clean. Large out door seating. 

We were seated promptly and our waiter took our drink order right away. 

While our waiter got our food and drinks timely,  he just didn't give the welcoming feeling. 

I ordered the Parmesan chicken, mash potatoes and broccoli.  I thought the side salad came with the dinner but it doesn't. Charged $3.50 for it. I'm used to getting a dinner salad with my entre at other places, so I was surprised this wasn't included. 

Daughter ordered the chicken and avocado flat bread pizza.  She said the sauce was a little spicy and she picked off the avocados. 

The food was cooked well and had plenty of flavor. BJ's had a large menu. From tacos,  burgers, pizza to steaks and pasta.  Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Always find myself wanting to order the jambalaya, its uber good. Turkey burger is good, pasta bowls are awesome, and the beers are always delish."}
{"text":"This morning we had intended to go to Vintner Grill for brunch, however, their website hadn't been updated showing their reduced hours so we ended up going to BJ's Brew House nearby. Although we prefer to patronize independent restaurants since chains aren't usually too exciting, we find you can get decent food at reasonable prices and the food is always consistent. Obviously everyone else must feel the same because you don't see too many of them closing once they've opened, and well, just look at every street corner in urban areas.

I ordered the \"French Toast Combo\" ($7.95) but subbed the adult french toast for the children's Cap'n Crunch coated and fried french toast. I don't know why you'd order sugar-coated and deep fried food for your child but it sounded pretty good so I though I'd give it a whirl. The eggs came out nice and hot and the apple-smoked bacon was of decent quality, but not crispy enough for my taste. The french toast was especially crispy but did not fall into the category of \"lightly fried\" as the description on the menu suggested. At first I thought it was alright but then I pressed down with my fork and saw oil starting to pool. Yuck. I reluctantly cut into the other piece which was astonishingly better. The Cap'n Crunch taste was nowhere to be found but it was much lighter and a fun version of french toast. Ian had the grilled chicken and cheese stuffed baked potato ($8.95). The Alfredo sauce that accompanied it tasted like it was straight out of a bag of Bertolli's frozen pasta (really bad) and the potato was unexciting. It was definitely a GMO potato if I'd ever seen one. What is America coming to..."}
{"text":"I've only been to a BJ's once - in San Diego - but had never tried the one in Las Vegas until last night.  

It was Thursday night, and this place was jammed - pretty good, considering the economy, so I figured I was in for some super food.  I wasn't blown away by the meal, and the service was sub-par.

I had a turkey burger.  I didn't want fries, so I was able to substitute steamed broccoli.  The burger was okay - not bad, but as bland as could be.  It came with Swiss and slices of avocado, lettuce and tomato.   Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about, either.  The broccoli, though, was inedible.  It was partially cooked, but not that crisp, delicious stuff that Chinese restaurants do so well.  This was RUBBER.  I had the waitress bring me mashed potatoes instead.  They were good, but too salty (What else is new?).  My friend had the turkey burger, too, and felt the same way about hers - Average.

Our husbands both had Parmesan-crusted chicken, and they were satisfied.  Again, nothing to rave about.

I just don't get it.  There are so many places in town that have above-average food.  They offer hefty discounts.  And they're empty.  In my humble opinion, BJs, which rarely has coupons, has a menu that's not much different from any other similar chain restaurant, and has food and service that doesn't distinguish itself in any way, has a steady stream of customers.  And judging by the Thursday night crowd, probably has lines out the door on the weekends.  I think it's kind of sad."}
{"text":"Solid value.

Great kale & Brussels sprouts salad.  Could have/should have left off the chicken.

Decent burger.  Cool, wide-open, loud, tv's.

Good service.  Lengthy of seat yourself bar tables...share your space & meet new friends!

In Summerlin coming back to LV from #redrocks conservation area!

Good stop"}
{"text":"I like their Chicago pizza. The beer is pretty pricey and not really worth it in my opinion but it's still a decent place to get some food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and atmosphere. Problem is extremely expensive food prices. Two lunches with just water should not cost $50. Please lower your prices. We will not be back until prices are lowered."}
{"text":"When I was first brought to BJ's with a friend I was a little skeptical of the huge menu and the fact that it wasn't busy, but I was pleasantly surprised by their deep dish pizza which still keeps me coming back. Nowadays there is always a wait for this hot spot at Desert Ridge. Although BJ's does do a good pizza nothing about the restaurant or service really stands out to me. The service has always been hit or miss in my experience, and the huge menu can actually be a little daunting. One time while feeling like a healthier option I tried the other famous item on the menu the big baked potato. The potato was extremely dry and lacking in advertised size, so I left hungry and disappointed. Although average, I would recommend BJ's for dates and group gatherings as it is an open atmosphere with a menu that can please just about any one. Also if you have room after dinner try the pizookie! They have mastered this favorite dessert of mine, and it is offered in four different flavors."}
{"text":"Went to Bj.s with my family for mother's day and it was a disaster, the fish and chips I got were burnt they bought me another but the fries were dry and the fish batter was thick and lousy not to mention the pieces were very small. They gave us free desert because of the fish problem and they gave gave me a pizookie with a burnt chocolate chip cookie.
My wife had pizza and she said it was lousy and my son who loves pizza did not eat the piece she gave him. This used to be such a great place to eat but the last few times the quality has gone to crap and it seems everytime we go here it gets worse. I will not be going back for a very long time."}
{"text":"Bj's is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour 3pm-7pm (I think). Their Garlic Kettle Parmesan chips on the small bites menu is one of the regular items I like to order. It's a good size portion that can easily feed three people. It comes with caramelized onion dip and a buffalo sour cream. I prefer the caramelized onion dip because it doesn't take away from  the flavor of the chips. Their mini deep dish pizzas are delicious and cheap during happy hour. Their appetizer portions are enough to make you so full that sometimes you don't have room for their Pizookie! I also found out that they can make the Pizookie into a half ..half order. It's helpful when you share this with someone who is the complete opposite of you because they can customize it to your liking. I find eating here during happy hour is sometimes cheaper than eating fast food and it's more filling."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and I've gotten delivery. The first experience was great all around. Second time I took my kids our flatbread app was burned. Why the kitchen and staff would serve it this burned was silly. First time getting delivery was great. Our food was so good, just very expensive. There is a delivery charge, plus a service fee (which is a % of your total, so almost $10 in fees for a $50 meal). Delivery a second time, my meal was burned. My burger was supposed to be medium and it was very well done. And they forgot my extra toppings I requested. Third time getting delivery my pitas for my tacos were so burned that when I folded it it ripped right in half. Not cool. My kids are obsessed with the pizookies. Seems to me they cared greatly about quality when they first opened, but quality is slowly going down hill. Esp for delivery. My daughter's pizza was supposed to be big and oblong, but it was messy and not made with care at all. For $15 I expect more."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times I had to wait about 15 min for a table. I would recommend coming at an off-peak time. Excellent selection of beers, drinks, and unique food, although the menu is very large and can be a little overwhelming. Charismatic servers and good service but the kitchen is slow to get food out. The restaurant is a welcome change to the sea of generic chain restaurants in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Food was good/okay . Service was okay. It was a Friday night, so may have had a bigger crowd than normal. Will probably return."}
{"text":"5 stars because Anthony our waiter was the BEST! Great food and wine, super tasty, but Anthony made our whole dinner and experience amazing. So impressed. Will be back!"}
{"text":"overall, this was great!  the food menu is starting to get bigger and bigger, similar to cheesecake factory.  hopefully it doesn't get too big, gets overwhelming.  the food was good.  we started with the avocado egg rolls and they came out very fast, which was nice.  the main concern was the service with our waitress.  to start, the entire lunch took less than 2 hrs, about 1 hr 45 min.  I think the biggest problem was our server...just slow and never around.  for example, one of us ordered unlimited soup and salad and the waitress never came around to refill the soup or salad.  when she did finally come by, we asked about a certain soup and she said she didn't know so she will bring a sample of it.  that alone took 10 min to bring a sample.  my friend liked the sample so he requested it and that took another 10 min.  we even had to tell her that we were in a hurry, but still no change in service style, she was never around.  

on a plus note, the pazookie got more flavors/options (I think) and its still as good as I remember first having it.  definitely end with a  pazookie!"}
{"text":"If I could give a minus rating I would.  This is the second bad experience at this place and my last.  Three of us arrived at 7:15 we were seated at 7:20 and waited on immediately.  A salad, fish N chips, and chicken tacos.  At 7:55 still no food so we left.  I stopped at the front explained why we were leaving and I left $6 for an iced tea and a lemonade.  They could have cared less, but not a surprise since my last experience.  We went to Red Robin around the corner and let hostess and manager know of our experience with their competition.  It was obvious that they could care less but I will make sure to write a review in the UNLV paper.  Hell will freeze over before i step foot in another BJ's or recommend to anyone. This BJ's and management is a joke and I let corporate know to."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 4:30 today and sat in the bar area to get the HH deals.  After waiting at our high top table for about 15 minutes, a manager stopped over to see if we had been waited on.  We told him \"no\" and he ran off to grab some menus.  When he came back, he assured us one of his servers would be over right away to take our order.  Since it wasn't busy, we figured this would be true.  About another 10 minutes went by without being acknowledged by a single staff member, so we decided to leave.  We headed over to Firebirds, where we had exceptional service and excellent HH drinks."}
{"text":"Service started out great and went downhill quickly. We had two young children with us and luckily we took toys. Took a long time to get our meals and they came in shifts. Cheddar broccoli soup was horrible. Clam chowder was okay. Ribs were not good. Caesar salad was actually a \"house\" salad. Disappointed. Ordered three (easy) desserts (celebrating birthday). Took 30 minutes. If it was not one of the children's birthdays, we would have left. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I stopped into BJ's the night of June 26, 2014  and I ordered a 6' combo pizza and a calamari appetizer. They were both very good. I will be back. It was about 8:00 PM and the place was PACKED. I saw the young lady who was the working carry area out as I was walking in. She was literally running to a car with an order. She must have run back to take my order. Very friendly with great customer service skills. I asked her if they were usually this busy during the week and she said \"NO\". She handled the people waiting and those who continued to pour in. Great job and I made sure to give her a nice tip. I checked out the many TV's while waiting and seemed like my order was up in no time. It's a nice place with reasonable pricing.."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times and the food and service is always excellent. I have only ever ordered their Buffalo Chicken Pizza but the company I have visited with have ordered their salads and they said they were great! Plus you get plenty of food for your money. For an added bonus their pizookie's are awesome!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! There salads are awesome and huge! I love their BBQ sliders too! They are so yummy! I usually do take out and they are so kind, because I always call 15 minutes til the kitchen closes. I always look forward to eating here!"}
{"text":"So i decided to come for a quick drink and lunch before work. I sat down at the end of the bar near the entrance and waited for about 8 minutes to get greeted. I watched the bartender jessica take care of 3 guests before me including 2 new guests that sat down 2 minutes after me. They recieved a greet within 30 secs and beers within 1 minute. Crazy. I finally made eye contact with her and she asked me what i was drinking. I told her an irish pear and then asked for the manager. Didnt make a big deal just wanted to provide him with feedback. Other than that I love the food.

{"text":"BJ's is a fun dinner spot, but I have a hard time getting over the cost for what you get.

First off let me say our server Megan was AMAZING and hilarious. We got there 2 minutes before Happy Hour ended so she made sure to hurry up and get in our appetizers and beer for happy hour price. She was attentive and answered my million questions I had about the food. 

The beers are always Ok here. I am not amazed by any that I've had. For an appetizer we had chicken pot stickers which were yummy because typically those are hard to find. Almost all the appetizers here will run you about $9-$11 dollars which is pretty crazy for a small appetizer.

For dinner I had the turkey dip. So good! Again this is not something you typically see. Their menu is very diverse so you should have no problem finding something you like. My husband had the Buffalo chicken pizza which was good but not great.

The atmosphere is fun and you should enjoy yourself here. However be expecting to have an $80 chain restaurant type meal for two."}
{"text":"As usual for this location, the service was good, but the food is slipping. We ordered the poke appetizer and it tasted fishy and \"off\".  We sent it back. I ordered the late nite burger and the cheese was not melted and the chili verde was lukewarm at best. I'm beginning to think the corporate overlords are ruining an otherwise good place, taking great ideas and doing them halfway. The beer is still good though.  That's brings it up to a 3"}
{"text":"Well, for those that don't want to read a novel I'll break it down:
The food is really good.  The service SUCKS.  It was seriously dreadful.  
Unfortunately we won't be coming back.

I had dinner there last night with my parents.  We were all excited to go, cuz someone told us it was really good.  I really don't like leaving a negative review for places, but It was that bad.

We came in about 7pm, and we went to the hostess stand.  She just kind of stared at us, and never greeted us.  Not a hello, nothing.  Ok, whatever, maybe shes having a bad night or something.  So we tell her that we'd like a table for 3.  The other hostess came over to seat us, and kind of dropped menus in front of us on the table and just left.  No \"hi\" or anything.  It was weird.

The restaurant was a little busy, but there were still many open tables and a lot of FOH employees on the floor.  It was a normal dinner time type of busy.  Not anything extreme. 

Our server comes over and gets our drink order, and right off the bat he seems to really not want to be there.  OhhhhKay.... do we like have the plague or something and not know??  We'd really like to know if we are contagious or something.

The food DID come out quickly, and we really enjoyed our appetizer.  But, we would have enjoyed it even more IF WE HAD SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS.  Like we tried to get ANYONE'S attention to get silverware, but employes passed our table and glanced at us, then pretended not to see us!  omg!  So we used our 3 beverage napkins.  We seriously tried to obtain some utensils.  It was super lame.  

A runner came out and delivered our meals, and then she tried to bounce out all quick!  So, we flagged her down as she was leaving and asked for silverware.  And I hate flagging down an employee because I think it's rude and tacky, but we couldn't get ANYONE'S attention any other polite way.

Our server did keep our drinks topped off, but I would have loved to get another beer - but I couldn't!!!  I was never asked if I wanted another, and I could not get him to stay at the table for more than like 3 seconds.  By the end of our dinner, we actually laughed amongst ourselves because the service was unbelievably bad.  We actually felt uncomfortable there.  What sucks is we went there to enjoy ourselves, and the food was good.  But wow... we made contact with 4 employees there and they all seemed standoffish, unfriendly, and we got the feeling that they all hated their job.  Like they really hated it.  I'd go as far to say they despised working there.  I mean, is there like a horrible manager there that they all hate??  We felt like we entered the twilight zone. 

As I stared longingly at my empty beer glass we got the 68 dollar check, paid and left.  At least, at this very point we got a \"thank you\"!  That was nice, however too late to retain us as customers.  What's sad is we really enjoyed the food, but we felt very uncomfortable.  We were kind of annoyed that we felt obligated to tip, but we felt like it's just not right to not tip someone.
So yeah... AKWARD!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Got seated at 6pm, took over an hour to get our order. Over 2 hrs later, we are here waiting on our check.....and our order wasn't right. The excuse was prom, totally understand but come on. :("}
{"text":"Good place to drop by for happy hour. Great selection of beer, and love their flatbread pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch today with my family, I had the soup and salad combo (no refills on weekends), wedge salad was watery and small, I'd rather order from Outback. The clam chowder was actually really good and filling, can't complain for $7.95. Next time I'll stick to avocado egg rolls and the pasta which are always good."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot and love it.  My 'go-to' dish is the Peruvian Quinoa bowl with salmon - fantastic!  My husband finally tried it today (recommended it to him before, but you know men... ;-)  and he just about licked the bowl and said this was now his go-to dish too.   Large salmon fillets in a big bowl of quinoa, rice, sauteed spinach, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes.  It is wonderful, and I brought half home for dinner ($40 check, no alcohol).  Waitress was great too (wish I remembered her name), as well as the greeters.  Used the two bonus $25 cards I got when I bought two $100 gift cards at Christmas.  What a deal.  

I have been here a lot over the years and thought it was time to write a review.  If I HAD to come up with anything negative, it would be the bar area.  Service is hit and miss, not as good as in the regular part of the restaurant.  Servers just aren't as attentive and nice.  But I highly recommend this place (and it is usually packed)."}
{"text":"First timers at BJs. Great service, upbeat atmosphere, nice music, lovely interior. Friendly staff. Loved the shrimp quinoa bowl. Dining partner loved the prime rib, asparagus and huge baked potato. Next time he will order the prime rib medium instead of medium rare (his bad). Had the cookies and cream Pizookie for dessert.  Outstanding. Clean men's room. We will be back."}
{"text":"The beer here is very good, I made sure to try a few different ones and they were all high quality. However the service level of the staff was not very good and for the price of the food it was no better than ordering at a chain restaurant for double the price. I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice place  it was crowded  but not bad the service was better then most restaurant's. And the food was very good"}
{"text":"We have been a huge fan of the BJ's franchise in Columbus and despite the negative Yelp reviews were looking forward to trying this location too.

We arrived on Saturday night at 6pm and the place was packed and we were told about an hour to 90 minutes for a table for 2.  Pretty typical when you don't make reservations on a Saturday.  Luckily while we were grabbing drinks from the bar 2 seats opened up.  We ordered avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, a  crispy jalapeno burger, and parmesan crusted chicken.  After about 20 minutes our dinners showed up and we told the food runner we were still waiting on our appetizers - a few minutes later our appetizers arrived.  The bartender came over to apologize and then sent the manager over to apologize - and ended up  taking off one of the appetizers from our bill which I thought was a nice way to handle the situation.

The stuffed mushrooms were just Ok - probably a 2 star item.  They were bland and no particular flavor stood out.  The avocado egg rolls were fantastic & I would recommend.  I loved the crispy jalapeno burger - 5 stars - (Fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, Baja sauce, red onions, tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro on a toasted bun) and it was cooked to perfection.  The parmesan crusted chicken - 5 stars - (Topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli).

We also tried the skinny margarita (5 stars) and you can't go wrong with any of their in house craft beers.  If you download the app and join their loyalty program you receive a free pizookie!

I would recommend downloading the app to add your name to the waitlist before arriving to the restaurant.  We never got the text that our table was ready until we were in the car on the ride home - thankfully those 2 spots opened up at the bar or we would've been waiting the full 90 minutes.

Side note for those with gluten sensitivities - I did notice many items were gluten free & they did offer gluten free buns for $1 up charge."}
{"text":"The menu at BJ's offers an extensive variety of entrees.  My mother and I decided on a lite lunch so we ordered the soup and salad.  The salad was pretty basic but the minestrone soup was delicious! And so much for the lite lunch, since it was all you can eat soup we did indulge. BJ's is a popular Restaurant and at prime time hours does fill up fast."}
{"text":"we opted to come Saturday late afternoon.  It wasn't very crowded....YAY for beating the crowd.
We sat at a booth at the bar.  I couldn't decide between baby back ribs or pizza.  I can get pizza anywhere right?!?!  BRING ON THE RIBS!  OMG...super tender, just the right amount of sauce and the French Fries were uber hot and crispy and thin.  Just the way I like them.
E of course got the jambalaya.  Didn't he get this before lol.  Yep just checked previous review....a creature of habit he is :)
I am so bad at getting the names of the wait staff to include them in my reviews but yep....once again I didn't get it.  Shout Out to the gentleman who waited on us in the big booth on Saturday late afternoon in the bar area :)  He was nice, fast and not annoying checking in on us every 30 seconds yet not taking forever and a decade to come back and check in on us.  
Awesome evening yet again at BJ's!
idiotic self forgot to use my rewards card....oopsie!  Next time right?!?!"}
{"text":"Went to BJ's to watch the hockey game. Got a table right away. Our server was Sita. She was awesome!  The food is always good, but the service was outstanding!  I'm requesting Sita every time I go to BJ's!

Since the last posting, I went back to BJ's with a couple friends and my daughter to again watch a hockey game. My daughter is 3, and I know that as a server having a 3 year olds is not an easy task. We requested Sita again.  Sita remembered what we liked to drink, and the special requests that my daughter had the first time and this time brought it without even being asked.  Because of Sita's exceptional service and overall stellar disposition, we have become a regular at BJ's!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  Last night I ordered a hamburger medium-well.  I can't do under cooked hamburger meat. When I got it the inside was completely raw. So, I asked the waitress to please have the cook/chef cook it to my requested specification. She took it back and said that she would have the burger remade. I got it 35 minutes later and it was the same burger that I had the first time and it was cooked more, but someone added so much pepper to the burger that I choked when I bit into it. Will never return to this B.J.'S!"}
{"text":"I've been to BJ's before in Columbus but the only memorable thing were the pizookies. Pizookies are freshly baked cookies topped with toppings such as ice cream, caramel, chocolate chips, etc. The toppings depend on the pizookie you choose. 

I loved the atmosphere. They have lighting on the shelves behind the bar where the alcohol bottles sit. They have their own brewed beers. I was excited to see they also had A cider - berry burst cider. It was light and refreshing. Not too sour and not too sweet - just perfect for my palate.  

We had the spinach stuffed mushrooms, broccoli cheddar soup, Mahi mahi tacos with fries, brisket bacon burger with honey Sirracha Brussels sprouts, and salted Carmel pizookie for dessert. The mushrooms were a great starter. The soup was ok I actually prefer Paneras broccoli cheddar. The fries I LOVED! Double fried ... crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Great burger, good tacos and Brussels sprouts! Make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Awesome waitress, ask for Crystal! We had the lettuce wraps, stuffed mushrooms and clam chowder! Oh and the triple chocolate pizookie. Started with a Bloody Mary! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Always busy.  Too much spice this time on our regular entrees.  Service a bit slow. Would have liked prompt drink refills to take the edge off the food. Prefer West Charleston location."}
{"text":"Great ribs and great service.  John was excellent.  We will returning soon."}
{"text":"It wasn't my favorite dining experience but it could just have been my choice of entrees.  I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  The meat was tough and the BBQ sauce did not tickle my palate.  It was too smokey tasting and had some kind of liquor in there that was too obvious.  I'm not one to send food back, but if I were, I would have in this case.

My dining companion raved about the roast beef sandwich, so all is not lost.

The service was flawless and the atmosphere just great."}
{"text":"All i can say is AMAZINGGG CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Would definitely recommend.
David (the manager) took the time from his busy schedule and contacted me personally after i had some issues from my order and had my food delivered with no cost to make it for it.
I have been a customer for so long and i wouldn't change it otherwise its definitely my to go to restaurant especially for my night cravings.
The food, the service and everything is on point.
I come from New York so i have tried a variety of food and been to different restaurants so i pay attention to the smallest details and i want my meal to be perfect since I'm paying my money and Bjs just doesn't fail to impress.
Thank you for making my days special and appreciate the great service."}
{"text":"I ordered the avocado roll as usual but this time it was complete mush and have the worst a flavor ever this has always been my favorite dish and I always order it...
as a main dish I ordered the barbecue beef sandwich .....the bread was hard ,as a rock the cheese wasn't melted and the beef was overcooked and crunchy this was terrible food at this restaurant this time I won't be back.   
this BJ Brewhouse was the most disappointing I have ever been to."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was so salty that we could not eat 3/4 if it.  So 3 people left hungry and we paid 78!  Avoid this place.  Even after we told the waitress the manager didn't adjust the bill for the crap food.  So salty we didn't eat most of it.  ...when I think about it, the beer helped to offset the salty..."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian small Pizza with goat cheese added. It was just meh. I've been here a couple other times and the salads (esp the ahi tuna) are a lot better than the pizza. I think the wines are slightly overpriced but not too bad. 

Service was decent the night we went. The menu is huge and I do like the selection - just not the pizza. Crust was a little burnt an no flavor. Hardly any sauce."}
{"text":"They should have been a one star but only nmoved up to a 2 star because they tried, but failed, to correct the issue. 
So, to be fair, we were at this place last Friday, and the food was good, which you should expect from one of the pricier chain restaurants.
However, in our ten or so visits there since they opened over a year ago, the service has been spotty, sometimes bordering on terrible, and the the food has been good only about 70% of the time. The visit I gave the two rating was on Monday, the third day after our last visit.
I ordered the exact same meal that I did on Friday, the Blackened Chicken Sante Fe salad (yes, I know....boring), but it seemed to be a good go-to item. 
WRONG!
The lettuce was wilted, with brown edges, and I had to hunt for the chicken, which, when I found it, I understood why they hid it. It was cold. Not just sitting in cool salad cool, but just from the refrigerator cold, with no blackened seasoning. They did sprinkle Cajun seasoning on top of the lettuce, which was funky. 
Funny, the salad from a few nights before had fresh veggies, and freshly cooked, blackened chicken on top, sliced,  but certainly recognizable as a chicken breast, moist and tasty. 
I don't blame our waitress, who, on me telling her that the salad was awful, didn't seem surprised, and offered to take it off our bill and replace it with another remade salad or something different. I had only tasted one bite, plus one piece of the cold, stringy and dry vulcanized chicken, and didn't want to repeat my mistake. I opted for something different. 
I ordered their new meatball sandwich, as the rest of the table was eating and I figured it would be quick. 
Honk! Not so fast. After about ten minutes,  our waitress came by to tell me that it would be another five minutes on my sandwich. When it did come, ( about twenty minutes after I sent the salad back), the rest of our table was done eating. A manager brought it out, and said were weren't going to be charged for the sandwich. Good thing, because the top bun was burnt black around the edges and dark brown elsewhere. No manager should have brought that to the table. I ate the meatballs and the bottom bun which was not burned, but left the unappetizing top untouched. 
The manager, a seemingly nice lady, looked frazzled and harried, and I'm sure she was putting out fires like this all night.
The fact is, the first plate shouldn't have made it out of the kitchen, either. 
We found BJs originally in Mesa, Arizona, and had consistently good food and service. 
Not so in North Olmsted. 
We were excited when we first saw they were building a BJs here. Now, we are disappointed too often to make this a regular stop. What a shame."}
{"text":"This reviews a week to late.

Server: Unknown 
(Fortunately, I have forgotten her name)

-Weekday, Dinner, Party of 2

It took approximately 8-10 minutes for our table to be greeted. This I can understand being aware that some server stations are bigger than others, or granted she could have been running another tables food. No biggie. 

Greet: (Asking for our beverages)
We had to repeat ourselves 3 times on what we would like to order because apparently it was too loud in the restaurant for her and she couldn't hear us. We could both hear her just fine but instead of her kneeling in or stepping closer to us she would just ask for us to speak louder. 

-We ordered or at least attempted to order:
    -1 Cider
     -Taster Set: with 2 out of 4 being the wrong beers. 
-She was not familiar with her beers and when she dropped them at our table she put them all down without telling us which beer was which.
     -2 waters: which neither of us received. 
    -Appetizer: Chicken Lettuce Wraps: which we also never received. 

Entrees ordered: Received no utensils and or napkins.
     -Brisket Burger: Arrived cold and looked very unappealing. 
(We have been here and had eaten and seen it before.) Sent Back.
    -Medium Pizza: Warm but crust was soggy underneath. Kept because we were hungry.

-We did not have the missing food or burger remade since we knew it would take to long. We just ate the pizza. 

Server: Was not attentive and although she apologized she seemed very unapologetic. She was MIA most of the time although we were the only people in the section left. Originally it was completely full but we outlasted our stay not because we were hanging out but rather because we were just waiting for food or service. 

Check: She brought our check and then offered us water. -_-
-She picked up her check quickly, which was upsetting due to the lack of service we received."}
{"text":"1pm & the service is not very good today...been here for a good 5 minutes, the waiter came to take our drink order, 10 minutes & he has not come back, REALLY??? 2 waters, 3 ice teas???

At the 15 mark drinks finally came, orders taken.  Now sitting, drinks empty???

Food finally came and order is wrong???  The manager came over apologized, offered to get the sandwich made over but we said no as we waited almost 45 minutes just to get food.  Also ha to ask the manage for drink refills which were brought by another person.

Now 2pm, the place is almost empty, drink is empty, waiter came by but no acknowledgement.  Our waiter, has a great personality but as for attention to detail, not very good. Had to ask for another ice tea.

Not sure why it is so bad today???"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this place...it's very clean, good vibe, reasonable prices...but tonight it took 10 minutes for us to get 2 drinks....I've been staring at them at the bar for 5 min."}
{"text":"They can't seem to get anything right.  Even dessert, a pizzokie they screwed up.  Then it took 15 minutes to get the correct dessert out!  Poor service, way too long of a wait for food, drinks and refills.  

Go elsewhere, you'll be happier."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place anymore. I've been to many different locations recently in Arizona and California and there seems to be a common theme among all of them...bad service. Luckily, when I visited last week for happy hour, our server seemed to be one of the better ones. Their happy hour used to be decent and now it doesn't feel like much of a happy hour at all. The food is decent. Some of my favorites include:

Chicken lettuce wraps
Chicken potstickers
Pork chile verde queso dip
Parmesan crusted chicken
Pizookie trio

There are some things here that are hit or miss, but their menu is generally pretty good and one of the few places that has some healthy items that actually look like something I would want to try."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch! We had the best waitress, Jennifer gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Overall a great place. Good service and it's fast. The food is good and I've never had a problem with it. Wife orders easy because she's more vegetarian or omni. Only reason I give it three stars is because it's difficult to order as a vegan. You have to take a regular menu item and modify it to where it's not even close to what it was. No vegan cheese for pizza. Marinara sauce and veggies is all you can get. Salads have no option for a no meat topping like tofu or chikn. . So you pay $15 for a chicken salad with dressing. Then you ask for no chicken and balsamic and oil. The cost is the same. So lettuce for $15.  Think the only thing you can order straight off the menu is soup and maybe the portabella salad.  Good place though. Used to it being hard to eat out. Just wish they'd make a page in the menu to make it easier on the waitstaff and the customer who's vegan."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant and awesome servers! Deep dish pizza is amazing! Kids have to try Mac 'n' cheese from the kids menu. And what to say about our server Ariana... I am 10 years in hospitality, I've never met better server in my life! I just can't decide if food is better or service! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant.....

This is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw \"Brave\" Great Movie) 

Anyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy.... 

The waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip) 

So on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color..... 

Now my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal....

Last but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about..... 

Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing....."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location several times, and have had mixed experiences with the restaurant, but perhaps last night was the worst experience. We went for a large family dinner to celebrate my son's birthday. The server, Sita, seems to dislike her job very much. As soon as we mentioned we would like separate checks, she acted as if the world was going to crumble. She demanded that we stay in the same seats, so as not to mess her up. She made a comment such as \"Oh geez, this is going to be difficult\". This type of restaurant should be used to handling large parties, as there were at least 3 others larger than ours. Even though the server made a point to write seat numbers down, the food was still auctioned off at the table. At least 4 different servers brought out our food out. This in itself is not a problem, however, my wife's food never came out, and I had not seen a server come to the table in over 10 minutes after the last plate was put down. Finally our server comes over, and I tell her my wife's food was completely missing. She tried to give some excuse, but there is no for us to wait 10 minutes to be told her food is going to be late because the server screwed up. My wife's food (which was a simple burger) did not come until after everyone else was finished, and had to rush through her meal. When the manager came by, I informed him I would not eat until my wife had my food, and then my steak would be cold. He did offer to bring me another steak, so that my wife and I could eat together. This second steak arrived to the table before my wife's first burger. So here I am with a second plate of food before my wife even had a single bite to eat.  Disgraceful. No communication whatsoever."}
{"text":"Had a relaxing night out here with friends. Great atmosphere and even better food. Ordered pizza and several appetizers from the menu. Hats off to John the restaurant manager from LA. Welcome to Pittsburgh and thank you for your OUTSTANDING SERVICE!! Go Steelers!"}
{"text":"We have been to many BJ's for meals and the one in Mesa multiple times.  It has always been a good one and this time was no exception. My wife tried the Spicy Chicken with Noodles and liked it.  I had one of my standards here, the Bacon Guacamole Deluxe Burger and it is was perfect. The service was solid and we would come again."}
{"text":"Vacation time spent by a trip to see the family is generally rife with compromises. After failing to produce an agreement on anything we all really wanted, we ended up at the somewhat unfortunately named BJ's Brewhouse.

I half expected to see gaggles of teenage boys and tweenage girls (of roughly the same maturity level) stifling giggles about what \"BJ\" might stand for, but did not. The other half expected the food to be disappointing and for me to be already longing for some good Szechuan before I'd been in Arizona 2 hours, and pleasantly did not experience that either. Standard chain decor, standard chain service, standard ratio of operational to non-operational men's room stalls (non-zero.)

We opted for the stealth $20 email special of a shared medium pizza (any specialty or number of toppings), a shared \"pizookie\" dessert and individual soup or salad which I would strongly recommend since normally a specialty pizza itself is $20.

The starter? Minestrone with a bit of cheese. Italian. Adequate. Unremarkable.
The pizza? A paradoxically Chicago-style Southwestern, like a chain boutique version of Pizza Hut. Solid crust, great by Seattle standards (low.)
The dessert? A very thin (Peanut Butter, among the 5+ varieties) cookie in a pancake-sized tin topped with vanilla ice cream. I was more preoccupied with whether Madame K's Pizza Brothel, er, Bistro in Seattle copied the Screaming Orgasm from them or vice-versa (and thinking they would have been better off to copy BJ's pizza) than the experience of the sweet cookie.

The verdict? For optimizing any particular aspect, one could do better elsewhere, but the pizza is quite good among mostly forgettable accompaniments. Chains are generally compromise candidates, and in that vein, BJ's Brewhouse performs the job."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love it. They have their own brew house and the selections are great. I enjoy myself everytime at this place, the service is quality and the food is tasty. No matter what i order i always make sure I have those shrimp lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Also on Tuesdays their wines by the glass are half off. For improvements I would say to make sure that there are no water marks on the silverware and plates, minor details matter. But overall, I love this place. It is my favorite in the area."}
{"text":"My girl and I had the Chicken Club Flatbread Pizza and the Stuffed Mushrooms. Both were excellent. The pizza had a great aftertaste. I enjoyed the decor. The hostesses all dressed in classy dresses which I thought was cute.  For the two appetizers and two drinks our bill was $20. So it's not too expensive but not a place with a value menu. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"As promised, I came back because of the managers amazing response to our less than great visit.  

I was here yesterday at 2:30, and the service seems to have improved! It was packed because they were giving veterans dinners for free.  We still got a table for 4 right away.  

I got the lunch special with the half California club, friess and a salad for $7.98. Someone else got the deep dish pizza, and another got spaghetti and meatballs.  

We did have a long wait for food, about 45 minutes.  My food wasn't warm at all, hence the 4 stars, but it was still very good.   I tried the spaghetti and it was delicious.   My friend with the deep dish said the crust was to die for. 

We also tried their hand crafted black cherry soda, which was very good and had free refills.  

Try the seasonal snickerdoodle pizookie, it was amazing! 

Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Always been my favorite place to get something good.
Casual, great service, eclectic menu, and priced right."}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple times.  The service is not too bad, but if you have somewhere to go, let them know in advance you're in a hurry... they like to take their time.

Ive ordered their sandwiches a few times and have been somewhat satisfied with them.  Nothing incredible, but not horrible.   However I did order their nachos one time.  They bring out this mound of red, green, plain nachos with tons of cheese, chili, peppers, etc all over it.  I was thinking this is gonna be good.  After eating the top half of the nachos (the best part), I find myself tasting nothing  but salt salt and more salt.  in the end, im thinking \"Would you like some nachos with your salt?\"  

Ive been here at least three times, and probably wont be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Every meal I've had here has been excellent our only complaint is the service we don't know if it's because the kitchen is so slow or it's because the servers are so slow but every time we've been there the service is been very slow"}
{"text":"Back again    Food was awesome   I had shrimp/fish tacos. Husband had jambalaya    Yes it's spicy. Girls split a steak. Prob more char on it than they would like.    The long wait for a table stinks.  But Bethany is the best was  server !! We'll be back and will ask for her !!"}
{"text":"Took about 10 minutes to seat us way in the back. Server then took about 10 minutes to show up. She took the order. We all had soup, salad and a sandwich. It's been about 20 minutes and nothing still. Found a bug in the strawberry in the prosecco. The rest of the restaurant is served and happy. They are not busy at all. We're just in  the back with absolutely no attention. Because we just ordered soup and salad right? Had we ordered maybe a higher priced item we would've gotten the service everyone else is having. So we will wait for our food as it has now been about 30 minutes since the order was so simple. First and most definitely the last time we'll come here. To top it off the server is not too excited to be here. The excuse was another big party was tying to get food. That tip is probably bigger and therefore more important since we are simple soup and salad. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I have to admit, we've been to this restaurant once and weren't fans.  However, we noticed they had a \"We Deliver\" sign up, so decided to order delivery.

Everything was wonderful...from the easy online ordering to the friendly driver, Rochelle, to the really nice packaging of their delivered food.

Also, the food was still hot and very good!  My only complaint, and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, I had ordered the prime rib sandwich, which was supposed to come with creamy horseradish...there wasn't any.  But, it was still tasty and I ate the whole thing.

We will definitely order from y'all again...it was a pleasant experience all around."}
{"text":"We came here because my boyfriend had a bunch of loyalty rewards from work. We asked for no straws and somehow ended up with 3 between the two of us. My water glass was dirty to the point of having a dead gnat in it. They brought me a \"clean\" glass that was still not great but no dead bugs, so I didn't complain. Turns out the loyalty points don't work on drinks, so we still had to pay. They didn't seem to know how to operate their own payment system. Food was good."}
{"text":"We visit the BJ's quite often and have always been happy with our food.  The service has really gone to top notch in the last year.  The Asian Chopped Salad and the Fish and Chips are the bomb!  I usually get one or the other.  My husband goes all over the menu...burgers, fish and chips, flatbread pizza.  The Paloma is the best one I have had in Las Vegas.  What would be totally awesome is bringing back the fried portobello mushroom appetizer.  Hint Hint.
.
 Aside from all of this, I have to give a huge thank you to the staff.  We, 9 times out of 10, go here with my sister and my nephew.  My nephew is a Wounded Warrior with a brain injury and in a wheelchair.  Every single staff member greets him and asks him what he would like.  Some may think this is not a huge deal, but it is to him.  We have been to restaurants where he is talked over, like he is not there.  Thank you BJ's for making his dining experience a normal one."}
{"text":"The service was great from walking in the door to the end of our meal. Our server was friendly and got our order right when we even had food allergies which is always a must. I got the new light salad:Thai mango chicken and it was awesome. I love a good fresh and a little spicy salad. It was very refreshing and filling.  BJs always has great brews too...try the lightswitch for a good lager under 135 cals."}
{"text":"Great beer! If it was the beer by itself I were rating, bj's would get 5 stars.The blond and piranha pale ale are my favorites. Food is good, but service is hit or miss(never actually had terrible service, however only once had fantastic service). I go for the beer! And you should too!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night... Tomatoe Soup is fantastic, drink selections are on point as well. Pricing is very fair."}
{"text":"A better Chili's. This is the type of restaurant that keeps people from fitting into their clothes. 

I generally don't go to places like BJ's because everything is so full of fat, lard, fried you-name-it and portions are always large. I realize I am not their target demo here, but still was happy to come here for lunch to splurge a bit.

The server gets a Star for the various things I threw at him: Changing which Fries I wanted after already placing the order; Side of jalapenos; and the biggie---- having my California Burger delivered deconstructed so that I could pick and choose what I wanted.  He went one step further and put the cheese on the bread, and had the bread completely separate from my burger. This was a great way to enjoy the burger. The burger itself seemed a smallish 1/2 LB and very thin. Consequently, not terribly juicy --- but not bad.

The in-house Root Beer was good and refills came without request.

The desserts looked good and others seemed to like them. I did taste the Grilled Salmon which seemed pretty healthy and tasted fine but nothing too exciting. Steak Fries are well-seasoned and a nice change of pace. I glanced at their 'Chicago-style Deep Dish Pizza'. Optimistic thinking, I'd say.

 Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Consistently good. I almost always have the BJ Cobb salad. Added a clam chowder this time. Canned but still tasted good."}
{"text":"We decided to try BJ's on a spur of the moment kind of thing.  What a great decision!  The wait wasn't very long for a Saturday night.  The staff was friendly. The ambience was nice and relaxed. And the Pizookies!  OMG!  White chocolate macadamia nut warm cookie with ice cream on top...mmmm!  I would go back just for that haha. My hubby said the steak was the best he's had since we've been in Vegas and we've been here about a year. The only complaint I have is that the pizza we ordered for my son came out about 10 minutes after our food.  The waiter said the oven was backed up. I understand, but 5 year olds don't care about how busy it is lol. But, everything was just fine once the Pizookies arrived!  We will go back!"}
{"text":"So the family and I enjoy the occasional visit to BJ's and it is a solid choice if you just want a place with a diverse menu and not as swanky as Cheesecake Factory.  Every visit is pretty consistent so the only thing that changes is the level of service.  Our server, was very busy and overall was not bad.  Had the potato skins to start, a blue cheese wedge, pasta with shrimp and asparagus, and the prime rib.  No complaints about the food.  Everything came out hot and fresh and was pretty tasty.  Only complaints were that it took a while, we had no plates and silverware by the time the appetizer showed up, and the menus were a little sticky with crumbs in them.  I understand it's not tablecloth dining, but service is what sets you apart in today's business world.  Last but not least, the Salted Caramel Pizookie is worth an afternoon visit if you've got the occasional sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"So we go here with my parents a lot. The pizza is pretty good and the atmosphere is generally pretty good. TVs everywhere so you can watch a game and still focus on the people in your group. Their beer is pretty good and very reasonably priced and there is almost always some sort of special going on. My only complaint is that the Vegas locations don't have nutritional guides on hand. They are readily available in California so why not Nevada?"}
{"text":"They were so rude! Which doesn't bother me as bad as the poor food! I had the Alfredo and my chicken was cold. My sister had the chicken pasta and said her broccoli was almost frozen. Won't go here again!"}
{"text":"I have gotten food from here multiple times with no issues. This past Monday (8/1/16), I ordered two pizzas and a kids meal to-go. Our food was horrible! The first issue was that one of the pizza's had NO sauce on it. You can see they put a tiny bit on there but I asked for extra sauce and it was bare. If I had time, I would have had them remake it but since I didn't have an extra 20min to sit there, I just asked for extra sauce on the side so I could make it right myself. Wasn't the same though and didn't taste good. The other pizza did not taste how it normally did- it tasted \"off\" according to my husband. Needless to say, we ended up wasting $30+ that night. We will NOT be wasting money here again."}
{"text":"they make their own cream soda. now how can you not like a place that makes their own soda. every time i go here its a blast. the only food i have had is the pizzas and so far there is not one i dislike. i really like hanging out relaxing and watching the sports on the tvs with good friends here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Great atmosphere and food. The parmesana crusted chicken is the best! I like that i can see all the sports games."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service. Boy does that make such a difference. Friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive. 

 We did happy hour. I had a flight of their house beers. Really liked their Hefeweizen; crisp and tasty. 

We had the wings buffalo style M with blue cheese sub for ranch. My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too. 

I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was. Really thick with the meat. 

Again bartenders Edith and Corey were outstanding. If we lived near by I would come back just for their service."}
{"text":"Can't say anything bad about the place. The food is okay. I brought my daughter with some of her friends there after the movies. They ordered chicken strips, French dip, burgers, and a big cookie desert.

They seemed to enjoy the meal. It was a good place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"My dad loves coming to BJ's restaurant when he visits from Michigan. Today I decided to try something new, garlic Parmesan wings... And I am very happy I did. They were delicious and I got 10 of them! My father had the mahi mahi and was very pleased with it as well. I love that no matter what I eat, it's always amazing!"}
{"text":"Decided to go last minute for dinner. Got sat immediately and with a friendly greeting by Michael. My daughter ordered her favorite:  mini corn dogs and fresh fruit - always great! I ordered the Enlightened Mediterranean Chicken Tacos. These were delicious! Michael was a great server and we look forward to coming back again. Highly recommend BJ's - always delicious food and great service! AND it was FREE pizookie night!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Order was messed up...son ordered prime rib dip...he got a Turkey dip...still charged us. Long wait for any food to come out and horribly over priced. Waitress was pleasant... only plus of this visit.  On a side note, what is the one garlic knot and 3 slices of strawberries for a table of four about? We make these same garlic knots at home. They are in the freezer case at Frys."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because my photos reminded me of what we ordered. The honey sriracha brussel sprouts were delicious and I recommend if you love vegetables like I do! I didn't notice much heat from the sriracha, but they were still very good. Husband enjoyed the blue cheese burger. The quinoa dish I had was just okay and I'd get something else next time. 
The atmosphere felt like other similar chain restaurants to me. The food menu is huge with lots of beer options as well. Very busy when we were there early afternoon on a Saturday but we were seated and served quickly. 
Prices average, about $40 for lunch for 2 including a couple beers, not including tip. Would come back if in the area with others who want to check it out."}
{"text":"My friends and I came into BJ's tonight only expecting an ordinary girls dinner, but our waiter Darin Klein, quickly turned it into an unforgettable visit. He was extremely friendly and even took the time out to help each of us find a dish that we would enjoy by making awesome suggestions. He was also very attentive and constantly checked on us throughout our meal. Thank you Darin for making my friends and I feel so welcomed! I will definitely request him for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I'm usually happy with my meal and service at BJ's. However this time around I was quite disappointed with the SERVICE, the food was still great! Our server wasn't attentive to us or any of his tables. I started to notice he would just disappear and not check on his section as often as the other servers would check on their tables. It was worse when we ran out of water at our table and it took 5 minutes for him to approach our table and another 10 for him to loop back around to us to refill our waters. This wouldn't have been that bad if we hadn't watched him grab the water container, walk past us refill waters for another table and then just disappear again. I'm disappointed with the service, I haven't had an experience like this in a while and I sure hope BJ's can step up service."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten at Bj's. I love the Blonde beer. The last time I found hair in my food and the service was great.

Yesterday we were there for an early dinner. We grabbed some calamari, avocado egg rolls and the sampler. Then 2 mini pizza's. Everything was excellent! Especially the service! I will be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"This was our first time at BJs. Four adults and 3 children ( 2 of them being 7 years old) for dinner today. They were busy, but we only waited a short time to get a seat. Once we were seated, we waited about 15 minutes for a waitress to come and take our drink order, then another 15 minutes for them to come. We each ordered a beer and were then asked for our IDs. With 3 older kids at our table the waitress stood there and scanned every detail of each of our IDs (mind you, we are all in our 30s with children). After trying to order chips and dip for appetizer, the waitress returned, much later, to tell us they were out of them. After our appetizers came we had to flag the waitress down and ask her if we could order, at this point we had already been there an hour! She finally took our order and then returned 3 separate times to tell us that they were out of the things we had ordered! Refills were never offered or given and we had to ask for dirty plates to be removed. I ordered the slider burgers with fries. The burgers were thin chip-like burgers that were burnt. I asked the waitress if they were supposed to come with grilled onions like the menu said and she stated they were in the patty. I found ONE onion in one out of 4 burgers! No apologies for the terrible food and service. The service was absolutely unacceptable, and 2 hours for dinner is outrageous especially when you're trying to entertain kids! We will certainly NOT be returning!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Nice ambiance, okay food, good beer on tap. We went for reverse happy hour ($2 off of shareable apps, half off pizza). We tried the avocado egg rolls, ahi poke, and nachos. The egg rolls were pretty good but everything else was okay."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is pretty nice for a weekend dinner. The massive TVs always have a good game on to watch. The food is pretty good but not amazing. The pasta was decent. The pizza is there area they shine."}
{"text":"allot of brews great selection prices are good too good is kinda pricy for what it is but the service needs allot of improvement. we first asked for a high top at bar area it was dirty the hostess said they would clean it they didn't we ended up sitting at bar 15 mins later!! ordered first round no problem asked for second round waited 30 mins with hardly anyone at the bar and then had to remind bartender of the drinks then ordered food at time if receiving second round of drinks then 30 mins later asked what i wanted to eat after i placed order 30 mins before this never putting it in... service is terrible needs to be improved and the garbage can in front of the place over flowing with garbage .. that should of been a warning sign when we first got there!  this place is new but staff is lazy! go else where!!! i will never go there again! all this and we spent $70 here.. terrible !! we have eaten at lower class places with 100% better service and much lower prices"}
{"text":"A business associate who works in Vegas invited me to dinner on a Thursday night.  Since he lives and works in this city, he didn't want to go anywhere particularly touristy, so he brought me here to this restaurant, which is about 5 miles away from the strip.

BJ's is a national chain restaurant and microbrewery which is a bit like Gordon Biersch, but BJ's features a few more comfort foods on their menu and it has more of a family restaurant feel to it.  This restaurant is located in a strip mall-type location where there are several storefronts with bars and restaurants, and I get the feeling this must be mecca for many locals, as the parking lot of the entire complex was packed on this night, and we had to wait 20 - 25 minutes for a table for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday.

I tried their Pumpkin Ale (one of my favorite fall beverages) and was a fan.  For our meal we shared an order of their Ahi Poke which was delicious and really hit the spot since I was very hungry.  For dinner, my friend had the chicken fried steak, and on his suggestion I had the old fashioned pot roast which was served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and veggies.

Everything I had was excellent, service on this night was very good aside from one slip up (they only gave us one set of cutlery and it was difficult to find a service staff to get a second set).  I'd like to return to one of their locations at some point to try more of their other microwbrews."}
{"text":"The restaurant seemed to be clean and there was no wait time to be seated on a busy afternoon. The menu for food and beverages is extensive with suggested pairings. The prices seemed to be very reasonable. I ordered the black and blue-house burger and it was absolutely wonderful. They also give you a ton of fries with your order. The people next to us had a problem with their food order and the manager came out and fixed the problem right away. I look forward to returning to try other items."}
{"text":"I have gone to this specific location three times and have never had any concerns. The food is always fast and no matter which waiter/waitress you get you can expect to receive great customer service. They all know the menu and the sizes of all the items which makes it really nice if you have questions on what to eat. Even when they are busy the wait time is never over 5 minutes. I will always recommend this location to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, the food is good. The restaurant is clean and there is a variety of beer. We had the quinoa salad with shrimp and the Mediterranean chicken pita taco's. all of it was good. The beer menu gives a bitterness scale, the higher the number the more biter. We will be back here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Yesterday we had the most exceptional lunch . My sister and I joined our parents who are loyalty customers. We know the menu well and know we'll always have great food and an ice cold draft beer. But it was our server, Grant who made our day. His service, knowledge and recommendations of food and beer and kick ass personality were second to none. We asked about the star pin he was wearing and were not surprised he'd received it. Not long before this guy is a five star General!"}
{"text":"Bad!  And by bad I mean the food is good, the service is horrid. 

Thankfully our waiter, I forget his name, was great. He had a great personality. 

Front desk, needs major work. In fact just hire new people. We walk in, and are told a 15min wait. Then we stand off to the side right next to the front desk and never move!  I look out at the tables and I am seeing 4 empty tables that people got up from. At the front desk I see 4 girls and a guy all talking or on their phones. 45 minutes later, I ask how much longer. They tell me they already called me. I'm sorry?  I'm standing 3 feet away from the desk and I was never called. Not to mention the vibrating pager thing never went off. 

After that, it takes about 10min to even get contacted by our waiter. I knew every course I wanted for this meal and didn't even get my drink order taken. Food also came out extremely slow. Yes they had people in the building but it wasn't packed where these long wait times could be justified. So something is wrong in the kitchen

Two stars just because our waiter had a great personality, one star otherwise."}
{"text":"Good chain restaurant with good brews. I had their house brand Tempest IPA (not on the menu) and I enjoyed it. Everything we ate was tasty and the service was great. I'd probably rate this place 3.5 stars, but since I have to choose, I'm leaning towards \"A-OK\" rather than the 4-star \"I'm a fan\" option."}
{"text":"I should finally finish this review I started a while ago. In short, BJ's is a good chain restaurant with good brews. If you like IPAs, I recommend their Tempest IPA, which isn't on the menu. Secret IPA for the win!

The last time I was there, it was for the World Cup 2010 Final. We chose this venue because our buddy had $70 in gift cards. It's really not the best spot to watch sports, but it served its purpose.

On this visit, I ordered their Jambalaya. I wasn't completely sold on it. I don't mind spicy, but this one was to the point of barely tasting the dish. In the past, I've had their deep dish pizza. I remember it being pretty good."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday night.  Friend had gift certificate, or I probably would not really go out of my way to visit a fun 90's style \"brewpub/eatery\".

We were seated promptly and the interior was cavernous, nice, and not overly loud, despite being nearly full.

Appetizers:  Our party ordered chicken wings for an appetizer.  Sauces were excellent and wings had good flavor.  The wings themselves were somehow undercooked.  The meat was done, but the skin wasn't crispy and the insides had too much fat.

Meals: 1 BJ's burger ordered rare & delivered... rare - good job.  Flavor was good but the burger could have used some additional toppings (or at least ask me \"do you need anything to adorn that plain-looking burger?\")  2 fish tacos - these were pretty good per the diners.  1 club sandwich - also good.  

Drinks: Great selection of drinks and our party sampled the porter, a crisp apple cider, and the BJ's-brewed root beer, among other beverages.

Dessert: Pozzati.  Chocolate ice cream on a brownie-cookie served in a little pan warm.  Very good.  Not what we ordered, but tasty.

Service: got a trainee+trainer combo who did make some mistakes that were not caught by the trainer.  Drinks sat empty for long stretches of time while these two talked earnestly about 20 feet away, never glancing at their tables.  Also, wrong dessert was brought by rookie - o well, it was good!

I don't love the genre, so reviewer bias is admittedly costing this place part of a star just because it's another brewpub with an unfortunate name.  A full star is deducted because service should be twice as good with 2 servers.  Instead, it was only about half as good as it should have been.

Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"Slow service and cold nachos. I did like the seasonal Red Beer but the food and service were disappointing. My family has been conning here for years and while the food was never amazing, it was consistent and what I expected. This time food and service was both poor. We waited for ever the check and finally had to grab someone after ten minutes of not seeing our server again. Next time I'll just have the beer."}
{"text":"Fun spot near great shopping!! The food was good, lots to choose from! We liked the lunch specials. The chicken club was great & loved the wedge salad!"}
{"text":"First I must say, we have been to BJ's restaurants previously, but tonight was the best experience ever and it was due to our server, Courtney. She made the night wonderful and full of fun!  She was very attentive and engaging and because of her, we will be back.  The food was very good, we had the fish and chips, bacon guacamole burger, chicken dinner and a half and half pizza.   For dessert, we had the mini triple combo pizookie and everything was excellent and the beer selection is awesome!  Great place to sit and visit with family and friends.  Great parking and convenient location right off the 215 and Charleston."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place now mediocre. Tonight went there and dined outside. Was seated at a dirty table and server named rick cleaned table with a napkin and was filthy and we made him get a rag. He finally did. We ordered and never was asked if we wanted a drink. Pizza came and was terrible and had to be sent back. Service from Rick was awful and food was terrible. This place has gone down."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants of all time!! The people are fantastic! Customers and staff are so friendly!!! Food is out of this world amazing! I'd give 10 stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to BJ's on Eastern. So I decided to have lunch Saturday with my little girl. I told the waitress my daughter has food allergies and she should alert the cook. I also asked if there was going to be a problem? She said no. Then 20 mins passed, wasn't sure how much longer it was going to be? The waitress said it shouldn't be long. Our food finally arrived. They didn't modify my daughter's order like they should...I was heated. It took forever and my daughter was hungry. The runner told me there wasn't a allergy alert on the ticket. I asked for a manager. She came and apologized and told me there was a allergy alert on the ticket. Idk who's lying here. The waitress already lied to me about not having a problem. The manager came back 10mins later with the correct order. By then my lunch was cold. I had the chicken with rice pilaf and it didn't taste good. Had a few bites and I was done. Not going back again. Not a place for people with food allergies, the wait time is long, and the food was meh."}
{"text":"Have had lunch or dinner here several times and find the food very good. The service can be overwhelming at times. We were asked if we needed to go boxes not half way through our dinner. I finally had to shoo the waitress away. Their IPA is very good. All pizzas, burgers and fish dishes were very good. A great go to place in the area. I have always gone with family during the day or early evening but the bar looks like it could be a great place to go as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really good food with a great variety on the menu. The healthy options are good, but the best thing is definitely the pizookie. Warm and gooey deep dish cookie topped with ice cream melting all over? It's even better than it sounds. Trust me, the pizookie does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away, but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza. 

I'll update the next time I am out there, but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games."}
{"text":"My husband and I decide to have lunch at BJ Centennial Hills today, worse experience every.  First 2 gentlemen ahead of us were told by the hostess that it would be a minute or 2 and they would get a table, we were standing right behind them waiting and the hostess took our name and told us it would be 5 or 10 minutes before we got a table. The hostess escorted the 2 men to their table came back to her work station and answered the phone then told us there was a table in the bar area available and we would get our menus once we sat down. As we were sitting down another couple followed us and sat at the table behind us.  
 1) We mention to the serve that the table was wet, she gave some excuse that It was just clean off, that was not what we were asking, we want the table dried off.
2) We were seated before the table that was behind us in the bar section, but our server went to that table and took their complete food and drink order. We stopped the waitress and questioned do they take the order by when you are seated, she said that is how it is done, we then informed our waitress that we were seated first, and she offered us an apology but did not ask if we wanted to order.  It so happens they were white; the waitress was white and of course we're black. We decided not to order lunch there but to go somewhere else were the only color that matters is green. 
Is the way BJ restaurant conducts business they pick and choose who they take orders from if you are not of the WHITE race your order is taken second to them!!  I work in a customer service business, BJ your service is bad."}
{"text":"Not sure who wrote that first review but they may be an employee of BJ's.
Hope the management is reading this because the one thing that guy had right was 'getting into the swing of things.' Service was a train wreck! Let me say it was not the front end waitresses' fault. We waited a half an hour for our food. And it was appetizers? The food they brought out tasted more like bar food. C'mon guys, get it together! Were you just in a hurry to get the place open? Where is the Yard House in the Northwest?"}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere, decent food, great dessert!

I went on a Saturday afternoon right before the dinner rush. Our server was phenomenal. He said it was his last day so unfortunately I can't direct patrons to his section, but even the managers were great. We were asked how our service and our food was twice while we were there and we has nothing but praise during our lunch. 
The California Chicken Sandwich was alright, but too greasy for my own liking. The wedge fries were good though and the sangria was tasty. I shared the red velvet pizookie with my friend and it was phenomenal. It was perfect for 2 to share and I highly recommend it!
I've been to BJ's plenty of times but this was the first time at this location and so far  it's definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. I've been to BJ's many times in the past, and the service has been a little slow. I didn't pay to much mind to it, as they were always busy. Today was different. I decided to take my mom to lunch and chose BJ'S. We were seated within a few minutes and got our orders ready. 10 minutes later, no waiter. 15 minutes, still no waiter. A new group was seated by us and they were served almost immediately by another waiter. After 25 minutes of nobody coming once to even get our drink order we got our menus, dropped them off at the front desk, and left. This was the first time in my life I've walked out of a restaurant. They definitely need to work on service. A lot."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been to that location at least four times, the first time was great, food and service was wonderful.  The three other times we have been there for dinner the service was terrible, food came out cold.  Please don't think about sending the food back because it is okay for them to pop it in the microwave, nuke it and bring it back out.  15min = 30min//30min = 45min - 1 hr.  The hostesses don't mind sitting their friends  that come in before anyone else.  The manager is a complete waste of space and time.  She has more excesses than a politician.  I would not suggest to anyone even my worst enemy to go to that restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday Party with /0 kids and about 20 grownups!!

Big and noisy crowd....
Service was amazing!!! 
Food was BJ so u get ur dollars worth.
But the team work and efficiency of the staff was amazing!"}
{"text":"10 minutes until a waiter came to our table, and not busy at the time. Server was nice...steak was horrific! Pizza and the chicken on the other hand...really good. But nothing special. I would come back, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I gave a 3 star rating because I've eaten there a few times and the food and beer has always been very good but I have found their wait staff very poor. The waiter this last time was very attentive but forgot things the servers were very surley bordering on mean we did not get our silverware till after our food arrived. I don't  usually write reviews but i felt that i needed to being that I had another poor experience with staff at BJ's. I wiil eat there again I just hope the staff improves."}
{"text":"#1 in over-priced mediocre food. Our family waited 20 minutes for a table that we knew was already open but needed cleaned up. Instead of just clearing the table, they asked us 3 separate times if we sure we couldn't just sit at the bar. Once we finally sat down, the wait staff put on an ignorant and sluggish performance. They also struggled to deliver drinks and food to the correct customers. We've been here about 5 times since it opened hoping the service would get better as they matured, but no such luck. Fortunately, there are many other good restaurants near by."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS : Very Good

   The second best part about hiking is what happens after the hike. That is the tradition of the post-hike supper. A few weeks ago after my brother and I hiked on the Cathedral Rock Trail, this very B.J's served our post-hike supper. 

  Dining out in B.J's made sense. Earlier this year following Norm K's Hike at the Potato Knolls, my Yelp friend Rob. W and myself went to their Summerlin location for a post-hike lunch. As my review implied, I enjoyed their jalapeño burger and the experience. Now I was returning to their second of three Las Vegas locations. 

   When my brother and I pulled into the parking lot, we saw that it was nearly filled up with cars. We walked into the restaurant expecting a wait. That wasn't the case because this large restaurant /brew pub accommodates a lot of people. When we walked in the woman at the podium pointed toward the back of the restaurant where we sat ourselves at a booth. Walking toward the booth in this urban style restaurant, we walked alongside the bar to the right and a room of tables to the left. What is unique is that there were zero signs of gaming. On the other hand there were signs of drinking. At the back wall I saw their microbrewery barrels. It is my understanding that B.J's is the recipient of many awards for their beer. Anyhow, we were here for the grub. 

   A few minutes after sitting down, our waitress introduced herself and soon returned with my glass of Coke. If you are a cola fan like myself they also serve black cherry cola and other unique flavors. At this point in the review, I will summarize the service as being good for a busy restaurant. 

  Just like the time I visited the B.J's in Summerlin, it was a slight challenge deciding what to eat. Then I laid eyes on their brand new Triple Decker ($11.25). 

  B.J's picked a winner with the Triple Decker. I was impressed. The sandwich bread was a hoagie. Within the hoagie were sliced roast beef, turkey, ham, and Swiss cheese. Complimenting the cold cuts were lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes, Italian dressing, and mustard. Finally, on top of the hoagie were a couple of sliced pickles. The pictures below this review supports the fact that the Triple Decker was loaded with cold cuts. 

  In reality, this is really a Quadruple Decker. I say this because B.J's gives customers the choice of regular fries or potato wedges. I am a fan of potato wedges. The Potato wedges adjacent to the Triple decker tasted very good. Kudos to B.J's for offering the choice of potato wedges or fries. 

  In conclusion, B.J's was a very good choice after hiking on the Cathedral Rock Trail. I give it my 3.5 STARS stamp of approval."}
{"text":"The neat thing about hiking is that after burning all those calories, there is the guilty free post-hike meal. After hiking on the UYE: Hike at the Potato Knoll, I joined up with Robert. W for a post hike meal at BJ's. It was a hop and a skip northeast on State Route 159.

  At 11:20 am, the parking lot, which is at the northwest corner of Route 159/Charleston at Pavilion Center across from Red Rock Resort was nearly full. That is a good sign. 

  Robert. W and myself sat toward the back of the restaurant where they have the microbrewery. My first impression was olfactory. There was a delicious smell permeating the restaurant. And we chatted and chatted. But when we chatted we were looking at a table minus menus. Where was the server? It seemed like we had spent an equivalent amount of time hiking from the Route 159 parking lot to the Potato Knoll until our waitress came on the scene. She half-apologized stating that she just started. \"Humm,\" I thought to myself, \"what about the servers who had been passing us with no sign of acknowledgement?\" 

   After the waitress handed us our menus, it was difficult making a decision. This is one of those restaurants that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was in a lunch mood. Decisions! Decisions! Should I go for the roast beef? The chicken club? The portobello Swiss? I finally decided on the crispy jalapeño burger. After a 4.5 mile hike, there was no guilt chowing down this 1,350 calorie burger. The waitress never hurried us, and let me take my time choosing the sandwich. Between the time of ordering til the food reached the table, the waitress handed us our drinks. Regardless that this is a restaurant and microbrewery, I went for a Pepsi. 

  The crispy jalapeño burger was delicious but not exceptional delicious like the Spicy Miso Burger I ate in Bachi Burger last Sunday. The thick burger was topped with the right ingredients: housemate guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapeños. Equally as delicious as the crispy jalapeño burger was the potato wedges. This burger that is $11 and change includes either string fries or potato wedges. I favor potato wedges over string fries. These were tasty potato wedges. I felt that they could of filled the plate a bit more with the potato wedges. 

   BJ's was a good choice for the post-hike meal. Robert got to enjoy breakfast and I got to enjoy lunch. Based on this experience, I will Yelp out that BJ's serves good food but needs improvement in service. If I was alone, I would of walked out and reviewed it 2 stars."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Much better than I expected based on the reviews.

My boyfriend and I came here on our cheat day and decided to go all out with drinks, the app combo, meals, and a pizookie. The server told us that if we signed up for the app, we get a free pizookie. We decided to sign up for the app but it turned out that only mini pizookies were in the special. He apologized and it's not a big deal, we probably wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't advertised to us though. Super delicious!"}
{"text":"We meet at BJ's a lot after work. Food is good and their selection of draft beers is huge. 
I belong to their points club, just got a free dinner. Nice perk.
The bartenders are well educated which helps when wanting to try a new pour."}
{"text":"Went out with the husband for a date night. While we had to wait a while to get seated it was definitely worth it. Started our meal with the Piranha chili nachos and those were kinda eh. But ordered the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza and it was amazing. Subbed the celery for tomatoes on it though. Root beer is super good and husband was also very pleased with his fish and chips. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We were a party of 9 and we ordered all our food, it took a little while, half of us got our food then a minute later the rest of us were served.  About half of our plates were not hot enough so the waiter apologized and got the manager. Nicki the GM gave us to go boxes for that food, cooked all new food and served it hot.  She was very apologetic, comped all our food and gave us gift cards for a future visit.  Although we had some problems the staff and Nicki made everything right and then some.  I'm from out of town and when I come back I will definitely go back!!! Plus the food was delicious"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Delicious veggie pizza."}
{"text":"One of mine and my wife's favorite places to eat. They have a really big selection so I'm always having something different every time I go. I also haven't been disappointed by anything I've tried. Gotta love there dessert pazooki too baked cookie with ice cream sooooo good. I have to say there Jerimah Red brew that they have on tap is one of my favorites to get as well. All around really good place for a dinner date or casual dining you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The menu is massive.   Great atmosphere and very clean restaurant.  I ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan.   The chicken Parmesan was very tasty but just not enough of the sauce on the plate.    The chicken tortilla soup was fantastic!   However, I did not care for the house Italian dressing.  It was too vinegary for my taste.    The ranch dressing was much better!   A little pricy."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good, but when you use fresh jalapenos on something use them sparingly!  Went there for lunch yesterday and while they seemed staffed service was slow. At one point it took 10 min to get a refill on water!"}
{"text":"Menu is extensive. I recommend the flat breads. Beer options are impressive. Desserts are phenomenal- pizzookki?!?! Please excuse my spelling  but the smore  one is one of the best things on this planet. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Love the chicken flatbread. Extensive beer and food menus. The pizookie is phenomenal-get the s'mores one. I believe they are discounted after a certain time in the evening. They offer a variety of seating options for small and large groups!"}
{"text":"Loved it ! appetizers were great tried the sampler. Also I ordered the shrimp scampi primeria (I know that is not the right spelling) But I had so much  had to get a to go box. It was great I will be going back"}
{"text":"I went to BJs for the first time for a dinner with some old co-workers.  I read the reviews before I went so I had an idea of some of the areas where I might have problems.  I am happy to say that my experience was a good  one.  It was a Sunday evening so that might have helped since it was not very crowded.  The weather was nice so our group of 5 sat on the  patio.  The service we received was very good.  He was attentive and funny.  Also was helpful deciding what to order from the enormous menu.  I had their Pumpkin Ale.  It was decent.  I liked it better than Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale since I could actually taste hints of spices.  I will definitely try other varieties of their own brews when I return.  Two of the other girls in my group went for the root beer.  I tasted it and it was good but I'm not enough of an expert to say it was any different than A&W in a can.  The other two had mixed drinks and found them to be a bit pricey - $9 for a frozen mixed drink?  The table started with chips and salsa.  Nothing special there at all.  I would pass on that in the future.  I ended up having the steak salad and it was very good.  I liked the touch of the roasted potatoes.   All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often.  If they had a reverse happy hour like Gordon Biersch I could see myself going more, but due to the price I will save trips here for special treats or during their happy hour in the day."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to get to bj's. I ordered take out and was extremely disappointed when I got my pizza. The pizza was dry and the cheese was over done. There is no way this pizza would have made it on the menu because it looked nothing like the pictures. Someone just threw this thing together. I was starving and the place was packed and I didn't feel like waiting for them to fix it. Not the best experience to say the least!!"}
{"text":"Friday night we hit up BJ's Brew House. Sometimes you just need a beer. We arrived around 6PM and put our name in. We were told it would be about an hour wait. No problem.

We headed to the bar and ended up standing and having a beer until a seat had opened up at the bar. We ended up just staying at the bar and eating as we were both hungry and generally just wanted to unwind.

I had the Tatonka Stout which was a really nice beer. BJ's brews a pretty solid dark beer that's actually not overly bitter, but still has some flavor. 

For an appetizer we shared some of the boneless wings. Theirs are actually pretty good and not over cooked. Sometimes restaurants just fry the life out of them. 

By then we were on our second round of beers, and I had their other dark beer the the Nutty Brewnette which is pretty damn refreshing for a dark ale. 

We ended up sharing a medium BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Everything on the pizza was great. Crust tasted good, veggies were fresh, wasn't greasy at all, but it was dry. Dry as a bone. It was desperately in need of some sauce. It wasn't as good as the pizza we'd had there when they first opened, but it was okay.

We ended up having another drink and headed home after that. Would I return to BJ's for a drink and food? Sure. We had a good time. I'd just make sure I asked for a little extra sauce on the pizza next time.

By the time we were leaving, about an hour and a half after we'd got there I'd received a text stating our table was ready. So if you plan to check it out, plan to wait."}
{"text":"Booooo went here today for a lunch meeting and my salad was gross! It was water logged and brown.. besides I asked for NO honey mustard on my salad and ranch instead... well when i started eating my salad they did the mistake of adding honey mustard and instead of making a new salad to correct their mistake they dosed it in ranch which made it even more soggy.. disappointed for sure!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their $4 beers! Ordered calamari and artichoke dips both were really great but my mahi mahi tacos were just ok. The service was pretty good and their were plenty of tvs to watch the game."}
{"text":"Another place that won't make a commitment! Are they a NOLA style restaurant? Are they mexican? A pizza place?  Who knows?  Unfortunately when you try to do everything nothing is done well.  The food was mediocre, service was normal.  Won't be back.  Burgers are about 13.00 as are sandwiches.  They were out of the entree specials which were a slice of prime rib for 26$ or a pork chop for 17-19$."}
{"text":"Great food and beer are a great combo!!

Best chicken dish I have ever had is their parm crusted chicken!! 

Caesar salad is always fresh and huge portion

Pair it with a Piranha Ale!!

We go atleast once a month!"}
{"text":"We had a super wonderful dining experience on Easter Sunday 2016 when our party was given impeccable service by Nicole B. Can't thank you enough. It was Great!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Monday night. It wasn't too terribly packed but BJ's is always poppin no matter what time you come in. 

My bf and I were greeted as soon as we came in & directed to our party. There were 11 of us at the table and were seated all the way to the right of the restaurant. Since it was happy hour, the bf ordered bone in chicken wings (buffalo something & garlic parm) with fries & I ordered the Alfredo pasta with shrimp instead of chicken. The wings were pretty good, we should've ordered it extra crispy or something. I prefer my wings with more of a crunch. The garlic parm was a little too saucy for me but the bf enjoyed both flavors. The thin cut fries are always a good choice! My pasta was super good! The portion was huge so I could only eat half & saved the other half for lunch the next day. I shared a salted caramel pizookie with a friend and maaaan, it was delicious! I loved the entire meal. 

Service was okay. It actually wasn't great. I'm not sure if it was cos we had a large party or what. The guy hardly ever came around to our table. I asked for a refill for my water & never got one. He just didn't seem like he wanted to serve our table, honestly. So deducted one star for service."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of BJ's since I moved to Vegas, and the Henderson location in particular. There are a couple of things that keep me coming back. 1: Fast curbside pickup. Pull in, call the number on the sign, and they bring your food right to you. 2: Santa Fe Spring Rolls...YUM! 3: Avocado Egg Rolls are ordered every time, and are always good. 4: Mediterranean Pizza. It's a taste that's not for everyone but if you love Kalamata olives like I do, you know what you want and this is a good place to get it. 

Inside service can be hit or miss so we just order it to go so we can sit at home and watch Netflix without having to put up with a lot of extra noise, or watch a good game without sound which I don't like doing. 4 Stars...yeah, it's been awhile since I did my last review but 4 years later I'm still going back, and it's still good."}
{"text":"There are hundreds of place one can go in Las Vegas and have lunch in under an hour. This BJ's location is not one of them. When it takes 13 minutes to order a Coke or iced tea, then after another 15 minutes nobody has bothered to even stop by and ask if you wanted to order anything to actually eat, that's a problem. It shows that the staff and management is not in tune with their customer's needs, and after 35 minutes of only seeing one server at our table I got up and left. 

Thankfully there was a Taco Bell down the street that even with 7 cars stacked up in the drive through was able to get me in and out in under 10 minutes. I took someone out for lunch intending to give them a nice change from their lunch routine but the inattentive staff at this BJ's location ruined that idea. 

1 Star. There's really no excuse for this kind of stupidity by the management team."}
{"text":"Me and the wife went here for a
Lunch/dinner date. The food was okay but the craft brews were awesome. This place is a little expensive for what you get but overall  good."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant four times since opening.  I am a huge fan of B.J.'s Brewhouse but this restaurant has some serious problems.
Visit 1 - 2 people ordered veggie burgers.  Both were given turkey burgers even though veggie burgers had been rung in by the server
Visit 2 was fine.
Visit 3 - one person's order was never rung in
Visit 4 - back to the turkey burger instead of veggie burger problem again.

These were all lunch times so three of the four times people left with takeout food instead of eating in the restaurant even after being there for an hour."}
{"text":"I take my family and friends here once a week to eat dinner or sometime lunch. I don't have any complains on the food because the foods that I order are good even my wife & kids love the place."}
{"text":"There is no excuse in the world for giving a party of three a 40 min wait time estimate and then the actual time being seated is 85 min. Oh and did I mention I made my reservation before arriving on their \"Preferred Waitlist\" through their app? No apologies, no trying to update us on how much longer it really was going to be (always \"You're at the top of the list!\" \"Not much longer now!\") with a surly and annoyed attitude to boot.  I understand why people continue to eat here because of the \"restaurant desert\" that the Pittsburgh South Hill is but there is no mediocre food in the world that is worth that kind of wait. While the draft selection is large and the waitstaff is consistently nice, the front of house host staff could have cared less about our waiting for over an hour and seemed annoyed to be so busy. As to the food, imagine yourself at any casual chain restaurant: Houlihan's, Red Robin, Applebee's... now you got a pretty good take on the food: it's nothing special. IF we go back it will be because we're in a bind or hosting guests with suburban tastes and a lack of food imagination. Yawn."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that Jeff, our server, is what saved this review from being a 1.  I was sorely disappointed by the hostess that greeted us. She was flippant and unprofessional- not a great representation of what I'm sure BJ's would expect your experience to be upon entering their restaurant.   Fast forward to being seated (after a 10-minute wait that the hostess said would be a 25-minute wait).  Jeff promptly arrived, introduced himself and took awesome care of us from beginning to end.  So he gets 5-stars, hands down!"}
{"text":"Always love BJ's!!!  Order something different every time and it is always excellent!!!  Tonight, out waitress is Beth!  Very efficient in a super busy atmosphere but gave us perfect attention and perfect advice.  I usually order the same items, but here at BJ's, I try something different each time!  They also have excellent craft beers with the Jeremiah Red being my fav!!!  Thank you BETH!"}
{"text":"Was in for an early dinner today.  Been awhile since we have been here. Very impressed with quality of food AND service we received. Got the loaded potato skins and Margherita pizza was very good. Whole family really enjoyed their meals. Best part was our server Jared B. extremely attentive, friendly and went above and beyond for us. In a service town like Vegas it's so nice when you get A1 service!"}
{"text":"We were passing thru Mentor on a working road trip and noticed, then yelped BJ'S brew house. The parking lot was very busy 7 pm wed night, and yelp reviews sounded good. We sat at the bar, preferred seating for us. While waited a few minutes for empty seats, (never a problem for us to wait for seats at a busy bar) a lovely hostess offered us no fewer than 3 tables so we didn't have to wait.
We got seats and Jackie was our bartender, she was VERY busy, but totally on point. She recommended the BJ's brews and offered samples of any we'll like to try. My boyfriend had a stout ( BJ'S stout... don't remember the name) he liked it. My skinny Margarita was very yummy. He switched to the Nutty Brewnette, it was very good. We had ribs and the ribeye, and shared. Steak was cooked perfectly, ribs were yummy. All the sides were good. 
Service was awesome!!! Then Jackie said they've only been there for 3 weeks. What?!? Great job BJ'S brew house!! Keep it up"}
{"text":"First, this place has a great beer list. 
Second, the food was above average, but nothing spectacular. We started with the chicken pot stickers, and though they were good, the portions were very small for the price. 
We had the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. This was also pretty good, but not worth the price. The crust is excellent, but the buffalo chicken was pretty bland. 
Service was below average. It took at least 10 minutes just to be asked if we wanted a drink. My wife had the watermelon mojito and loved it. I had a limited release Stone IPA that was blended with a BJs beer. It was unique and was good. 
We asked for a side of ranch that took about 20 minutes to show up. 
Not sure if we'll come back. Maybe for a drink."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I ordered a Brewhouse Burger, which, according to the menu comes with sauteed onions. I asked for \"no tomato, instead more sauteed onions\". A reasonable request I'd think. Well, the Burger came WITH tomato and NO sauteed onions. Well, no problem one would think.... I pointed it out to the waiter. He told me that the onions are on there.... Seriously? I took the burger apart in front of him: not a single onion. He still insisted they are on there! Ok, called for the original waitress, she also told me that the onions are on there. I am not so sure what that is all about - 2 people starring at at burger with no  onions tell me that there are onions on there. I asked for the manager. He immediatley started telling me that there are onions on the burger. (which they had already taken). To sum that joke up. 3 people were calling me either stupid or a liar even though the evidence was RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES.
No words of excuse - the waitress put on a big ol fake smile like she is laughing about me. 

The beer took  15 minutes. Unacceptable. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I come here way too often with my family and friends. You could literally be in the mood for anything and go here. The menu is a tad too big for me, but if you can't decide what you want to eat when choosing a restaurant, you can choose from the huge selection they have. I stick to the few things I know I like here and don't worry about the rest of the menu. Food is pretty good, nothing to rave about, but it's better than most restaurants out there. The best dish I've had was a pulled pork burger as those are my two of my favorite foods put together. Would probably still go with a real barbecue place, but this sufficed for my hamburger craving. My favorite part is the pizzokies, though. They have so many different flavors in which I still have some to try, but the awesome thing is they have a pizookie the size of a large pizza. I had this one time with a group of friends for someone's birthday and with seven of us we couldn't even finish it! Definitely a fun experience and let us indulge for the night. If you drink beer, definitely a place for you. Their selection is huge and from what my friends have said the taste is great (I don't like beer so I can't be a contender in tasting). Overall, great place."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my elderly aunt out for lunch today.  Since she requires a wheelchair, I need help with that.  We decided to call BJ'S and ask if they would assist us if we came by.  They couldn't have been more helpful.  The manager had a young man named Carlos come out and assist with the wheelchair.  We had a wonderful lunch.  My aunt had the chicken Alfredo pasta and I had the half California club flatbread pizza and salad.  All were tasty and enough to bring home extra!  Oh, we had the yummy appetizer, fried artichoke too!  Thanks BJ'S  You made my aunt happy and that makes me happy!  We will be back."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here. Highly recommend eating their Parmesan crusted chicken & white chocolate macadamia pizooki!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food all around today. Typically one of my favorite restaurants but today I was served burnt fish and chips, salty and slightly over cooked cheese curds, and the service was just bad. Think I'll find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Beer was good.  Service wasn't horrible but it was slow. Maybe cause there wasn't many customers in the restaurant. Food was alright. Burger was really dry.  I actually had to use a ton of katchup.  Maybe cause my waitress didn't ask how I wanted my burger and they just make it well done. But pazookie was good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Normally when I travel I avoid chains, but decided to go with a tried and true (albeit in another state) restaurant. Bartender was very friendly and attentive, as were the other staff. Good food, good service. Will keep them in mind when I am in town."}
{"text":"Mediterranean tacos are to die for!! Great service, exceptional food. Server Christina was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great brews on tap.  They have a small seating area outside to watch the sunset.  Food is good."}
{"text":"We have been here twice since the restaurant opened.  There were high points and low points to each visit.  On the positive side, the pizzas (both thin and thick) are quite good in our opinion.  On both occasions, we had brussel sprouts that were nice too.  Unfortunately, there were some drawbacks.  On the first visit, multiple beers were unavailable due to temperature issues.  It's great that they want to maintain standards, but it was nonetheless disappointing since it is a brewhouse and a driving factor to try their establishment.  What a let down.  

While on the first visit, our exceptional server (Marissa) mentioned their app which included a waitlist feature.  I downloaded and utilized it for the second trip.  When our info. was entered at 6:28, the app indicated an approximate 40 minute wait.  My wife and I proceeded to check in as instructed with the hostess at approx. 6:55 and were told that we would be seated in approximately 20 minutes.  This, of course, seemed reasonable - especially hearing the party in front of us (also a group of two) were quoted an 80 minute wait time.  Long story short, the waitlist app feature was worthless.  We were not seated until after 8:00.  In fact, the couple in front of us with a quoted wait time of 80 minutes had a table before us!

While the food was good, the front of the house management - specifically related to the waitlist - was below expectations.  I don't know if we will or will not frequent the establishment in the future."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed at BJS tonight .. I never had horrible service here, but today was just not good from the beginning . 

I believe I came in around 830 , maybe 9. Regardless, they close at 11. 

Service starts from the time you enter the restaurant . The hostess said \"hello\" but it was not welcoming at all . I understand the POS is what you use to see who got sat , who's leaving etc, but that screen isn't going anywhere . She honestly did not look up while she asked me \"how many people, or even when she said hello\" til I asked her why I was getting waited 15 min ( bc I needed a high chair and I need a table that wouldn't violate safety measures, understandable). She didn't smile at all . Even people that were leaving the restaurant , she was still looking at the POS and said \"BYE\" . It was very insincere . 

So we waited a little , then we got sat . I think we were the last table this server was gonna have or something? Because we got rushed from the time we sat til we paid out. 

I'm not sure if it's because we look like kids,or bc I wanted to do a BJS special promo , but she treated us with such haste , and didn't really check up on us. 

The only person that was really nice and made conversation was the food runner.  Even though he came around once, he was human and wasn't like a robot doing his job . I understand rush , but it wasn't busy .. 

Regardless of bad service all around , I gave her 10 on 40, which is decent tip. Just want to remind servers , don't judge a book by its cover , don't rush customers , don't assume I'm being cheap bc of the promos you have . 

Please, if your shift is over or if you have to go somewhere , let a customer know, instead of not saying anything and giving me the check when I didn't even get my dessert . Even asking for what dessert I want when I'm still eating my pizza . I would understand more if you told me your shift was ending or something . I didn't expect this type of service here . 

I came here because of a food promo, but mostly because I wanted the delicious pizookie , but it definitely felt like a home that I wasn't welcomed too .. Thanks BJS."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying BJ's Summerlin since I first moved here back in 2006.  They're pretty quick with their service and they always get my order right unlike some other places that seem to forget little details.  When I say no l don't want lettuce on my sandwich, they don't put any on it!  When I ask for condiments on the side, they'll put them on the side!

My favorite item to order there is their California Chicken Sandwich.  I'm not a huge fan of avocado, but the combination of avocado with green chiles and the juiciness of the chicken is just out of this world!

Of course, you can't talk about BJ's without mentioning the Pizzookie!  I can't tell you how many of these I've tried, but it's a lot!  They're just the most delectable dessert in the world!  I cannot stress how good they are!

Best time to go is definitely a little before the lunch rush around 11:30-11:45 AM or later evenings after 7:00 PM."}
{"text":"Great experience and wonderful food and service!  The server was very attentive and we were impressed, that even the manager (Jon the GM) stopped by to make sure we were being well taken care. That never happens anymore at restaurants. We appreciated it and plan on going back again soon.  Super impressed. Great job BJs!"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement I gave this place another chance.  It was the Pizookie that brought me back, but I'm glad it did, because it was a completely different experience this time.

I had the Beachhouse Blonde beer battered fish and chips this time.  it was delicious.  The fish was perfectly fried, light, and not greasy at all.  The fries were crisp and hot.  And our waitress, Taylor, was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.

For dessert, I went with the salted caramel Pizookie.  It was yummy. Some of the caramel got crispy and that gave it a nice little crunch.

I'm glad this trip was better than my first.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Good Beer, Good food; not much more I can ask for.   Have yet to have a bad experience here. I'm a rewards member so it pays off since I visit often.  Can't review much on wait staff as I always sit at the bar top and have great service.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I think the calamari is some of the best I've had and the fish and chips is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I'm sure I will be going back several more times over the coming months.  I've only had a couple of appetizers and a small pizza, and I was fairly pleased.  The avocado egg rolls weren't my cup of tea, but the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza was terrific.  Not what I usually want when I am in the mood for pizza, but I was impressed by the meaty chunks of ground beef and the sauce that is drizzled over the deep dish pie.

But enough about the food. I came here for the beer.  My first time I tried their 7-beer flight.  The Porter and the Tatonka Stout were a little heavy for me, but the red and brown ales were right up my alley.  Some of their brews are STRONG in the alcohol department.  I'll just leave it at that.  What I was most surprised by was the selection of other beers on tap.  Most brewpub-type places only serve their own concoctions, but this place offers options from a wide variety of American microbreweries and foreign brewers.  The selection of tap beers that aren't made on the premises is impressive enough that I would likely want to return to BJ's even if they didn't make their own delicious booze."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate and was met with a wonderful server Sam 5 Star server. Treated us like family, he single handed made our evening a true celebration."}
{"text":"I was looking at yelp at the BJ's restaurant and saw that they had a appetizer special free appetizer with purchase I clicked on it and it was only for Tuesdays and Friday well today was Wednesday so that sucks that's why give it a bad review so there next time make it every day free appetizer with purchase day. I got home and unfortunately the pizza was cold. They also forgot to include a spoon with the soup we had six Forks but where was the spoon really we ordered soup you don't put a spoon in ? When I called the Mgr he was very cool about things and after apologizing he said he would send me a gift card. I'll post whether I get it or not."}
{"text":"Service, especially after normal dinner hours is INCREDIBLY bad/slow/non-existent.

Sadly the happy hour food is 'happy hour sized' which means it's not a deal at all.

No TV sound.

No TVs on patio.

Should have many more TVs behind the bar instead of the stylish but not-functional/useful towers/back-lit shelves of extra liquor bottles. The architect got away with something not in bar-goer's best interests."}
{"text":"They might not allow dogs? I called to ask and the person who answered was not sure, but did express interest in seeing my dog :P.

The menu is HUGE, how people find what they want here is beyond my comprehension. The service was fast and friendly and I was impressed by how well their wait staff utilized technology. When you check in at the host's table they will take your cell number and text you when your table is ready. When you order the server can input your order from a handheld touch screen device and when it's time to pay the server doesn't have to wonder off with your card because they can run them right there at your table! The food was good but the experience was better. I will go back because of the experience."}
{"text":"I was close to giving this a 4-star, but I think the only thing holding me back was the appetizer.

I read tons of yelp reviews before going here with a group outing - and got scared away from the fish. My buddy had the cherry chipotle salmon and said it was great. I didn't want to run the risk of a crappy meal.

I had the buffalo burger, and while the meat and cook were decent enough - what made this dish so good was the barbecue sauce, pico de gallo, and grilled green chiles that were topping it. Seriously, amazing. The cole slaw that came with it was less than desirable haha, but I still a few days later now cannot get over how good the sauce and condiments for that burger were. 

I had the calamari appetizer though, and it was really lack luster. Definitely do not recommend that. It was a good enough for me to be willing to try it again sometime."}
{"text":"I have had the worst luck here lately. It used to be one of my favorite places to go. I always order the sweet pig pizza and used to love it. The last 2 times I've eaten at BJs the dough tasted pre-cooked and reheated and the toppings weren't cooked and the cheese was minimal. We also got the chicken Marsala and it was flavorless and the pasta was stuck together and undercooked. I think I'm done with BJs. The kids menu is great but I can't justify spending $50 on a meal when Pizza Hut is better"}
{"text":"The starter salads served were great, but my friend was served her salad five minutes before my salad came to the table. The bison burger was disappointing. The slaw served with it was terrible. The waitress had little patience with my elderly friend. I have dined at the BJ's in Columbus, Ohio and it is always wonderful. I'm very disappointed with the service and the food and will not be back."}
{"text":"BJ's is great! The menu has a lot of options and the beer's are great as well. I went on a Wednesday and the place was packed. Had to wait for a table for 2 for about 15 minutes but we just went to the bar and got a beer. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the food and service. I frequent about every month or so over the years. Have never had any problems. These days I attend with the family - 2 kids, 2 parents and 2 grandparents."}
{"text":"Arrived around 2:30pm.it took an hour for our food after placing order.we were a family of six.three of us got our food and it was another 15 minutes before the other 3 got theirs.all burgers were ordered well done and two arrived to us barely medium.needless to say after everyone was finished eating, it was yet another 25 minute wait before the last two of the group got their fixed order.the food is ok at best.servers try,but in all,this was not a plea sent experience by any means.this place has too many issues.would not recommend and will not EVER return here."}
{"text":"called the night before to set up a reservation. get there for our time and said our reservation was a \"call ahead\" even though the night before was told \"reservation confirmed\". we waiting about 20 mins to be seated. 
anyways the food, ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and two medium cheeseburger pizzas for the 9 of us. probably only had a couple slices of the pepperoni for us. cheeseburger pizza is NOT on the menu anymore, but they still make it if you request it. i highly recommend the cheeseburger pizza if you are into burgers and pizzas. the pizookies, very very yummy: recommend the regular chocolate chip as well as peanut butter. 
my boyfriend has celiac so he was able to enjoy the gluten free pizza (which may i add, is also delicious) and the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie (also very delicious) i'd eat both!"}
{"text":"Literally their 3rd day being open and this is officially my husband's and my spot! We had the buffalo chicken mini deep dish pizza which was pretty decent for deep dish. The barbecue, buffalo and ranch mixture was interesting and delicious. We also had the new sriracha chicken bacon Mac and cheese which is absolutely a must have, considering the perfectly al dente pasta and perfect proportion of bacon and broccoli. Even more so, the decadent macadamia nut pizookie came highly recommended and is confirmed by this casual couple! Lol! As with any three day open, there were hiccups such as slower service, only one olive in my dirty martini that they couldn't balance on a tray, and a few other  awkward moments. However, the casual yet upscale ambiance of the restaurant is fitting for the area and incredibly welcoming. This chain is definitely recommended and is worth the slightly higher than average pricing."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I would have to say that overall my experiences have been good. The service is normally fast and friendly. They have a menu with a wide variety of cuisine. There is a wide variety of beers available and a good specialty mixed drink selection. I would have to say that the food at times is hit or miss. I tried to deep dish pizza, and it was soggy in the middle. A few more minutes in the oven would have done it more justice."}
{"text":"Waiter was great, food was good however my friend and I got the same rack of ribs and mine was noticeably smaller. Waiter apologized but manager never came around. Craft beers were pricey compared to domestic."}
{"text":"I now know what the B in BJ's stands for...Bland. Calamari had no taste even with the salt and pepper I added. Sent that back. My bacon cheese burger was dry and bland too. Didn't send it back just got a box and brought it home. 1 star because my pink lemonade was good"}
{"text":"Always busy, always a wait. Decent beer selection and a large but somehow limited menu."}
{"text":"Great spot! Took my wife here on a date night. They have a great selection of beers. Their dark beers are amazing"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  They are slow for everything drinks, food, etc.  When you do finally get your food it is cold! Need new servers and new management.  NEVER going again. Poor poor poor."}
{"text":"Stood by the host stand for well over 5 minutes and had multiple employees walk by without even acknowledging us. Guarantee with service like that, you wont be open much longer."}
{"text":"October 2015

I have always enjoyed coming to this establishment since trying it out for the first time at their Chandler Location.  They have an incredible array of alcoholic beverages - including their own line of brews.  Their menu can be jarring and take you a bit to peruse through.  On my recent visits I tried their jambalaya.  The waitress informed me that it was spicy,and when I told her that that was fine with me, she asked if I'd like it hotter - could not turn that down.  The food definitely reminded me of my recent trip to New Orleans.   I paired it with a jalapeno margarita, which was equally tasty.  My son got a large plate of mac and cheese, a side dish, and a drink for very reasonable price.  He happily gobbled it up, an had room for a sundae.  The next time I came to this place was for pick up.  The person was gracious, friendly, and organized.  My food was prepared the same way I had it in their restaurant which shows me that they have excellent consistency.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant, I've been coming ever since it opened (probably 10+ years ago??). 

The best part for me, is (last I checked) the Pizookie donates money to the Cystic Fibrosis foundation (something I have)! 

Whenever I go, I always make sure I get the Sashimi grade Ahi/Tuna Poke, very good! 

Service has always been an 8/10 but the food has always been a 9/10. The location is also very convenient since it's located by all the big stores."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago with some friends and I had a wonderful dining experience. The food was delicious while the service was beyond excellent, one of the newer employees, Elizabeth Gonzalez really left a lasting impression! Highly recommended for great food and service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the top sirloin medium rare. When I cut into it I discovered it was well done! A server did not come around until 15 minutes later. By then I had decided to try it. Dry and tough!!!! The server ask if I wanted another, but my friends were almost done with their meal. So I just told her I was very disappointed and did not finish the steak. No compensation was made. I guess BJ's us just not a place for steak. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"went there yesterday for the Veteran's Day special. Turns out they allowed you to pick out anything in the menu and they paid for it. I had the beef brisket cheeseburger with smokey bbq sauce. Executed perfectly and tasted fantastic. their signature beers were only $5 for me and my guests. I just want to thank BJ's for making an old veteran feel appreciated. and in the words of MacArthur, I shall return!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, BJ's, I think we need to end this relationship. You're beautiful and you cook good food, but you're service makes me feel like you just don't care about me. 

In the theme of Festivus, below are my grievances:

1) The app's \"Preferred Waitlist\" is misleading. I logged in from home, added myself to the wait list and received a time of 25 minutes. I check-in and am told it will be 25 minutes, ok, fine, I'm already there. 50 minutes later, after speaking to a manager, we're seated. Either they quote you a lower time to keep you from leaving, when they know it'll be a longer wait, or the process is broken.  I had to wait to speak with the manager because someone else was also complaining about their \"Preferred Waitlist\" experience. 

2) Since we had 50 minutes to decide on our food, we ordered immediately upon sitting down.  By checking-in with the app, I was able to track my ticket time by seeing the exact moment the order was entered. Ticket time: 40 minutes. Unacceptable for pizza, breaded chicken and kids pasta.

After a bad service experience on my previous visit, I received a survey directly from BJ's corporate. I completed it and was provided a $15 coupon (as an apology) for a future visit, so we decided to give it another shot. Sorry, there are systemic service failures at this restaurant.  This place has potential but they better hurry up before others give up on them too."}
{"text":"First time we have ever went to BJ's we were surprised. We did call ahead seating and got right in even though there was a big crowd.
We ordered the Double bone in pork chop and the Parmesan crusted chicken and both were excellent.
Our server Sorba was exceptional she was very polite and gave us great service she had a great attitude.
I would recommend and we are coming back tomorrow night"}
{"text":"If you want horrible service and want to be treated like you are an inconvenience to the wait staff, then bj's is for you. This place just flat out sucks!!! I won't be back. I'll use my federal reserve notes somewhere else."}
{"text":"What happened? Bjs is no longer our go to family restaurant. Service is so slow and unprofessional. Took so long for our server to even acknowledge our party. We had to track down a manager to request some service. Even after we got our food, we never saw our server again....until the check came. Shameful. Food was ok but not good enough to make up for poor service. Too bad. We'll miss coming here. There are many more options were we can spend our money and get better service."}
{"text":"I've picked up dinner three times; Twice the food was very good, once very bad.  Check your order before you leave; two of our salads were a watery mess with virtually no toppings, just lettuce.  I'm sure they would have re-done them, but didn't want to drive back.  The sandwiches and burgers have been very good, Jambalaya and salads, bad.  The pick up system is very convenient.  Just park in front at the designated spots, call the number posted, and the server comes to your car."}
{"text":"The bathroom was disgusting filthy!!! Smudges on the stall walls, no toilet paper, only one of two faucets worked and that one did not work well! Only 2 of us, but I would prefer a table not a booth. Beer and food good."}
{"text":"We ordered the ahi salad which I thought was always great but yesterday  it wasn't the best.  I wonder if they have changed the recipe.  But my friend had the steak  and it was good. The service was ok but it seemed like he was in a hurry for us to leave so he could go."}
{"text":"Like everyone else there was good and parts about this place.  First the good.  Ordered the BBQ brisket burger and it was delicious!!! The server was very attentive.  My friend ordered the Ahi tuna Salad and said it was really good as well.  

The bad was the beer. Now I will admit I'm more critical than most with beer since I'm more of a beer nerd.  I was excited to try their home brews but those every was terrible especially the Porter.  None of them had any taste.  The Porter literally tasted like colored water.  One of the only times I can remember not being able to finish a beer. It was quite disappointing since this was a brew house.  I will go back and try it again as maybe the problem will be fixed as they just opened up."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago and never got the chance to leave a review! 

We waited about 5-10 minutes for our party of three and were seated in a booth. While waiting, they had posters of different specials they had each day, and I believe their burgers were 50% off one day and they also had $3 pizookies on Tuesdays! 

I decided to try their Long Island Ice Tea, and let me tell you - the strongest I've had it so far! Also worth it. Ordered the avocado bacon burger well done and got some fries with it. My mom ordered the chicken alfredo pasta and my uncle ordered a different pasta with shrimp in it but I can't remember the exact name. Service was a little slow but it's understandable because it during a dinner rush! 

My uncle had never been to a BJ's restaurant so we ordered the trio pizookie option and got peanut butter, salted caramel, and white chocolate macadamia nut. And for about $9, that's a GREAT price considering you can try THREE different pizookies!"}
{"text":"Service is good here. I always come for their appetizers!! My favorites are: avocado egg rolls, Spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella salad, stuffed mushrooms, Mac & cheese, and  fried calamari. They have an excellent selection of beers! My favorite is the Jeremiah red! Their pumpkin ale is a must try during the fall season!"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick lunch and came out two hours later frustrated and annoyed. We went when the system was down and our waiter could not handle our table and the other three that he was waiting on. It took half an hour to get our order placed and another 45 minutes to get our food. When done with the meal we waited 15 minutes for him to take the check and credit card but got so tired of waiting that we, along with the other tables he was serving, have cash and left rather than waiting for him to show up. 
   The food was lukewarm and overly greasy. 0/10 would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"As much as i love to dine here not tht sanitary although typically ive always gone to bj's in san diego. This particular bj's really needs to get it together. There booth chairs had crumbs all over it. The menu had dried up old food. Lastly the bathroom, the first 3 stalls had no tissue. Smh. Come on i could hve gobe to jack in the box for this or any fast food for tht matter!!!"}
{"text":"I really like bjs. They have great customer service, and their servers acknowledge our toddler, which I appreciate. You wouldn't believe the servers at most places who completely ignore our daughter. I get the clam chowder and the California chicken club. My husband loved the balsamic glazed chicken, but I think they've taken that off the menu. The pizookie is good, but I never get it now that I know what the pizookie at oreganos is like."}
{"text":"I had to go for a work function. I feel obligated to write something since it's a restaurant and this is Yelp, and I ate food. As I get older, I get less tolerant of chain food. BJ's is so prototypical, that I couldn't stay for very long. The service was agitating at best... food was sub-par. I truly hope I dont have to go back anytime soon. I gave 3 stars because some people like chain food, and this was only below average, not horrible."}
{"text":"WHAT A NAME FOR A RESTERAUNT! anywho BJ'S(lol) has the best selection of soups! the TOMATO BISQUE is awesome, although today @ lunch we ordered brocolli/cheese & clam chowder! My friend Sandy & I filled up on the ROTINI chicken pasta & italian chopped salad!  we couldnt believe the bill was only 22 bucks. 
BJ'S is my kind of place, minus the dirty title!"}
{"text":"Poor service. We received our appetizer relatively fast but it took our service 20-25 minutes to come back and take our order then another 30 minutes to receive our order. My wife's fries tasted like fish and her sandwich was cold. We couldn't get anyone to come back to the table. Finally we just went to the host stand and asked for our check. Needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Our Waitress was great.  Very attentive, very nice.  Beer was ehhh, ordered 3 pizzas.  All 3 minis came out cold, undercooked, with no sauce at all.  Mine was so undercooked the dough was still in the doughy stage.  Needless to say the pizza was really bad, might have been the worst I have ever had at a restaurant ever.  Not a fan, will not ever go back....Giving it a one star cause our waitress was amazing.  She is the only reason I can say anything nice.  One of the best I have had in a long time.  Too bad the food was so poor."}
{"text":"Bjs is the bomb. I've been here so many times with so many different crowds. I've never had bad service any time I've come.

I always get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with no sun dried tomatoes and extra sauce.

I've been here for brunch too and lol its not that great and the mimosas are SMALL. 

So my review is not for brunch it's for staff and service and dinner. Also the pazookies are amazing. My friend Nathan is obsessed with them for good reason :) 

Come to Bjs"}
{"text":"Their berry cider is delicious, it is very sweet so I highly recommend it for the ladies, but as well they do brew their own beer, and have a large selection of liquor, so very accommodating for both men and women. There are quite a few tv's all around so it's good to come for a game. I thought all the bartenders and servers were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Another solid meal at BJs. Wait was usual, about 20 mins. 

Our server was on top of everything from our extra napkins request, side of this or that, to keeping our drinks refilled. Food was cooked perfect. 

Our waitress  Kaitlyn was friendly and service was great!

Definitely recommend. Enjoy!! :)"}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice - once on New Years Eve (with a new trainee attempting to serve us) and years later for lunch.  First it hasn't changed with the horrible customer service.  The hostess avoids looking at me for about two minutes, then says, \"Party of two?\" and she points to the bar area to seat ourselves....We then seat ourselves, a waitress approaches us and we request water and menus  - we get those in a timely manner.  She then takes our order and we never see her again..... we sat there for at least 20 minutes with no other interaction from her.  We then go up to the hostess stand to do a courtesy notification that we are leaving because we have not received our order nor seen our waitress again and her reply is \"Do you want to speak to a manager?\"  Obviously, this is a problem here!  

DO NOT GO HERE - THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER CHOICES IN THE VALLEY!!!!!"}
{"text":"My iced coffee was weird, it was like watered down regular coffee over ice. I would never order it again. For a sports bar there were an awfull lot of children there! Although our food was quite delicious tho mmm especially dessert. Our server was attentive and friendly, the menu was so vast, it takes a while to decide. Our overall experience was good its just that at the end of the day, its just over priced bar food in a noisy environment."}
{"text":"Rib Eye and Baked Potatoe was fantastic. I used my rewards points so that was  a plus. This is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Nice variety of food and they stay open late. I'm from Atlanta, GA where sit down restaurant stay open late. Here in Phoenix things tend to close early, unless it's a bar. My family and friends can always count on BJ's for a late night meal. 

We stated coming here about four years ago when we bought our house. We met one of the servers, Jamie Harris. She's the bees knees. We always request her section if she's working. She's professional and very witty. 

They make their own root beer. Yum-mee! I'm not a soda drinker and was never a root beer fan until now. It's a must have at BJ's."}
{"text":"BJ's has a great variety of food - pizzas (including deep dish), fish, pork ribs, pastas, and burgers to name a few. Their pazookie dessert is a must try if you love sweets! I'm not a big alcohol drinker, but there is a wide variety of drinks to choose from as well. We normally don't want for a seat in their restaurant area. They have lots of booths and tables in their bar area so we're normally able to find a seat right away."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about BJ's, my brother and I went last night along with our pastor friend who lives just down the street.  We got the fried artichoke as an app, which was very good.  I had a baked potato with chicken and broccoli which was smothered in cheese and my brother had a chili cheese burger (those skinny fries are sooo good!).  Our friend had one of their BJ's deep dish pizza and I had a slice.  Not too greasy and with just the right about of crunch from the dough.  Then we topped it off with the red velvet pazooki, which was amazing!  But it's hard to go wrong with a pazooki.  
The guys tried out a couple beers which they all thought were decent, but non of us are any sort of beer experts.  

Overall the food was great and atmosphere was comfortable, but just a little loud.  Not the kinda place you want to go for peace and quiet, but not overbearing either.  Our server came to check up on us frequently and she was very polite.  

Will come again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love going to yard house. The food is great and the service is great as well. Our waiter Name was April sunshine, And she was the best! she had the best customer service, She was friendly and nice. We are definitely asking for her next time we go."}
{"text":"The service I received on 4 Sept last Friday at this location (Chandler) was unimpressive. I was even more disappointed in their management.  My wife and I made a reservation the morning (11:00 AM) of 4 Sept (Friday) for 16+ people for dinner later that night at 7:00 PM.  The host (male) confirmed the reservation (via phone) but when my family along with our friends arrived there later that night, they told us to take a pager and would seat us as soon as possible.  When I inquired as to what had happened, the hostess simply stated that somehow our reservation had gotten deleted in the system and when it was put back into the system, the morning shift entered it incorrectly (6:00 PM).  The server then stated that the current wait was 50 minutes.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve the issue (as I had 16 individuals w/ their families waiting) and when the manager spoke to us he was less than empathetic in what had happened.  His demeanor was less than encouraging, no apology was given, and he stated he was working the issue but we would have to wait.  There was no sense of urgency to remedy the situation from management and I got the perception that there was very little interest in correcting the error.  Looking around the restaurant, I could easily see that there were vacant tables on the patio (which the manager could have easily offered) regardless if the service would be slow. But no offer was made.  Instead, he stated that we would have to wait the current wait time (50 minutes).  

Having a wife who has been in the hospitality management industry for 10+ years, there could have been multiple ways of recovering the situation: Offered patio seating, or at least somewhere to sit, offered some seating at the bar, maybe a few complimentary appetizers to calm the hungry children, or even some waters at least while waiting in the Arizona heat, vouchers or anything to come back another time... at the VERY least, a sincere apology (especially with a party as large as 16+ individuals).  My true disappointment was not that a mistake had happened, but rather how the situation was poorly handled.  We can understand there can sometimes be a miscommunication during a shift change, but poor management and recovery should not be accepted. After talking to the less than empathetic manager, my family and party left BJs and went to the Keg where they were glad to have our business. Sadly, that's $700 in sales BJ's lost out on and also grat that their servers missed out on and more importantly, a loss in some loyal patrons. The great thing about all this is- we have found a new meeting place as our regular dinner location, thanks to the Keg. We will look forward to returning there for our regular dinner outings and will look back and laugh at myself and think what a fortunate mistake this was. 

I would suggest a bit more training for the staff, not just for the hostess stand employees, but for leadership/management more importantly. Staff is only as good as their leader. Take a tip from Bob Farrell, Give 'em the PICKLE. Here's the link if you need more info: http://www.giveemthepickle.com/"}
{"text":"BJ's can be kind of loud, and the hosts sometimes are not very welcoming, but we like the food and management is great, if you have any issues they really make an effort to make it right. 
We just try to come here during low times because otherwise it can be very loud and it is difficult to have a conversation. Also when it is busy they do not seem to like seating parties of 2 on the booths that are for 4, but being so loud it is tough to have a conversation across the table in the small booths. 
I usually have the full rack of ribs with the sauce on the side (naked ribs), chili and salad, and my wife usually has the ribeye with the mozzarella salad.
Service has been good on and off. 
BJs is a solid choice for lunch on workdays, they are very fast and have a big parking lot."}
{"text":"Let's face it.  It's hard to impress 'the average Joe' these days when it comes to new dining establishments.  There is so much competition, especially when it comes to overpriced (my opinion) national chains, thus expectations are ultra high to begin with.  Really, all people want is good quality, good tasting food at fair prices.  My wife and I had been driving by the BJ's location as it was being built, wondering what kind of restaurant would be replacing 'Smokey Bones'.  We stopped by on opening day, and frankly left unimpressed.  My wife had the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which she thought was OK, but the veggies and rice were very bland in taste.  I had the Ahi Poke as my appetizer, which was gross to say the least.  The 'poke sauce' tasted rather anemic, and the tuna was bland and flavorless, and seemed to be a 'lower grade'.  It's consistency was 'way off' as well, being very soft and limp.  Which makes me wonder if it was actually tuna at all I was eating, or some other cheap seafood filler masquerading as real tuna.  At this point, I thought to myself, well at least my medium deep dish pizza is going to taste great.  Wrong!  The dough was way too chewy in spots, and clearly not baked or crispy enough.  The cheese and tomato sauce tasted processed and bland as well.  I've tasted much better frozen pizzas, truth be told!  I took the pizza home anyway, and tried re-baking it, and added my own mozzarella cheese and spices.  It tasted much better.  At least the Pizookie desserts tasted great.  On the plus side, the interior layout is top notch, with a nice mix of bar, tables, and booths.  Our server was excellent too, as was the manager, who listened to my concerns, and ultimately 'made things right'.  I will probably give this place another chance in the future, but not anytime soon.

2/21/17

We returned to this location, and gave BJ's another chance, and it turned out much better.  The shrimp tacos and calamari were good, and our server was amazing!  My guests and I had a great time, and everyone left happy.  All I can say is that if you've ever had a bad experience at a new place, go back again and give them another chance at a later date.  Oftentimes, it takes a few weeks for a new place to find it's mojo, and reach optimal service and potential.  I hereby change my original 2 star review to 4."}
{"text":"I stopped here after work last week to grab a beer and some dinner. (My medical assistants love this place.) I sat alone at the bar and the bartenders, Ariana and Marcus, were so friendly and amazing! I drank the Jeremiah red which was a pretty palatable, inoffensive beer. I wasn't feeling bar food so--shame on me--I ordered a quinoa bowel which was not that great. I've heard I should've gone with bar food and would have loved it. Regardless, they gave me a free dessert since my meal was over ten dollars. I will definitely be back. Definitely not for the quinoa bowel but because the bar staff was so damn awesome!"}
{"text":"This by far our most favorite place to go in North Las Vegas... The food is wonderful and the staff is exceptional. 

The lunches are terrific and the Jeremiah Red is the best beer ever. 

Go there!!!"}
{"text":"It was A Sunday afternoon, we sat at the bar looked over there large menu, asked for suggestions. The bartender was less then hospitable, food was ok, WINGS were terrible!!! they were placed well, plating was pretty, Wings sucked!!! small, and frozen. Then the bartender spent her time trying new drinks in the corner while we waited a half hr. for our bill. Hopefully this place will do as well as the place they are replacing, I will not be back.."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I think this restaurant is really overrated. I have been here numerous times and only twice have I not experience a problem with either our order or the service. 
It's usually something simple like when my husband orders no mayo on his burger and it comes with mayo. The annoying part is that it ALWAYS happens! How hard is it to not put mayo on a hamburger? Often times our drinks never get refilled and the servers here are often MIA. It may seem silly to complain about a soda refill, but it's the little things that make the experience when you go out. 

The tables really turned for me when I was a BJ's for my friends daughters birthday party and we had the absolute worst service ever! She was turning 9 and she choose BJ's for her birthday lunch, which I personally think was quite grown up for a nine year old, she could have gone anywhere but she choose BJ's!! Anyway, we only had 11 people in our party and it was 3:00 pm so it wasn't anything too crazy and it wasn't a rush hour, so it shouldn't have been something that they couldn't have been able to handle. Our server wasn't off to a good start, he was just sweating profusely as if it were 100 degrees inside the building with no air! He actually had sweat pouring from his face! Clearly a partly of 11 was going to be too much for him to handle, he needed to ask for help. Of course he didn't get help and things just got worse and as luck would have we weren't his only table. 
.........And that's when it happened! Our server had just cleared of a dirty table behind ours and was walking behind behind us with a tray full of half empty dirty glasses,  when he spilled the tray all over my son and I !!!!! We were both cover with what I think was old iced tea! As we sat there wet, cold and in shock, our server just said nonchalantly \"I am sorry\" and continued walking to the back. He never came back out! So my son and I were left to try to dry of with the napkins rolls that were on the table! Meanwhile the floor underneath our chairs was a pool of spilled liquid and we were surrounded by it, so if we were to try to move our chairs to get up we would have been stepping in liquid! About three minutes latter our server was still MIA and there was no one coming out to mop up the floor, I was beginning to think I was being Punked! I saw a women walking toward our table who looked like the manager and I thought oh good she is coming to fix the situation, but nope! She just walked right by our table, even after looking directly at the puddle on the floor!! Finally another person at out table had to stop the manager because I was trapped in my chair wet and surrounded by the puddle of spilled drinks!! Meanwhile, my poor son just sat there so quietly and didn't complain once! Finally the manager did come over to me, she asked what happened and I told her how our server spilled a tray of old drinks on my son and I and then disappeared and didn't offer us anything to dry ourselves off with, nor did anyone come to mop up the floor! The manager barley apologized and then all she gave us was a small stack of the brown paper towels from the bathroom to dry ourselves with. I would have expected a clean white towel from the back, but this lady seriously did not get it! Finally about 15 minutes into this disaster someone came to mop up the floor so we were able get out of our chairs to make it to the bathroom.

So then our bill comes, and don't get me wrong, I am not after free stuff, but after you spill a tray of drinks on my son and I and then disappear and treat us like crap, it would have been nice to just have taken care of the bill. Nope! Not even a little I am sorry discount! They gave my bill in full! So why the two stars you may be asking? Because I went home that night night and told my hubby the whole awful story and he was pissed at me and asked why I didn't freak out on them?! I told him it was because I was at a birthday party and I was trying to keep it cool, could you imagine if I went all momzilla at my daughters friends birthday, she would have died!! So my hubby went to BJ's website and contacted them. He was latter called by the DM who apologized for the whole episode and sent us a $50 gift card. Again, I am not after free stuff, what I really wanted was for them to just OWN IT the day it happened! If you mess up then just apologize and mean it!! The DM also sent the mother of the birthday girl a gift card too because the server messed up the birthday cake. I would have written about that episode too but I am only allowed 1500 words!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar.  Quick service.  Introduced themselves.  Offered suggestions on beer.  I was by myself and felt very comfortable.  Good meal too! Exactly what I needed having Ahi."}
{"text":"Incredible!! We had an amazing waiter, Anthony. He was attentive, knowledgeable and incredibly on top of service.  We were absolutely delighted to be seated in his section and will request him by name in the future. The food was also very very good.  Great experience which was again enhanced by service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...I went here with my family after we saw a movie.  We got seated quick and got our drinks. I was excited when I saw how extensive the menu was and, looking at the prices, I figured it would Cheesecake Factory quality stuff.  We ordered a Southern Fried Chicken, Deep Dish Ziti, and Flatbread Pizza, which arrived within 10 minutes.  This is when it fell apart.  My corn was cold, and the chicken and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm.  The chicken was paper white inside and disgustingly dense, rather than the tender and juicy chicken I had been expecting.  The sauce on the ziti tasted like tombstone pizza sauce and had no distinguishable flavored.  The pizza had a soggy crust and the cheese tasted like a cheap version of Pizza Hut.  All of it was awful, but I guess the pizza was at least edible.  The conclusion we came to is that this place uses frozen meals (think Banquet, Lean Cuisine) and heats them up.  That explains how the chicken could be cold, yet cooked through and the total lack of flavor.  You could honestly find better food in the freezer aisle of Giant Eagle, at least it would be hot.  Will not be going back.  With all the options for food in this area, there's really no need for this house of horrors."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location off and on for a couple of years now, typically for lunch with friends, colleagues or family, and it's never really disappointed me. 

I'm a huge fan of their tomato soup, greasy though it might be sometimes, it is nonetheless delicious and I always have to have it. My only gripe is that their idea of a 'bowl' of soup is basically a coffee mug, not an actual bowl. If you're hungry, make sure you order the bowl or you'll probably only get about a shot glass worth from the 'cup' version. 

For the lunch specials, my favorite has long been the chicken fettuccine, which has always been good, although I must admit I've had mixed experience with the pulled pork sandwich and the blonde shrimp, both a tying for a close second. Both the pork and the shrimp I've gotten in bad form a few times, not wretch inducing or anything, but it's definitely been sub-par from time to time (tough pork, badly battered shrimp, etc.). I've always gotten a sincere apology when things go awry and offers to make it right, but I have to hand it to them that there's never been an issue with the pasta or the chicken therein, so I keep my fingers crossed and stick with that these days.  

If I'm not in the mood for pasta, my new second favorite is to go with their BBQ chicken pizza, another item that they've managed to be very consistent with. Probably not the best pizza out there, but for the money, it's certainly par for the course. 

Service is typically pretty good, but if they're packed for lunch, you can generally expect the drink service to fall off the radar. This has been a consistent theme, regardless of who our server is, but it's hard to blame them when the place is packed. They definitely fill up quick around lunch time, so get there early if you want brisk service! 

On the whole, I've no issues going back to this place. I haven't gotten any serious complaints from anyone I've taken here, whether they're friends, coworkers or visiting family members, so that says a lot. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in several years and now I remember why...ordered the flatbread pizza app. , when he brought it out he dropped some pieces on the table, I said we aren't going to eat that so he said well I'll see if they can make a couple more..pretty sure they just flipped those over and returned to table..gross!! Didn't eat that!! Then came the cobb salad, old lettuce no romaine, no bacon either..very lame! Server was pretty much like casper..disappeared the whole time...."}
{"text":"The food is good once you actually get a table. We've been here twice and even though we've used the app for \"preferred wait list\" (basically call ahead) we've had to wait more than an hour each time. The parking lot is extremely small, but it just prepares you for the cramped waiting area. A server passed around small slices of pizza in a feeble attempt to placate the many angry waiting guests. The concept and menu are great, but the execution is terribly lacking."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! If you're debating between a few restaurants and this is one of your options, you can cross BJ's off your list and I'm sure you won't regret it. 

My family took my bf here for his birthday. 
We were seated immediately and the server came over in a timely manner. He had no knowledge of the menu- he kept offering items that were not even on the menu and then saying \"Oh sorry never mind you can't get that\". 

The food was mediocre at best.. rib eye, mahi-mahi tacos, chicken sandwich were all overpriced and it seemed like the quality was not what it used to be- More bland than it was flavorful. 
Anything we requested from our server, such as an extra ranch or drink refill, were forgotten about. 

The server ID'd my bf when he ordered a beer and noted that it was his birthday the day before our visit, but forgot it when it was time for dessert and we had to remind him. 

We ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The server informed us, to my bf's disappointment, that they were out of vanilla ice cream and will have to give us chocolate instead. My bf is not a fan of chocolate (what a weirdo, right) and passed on the pizookie but they brought out the cookie anyway. About 5-10 mins later, we see dessert plates being brought out with VANILLA ICE CREAM. I guess they restocked but we were not informed, received no apology and the server had made no effort to make things right. 

To top off our amazing experience, my bf, my sister and I ended up in and out of the restroom all night from 2 in the morning til now thanks to the mahi-mahi tacos we decided to try. If I had to diagnose that, I'm going to guess that we've got food poisoning. 

I called the manager on duty this morning to explain everything that had happened to her and she had no sympathy or desire to make things right. 

Don't waste your time or your money! There are sooo many other options than a place that has no respect for your needs or your time. You. Deserve. Better."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch today. I had the soup(Broccoli, my favorite) plus a mini 1topping deep dish pizza & Jerry had a hamburger with skinny fries. They were delicious! Great service. As a vet, Jerry's lunch was free. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Honestly, why I didn't know about the Baked Beignet is beyond me. Probably cause I was always blinded by all the pizookie options. One of my favorite new desserts for sure. Light and fluffy beignet with powdered sugar, strawberries, strawberry purée, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. Perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place. The ale was nice and they served up one of the best burgers that we have found in this town. We were seated promptly even on a very busy night and our waiter was on the spot with everything we needed. They without question exceeded our expectations going in to a chain. Well done guys!!!!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here, especially for the pazookies! Our server Anthony was really nice and catered to our needs well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I try not to go to chain restaurants as much as possible for a reason! BJ's reminded me of exactly why. We walked in and were seated right away because it was empty, however, waited 15 minutes for a server to ask us what we wanted to drink. Waited another 10 for our waters and to order... Waited another 30 for our dinners... Our server seemed over worked and unapologetic. 
The food was average. Deep dish ravioli was good,pepperoni pizza was ok the roast beef dip was dry, chicken Alfredo was dry... Just overall a bad experience...so THANK YOU BJ's for reminding me of why we don't do chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to BJ's twice now.  The last time I ordered a Jalapeno burger with fries ($9.95) with a stout beer called Tatanka ($5.00). My daughter had a cheeseburger and fries. She ordered her burger well done and I medium. Both burgers were perfectly cooked, juicy and as good as a hamburger could be. What made it most wonderful for us was the waitress was expedient, never letting us sit there with an empty glass ( within 30 seconds of our glass being empty she was there to see if we wanted more). The beers are phenomenal the decor is easy on the eyes. Bathrooms are clean and well kept. Our waitress made us feel as comfortable as if we were at home."}
{"text":"The bartender Shelly T is not friendly at all. She wasn't customer service savvy also I left tip and she didn't even say thank you. Very rude I used to really like this place. Go to Max and Erma they always treat you nice no matter how much you spend. Also I can here her side talk about the place. That was not professional."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been back a few times since my first review and I have to say that on balance my wife and I like this place. There is a large menu and we've been going through it. Aside from the flat bread pizza appetizer, I don't think we've ordered the same thing twice. The atmosphere really helps. There is a buzz going on that just makes you glad to be there. We always enjoy a couple beers here too. Somehow we find the place comfortable!

A great thing to do if there is a 20+ minute wait is to get a beer at the bar and wait there. You won't even realize you're waiting! Another nice thing is paying with their app - you don't even have to wait for the waitress to bring the check!"}
{"text":"I ended up in the emergency room within an hour of eating here with a terrible allergic reaction to something.  I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and didn't order anything with shellfish in it which scares me that there is cross contamination with the shrimp in the kitchen. I will more than likely not be back, in fear that could happen again."}
{"text":"Bjs management sucks completely! Every location I have been to treat their staff poorly and it shows. I will NEVER be back at a Bjs location. EVER!"}
{"text":"What a fun brewery!  They had so many different kinds of beer from so many different places.  I ordered a beer made by them called Nitwit. I know, very appropriate. It had this nice hint of orange. We got some onion strings as appetizers. They came with a ranch and another house made dressing. My husband ordered the bacon turkey club sandwich which was quite big. I ordered a clam chowder bowl. Very good clam chowder with plenty of clams in it. The service was very good the interior of the restaurant was fun. The place is probably a very hopping place later at night. We were there at lunch, so I would know. I liked the atmosphere and the beer. I would gladly return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and was greeted by our server Agla!
What a delight to converse with. Food was delicious as usual but what made this visit special was Agla's awesome smile, personality, and great laugh. 
We'll be back again and ask for Agla. Shes terrific and an asset. Thx!"}
{"text":"Skip the fettuccine alfredo. It's better at any italian restaurant. Wedge fries were good though! And of course, you can't resist the pazookie!

Waiter was very nice and patient considering my friend and I sat there for 3 hours catching up."}
{"text":"Ate there last year for my son's birthday and had great food and service. This time we had the worst waiter imaginable who didn't even bring us silverware. Food and drinks were bad, service was bad, I was pissed that I paid $100 for this drool. Serious indigestion for ALL of us, including our 4 year old!

Waiter wouldn't bother to take the time to look up my BJ's card, never refilled tea, forgot to order my son's food which left him sitting there watching us eat for 45 minutes! Ordered my daughter's food wrong as well. Overcharged us for meals and drinks. Barely spoke English and obviously couldn't write it either. 

With so many more options now since Downtown Summerlin has opened one would think they would at least attempt to make an effort. 

I'm very disappointed and it was reflected in the tip or lack thereof. Having been a waitress in the past, there are a few things I expect such as silverware. 

I don't know why this place is packed or how it stays open. Perhaps everyone is parking there to eat at Olive Garden next door."}
{"text":"After dining in many times and ordering the kale and Brussels sprouts salad, I ordered the allegedly same salad, 'to go.' It was terrible...barely filled the container and was missing some of the usual ingredients. I think I found two blueberries and three pecans. Terrible!"}
{"text":"BJ's is a nice bar. They have no video poker and are completely non smoking, which is nice in Vegas because most bars have video poker and smoking. The food is pretty good for bar food and the beer is definitely above average for brewpubs."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been eating here for the last couple of years. Everything on the menu is great. I really like the pizza as well. Service has always been very good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for lunch. We had the avocado egg rolls and burgers! The food is always outstanding!Our server Babette was very polite and attentive!"}
{"text":"Always love coming to BJ food is always great.  My husbands favorite thing to order is the jambalaya,  he gets it extra spicy with pasta instead of rice. I love the Parmesean lemon chicken with white Cheddar mashed potatoes and broccoli,  my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I always want to order a pazooki but am usually to full to get one, they are fantastic! !! This place is one that we will continue to come to over and over agon."}
{"text":"I posted a comment on BJ's at Centennial Center in Las Vegas, NV on 5/10/16 in reference to our visit on 5/9/16 (Mothers Day).  Today I got a phone call from the manager, apologizing for the experience my family had.  He stated that the incident was not there norm, and things were not handled right at the time.  He has made note of what has happen and also stated that he wants customers to have a good experience and leave with with a smile on there face.  He was very interested in what happen and I felt that he would take action to make this not a repeat occurrence. I was very pleased with his phone call and comments."}
{"text":"BJ's Brewhouse is exactly the type of place that this area needs. Located right in front of a mall, all you usually see here are chain restaurants that all feel the same. BJ's is different though. With a huge menu and a great selection of beers, you really can't go wrong here! 
     I have heard a lot of hype about this place recently, as it just opened, so I had to try it for myself. Being in front of a mall, parking was a nightmare. I drove around and turned around 3 times in mall traffic before I finally gave up and made my own parking spot. Once we got inside, the place was decently crowded but we were seated right away. 
     There is plenty of seating inside, an outdoor patio for warmer weather, and a decent sized bar. The atmosphere is very comfortable and what you might expect from a brewhouse. The hosts and our server were all very friendly, so no complaints there. While we were eating, food runners came up to us two times with food that wasn't ours (before we ordered, just meant for another table). I chalk this up to just opening and serves not yet having the hang of the table numbering. Nothing major. 
     As for food, they have pretty much anything you could want. We started with the spinach artichoke dip which was delicious. It came with tortilla chips and was exactly what I wanted. My mom and I both ordered a soup and salad combo, with tomato basil soup in a bread bowl (2.75ish surcharge). The soup was delicious and the bread bowl was amazing. The top of it was toasted and tasted like garlic bread. On the side, I got a Caesar salad and my mom got the wedge salad. Both were very good. 
     They have a great selection of house brewed beers, as well as cocktails and many other drinks. I went for their house brewed IPA and was very pleased. It was very smooth and went well with the food I was eating. Overall, this was a great experience and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere in this place...who doesn't like a place to watch games and throw back some brewskis? Food is a cut above normal chain restaurants..not spectacular but good.Besides after 4 or 5 beers everything tastes good anyways. I will definitely frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"We cannot say enough good things about Erica. There was a problem with our order and she went above and beyond to take care of us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"nicest BJ's around.. the micro brews were amazing and the chicago style pie is great"}
{"text":"We have been to this location twice in the past 2 weeks. Love it. Plenty of parking and we have been lucky enough to not have to wait either time.  We went on Sundays both times. The service has been fantastic and the food has been stellar. If you are a beer drinker this is the place you should check out, so many different ones to choose from. They have a very lengthy menu.  There is definitely something for everyone on there.  We have tried the cheese curds twice (perfect little morsels of cheese, deep fried to perfection), the honey siracha Brussel sprouts (fan freakin tastic deep fried Brussel sprouts), turkey dip sandwich (thanksgiving stuffed in a hoagie roll complete with a chicken broth dip) sweet potato fries (nice change from regular fries) southern comfort fried chicken sandwich (juicy tender chicken breast sandwich) fish and chips (4 huge pieces of fried fish with a side of fries) hickory brisket burger (juicy, full of flavor, bbq goodness), peanut butter and triple chocolate pizookies( who doesn't want a ginormous cookie topped with ice cream and drizzle with sauce??) The food has really been stellar at this restaurant and the portion sizes are very generous.  Love it, will most definitely be back. 10% military discount. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Place has a huge menu, something for everyone. And they run daily specials, which is fun. (I like a deal).

The restaurant is always clean and has a nice atmosphere.

Good place to take kids, or a group. If it is just my and my husband, we will probably go somewhere else, as it is just OK."}
{"text":"This is your standard casual dining restaurant and it does its job effectively.  We come 2-3 times per month and rarely have any issues.  The food is good, the drinks are done well, and the servers are prompt and efficient.  I would recommend this place over TGIFridays and Chili's any day."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty mediocre restaurant for vegetarians who don't drink.  The only reason I've been back a couple times is because my fella likes their pizza... they also serve massive baked-potatoes.

Last night they wouldn't serve me a Gardenburger because there is spinach in it.  I understand that they are looking out for our best interests (so I don't get sick and so they don't get sued) but since it isn't FRESH spinach it seemed a little excessive.  The FDA lifted the ban, get over it and gimme my sammich!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely great hear but the hostess was super rude when we walked in. We had made a dinner reservation for 7pm for 8 people and we arrived 5 mins early and we still had to wait a good 30 min. I do understand that there was a big game on that night but did they not think to hold a larger table? But the hostess was complaining to all of her co workers and it was not quietly about the guests around her stating \"can these people leave?\" \"WOW there annoying\" and other comments like that. But BJs is a great place for yummy food and desserts! All of there waiters are super nice and cool too!!"}
{"text":"3rd time going. All 3 times the food was not very good. Party of 8 and all of us agreed no more going back. Maybe they're known for something that we haven't tried yet.

On a side note. The lay out is pretty bad too. Where we were sitting it was so tight we had to keep moving our seat in and out to let people and waiters go by. Not a very enjoyable experience at all."}
{"text":"Burgers are great, but the fries are terrible. If you like really hard and crunchy skinny fries, you're fine, but if not, don't get fries. Overall not bad"}
{"text":"The food was just okay. Service was good. Meals were overpriced and the quality wasn't that great. I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't go back and probably would not recommend coming here to anyone. Upscale Applebee's type place. I would only go for drinks."}
{"text":"After a full day of shopping and going out, my mom and my friend Austin were starving! We were down in the Awatukee/Chandler area doing some shopping at Ikea, and decided we needed something to eat stat.  We didn't feel like driving very far, so we circled through the mall to see what we could find.

We decided on BJ's as none of us had been there before and the menu looked really good from the outside. Its a beer brewery, but seems to have a really good menu of food items when eating here.  We got seated right away and our server was a real nice gal who answered all our questions.

I went with the roast beef sandwich Au jus.  It came with white horseradish and was delicious!  My mom went with the tomato bisque soup and ceaser salad, and my friend Austin ate the bacon cheeseburger with some fries.  OMG food was so good!

Water and beverages were filled quickly without being asked, and everyone here was happy.  I would love to come here and drink, as they have an awesome drink menu, but since I was driving everyone all over town AND we were with my mom, I guess I'm going to have to come back another time and get my adult beverage on here!

I will say, the only negative thing I have to say about this place was that it was freezing inside! It was so cold that my mom had to go outside to warm up.  It was quite cold, but I was able to stick it out, but when my mom was outside warming up, so befriended another customer who was outside trying to warm up too!"}
{"text":"BJ's food never disappoints for me. I order new things each time I go (parmesan crusted chicken/burgers/pasta/etc.), but the main thing I ALWAYS come for are their pizookies! A pizookie (pizza cookie) is a MUST when you come to this restaurant.  

It's so fresh, and the combination of warm cookie and cold ice cream, is a match made in heaven! I love getting half chocolate chip and half oreo flavor! However, if you're not feeling too indulgent on sweets, you can always order a mini pizookie! 

Their drinks are pretty decent priced as well! I ordered their strawberry mojito, and it was I was tempted to order more! 

The only reason I didnt give a five star review, is because sometimes the service is a hit or miss when I go. Some days I get excellent service, other days I get really slow service & long wait times to take your order (even when it's not a busy night). But all in all, a great restaurant to check out!"}
{"text":"Very, very convenient for large parties. Very accommodating. The staff was fantastic. Food was....ok. Mixed drinks were below expectations. Horrible, horrible parking! The restaurant is a little difficult to find if you're not familiar with this extremely large area of stores and restaurants. Apparently, this area is very popular. The closest lot is for many popular businesses."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place. It's a newer chain restaraunt that seems like a more modern Applebees. They have an extensive beer list & a decent amount of cocktails. The food menu is HUGE & I think they can afford to downsize. I think it's weird that a large portion of the menu is for lunch hours only. There are more vegetarian options for lunch than for dinner. They have a space on their menu that says, \"We have LOTS of vegetarian options, ask your waiter what meals can be made into vegetarian options\". I wish that they had a leaf marker on Vegetarian/Vegan options like most other places do to make it easier for the customer. Food quality isn't too notch, but it is what you'd expect from a chain restaraunt. Nothing great, nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Pretty decent foods.
I love the seared ahi tuna salad.
Beers are tasty.
Wait times have been reasonable and have had pleasant waitresses.
My wife likes the pizokies or whatever they are called, I think they are overrated."}
{"text":"I usually love BJ's, but today just wasn't all that great at this location. First time here, and I as greeted and sat immediately. But then it kinda went downhill. It took 10mins for a server to come to me, and I watched people get seated and drinks after I was sat down. My waitress barely said 20 words to me the whole time. Never really looked me in my eye. Whenever I said \"thank you\", she responded with \"mhm\". I got a strawberry mojito (which tasted amazing) but the guy who dropped it off did a moving drop - never stopped to place it at my table, just dropped it down and kept moving. I got a create your own pizza and the guy who dropped that off was much better. And placed it on my plate for me. I came around 2pm and they were pretty slow but got my food around 2:30. If I'm craving their pizza I'll go back, but I'd rather try a different location."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week. I love it. Always great service great people and great food. McGragger, the manager had one of the best customer service and I am so thankful. But don't get Jennifer. The horrible service I had with her is too long to tell. But mark my words don't get Jennifer."}
{"text":"Solid service and extensive menu...

The menu is a book! I mean, literally, it's 20 pages long. I would normally complain and say a restaurant should specialize in something, but in my 4 visits, I haven't had anything that was good. 

Burgers, salads, flatbreads... even pasta, all were solid. 

Only reason for four stars is because it feels a little too-\"chainy\" but that is unavoidable. Certainly a step up from TGI Fridays and Applebees, but the over the top menu and decor just don't do it for me.

Service has always been exceptional and the facility is perfect for large parties, prices are competitive, and I will definitely be back, especially when I cannot decide what I'm really in the mood to eat!"}
{"text":"BJ's started a rewards program recently on a visit. This is a nice addition to an already really good restaurant. The salad portions have gone down which for $12 for a salad, cutting out the lettuce probably isn't a good idea! The pizza's are really good. They also have a really good fried jalapeno burger. They started a lower calorie menu as well and I was really suprised that they have a pizza on there which actually was good for so few calories. Still find their pazookie's the best dessert. The white chocolate macadamian is amazing and I want one just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend always come here when we can't decide where to eat. Inexpensive, a really good variety on the menu and I've always had a good experience, minus the waiters, you either get a really awesome one or one that's brand new and knows little to nothing about the menu."}
{"text":"Ehh..... Defiantly not the greatest food..

Our wait was a little over 40 min and the food was not that great. I got the California Chicken it was so bland. Seriously no flavor. The green chilis had no kick to them or flavor. I was highly disappointed. The husband got a steak and steamed veggies. He ordered medium rare and It came out well done.... 

This place was just not that great overall. Not a place I plan to come back to when I visit Henderson again."}
{"text":"The place is nice. Service was ok. The waiter poured too much water where it splashed on the table and just said \"oops\"...

We got their deep dish pizza whth roasted garlic and fresh basil; Their definition of deep dish is thick crust, so that was disappointing. Their pizza sauce tasted like rotten tomatoes. yucky. I got the tomato bisque and I've had better tomato bisque in a student cafeteria. We also got their sample appetizer platter and I only liked their avocado rolls and their mozzerella sticks. The rest was just gross. 

I don't recommend this place at all. Only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is because I liked the way the place looked."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was good! I'm glad we came here on Super Bowl Sunday. It was nice and chill which was unexpected since it was the day of the Big Game. It was also nice to find out that they weren't going to charge a cover to watch the game here. We accidentally went to Twin Peaks next door first and they were charging $20/person even for the kids! Forget that! 

Here, It has a nice atmosphere for a casual sit-down lunch or dinner or even a nice vibe for a birthday celebration. 
We ordered a lot of food and everything was good...

Calamari (appetizer) - good portion size, yummy marinara and aioli dipping sauces, good batter
Chips w/ Guacamole Dip (appetizer) - just okay and similar to other house-style chips 
Fish and Chips - fresh and crunchy battered fish 
Margarita Flatbread Pizza - just okay 
Kids Menu - super good value...about $6.00 for a drink and one of the options listed, my nephews ordered the cheese deep dish pizza and cheeseburger and fries
Clam Chowder - creamy and lots of clams but not too much other visible ingredients like onion, celery, carrot, etc. but it was still tasty!

Overall good experience! I wish we had a location in Hawaii! Much better than some other chain restaurants we have like Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Been to BJ's in Dallas and S Calf and decided to stop in here with the wife. We were told a 10-15 minute wait and the hostess was right on. For a Friday night, wow! We were seated and offered a beverage right away. We decided on the 2 for $35. I ordered Salmon, my wife ordered the Rib Eye. A little while later, Igor, our server told us there was an issue with a server error and another server took my wife's steak. It would be a few more minutes  before her steak would be ready but my salmon is ready now, do I want to wait? We said, no , bring out my salmon.  The steak was ready 5-7 minutes later. No big deal, but the manager came out to apologize and gave us a BJs Holiday Card worth at least $5. Great customer service and great meal. Igor, our server was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting. We went on a sunday evening, had to wait a little bit for a table but their dining room was full so that was fine. The home brews were decent. My best description of their menu is \"overwhelming\". I understand wanting to offer a wide variety but that is ridiculous. The caprese salad was good but the \"fresh mozzarella\" tasted like it had been cut that morning and had dried out. I had the parm crusted chicken but the star of that dish was definitely the white cheddar mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had the ziti which he described as \"okay\" because the sheer amount of different ingredients caused the dish to lose its identity. Definitely save room for the pozookie desert! Natalie was our server, have had her before at Applebee's, that lady is five star. Our experience was pretty solid until afterwards. Both my boyfriend and I had an upset stomach about an hour after dinner. For me this is not ordinary but he's had three stomach aches in the last year. I can only assume that the cutting boards or other prep equipment wasn't sanitized properly. Willing to give it another try. We will see what happens."}
{"text":"Wow. Cant believe the ambiance herem  Great view awesome staff a menu to die for. Upon arrival at 645 was given a beeper. We were notified with a flash and vibration also had a text sent too our phone how kewl is that. Greeted by a wonderful waitress.
 My wife ordered a tomatoe mozzarella salad and a sour dough bread bowl toasted nicely the chicken tortilla soup was cooked to perfection, next entree was a california burger very juice and thick with a side of fries. I had a small 9 inch deep dish pizza with sausage and a side of cripsy breaded mozzarella sticks and marinera sauce yumm. This place has a special look and ambience .
 Reservation also are availabke.
The menu is LARGE bring a empty stomach it is one of my favorite places now.
  Price for all we had was 64.00"}
{"text":"Shawnda is one of the best servers ever.  She's attentive & friendly.  A must have are the avocado eggrolls."}
{"text":"Have eaten as BJ's locations throughout the country. Was happy to see one coming in nearby. Made trek out there today. Was a disaster in every way. From the hostesses to the servers, no one presented themselves in a customer-friendly way. After more than an hour in the restaurant, I finally received my food...only to be brought something that wasn't what was ordered. Given my positive experience with other BJ's, I'll give them another chance. But if I had to lay odds today, I'd bet this location closes within a year."}
{"text":"I love there late night happy hour. Really good food and drinks. Mojitos and wine are only 5 bucks and well drinks are 4 can't beat that and very fast service too. I'll be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"The only thing we enjoyed about our visit was our server Spencer. He was very friendly and attentive.  He actually seemed to be doing his job rather than congregating with other staff and talking very loudly. This was our first issue. My boyfriend and I were sitting at a booth at the front of the restaurant and right behind us were about 5-6 staff members hanging out and talking so loudly that we could hardly hear each other and pretty much had no choice but to listen to their conversations rather than have our own. 
The food - presentation was great but that was about it. The bread bowl with broccoli cheddar soup was the only thing we enjoyed. My boyfriend ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. The brisket was lukewarm at best but tasted decent. The burger itself seemed like a frozen burger thrown on the grill, looked great on the outside but undercooked in the middle. The bacon was super greasy, like it was thrown in the dryer and put directly on the burger. I ordered the southern fried chicken. The mashed potatoes were good but the chicken was terrible. It way over cooked and hard to chew. We're not the type to send food back, we just probably won't be back. It was almost $40 (pretip) for lunch for two that neither of us enjoyed."}
{"text":"I really want to give them a five star! But I want to come back some more to see consistency.

We sat at the bar right away.  The appetizers took awhile to come but they were worth it! The spinach dip looked soupy but I was surprised! It was really good!

I had the bison burger and my wife had the poke salad. Come from Hawaii the poke was made fr ah and it was oishi (delicious)! The bison burger was so juicy! The sweet potato fries were so good we had to order extra. The fish and chips were golden brown and crunchy. I was very well pleased. Their menu is huge but they don't sacrifice quality!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry hands down 5 star! We went to BJs up north Las Vegas and absolutely loved it! The servers and managers were so helpful and friendly and the food was on point!

Henderson location is the same! Our server was so attentive and we were in the bar area! Even the guy that gave us our food was so happy and excited.  They never rushed us and they made sure that were attended to.

My fish and chips was very crispy and flavorful. The veggie (vegan) was tasty and garnished perfectly! My wife had to have the Poke Salad again and it was just as perfect as before.  We signed up for the app, got a free dessert And started earning points!

Check them out!"}
{"text":"Food has gone down a bit the last few months. If it weren't for the bartender that we typically go see we probably wouldn't bother as often as we do but I know that a place this well known shouldn't run out of main items on the menu that often. Seems like every time I go they are out of something that I want."}
{"text":"I go here when the wife is out of town.  She goes with me many times, especially when a big game is one that we want to see.  We always sit at the bar.  The service is very good, sometimes it might take longer to get our food, but nothing outrageous.  The beers are very good, the home make sodas are tasty.  

The cherry chipoltle salmon is exceptional.  A nice sized salmon filet sitting on a field of cous cous and grilled asparagus.  The calories and fat are very low.  

We love the happy hour pizzas.  Nice price and very good quality.  

We are usually not fans of national chains such as B.J.'s.  But, the menu is extremely broad with multiple healthy choices and the prices are reasonable for what they deliver.

And, in other B.J.'s across the nation that we have visited, the quality is surprisingly similar."}
{"text":"Two stars, Beers where good,water was good. Service was not good at all. Waitress was like she was in a rush to get out of there never got a refill on my water but she had time to talk to the other staff members. Food we ordered a deep dish pizza but tasted like more double bread than sauce and all the toppings, that was not good. We order boneless chicken wings they where over cooked and dry and very crunchy. We also ordered calamari was not good at all it was waaay over cooked also. Thank you BJ was my wife's and I first time going there and I was a bit excited but now after the experience we won't go back. Thanks is for the beers."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight. Was welcomed as soon as we walked in and seated right away. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was so good! Rodrigo was our waiter and he was awesome. Recommended the pazookie after our meal because I had never been here before and we HAD to try it. Everything was great! Will definitely be coming back here to try the amazing selection of beers."}
{"text":"Candies  best waitress  So nice  and fast ..,  we recommend this place  ..  We always go there brunch and dinner .. Nice place"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. First couple visits you couldn't go without waiting 30 plus minutes. Now that it's been open for a few months the crowds have died down especially with Burgatory opening next door. Anyway, this place has a large seating area with a bunch of televisions. They have homemade Root Beer, orange soda, cream soda, etc. The root beer is really good. As far as the food the pizza is very solid and the burgers aren't bad. My favorite though is the balsamic glazed chicken (pictured below). It comes with mixed greens, onion straws and mashed potatoes. You get two decent sized pieces of grilled chicken smothered with balsamic vinaigrette and covered with the onion staws. It's the perfect portion that will make you comfortable full but still have room for desert. I would recommend this dish. The desert are amazing. They have P-Zookies cookies fried with ice cream on top that are to die for. Service has always been exceptional. One of my new favorite spots to go."}
{"text":"I tried to come on a Friday night at 6PM on a Friday night with a party of 3. Call ahead wait was 80 minutes so my party and I decided to go elsewhere after we called back and found out that we weren't even put on the list. 

We tried again tonight with a call ahead wait of 30-40 minutes. What they don't tell you is that the call ahead wait is just putting your name on the list. Your actual wait time starts when you check in at the hostess stand. Okay. No big deal. Except that 30 to 40 minutes has turned into over an hour. Larger and smaller parties who arrived after mine were seated much faster than mine. I understand that it's a Saturday night but it's a little ridiculous. 

We went over after waiting for over an hour and we come to find out that when we called ahead to put our name in, we weren't even on the list. How is it that when I called ahead and checked in with my name and phone number upon arrival as instructed they somehow lost my information?

Service was good but overall slow. Our server was great but it another 45+ minutes to bring out a salad and 2 burgers. The fries that came with the burgers were cold as if they had been sitting at the pass for a while so our server had them replaced with hot, fresh fries. The food was nothing to write home about. 

If you are expecting fast service, this is definitely not the place to come. We definitely will not be back as we have better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"I heard about BJ's in Columbus, so I was excited to try it when it opened in Fairlawn. I have to say I was rather disappointed. We did call ahead seating for 7:30, came and checked in around 7:25. At 7:50, I went to the hostess stand where I had one tell me \"yeah I don't know what they're doing\" and the other tell me \"you'll just have to wait for a table to open\". I know it was very busy, but I did call ahead seating for that reason. So we finally get seated, our waitress comes over completely disheveled, we split a bbq pizza, which we had to tell her 4-5 times as she kept writing buffalo pizza... The food was nothing to really write home about, the pizza was mostly dough and the chicken definitely had not a lot of flavor. Then, the famous pizookie. It's a warmed up cookie with ice cream, delicious, but honestly can be made at home for a quarter of the price. Overall, the staff wasn't very friendly, food was lackluster, and it was so loud that the atmosphere wasn't too great."}
{"text":"Ate there last Friday (we have been there several times before - last time they forgot the chicken in my boyfriend's chicken salad). It was busy but not crazy. It took awhile for our server to greet us and after she brought drinks it took her awhile to come back to get our order. We ordered an appetizer and two dinners, which all came out at the same time. Also, I ordered a second drink which she finally brought as she brought a box for my leftovers. Food was good, but service was definitely off this time."}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars, the wait and the staff not so much. I've been to this location several times and the food is always good. However, what I'm not a fan of is being told the wait is 45 minutes only to be seated shy of 2 hours later. If you can come here at an odd time like before lunch or dinner it's likely to be a quick wait. It's unfortunate they aren't more organized because this could easily be my favorite place."}
{"text":"Way above average corporate food. Beer selection is excellent. Food is good and service is way above average. My only complaint with the place is the menu. Do I really need to read through a 20 page book to figure out what I want? If you're looking for someplace to kickback and relaxed with a good brew and good food; BJ's is hard to beat"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm totally guilty of chuckling at the innuendos. You bastards really bring out my inner 8th grader. I came here during happy hour with a group of around 15, and I'm always pleased to see my large group accommodated. I was informed that during happy hour, all mini pizzas were 1/2 off. I wasn't that hungry, and I'm always hyped for new foods, so I snatched up a menu and looked at the options. I stuck with the BJ's favorite (pretty much the works) and even paired it with their recommended red ale.

The pizza was just so-so. I loved the buttery, deep dish crust, but the toppings were just warm or room temperature, like half of them were thrown on after the pie was already done. Dislike. The beer was spot on, but subsequent requests for adult beverages were met with a suspicious delay...and then the manager came out to make sure all was well. She seems very reluctant to serve alcoholic beverages, as opposed to other restaurants in the same price range that encourage you to let loose. Maybe they think they're classy?

In any case, I had the blonde hefeweizen and the Grand Cruz, which came in a small goblet and packed a whopping 10% ABV. Not that you would guess that by tasting it! You may want to be picky about the mixed drinks, however, as my mojito was pretty bland.

I'll come here again and try more pizzas and of course, more of their delicious beer. I won't stay too long, however, unless I finally come across something enticing on the list of traditional entrees."}
{"text":"It's a nice interior and a decent brew selection, home brewed beers, cider, and sodas (Rootbeer!!) pretty good service and the food is A-ok. This receives a 3 star because it's a generic chain. It's not that I don't recommend it but if you're looking for a burger, beer, mahi mahi tacos, giant salads, or some decent entree - this place is on caliber with Cadillac Ranch. If you dig that kind of place - you'll love it here!"}
{"text":"Only eaten here a few times but really enjoy it. Great drink selection and good service. Nice clean restaurant. Try the jambalaya!"}
{"text":"Solid service, their draft beers & ciders are outstanding, and always good healthy food options.  BJ's is always a good choice for a business lunch, after work beer, or a nice dinner.  I've been to at least 5 locations and always impressed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my review of this place is a combination of 2 visits: 1 being a 4-star, and the other being a 2-star, hence a 3-star total.

I came here last week and met a friend for dinner.  We sat in the bar area were immediately greeted by a server.  She was friendly and helpful.  We ordered burgers, both of which were amazing.  I got the Bacon Cheeseburger with a Chipotle mayo and he got the California burger.  They were huge and I could barely finish mine.

It always seems busy there, but we didn't have to wait on the server.  I actually really like the busy atmosphere.

I came here again with my best friend and goddaughter yesterday.  We were craving bloodies and my goddaughter wanted ice cream so this seemed like the perfect spot.  Right off the bat, the hostesses seemed completely uninterested and in a simple word, LAME.  Their attitude screamed \"It's Easter, I don't want to be here.\"  They were just so blah and unfriendly.  Anyway, after asking if the outside patio area was shaded, she said yes and that there was a table.  She seated us out there at the one table that didn't have an umbrella.  Luckily another table was just finishing up so we moved over as soon as they left.  

We got our bloodies and ice cream and were pretty happy then.  Our server was nice enough and to our surprise, we were on happy hour the entire time so our bloodies were $1 off.  The other thing that would contribute to the 2 stars is that several other tables left as we sat there and no one ever bussed the tables.  It just looked sloppy and gross."}
{"text":"We were referred to this place by some friends for the pizza.  After waiting about 40 minutes to be seated, and another 40 for our food,  we were ready to dive in to our pizza.  The food is good, the atmosphere cozy, the service decent, somewhat pricey. It's not a place I would go out of my way for, but not a place I would avoid or mind eating at again."}
{"text":"I see gat this restaurant is up here twice, but it gets 5 stars and an A++++ in my book!"}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken Pizza and the beer samplers"}
{"text":"Service was just awful 
One Waitress was very good. That was about it. 
Will Not return"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood restaurant that does not disappoint.  There was a wait on a Sunday evening when we went so we just sat in the bar area instead.

The deep dish pizza is really amazing.  It's light and tasty.  Doesn't leave that heavy pit in your stomach after you walk out.

Do NOT get the Caprese salad as the appetizer.  It was average and nothing you wouldn't whip up at home.  Very mediocre.

Don't go out of your way to eat here, but don't avoid it either :)"}
{"text":"What the heck happened?  This place used to deliver great value.  Our pizza was served cold, the wait staff was either over-taxed or out-to-lunch.  Regardless of the promotional discount, I may return, if only for a beer.  The pizza is a big miss."}
{"text":"Good news is the huge portions and familiar American cuisine that is easy on the palate and friendly to all food tastes. 

However, why would anyone want to wait in line for this food is beyond me. Sometimes the lines can be 45 minutes. Do not go there with hungry kids at 5:00 on a Fri/Sat night. You will be distraught over the wait...

Otherwise, I enjoyed it overall, but don't plan to go out of my to head back there soon."}
{"text":"Only giving 4 stars because of the food. Ahi Tuna salad was perfect... beyond expectations actually. My friend got the thin crust pizza which was amazing and not too heavy!!"}
{"text":"I like going there,  but I would love going there if they would bring back their original ribs. These ribs were so good,  melting in tour mouth and not to sweet,  not spicy, then they changed the recipe and now they are so spicy that I can't enjoy them anymore. Otherwise they have great food,  super service."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good. Great server we had. Nice atmosphere and quite busy. Great place if you're a veteran as they offer discounts on special military holidays too.  Recommend stopping in for a bite and a beer if you like them"}
{"text":"I have to come back and give more details  and to put a full review but I will say I had a stellar visit here .. Corena(Korena) not Katrina as formally messed up ugh  was our server who was super friendly and made sure we left happy , full and wanting more ..


I definitely recommend downloading the app and getting on the wait list first and ask for Katrina .. food is always yummy and the drinks are delicious at every bjs but the service has not ever been this good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Food is amazing and so is their handcrafted root beer! You won't wanna miss out on this place."}
{"text":"Nick did a great job getting our orders and drinks quickly. We had an eventful night on the Strip and wanted to chill out for a late dinner out in Henderson. BJ's was a great choice! All the food was so good!

Between three of us gals, we ordered some beverages followed by a Pulled Pork sandwich, Hamburger with Wedge fries, then my (pictured) Swiss Cheeseburger with Skinny fries. With room for dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizookie, which is a must if you eat here!

Over a nice dinner and cool conversation, I can't think of a better place to hang after a typical Vegas night. Great drinks, even better atmosphere, and awesome server! When I'm back in town, I'll be sure to check it out again (aka more Pizookies). :-)"}
{"text":"If Cheesecake Factory and TGIFridays mated and had a baby...this place is it.  But some eclectic menu choices (watermelon and arugula salad) some great looking deep dish pizzas and a huge liquor selection make this a viable option for families w a wide variety of tastes."}
{"text":"They have great deep dish pizza, a huge menu, and large beer selection. But don't come here if you're in a hurry - service is usually slow, and in the couple times I've been it has taken 40 minutes to get my food. The last time they delivered one of our pizzas to the wrong table, so I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to eat. So not the best service, but good food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this particular location. We usually go to the location in Chandler without any complaints.

To start off my experience, I called ahead to see if I could make a reservation for 10 (a bunch of nurses who want to meet up after work, around 8pm when then dinner crowd would be dying down, I would think). I was on hold for 15 minutes while the hostess \"checked with her manager to see if the reservation was possible.\" After 15 minutes of being on hold, I hung up and called back. She apologized that nobody ever picked up the phone and that their paging system is faulty. She then told me that the reservation at time I was requesting would not be possible because they were too busy. I told her to put us down for the earliest time possible which was about 30-45 minutes from my requested time, which we could work with, she also said the bar was first come first serve, so I figured we could grab a beer and appetizers in the bar while we wait for a table to open up. 

When we arrived, I check In for our reservation and told them we would be in the bar waiting. it was pretty busy in the dining room but we were able to find some scattered spots at the bar and high tops. Our server in the bar seemed overwhelmed and had a bit of an attitude. Another part of our group at the bar also said the bartender had a bad attitude as well. 

We had a round of drinks, paid for them, and then our table was ready. The other half of our group had ordered a pizza at the bar, not knowing when our table would be ready and asked if they could take it to our table in the dining room. They receive attitude from the bartender and ended up just eating it in the bar to reduce any problems this was supposedly causing. They could have paid for it and tipped the bartender, I don't really see what the big deal was. The staff had major attitude and we were just trying to wind down after long hard day working with really sick patients. We weren't sure how we were inconveniencing their work and didn't really understand. 

Just bad customer service. Food way okay. My soup was just lukewarm and I had to ask for crackers multiple times."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night with my boyfriend and we both agreed this location has definitely gone downhill in the last couple of years. We both have eaten at this location numerous times before and have been pleased with the food in the past but something has changed. My only big complaint is the food. I ordered an ahi tuna salad which came out with NO salad dressing... like how does a salad come out with no dressing?! Also when my boyfriends food arrived the man who gave it to him spilled his ranch all over his plate and said \"your ranch spilled on the plate\", didn't ask to help or to get another ranch. We both thought it was pretty rude. Ok service but sucky food!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm.    beer.  Tried the porter and red.   Both good.

Then I went  back a month later and had the Chocolate Stout.  That one is the best yet!!"}
{"text":"I've benn there twice and so far so good. I have gotten take out twice for their crispy hobey sriracha brussel sprouts...those are to die for! I crave them, I  will keep going back just for the brussel sprouts! Keep up the good work, perfection takes time and practice."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for late happy hour around 11pm since I didn't work till the afternoon the next day. I sat at the bar only ordered beer. The bartender Matt was extremely friendly and offered a few samples of some of the beer I mentioned I was interested in. The Jeremiah Red is my favorite, and will come back here for happy hour to order food and drinks next time."}
{"text":"Get yourself to BJs. Because the food is that good.  There is something for every person in your group, from picky to somewhat exotic... Seriously: every person!

We had Brussel Sprouts and salads and we looked around at what was walking past our table to other destinations and realized that all pizza is clearly NOT made the same.  It was our remorse - that we didn't get pizza.  Hard to do when everything sounds great.

Our server helped us a lot in our selections and did not steer us wrong.  However, he was a better concierge than he was a server.  Very personable, not so much on the plate removal, drink refill, meal inquiry.

Parking is great, restrooms are clean.

One HUGE pet peeve of mine:  the need to give my cell phone for seating.  You get my cell number, I get a welcome text - which I don't want.  Then I get a your-table-is-ready text while looking at the host/hostess...  right there - hey! whatcha doing!?  Human beings over here!  Look, Look!  Sorry that this is becoming a rant here Yelpers, but for pity's sake make eye contact and act like a host/hostess - not a technician!  I know:  Corporate progress, cutting edge stuff..."}
{"text":"Average, average, average.   Had a few beers and tried several others.  All were fine but seemed watered down a bit.

Had a few apps and they were standard issue.  Meh.

I'd rather go here than an Olive Garden, I guess that's the best way to sum up how I feel about this place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly suprised at how good my steak was! Love their beer too.. definitely a fan of their house hefe"}
{"text":"Came in after a gymnastics event on Saturday right at lunch time. Busy, but seated right away! We had a party of 9 -served by Jessica; she was outstanding!
Had the lettuce wraps, fresh , crispy leaves of lettuce served with a Asian chicken mixture: accompanied by a side of hot mustard & teriyaki sauce!
Really good, wonderful light meal.
Pizza (6 sliced/ med) Pepperoni & had them add fresh garlic and basil.
BBQ chopped chicken salad was piled high to perfection!
Caesar salad was a generous portion for a main meal.
Side order of fries same deal!
Pasta dishes are always on point!
Again, this is the place we always end up. Great service, great food for all. Many options!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight. Special was $10 burgers with endless fries! Offer nightly deals throughout the week.

They have a huge menu)!! From appetizers, burgers, chicken dishes, salads, to completely satisfying lunch/ dinner meals. Great for a group because of so many options!

Devin was our server. He was professional & pleasant.. 

Started with the wings. They've got two new sauces that are really good! Boys had burgers with the fries that \"kept coming\"! Both my guys really enjoyed the Barbecue Brisket Burgers. 


Unfortunately, the only downside of the evening was the very late arrival of our pizookie  For the amount of time we waited, it should have been comp'ed. It is however, such a delicious dessert! Recommend the Peanut Butter S'more. ( see pic)

This chain also offer a huge beer list. Plenty of options for everyone too!"}
{"text":"Been here 6 times now since moving from LA....and never had a bad experience. They have great food, great service, and great beer....thumbs up"}
{"text":"Wanted to have a nice ambiance and good food while on the a business trip here.
Found BJ location quite nearby and it didn't disappoint. I hadn't try there sandwich before so gave a shot for the chicken club sandwich with thin fries. I have to say the bread and chicken used is perfect combo with just the correct seasoning. 
I also tried the italian soda - orange flavor, it was yummy and free refills :)"}
{"text":"Cool concept and good customer service, but for the prices the food is not tastey.  My 
brothers chicken was dry and my salmon had no flavor."}
{"text":"Sam and I go to this restaurant pretty often.  Lately it has been a bit off.   We have had the food come out wrong.  Or cold.  BUT!!   I do want to say that Miriam and Anthony are THE most amazing servers that do their BEST  to make sure that you are taken care of.  We will definitely go back but will request to sit at one of their stations.  Thank You

                                                                                            Sam and Sherri"}
{"text":"READ THIS DISGUSTING COMMENT. I expected Mother's Day to be busy but service and food were still awful. During my dining experience a little boy threw up EVERY WHERE. It took employees a solid 5 minutes to address it even after multiple people had told them about it. Every employee that walked by my table said gross remarks and gave grossed out faces instead of CLEANING THE VOMIT OFF OF THE TABLE AND THE FLOOR. I then witnessed them using rags to clean the vomit up, put the vomit filled rags on THE FOOD TRAYS and re use the rags to wipe down the table. Again, since I said it was busy they quickly put the tables together for a large party to sit down. NOT AT ALL PROPERLY CLEANED. Working in the EMS field, I know how to clean up contaminated areas and using the same dirty rag over and over is not the way to do it. They didn't even mop! The next large party sat down, poor guy hit his legs on the bottom of the table, throw up was on it. He had throw up all over his legs, gross. No idea what's going on.. the manager then proceeds to play dumb and accuse the restaurant goer of coming in here with vomit already on his pants. Ridiculous. The manager definitely knew about the incident, since he walked the kid out. I leaned in and told the dude there was a little boy who threw up. I'm absolutely disgusted, they cared more about service than the health of their guests. I will NEVER dine here again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner for the first time tonight. Probably the last. Semi crowded, got a table kinda near the bar which had extremely loud music playing. Not good for conversation and actually gave me a headache. Ordered mahi tacos, wife ordered similar. Pretty quick service and waiter was nice enough. The food was just so-so, not great by any stretch of the imagination, i.e. not seasoned well and very little flavor, and the servings were pitiful...two small tacos with 5 chips and salsa. Overpriced and not a good value at all. Left there still hungry and feeling a bit ripped off. Went to Trader Joe's for snacks. Will not return."}
{"text":"Happy hour at BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse is worth a look!

Offered on Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 7 pm, and reverse happy hour on Sundays through Thursdays from 10 pm to closing.

$1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails
Half off all Mini Pizzas
$2 off all appetizers (BJ's Snacks & Small Bites not included)

You can only take advantage of their happy hour in the bar area - so cozy up to the booth or the high tables!

For our party of three, we shared three flatbreads and we enjoyed them all!

* Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage \"Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan cheeses, fresh basil with a hint of oregano, sliced Roma tomatoes and a touch of Italian sausage.\" ($8.95)

* California Club \"Grilled chicken, crisp Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.  Drizzled with roasted garlic aioli and topped with fresh diced avocado.\" ($8.95)

* Grilled Chicken Pesto \"Basil pesto sauce drizzled over mozzarella and fresh Parmesan cheeses then topped with grilled chicken, red onions and sun-dried tomatoes.\" ($8.95)

I can't remember which one was my favorite, but I know we were impressed by all of them and happily finished them.

I also enjoyed their Double Berry (10 oz) \"Berry Burst Cider & Lindeman's Framboise\" ($5.95), which is part of the HH. 

It definitely gets packed though during these hours, so get in there early.  We barely got up from our booth when another party was happy to take it over. 

It's a busy restaurant with means the noise level is high and parking can be challenging."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I have been here many times, ordered many things. But the thing you gotta try more than once is the pizza, so good! They have their own microbrews which they make in house, I really enjoy the Blonde ale the most but the seasonal ones are very good as well. Appetizers are good, so many to choose from but I tend to get these artichoke bites that you can just pop right into your mouth. Come for lunch, it ranges from $6-10."}
{"text":"Great spot in the south hills to grab drinks and dinner without having to travel to the city. The prices are great and the portions are good. Always a full house so it makes for a good and energetic atmosphere. Also a great place to watch a game. I love that there are health alternatives and vegetarian options. Good location with ample parking and plenty of food and beer choices."}
{"text":"I came here with my co-workers for a team lunch. We do this every quarter and decided come here cause they can handle large parties and they have a big variety menu. 

When we got here our table was already setup and once we sat down our server was really quick to provide us with our drinks. I ordered the California Burger. I thought that this was really good. Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it. 

As for the service, our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us. 

So overall, I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time. The only regret was that I didn't order their Pizookie. Those are so good. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I've been to different BJ's and really haven't been too impressed with the food but never really tried the Desert Ridge location. 

Nice ambience and very modern looking with lots of TVs. The place was packed and seemed like everyone was having a good time. Pretty loud and I would say normal for a brewery restaurant. 

I had the deep dish BJ Favortite pizza. Let see it had pepperoni, sausage, meatballs, green peppers, mushrooms, & tomatoes. The pizza was good. Nice crust. Soft and chewy but again nothing compares to a Chicago deep dish. So it was pretty good. Not great. 

My wife had the mediterranean chicken pita tacos. She thought they were okay. The chicken was a little dry. My son had the baby back ribs with clam chowder and Caesar salad. He thought it was okay but he did eat it all.  Can you say starving. Of course, we had to get a Pizookie. It's a must. We ordered the salted Carmel Pizookie. It came with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The cookie was warm not really hot but was good. Really liked the dessert. 

Our server was pretty good. He greeted us pretty quickly and took our order. Only problem is that we had to ask for water refills but once we ask he was pretty good in refilling. He did apologized to us because he was so busy. Understandable. He was good in clearing out dishes and did check up on us every once in awhile. 

So I thought the food was okay, service was okay and atmosphere was good. I'm sitting here scratching my head in how BJ's is always so busy. Packed house and waiting line. It was okay at best and we'll see if we come back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with my husband for dessert and a beer. We got the salted caramel cookie desert. It was amazingly delicious!! The service was a tad slow for a Monday night. I might return again."}
{"text":"I don't think the reviews on here do this place justice. Good beer, good food from beginning to end. Very good service every time I've been there, along with friendly waitstaff. The steak was done how I wanted, and the side veggies were flavorful. Was it unique, per se? Not really, but the food is consistently good and filling, the staff is consistently on point, and that's just fine with me. My favorite beer is the porter, and make sure to save room for a pizookie! If you're unsure, get the sampler. They're all delicious."}
{"text":"This is a ok restaurant. The service is par and so is the food. The portion size is big which is a plus. The design of the place is very nice and modern looking. Overall not a bad place but there are definitely better."}
{"text":"Good selection of tasty beers.  I have eaten there a couple of times and we were seated quickly, served quickly, and enjoyed the the experience. Give it a try I think you will like it."}
{"text":"BJ's my go to spot! I live so close by it it's perfect, they do get pretty busy at this location especially on game days the wait would always be 30 minutes longer if you have a larger group but that's understandable! 

The pumpkin spice pizookie is to die for! I love it, not a big fun of pumpkin but the pizookie was so good I wish it wasn't for limited time only!!"}
{"text":"Love the place but they always take forever when it comes to taking orders and bringing our food out, they actually forgot to bring my food out so I had to wait 15 mins after they brought everyone's food out... server was never around we'd always had to ask to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"BJ's prices are fair and we are always happy with their food.  I recently tried the bison burger and was impressed!"}
{"text":"While I am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs, BJ's in Chandler is an exception to the rule. The beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd. The best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around $8.00. Food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok. They also make root beer for the kids."}
{"text":"It's BJ's.. A giant chain so the food is going to be generic and nothing amazing. Even though I only gave them 3 stars this is a positive  review.  I can't say i like the food but i don't hate it. In large establishments, I expect consistency and quick service which they seem to have. I've been a few times and the service seems good. I would recommend it if you have a picky eater because most chain places are made to please the masses. 

I didn't mind the happy hour. Good options for good prices but it's nothing to rave about. 

The parking is decent but a little chaotic. This whole shopping center can be a mess."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tenders and they were good 
The waitress was Nice No Comments about how fast I was done lol overall great restaurant highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went here just today for the first time and I was very disappointed:( I came with my dad, fiance, and baby. I ordered the fish and chips which I know are inherently greasy but this was a whole new level of greasy! I ate 2 out of 4 of the fish and was nauseous before I even finished the second one. My dad ate one and said it was way too greasy as well, we ended up peeling off the breading completely but by then I was over it. I only ate a few fries they were good but after the fish I couldn't stomach very many so basically that was a complete waste of money. I wish I had asked them to take it away and off the bill but I didn't want to ruin our time out. My dad and fiance both had the rib eye, they said it was good. The place was very nice on the inside and the service was okay."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, listed by color and type on menu,which is handy and helpful. Food was great too."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I usually order the flat bread pizza with half a salad, and my husband likes the calzone. They have a drink called the lime in the coconut. . its tasty!"}
{"text":"Clam chowder is kinda salty, service was alright but the hostesses seemed off, boyfriend thought the chicken alfredo was good but I thought it was pretty average. 

Eh?"}
{"text":"Just plain rude! My wife just finished her nights shift at the hospital and stopped by to pick up some gift cards. It was around 10:15am and workers were arriving and she walked in and said she just need to pick up some gift card, they said they're closed and to come back at 11am. How about we don't come back at all! Who the hell says that? Especially at this time of year and with a brand new business."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! Waited 35 minutes to get my food then it was wrong. Didn't feel like waiting another 35 minutes to get what I ordered. Bathroom was filthy! It had no toilet paper and yuck all over it! Will not go back."}
{"text":"First trip to BJ's almost an hour there before we received our appetizer (mozzarella sticks). Another 30+ minutes before we received our burgers. I like them pink but I ordered medium and it was raw inside. We were so annoyed with how long everything took that we didn't even order dessert. Our waitress never once apologized for the delay and took forever to refill sodas. We will not return after how long it took to get an appetizer and our meals. Meal overall for 1 appetizer and 2 burgers took over 2 hrs! Awful experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE. BJ's. Think it will be the family go-to. The offer Gluten Free Pizza, a little pricey as it comes with cheese only, every topping after that is $1. Making a small pizza close to $20.
 It is good, everything our large party ordered was very good.
 The drinks are cold,one was an Irish Rootbeer, tasted like Rootbeer, only made out alcohol. The shits were cold, my Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade Was delicious. 
 As it was my birthday dinner I had a coupon for a free Pizookie, which is a giant chocolate chip cookie pizza. They made mine GF, and didn't charge an up charge. They come with ice cream on top. Our server Chanel brought us extra ice cream! Without us asking! Very nice touch.
 The atmosphere is upbeat and a little loud, perfect for when Kayden wasn't happy. Several tvs on,  and drinking people, all led to a family feel.
 Parking lot plenty large, patio area perfect for walking a fussy baby.
  12 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised by my visit tonight. This was not my first visit to BJ's. At our table of seven chairs, 4 of them were broken. This is a huge accident waiting to happen.   We started out our meal with the calamari appetizer. This was very good. No issues there.  Then with the meal, I ordered the margarita flat bread. I have ordered this before and loved it. Tonight was not the same. I think it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile before it was brought to the table. The last time I remember that it had more fresh basil on it, too. This time the basil didn't even cover the entire pizza and it was not very fresh. I couldn't even taste it. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. She asked for some grated Parmesan on it and they brought her some packets of Parmesan and told her they couldn't find the grater.  Really?  I am giving them 2 stars only because I know how good it can be ... how good it has been.  I don't know what is going on here but they need some serious attention from upper management to get it back to where it used to be starting with the broken chairs."}
{"text":"Good food, awesome pazookis. Fireballshots are a bit expensive at like $8 a pop but it is a restaraunt and not a bar. I got the Pink Cadalliac martini and it tasted like no booze was in it. Overall though, the bar has a nice large TV in it which I was able to glance at. Service was pretty good. About a 20 min wait on weekend nights to get sat unless you can find an open spot at the bar."}
{"text":"What a menu! It reminds me of cheesecake factory (minus the desserts) in the fact that there is literally something for everyone. We had the calamari appetizer (good, not great, but dipping sauce was to die for) and the mozz sticks (better than average) and had a few of their own beers, which were very good. I had the jalapeno burger and sweet potato fries and can't complain at all. The sauce that was on the burger was amazing and I could have used more of that, but the burger was cooked just like I wanted it and the fries, which I normally don't finish, were gone because they were awesome. The others at my table also enjoyed their meals. It was a Sunday afternoon/evening, so it was busy, but there were open tables so we were a little upset that we had to wait over 30 minutes for table but not enough to take this rating down. Our server was very polite and friendly and although she didn't come by often, when she did she got us what we needed. We will go back, possibly to try the deep dish pizzas which looked pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Just doesn't seem as good as it used to.  Menu has gotten smaller, starchier, and less interesting.  The cooking seems sporadic -- Just not as well prepared and consistent as a few years ago.  Things often come out undercooked, burnt, and sloppy.  The ingredients don't seem as fresh.  They no longer seem to carry the seasonal Goliath and Imperial IPA beers we liked.  We still go here now and then, but a lot less often.  I hope they will turn this around and return to the consistency and quality they had a few years ago."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice lunch date together instead of the usual fast food run so we went to BJ's. BJ's isn't a fancy restaurant but it is a little more on the pricier side, but definitely worth it. We usually don't eat so heavily for lunch but we couldn't help ourselves once we saw the menu. We decided on the stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer because we heard a lot of good things about them and they were 100% right. The stuffed mushrooms were so delicious, perfect for an appetizer because the small portions definitely boosted up my appetite because I know for sure that I wanted more. Soon after our appetizer we received our soup of choice, I got the clam chowder and my boyfriend got their chili. The clam chowder was pretty good, nothing too special about it but there was nothing wrong with it either. The chili on the other hand needed an acquired taste I guess because I wasn't very fond of it because of the beer flavor. Since BJ's is a brewery I'm not surprised but it just didn't taste right to me. My boyfriend ate it because he ordered it but he wasn't the biggest fan of their chili either. (on a side note: a different time I went, I had their tomato soup and it was incredibly delicious...since we're on the soup subject.) after we finished our soup we noticed we weren't getting very good service because our server hadn't taken away our appetizer platter and we were done with our soups already, and our glasses were empty. Usually Im not picky and I don't mind but it wasn't busy at the time we went and our table was extremely tiny because it was just the two of us. I felt cluttered and a bit forgotten by our server. We ended up having to ask another server if they could take our plates and refill our drinks because our server was no where to be found. Anyways, when we finally got our main dishes, all was forgotten because the food was literally to die for. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken in lemon cream sauce. The portion was huge but I can't complain because I ordered from the dinner section, but I'm not complaining because leftovers was fine with me. I order an extra side of the lemon cream sauce because it was too delicious not to, and the chicken to sauce ratio was not sitting right with me with the extra sauce. Every bite was dreamy and delicious. The dish came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The two sides went magnificently with the lemon cream sauce. If I could have, I most definitely would have finished but my stomach wouldn't allow it. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya they serve there. I'm not a big fan of jambalaya in the first place so I don't want to comment on it since its already not my cup of tea. We knew about they're famous pizookies but we were way too full from our meal so we got our check, left a little less than decent tip for our ghost server and left. All in all the lunch was incredible. I definitely love this place."}
{"text":"Bj's catered my hospital ambassador meeting. They were about 40-45 minutes later than the scheduled delivery time.

- Chicken breast was tender and charcoal flavor was not overbearing like some charcoal grilled chicken breast can be from other places.
- pizza was warm still, with a crust resembling pizza hut. Less marinara than I prefer, only a thin layer under the toppings.
- toppings are plentyful, and of average quality. Crust was soft, not crunchy, probably due to having sat in a warming bag for a while.
- ribs were ok, a bit on the dry side.
- salad was very basic, with the majority of the lettuce being iceberg (see pic).
- meatballs were very soft, mainly due to the large amount of dough rolled into them, resulting in a diluted meat flavor that leaves them fairly bland.
- pasta was just boiled pasta, marinara was not very flavorful either.
- chicken nuggets could have come from the frozen section of the grocery store.
- sausage was just your average sausage with spices.

Overall, the best parts of the meal were the pizza and chicken breast in my opinion. I don't intend to go eat there in the future, as there was no food item that I had that was more unique than something you could find at a grocery store."}
{"text":"I have eaten at BJ's four times and I am a fan! (I was really surprised by this place, because I'm NOT a big fan of chain restaurants).

The decor is spacious, relaxing, and enjoyable. 

I've had great service on all of my visits, in fact on my recent visit, the waitress had brought out samples of various salad dressings for us to try when we were inquiring about the salad choices.

Once thing I really LOVE about their salads is that they make their own dressings from scratch. I hate places that use dressing from a gallon jug laced with Sodium Benzoate (nothing like that nasty after taste!). The salad portions are HUGE and plentiful (enough for 2 to share OR take the other half home for leftovers).

They are a bit pricey, but they do offer $5.95 Lunch Specials."}
{"text":"Great place to try a variety of beers (and other drinks), as well indulge in a wide selection of food. It's a great place to narrow down your likes or dislikes (order a sampler!). There's really something here for everyone in your family - yes they even have a kids menu and root beer on tap!"}
{"text":"i have only been to Bj's one other time but had no food, and I was very impressed with our dinner tonight. I had the chicken santa fe salad and it had a wonderful flavor and the quantity of salad was ample (the chicken was cut to make it looks like a lot, but in fact was not enough for every bite) our server was friendly and prompt.  The last time I was at Bj's we meet friends for drinks,and because of the design of the restaurant (open concept) it got very loud, but tonight was not bad

I gave 5 stars tonight cause the food/service/price had a good balance for this type of resturant."}
{"text":"We were heading back to Vegas after a day trip to Red Rock Canyon and decided that rather than dealing with the insanity of eating somewhere on the strip, we'd eat somewhere just outside of it.  I pulled up my handy-dandy Yelp app on my phone and found BJ's.  After a few wise cracks about how with a name like BJ's, it has to be good, and then proceeded to navigate our immature selves there.

We were seated right away and our waiter was friendly.  We ordered a couple of beers and the potstickers for an app, and decided to keep it simple with a cheese and tomato deep dish pizza.  Both the beer and food we had were quite tasty.  Back home, the only option we have for Chicago deep dish style pizza is Uno's, and this definitely beat that by a landslide.  It made us want to go to Chicago someday so we can try the real deal for a basis of comparison!

Overall, it was a nice, inexpensive, quick, and tasty alternative to dining on The Strip!"}
{"text":"What's not to like?!  BJ's to me is like Friday's or Applebee's with personally, better food, and way more beer selection. Love this place!

I'm not reviewing any specific time, just thought I should let the world know that this place is awesome.  Always a great choice for dinner"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice now and I've definitely formed an opinion. BJs is a chain restaurant with a decent concept of large beer selections (many their own house brews) & a huge menu with so many options that seem to be executed in a very average way. Not bad but nothing that would ever wow you. And like many chain restaurants you get inconsistencies in service from a very large staff. 

Their Hopstorm IPA is pretty solid and at $3.50 a glass at lunchtime one day, we were pleased. Their lunchtime BBQ plate was very reasonably priced under $7 and plenty of food but the pulled pork slider & BBQ chicken breast were average tasting fare. I'd describe the pesto chicken sandwich I had today exactly in those same terms with the addition today of slow service to go with it. 

We definitely had better service last time at the bar than at a table today. There seemed to be lots of servers running around & standing around but very few people getting food. 

I've heard this place has been super busy with long wait times. Today it was nearly empty and we had a long wait - well over 30 minutes for lunch to arrive. Something to definitely keep in mind."}
{"text":"If you ever want to have your tits blown clean off because of excellent food and even better service, look no further than this BJ's. 

I came in with 12 people about two hours till closing time and expected the staff to be a bit salty, but they were anything but. Our waitress came in clutch and scored us a nice spot that accommodated everyone - she was super friendly. 

Next, David (who I assume is the manager) came in and swept us away. He greeted us in a warm manner and made us feel very welcome. Our appetizers came out quickly and were fuckin' excellent. I swear those mozzarella sticks multiply when you're not looking. The potato skins were amazing, too. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, never had to check if our order was put in correctly, never had to complain - everything was wonderful. When it came time to split the check, things got kind of hairy because we wanted to split one giant ass pizzookie twelve ways - but David was like \"I got you, fam,\" and split that shit up like it was no one's damn business. He was such a sweetheart. The guy taking our cards at the end was hilarious and had a wonderful sense of humor. 

Squad will definitely be coming here again. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"First the good: I love the fact that as a business, BJ's supports groups like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is doing things in October for breast cancer awareness. I like that they have good seasonal brews - the pumpkin ale was quite tasty. They have a sizable menu - and the quality of the food is pretty darn good all around.

However. The quality of the service keeps us from making this place a regular stop. It's just so sporadic - sometimes it's all right and sometimes it's sub-par like today. We were greeted warmly, our server (Erica A) came quickly and when asked for an additional minute returned quickly to take our order. This is where it all fell apart. After taking our order, we saw her only once more before paying our check. I know our $25 order wasn't laden with lucrative alcohol - but no refills on water, showing disappointment when only one of us ordered more than water, having to flag a bus boy for silverware while our appetizer got cold, watching the manager watch the football game more than the service - it all just sours us from coming more frequently. 

It's a place that I'd like to come for happy hour post-work - but I just never feel good about suggesting it with the experiences we've had."}
{"text":"I love love love BJ's!! I've frequented this chain both in Florida and Columbus, OH and I've never been disappointed. The North Olmsted location delivers just as well!

The ambiance of the location is fantastic - it's a large and usually crowded restaurant but I never find it overly noisy, which is nice. 

The menu is extensive and I have tried many things including the jumbo meatballs and spaghetti, hickory brisket and bacon cheeseburger (SO good), almost all of their chicken dishes, and their steaks. I've not had a bad meal here yet. I HIGHLY recommend the chips and salsa appetizer.

Their waitstaff is friendly and personable and their prices are reasonable. I'll agree with other reviewers who say that the wait for food to come out can be lengthy. I don't find it overly long to the point that I get annoyed but this certainly isn't a restaurant that you should choose if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Had the slowest waiter ever.. We were there close to 2 hours.. He took forever to take our order and forever to deliver it.. And when it came out,  it was cold.. Didn't want to send it back bc I knew that would've taken even longer.. Had the Rib eye.. The steak tasted really good and flavorful but I knew it would've tasted better  if it wasn't cold.. Then ordered dessert and that took forever as well.. I'm not sure if Pizookie and monkey bread  are meant to be cold or not? But they were cold and hard.. I've eaten here before and never had any issues.. I noticed all the servers tables waited forever for there food to come out and the people behind me sent there food back because it was cold.. Can't remember servers name? Wish I wrote it down.. He was a white male , bald head and wore glasses.."}
{"text":"The restaurant is set up to be inviting and roomy. The server really loves her job so it made our visit really nice. The food took a long time to come considering it was lunch hour on a work day. I had a disappointing bison burger. The bun was stale and dry, the frozen burger was definitely rare although ordered medium. There was approximately a 1/2 tsp of hatch peppers and two pieces of onion. Really disappointing. Although The server rocked, the system of having runners was lacking. Eight minutes for a coffee reheat and water refill?  Five minutes for the sour cream to come for for the baked potato (which had been requested when order was placed)?  

I will give the establishment a second try to be fair but will not order the burger, tortilla soup (salty) or baked potato.  Will probably go with an appetizer or flat bread."}
{"text":"I choose this place over BWW any day. More great food selection, great beer and lots of TVs for gameday without the BWW crowd. Happy Hour is great here too. Unlike BWW, they don't have happy hour. Love this place and great location."}
{"text":"Great environment n vibe!! Jared B was my server. Although he forgot my to bring my drink that I ordered with my food I gotta give him 5 stars cuz he has a great personality n very friendly. I have been here a couple times but didn't get a server with a great vibe n playful like today. Food was great n drinks cold as I expected. I had a great time today!"}
{"text":"As an avid burger fan and fat ass that loves to eat I have to give this place two stars. The food was average and the wait staff was awful. The server looked annoyed she even had to breathe much less work there and not a fan of the ambiance/environment. Nope. Thanks. Next."}
{"text":"My husband has heard great things about this place from his co-workers. We visited on a Sunday at lunch. It was comfortably busy. The noise level was good--nice background noise, but not intrusive.

Our server was fabulous. One of our biggest obstacles in dining out as a family is that our son is autistic and can only eat chips in restaurants. I asked our server if it was possible to get some tortilla chips by themselves and she was extremely nice about it. Thank you, thank you. A big tip for that kindness alone.

My husband enjoyed sampling the beers. He had the small deep dish meat pizza and loved it. In the bit I had, I could tell the meat was very fresh, the cheese was real, and the crust was good--thick but not as heavy as some places. That was definitely the only meal my husband had for the day!

I had the seared ahi salad. Oh, that was divine. Colorful with a fantastic mix of textures and tastes. I loved the dabs of wasabi at the corners of my plate. I'm grateful that they had a full menu of \"enlightened\" choices with calories clearly labeled; I wish more places did that. I felt like I got to eat out responsibly and have a fantastic treat, too. (To note: I love the ahi salad down at Yardhouse, too, but the two salads vary widely in ingredients.)

We're already talking about opportunities to make a return visit here for a date lunch."}
{"text":"A typical BJ's. A menu similar to Cheesecake Factory. So many items to choose from. Typically get beer and pizza, but this trip it was the baby back ribs. Fall off the bone good. Added the side of sriracha brussels sprouts. Those are awesome. Can't beat the fried brussels sprouts with the sriracha sauce. Came with a large group everybody's meal was perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible service by our waiter, food was very mediocre. The menu was huge, there's a lot of different options to choose from. A very so-so establishment. The \"craft drinks\" were watered down and sugary. I had to send my drink back to be remade which took 15-20 minutes. Very disappointed in my experience at BJ's in north Olmsted."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. We eat here on a regular basis and have never had a bad time or food."}
{"text":"The manager reached out and wanted to make it right because the last visit here they were out of both the prime rib and pork chop.
So about a month later I came back and tried ordering the prime rib again. This time I came at 730p on Saturday.
They were out again hahahahahah. Its so hilarious I came in with low expectations so I wouldn't get upset.  I give up. :(
By the way I ordered the pork chop this time because they weren't out yet."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this location after a long day at work for HH. Not much has changed. The food choices are still extensive....lots of good beer on hand and the service is still as solid as ever. This is probably my favorite location out of this chain just because over the years, they have been consistent and that's a difficult thing to find nowadays.  

I've always liked their fish tacos and calzones. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great service!!  Been to Bj's more times than I can count. Never a bad experience. Pizookie's Rule the World.....at least my world!"}
{"text":"It's always a happy surprise when coming here , either in the way of a seasonal beer or a employee who hates their job. Either way the food is always what I expect And tastes the way I remember. If I want a sure bet I come here. Love the soups and pizza lunch specials and the to go service to your car."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of BJs. This by far was the worst BJ I have ever received. The service was slow and not in a good of way. If your going for a birthday dinner, you might be there to see their next birthday. Never again."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service every time I go. Went in on a busy Saturday (party if 3), during several graduation big parties. We still received excellent service & great quality of food. I will definitely continue to dine here!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Mac and cheese, really awesome, bacon. Corn fritters with a bacon aeoli, also really great, jalapeño gives it the slightest spark, corn adds sweetness. Pub burger w/ bacon and cheese, can't go wrong there. Parmesan crusted chicken, my favorite. It's always cooked perfectly. Staff were great, bringing extra plates since we were sharing everything. Always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Man, I totally made a mess of the evening before, so I had to meet a friend to work out a situation.  We wanted to go to a place that had great food and a great vibe...that I've never been to.  Ok, so I can't lie and say that although we had to talk about something important, a small part of my decision to go to BJs was because A.) I haven't been there, B.) I heard it was really good and C.) It would give me the opportunity to make a review on Yelp :)

This place has a huge buzz, well at least from what I experiences.  True it was on a Saturday night but the place was packed with people, the lighting was hip and the overall vibe made me excited to be there!  They have their own signature brews and offered many menu options?  Uh, yes please!  Our server was quite but didn't a good job.  

For my first visit, here's what I got:

Drinks: A couple of glasses of the Piranha Pale Ale.  It's a hoppy ale and had a snappy flavor.  Apparently this beer took Silver in some American beer festival in the past, so I had to try it.  

Appetizer: For the table, we got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce, served on a bed of Napa cabbage, cilantro, carrots and red onion, all tossed with a fresh, minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping.  The shrimp to everything else ratio was great and the sauce really pulled all the components together.  Sooo good!  A little messy but I definitely looked passed that!

Meal: For my meal, I got the New enLIGHTened Thai chicken mango salad.  Grilled, marinated chicken breast, chili spiced jicama and mango strips, red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens, bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in a sweet citrus-chili dressing and topped with fresh sliced avocado, mint, green onions and sesame wonton crisps.  Trust me, that description was taken from BJs' website, I'm not that good at descriptions, however, I am good at giving my take on it.  Probably one of the best salads I've ever had.  The spiced jicama complimented the sweet mango and the bell peppers gave a crisp texture.  This salad was packed with seemingly clashing components but it all worked well together.  

So for all of you who want to know, yes, we worked out our differences and made a possible bad situation into a completely better one.  I definitely think the food had something to do with it.  The place had a great buzz and I can't wait to come back!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Came for HappyHour ($2off drinks and apps, half off mini pizza) with Angela H. 

I had the Portobello mini pizza (half off during HH) and it was pretty good with a mix of portobello mushroom, carmelized onions, balsamic glaze and thyme. It was crisp outside and soft inside so it was cooked right. 

Off the mini bites I tried the artichoke hearts (not on HH)- pretty tasty. It was perfectly crispy fried and the dip was good with it. 

Service was decent enough. We decided to settle checks and get our pizza packed early but were staying a moment. I kinda wish we had some ice tea still, but I guess if you settle your check, you don't need to be seen to anymore."}
{"text":"The BF and I shared:

Butterfly Shrimp basket. Came with about 12 big shrimp, coleslaw and fries. These were good, panko breaded and not greasy. 

Small great white deep dish- More doughy almost like having pillowy bread with toppings than how Chicago style is. Good though. 

Pizookie Trio- we got red velvet, chocolate macadamia, peanut butter. One plus is they don't skimp on the vanilla ice cream. I've never had these before as I don't really ever have space for dessert. 

The service was great. Our server seemed to know how to pace themselves well in checking up on people and walking by to see if you need more drinks. The BF didn't know they make homemade sodas, but it was no issue for the server to switch to homemade rootbeer from ice tea. They brought us the check after putting our dessert order in so by the time we got dessert, we were all checked out. More servers need to do this! It's awesome not needing to wait for the check. 
 
It's a decent chain specially if you like beers and homemade sodas."}
{"text":"While I am not a fab of their beer, my wife and I frequent this location several times a year either alone or with family for the tasty menu items. They add new healthy options regularly and we have our favorites (BBQ Chicken Salad, Ahi Salad, Shrimp and Quinoa dish and more). Servers are prompt and I have been a Premier member for years using points for discounts on meals. Always busy which is a good sign."}
{"text":"during the lunch hours, they are fast and have great service. I always go to order off the lunch menu because I'm broke! 

I usually order that parm crusted chicken sandwich, which is delicious. Their gourmet Mac and cheese and stuffed mushrooms are great cheap appetizers--I'm always hunting on the cheapest thing on the menu! 

But if you want to spend a little money on the appetizer, I suggest the Ahi Poke. It's one of my favorites.

They never ask to split the check, even if I'm in huge groups, which is why I took off a star."}
{"text":"I just love BJ's. It might be the food, the drinks, and the entire atmosphere, but I adore it. The restaurant is usually full at every location, so it doesn't hurt to make a reservation. 

The Ahi Poke dish is my favorite and that Cheeseburger Pizza really tastes like a burger! The pizookie is super good, I suggest the macadamia one if you like sweets that are not -too- sugary! 
If you're on a budget, try their lunch menu M-F @ 12-3 pm. I think you'll find that BJ's is better than your average restaurant :)"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful! We haven't been disappointed with anything we have ordered. Beer is great. Atmosphere is great. I'm giving a poor review because the service is a hot mess. I've been brought wrong dishes, wrong beverages, dirty plates, no silverware and I'm now 45 minutes into waiting on a deep dish pizza. If they can work out the kinks, this place will be a gem. 

Update: We went back one month later because we just love the food, but... that service again. 
We arrived at 8pm and did not get drinks until 8:30. Salads came out at 8:45 and food came out at 9:15. We received our checks by 10 and got out by 10:15 pm. Their kitchen was slow, the wait staff forgot about us, and despite the great food we have decided that we are done with this place. Sorry BJs- you lost a couple of regulars that will spend their money somewhere that values customers."}
{"text":"We went to BJ's today because we were hanging out with our God daughter that graduates tomorrow. We ordered our food and we figured everything was great. Well about 30 minutes later my God Daughters food comes out and it was chicken wings that she ordered. We were then told that our food was right behind hers. Well 10 minutes later my side order of fries came out with a Santa Fe salad. ( No one ordered a Santa Fe salad)We then explained to the server this wasn't our salad and my husband told her that he ordered chicken wings( plus they had a conversation about the wing sauce).She didn't care that she messed up the order and didn't even try and correct the problem. Then about 15 minutes later I finally received by boneless wings. I looked over at the table next to us that had 4 people compared to our 3 and they were all getting their food at one time. The service was really horrible at this BJ's and the manager didn't care either he asked if everything was ok I explained to him and he was like I will take the chicken wings off the bill. No one ate. We left..the whole bill should have been comped.."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food always. Very clean. Seats allot of people. Our waiter James (Bar seating) knew his menu and what the future menu would have on it. He works very fast but talks as he's moving. Very funny personality. I will definitely ask to be seated in his section next time!
Don't let the crowded parking lot and long  waitlist turn you away. Hostesses get thru the waitlist quicker than any other restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"1-31-18
After a day if rappelling at Red Rock a friend and I went for a bite to eat at BJs. Our waiter Dan was awesome. He took our order after answering a few questions. He refilled our glass many times throughout our lunch. Very nice guy! Food came out promptly. We both got the Wednesday special any loaded hamburger with fries. They were both cooked exactly as we ordered. Very good burgers.
Very clean restaurant. Restrooms were clean and well stocked.  Would definitely  come back when in the neighborhood. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location a handful of times since moving out here. I became a fan of BJ's ever since I gave one a try back in Hawaii. Imagine my excitement when I found out they have a few here(And in Cali)! I've taken a few friends here and it's been a pleasant experience each time. Good food, drinks and service.
Big fan of their deep dish pizzas. They do have hand tossed as a pizza option now. Prices are about average for this type of venue, not real pricey but not cheap. It is also a brewery, so they make their own brews, even root beer and cream sodas.
They do currently have some specials. 2 for $19.95 meal which includes 2 salad or soups, a medium pizza and a pizookie for dessert. Also some lunch specials starting at $6. They do have other items like sandwiches and entrees but honestly, I've never gotten past their pizzas yet hehe. If you have a craving for some good brews n pizzas, definitely not a bad place to stop by!"}
{"text":"Their menu is set up a lot like Cheesecake Factory, they have quite a selection. There are a lot of tvs throughout the restaurant with all different sports playing, great for a guys night. Appetizers are really good but main course fell flat, for me. Everyone says to leave room for their well known cookies and ice cream."}
{"text":"Our favorite Friday date night spot before our movie..The Happy Hour specials are and selections are vast and the atmosphere is great surrounded by tv's.  The service has always been top notched and the wait time is never over 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Christian J. was our server and he was simply amazing. He had phenomenal customer service! He was very personable, had a great sense of humor, and was always on top of it. Thank you, Christian!"}
{"text":"I'll make this as short as possible. We decided to come later on in the night 10ish is when we got to this restaurant and they close at 12. Anyway, hostess was nice and welcoming. Sat us accordingly. We brought our 19 month old baby with us as well. The waiter came over immediately. He was a young nice guy. Can't remember his name for the life of me. I think it started with a J. Anyway, we even engaged in a conversation and claiming he knows about babies and how they are. That being said, after we gave him our order we waited 38 MINUTES for our food!!!! 38 minutes! Are you kidding me? There were 2 other tables in thee entire restaurant!!!! We had no silverware. I had to walk up to another waitress to retrieve them. Our drinks were never refilled. Not once. And being it took that long for our food our drinks were gone WAY before or food got there. He never said \"sorry\" or let us know what was going on. To sum this up... I didn't touch my food. By the time I got done calming my antsy baby down from sitting so long I didn't even feel like eating. My husband and I were both very irritated. We will not return to this establishment again."}
{"text":"Just left the place and no one even spoke to us for over 15 minutes. Five employees walked past, not even a hello. It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon on a Sunday, no excuses. Worst service I've ever had here, sad to say I'm disappointed"}
{"text":"BJ'S Brewery has always been a favorite.   I first discovered them in Tucson AZ.  Today in Nevada.  Great beer Grand Gru"}
{"text":"I went to BJ's when I lived in California.  The one in Cupertino is nice and big.  I had some time to kill before I went to a movie and it was July 4th so some of the other places had closed early.  BJ's was pretty empty.  I bellied up to the bar and the bar tender was there instantly.  She was great!  She gave me a menu and gave me a minute to look over a wine list because, silly me, I thought I would have a glass of wine....what was I thinking?  The bartender told me they had a great seasonal brew so I said I would give it a try.  It was a heif...er.....hief....dang, I can't spell it...but you know what I mean and it was good!!  It has a nice cardomon finish but not overpowering at all.  

I ordered a Santa Fe Salad and it was delish!  Nicely cooked chicken breast and cruncy tortilla strips.  The dressing was good but a little too much of it.  Still I would order it again but maybe ask for dressing on the side.  

The service was stellar.  The bartender, which I could remember her name, was knowledgeable and she was pleasant.  We chatted a bit and she was the same with the other patrons at the bar too.  When you eat on your own it's nice to go somewhere where the service is friendly and welcoming.  They brew the beer here too.  All in all it's a great place with a pretty varied menu and good beer."}
{"text":"We really liked it, it was our first time there.   We really liked the beer, lots to choose from.  
We ordered the Itialian Salad, and the pulled pork sandwich with skinny fries.  The salad was good, the salad dressing that came with it was very light.
But the pulled pork......ummmm, ummmm, ummmm, ummmm ummm!  there was so much that I wanted to try, so I know i will be back. 
Very nice place to go, you can go wih jeans or a suit.....I even saw a girl in sweats.
Deserts looked awsome.....I will be going back one day soon, just to try the desert."}
{"text":"Tonight my friend and I ordered BJ's through door dash. Everything seemed to be in order until I realized my fries were not sweet potato as I requested but that was the least of my worries. Wait.... keep reading... I bit into my delicious looking turkey dip sandwich and was pleasantly surprised by the hearty turkey meat. Wait for it... I'm halfway through my sandwich when I realize my tongue feels a weird burning sensation. I look down at my food to find the culprit and as I turned the sandwich over I realized the bread was completely molded on the underside. Yes, you read that correctly. COMPLETELY MOLDED. I instantly felt a panic attack coming on. I called BJ's immediately and all I got was a 20 something year old manager that didn't seem too concerned. I was offered to have my order comped and that's it. There was no apology or any real sign of embarrassment for the fact that they serve moldy and potentially poisonous food to their customers. I am beyond horrified and angry. You couldn't pay me to eat food from this disgusting establishment again. I uploaded pictures and they can be seen towards the end of their photo gallery... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great staff, good food with lots of selections and a nice selection of beer.
Never had an issue about service, what more can you ask for. Bar is a nice place to catch a game."}
{"text":"Went to bjs the other night and ordered fish n chips to go. Got the fish, no chips. The server was kind and gave a free drink while i was waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Admittedly, we were very excited about the opening of BJ's Brewhouse but our excitement was short lived after eating here several times after opening and being unimpressed with sub-par food and what I found to be unappetizing menu selections. However, a little over a year and a half later, I must admit that both the menu selections and the quality of the food has taken a huge turn for the better. I enjoy their weekend prime rib special, Parmesan crusted chicken, and the Oreo pizookie is not to be missed. Very much improvement!"}
{"text":"So ok, it's a holiday and people are off, but one bartender during a heavy lunch service is ridiculous. And he is doing the best he can no doubt, but shame on BJ's. 
and he is really good. Mgt must have their heads up their ass as usual at restaurants. 
Food, very good. I had unlimited soup and salad. I had chili, broccoli cheese, and a wedge. All very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Weren't planning on dropping into BJ's for a late lunch (or early dinner) but the other place we wanted to go had a long wait. There was a bit of a wait at BJ's for tables but we were able to grab a spot in the bar area with no wait. Server was friendly and food is as expected at BJ's... consistent and fair priced.
Ordered two small plates, the mozzarella and tomato salad and the bruschetta bites. Both were really good and were a nice starter at just a few bucks each.
Ordered the grilled burger melt with wedge fries and Kacey had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Both were good and my burger was cooked just how I asked.
Of course one of the best reasons to go to BJ's is for the beer. I'm a big fan of the Blonde... one of best light beers I've had.
All in all, good service, good food and good drinks... BJ's is a solid option any night."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas from BJ's and they were not delivered. BJ's won't give me a refund and DoorDash, their delivery partner won't give me a refund either. I don't recommend you have anything delivered."}

- Great beer & lunch meal specials, convenient location near Costco, Lowe's, Best Buy, etc.

{"text":"Anytime a new place opens in Mentor it's slammed for the first couple months. Expect about a 45 minute wait. I'll start with the positives. Service, our waiter was great. Space, I really liked the open layout and windows. Decor was cool. Now the negatives: beer, didn't like their home brew. Food: my steak was overcooked and tough. My wife didn't like her seared ahi, dry. Rice, oily. Caesar salad, bland. Queso dip, think baseball concession stand. I hate to give two stars but I can't give three because we're not going back. As my wife said, \"Not worth the money.\""}
{"text":"Jared B. was seriously the best server that I have ever had! He was fun and attentive! The Brussel sprouts were amazing! Our drinks were never empty even our mimosas and I had such a fun time! Great location! Great food! Great server!! Thank you Jared!"}
{"text":"Big place with only a few locations in the Valley. It's crowded and loud for a Monday night but their rewards app allows you to reserve ahead to shorten your wait time. Worth it if you are in the area and plan to visit more than once. The app also offers neat features such as point tracking, mobile bill pay and order ahead. 

As with any large space, it was loud and vibrant. The bar was huge, with TV screens viewable from the dining room. The food was good. We started with the queso dip, topped with green hatch chiles. Everything seems to have a skew towards spice. Very good flavors and a large menu.  I opted for the Ahi tuna salad. My husband had a chicken salad. The tuna was perfect but I wouldn't order the salad again. It was too vinegar-y. Perhaps ask for the dressing on the side next time or for an alternative. 

Our large party was handled nicely by one waiter. They have order pads to keep everyone straight for their separate checks. The only downside was the lack of clearing the table. Nothing was moved off until dessert. 

The desserts they are known for are the pizookies - cookies topped with ice cream. I have to say, those are pretty good. Definitely shareable. The other end of our table ordered a pizookie flight - came with three smaller  cookies with different ice creams. Something special for sure. 

Monday night specials are $5 margaritas and 1/2 off pizza. 

Great for groups and large parties. Not good for a quiet night out. Skip the fish, we could smell a woman's order of fried fish, at the next table. It shouldn't have smelled like that."}
{"text":"This place is always popping in the Centennial area, but it's really because people are too lazy to drive further out and come here cause it's close to their suburbia utopia, not because of food quality.

The service here is always nice and I never have trouble with them, though the pricing here is not equal to the food quality. Even the beers are just \"meh\". That Strawberry Splash though is the business, can't complain about that.
Majority of the time, the pizzas are overcooked and the sandwiches are slapped together with the blandest ingredients cheap budget can buy.

Most of the time I'm here I just get some sort of pasta, you can't really fuck up noodles."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it has a lot of TVs great menu excellent happy hour the staff is awesome people are great. The beer is excellent starter. Tried the fried artichokes and loved it. The jalapeno burger was absolutely amazing. Have another beer and then make sure you save room for a pizookie doesn't matter which one because they're all awesome!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour. It was pretty busy. We sat in the bar area. There was 5 of is and we squeezed into a table, We ordered drinks. I ordered a Mojito. Some of the other people in my party ordered lemon drop martinis , apple martini and the Irish root beer . That was by far my favorite even though it wasn't on the happy hour menu. It tasted like a root beer float! So good! For appetizers we ordered the flat bread pizza, spinach appetizer dip and pot stickers. Everything was good. Portions were a bit for 5 people to share but they were tasty. Service was good  and it wasn't too loud. I will come back again."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating out as a family after discovering our 6 year old has all sorts of food restrictions.  It was a little nerve wrecking but it turned out great.  When we arrived I asked for an allergy menu.  It was super easy to use.  We ordered a gluten free pizza with mozzarella cheese (not the normal 5 cheese blend because my son can't have aged cheeses like cheddar).  The manager, Joe, came out shortly after to let us know they didn't have shredded mozzarella but 'pearl mozzarella balls' and asked if that would be alright.  We were just so happy they could accommodate us we didn't care.  Pizza came out and my tiny eater ate almost the entire thing!  Joe came back to check on us to make sure everything turned out ok.  We were so appreciative of the personalized treatment.  Our server was also fantastic as she was peppered with questions by us about everything.  I'm so sorry I forgot your name to give you proper credit.  Of course, the rest of our food was great and my other two boys devoured all their food as well.  Thank you so much BJs!!!"}
{"text":"Solid Chain Restaurant, always great for late night food when many other places are closed."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. Birthdays, graduation, promotions. Special event we choose BJ's as one of our celebration spots."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Came here for my sons birthday! Chicken parmigiana was good. My sons enjoyed their hamburgers. French fried the best!!! They really love the cookie  dessert! Our waiter was very nice! Good shopping area"}
{"text":"Had burnt Brussel Sprouts. 20min after the meal .. They said that's how they're done. steak medium well was well done.  had to wait for our complete meal. Not a good dinner experience. Pizzookie was good."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Food and service.  Wait time may have been an issue but got in just before dinner rush."}
{"text":"I love this place because they have the most beers on tap in the area. Dead Guy IPA is my personal favorite. 

I've always liked BJ's for their food, but I will admit that I usually go for their high calorie salads, soup and beer...

The Ahi Tuna Salad is delightful and the main thing I get here.
The other things to consider -
Chopped Salad
Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps
Santa Fe Spring Rolls"}
{"text":"Always good.  The Jeremiah Red is the best.  Good prices on food during happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here earlier this week and it was okay. Not great...okay. Prices are reasonable. Service (particularly the bar) was a bit slow and maybe you can chalk that up to being new. I had the Jambalaya which would have been good except it was terribly over spices. I like spicy....this was terribly overspiced. My companion had the shrimp and penne which he said was okay. Again, not great or good....ok. 

On the positive the wine prices were pretty good especially by the bottle....and some good IPA's. 

Very open place which makes it very loud. I am in no need to rush back here."}
{"text":"I am always surprised at how good the food is at this restaurant. They also will give you a baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top for a birthday celebration. You can watch your favorite football games while you enjoy your food. The place is clean and the people are friendly !!!!!"}
{"text":"On July 20th,we took our daughter and granddaughter to BJ's for our grandaughter's 16th birthday. We've never been here before,so we were excited to try it. Well...Audrey happened to be our server. I must say...Audrey was the best server we've had in a very long time. By the time we left,we felt as tho we not only had a fabulous meal..but we made a friend! She is a huge asset to your company! When we return,it will definitely be because of Audrey. Thanks Audrey!!"}
{"text":"Service issues from the moment we sat down. Server brought lemons for our water in her hand. 
Served the red pepper flakes and Parma cheese with hand over shaker holes which seems a little unsanitary. 
Our table conversations were interrupted multiple times. 
Salad arrived with no utensils and our server never returned with them. Had to stop another server for set ups. It was half off pizza night but the bill arrived at full price. Server was full of excuses for everything including being outside in freezing weather? Smoking? With no hand wash on re entry. 
Pizza is normally good but tonight lacked flavor. 
Extra long wait for our desserts despite ordering mid meal ( as we are familiar with the cooking time) One pizzokie was great with beautiful presentation the second which came later still was way over cooked which they tried to cover with a big chunk of vanilla ice cream. 
In the end the manager could not be found. Although we did see him at another table fielding complaints from a family of 5.

Our group represents 3 families who won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They have returned to the pan for the pizza. So I will raise my rating to five stars."}
{"text":"We went to BJ's tonight for a special occasion. It was my son's pick and he chose BJ's Pizza. They always have a great selection of food and a good kids menu.

We ordered several pizzas tonight.  There was a mistake on one in which they put chicken instead of pepperoni. The waitress was so quick to respond. The manager David came over quickly.

I really appreciate how attentive and how quickly they resolved the problem. No complaints, mistakes happen. Our waitress was awesome. And kudos to David for handling it so well and being at our table so quickly.

BJ's Executives,  understand that there are a lot of pizza places your employees make this place very special. Thank you."}
{"text":"I never do a 5 rating.

But... now I do for the new BJ's that just opened up.  Family was there for the soft opening, and we (Alicia and I) went on Monday for the first day.  Quality control.... every server had a corporate trainer/shadow.  Kitchen -- all cooks and su chef had a corporate trainer/shadow.  Manager, Brian Torgerson, was all over the place for day 1... Beverages were as advertised, beers fine and most \"local,\" food well managed in presentation.  

Honestly, I do not like chains... but this one seems to break that mold a bit by focusing on servers with people skills, then training them, and supporting them for nearly a month!   This model/template for chains is to be understand and respected.    

A dozen big screens.  Bar seating excellent.  Great parking.  Visibility from route 19.  ...  

A nice place for many reasons."}
{"text":"Had a burger here before it was awesome
Today  I ordered the bacon burger the server forgot to ask me how I would like it done-she must have thought I like it well ,it came out burnt on one side I asked her for another one this time she said how would you like it done I said medium it took for ever and came out well not a great experience for a $12 burger"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good. Our server Woody was amazing!! I sooooooo love him. So personable and attentive. The calamari, sriacha boneless wings and the pizza were all amazing.  I totally have no complaints. They even have a rewards program. For every $1 you spend you earn points to free food. I also unlocked a free appetizer thru Yelp!  So yes I'm was winning at this restaurant. Stop in and check them out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Today I had the worst experience. I ordered something that's not on the menu anymore. But Bjs still has the ingredients to make it and they just made it for me a couple of days ago, but now they're saying they don't have the stuff to make it anymore. Which is completely fine. But the head manager was so incredibly disrespectful to me and raised her voice a bit and was demeaning. I don't know if it had something to do with my race, but she was completely rude. I can't believe that  bjs would let someone like that hold such a title or position for there company with that kind of attitude."}
{"text":"Decided to try Bjs out again. Big mistake. Got home and my turkey burger had no toppings on it but onion. It comes with a lettuce mix and cranberries also. That was missing. Once again, bjs can't get their to-go orders together. I will definitely not come back ever again. Such a hassle and disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Undecided as usual for lunch so when in doubt, a chain restaurant with lots of variety helps me. Like Cheesecake Factory, a lot of menu items which can be overwhelming. Had a great server to help me navigate and provided some good conversation as I was solo! Location and menu items suited for a large or small group and accommodating."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! I have never had a bad experience at BJ's. Love the variety and quality of food. My favorite dish is the root beer chicken wings, with a side of avacado egg rolls."}
{"text":"My boyfriend likes the split screen TV at the bar otherwise we wouldn't come here. Service is always bad, but I'm hesitant on writing terrible reviews.  Today however, all 3 bartenders had never heard of Campari.  I'm still not sure if they have it, but most bartenders at the very least have heard about it."}
{"text":"This place seems to be the spot we always stop at when we get into town which is every other month. Prices are reasonable, wide variety on menu, appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees and good wine/beer list. The staff is always friendly, the place is typically busy, we never have to wait more than 15 minutes which is nice. One of my favs is the BBQ chicken chopped salad....the thin french fried onions on too make it so good! Good place for a date, meeting a friend, family dinner or to watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed several lunches and dinners don't know why it's not rated better, maybe it's the particular crowd  I'll be heading back very soon"}
{"text":"Awesome top to bottom! Usually something about an establishment pisses me off, but this far exceeded expectations. Big and detailed menu. Great service. Will come again"}
{"text":"Ok so truth be told this is really a 3.5 star but I'm in a good mood. The food is ok, a nice meal, big portions, only a little over priced ( loads of coupons through the app) the atmosphere it's self is great high ceilings, loads of interesting things to look at, huge tvs, for the sports fans I love the lighting. And you get a free dessert in your birthday. The staff is attentive and quick. So why the 3.5 ...., such potential for amazing food, dig a little deeper guys, use the fact that you are a brewery, create some dishes around that. Right. Now you have an average collection of predictable meals."}
{"text":"Staff was not too helpful when I called to ask if they had found my debit card. Eat there but make sure you don't need anything from these guys cause they are not too helpful."}
{"text":"Great place to go in with family and friends to enjoy the great food they serve.  Lots of great brews to pick from."}
{"text":"I was NOT happy about paying for brisket burger with hardly any brisket basically none it was more of a flavored spread. No waiting area (what's called the greedy design) so everyone waiting is standing near those trying to eat! Servers asking you to please move so they can get by. No double doors the cold wind blowing in... My boyfriend liked his food but I wasn't impressed and with drinks (just beer) and our meal it was about 80.00!! Word of advice the happy hour ends at 7 but if you barely get off work and make it there at 630 like me you'll miss happy hour waiting in the way for 30 min plus!"}
{"text":"Busy place in the evenings. 
Server was good.
Food was good. 
I will go back to try something different."}
{"text":"After Flemings next door decided to close early before their posted hours and one of their employees rudely noticed us through the locked door, turned and walked away, well...  my wife and I were going to head back to Westgate where we normally hang out and celebrate our anniversary at another place known for brewing their own beers.   Being outrageously hungry and bored with their menu, we decided to give BJ's a try, and I'm glad we did. 

First of all, the BJ's menu is an employee manual.  Loan document folder.  Car manual.  The thing is huge, and completely disorganized, and flipping through, I became frustrated at the randomness.  I sort of loved and hated it at the same time.  On the other hand, there's something for absolutely everybody in that massive encyclopedia of options, and it's unlikely that even the most ardent of loyal customers will get bored with the selection.  So... +1 on that one, because we'll probably be back a few times.   

The deep dish pizza is about the closest thing I've had since leaving southside Chicago quite a number of years ago.  The BJ's special deep dish nailed it!  Deep dish pizza is a favorite of mine.  

If that wasn't enough, they had Wyders Pear Cider on tap, which I haven't had since my San Diego days.  It's like my two favorite things in one spot.  We really enjoyed ourselves.   My wife ordered the chocolate chip cookie pan ice cream thing - wow, what a desert.  

Two things kept this from being a 5-star.   The \"It's that drink\" drink special tasted awful.  It was like cough syrup, and it doesn't mix.  I expected a lot more, and that drink didn't deliver.  I don't send back drinks as an absolute rule, but I'm confident that if I did at BJ's (unlike some restaurants), my replacement drink would have been treated respectfully.  Still, we just don't send drinks back.  Ever. 

The other lost half-star was because the prices were pretty hefty.  We had an appetizer of avocado something-or-others, pizza, dessert and 3 drinks that came up to almost $100 inc tax and tip.   It just seems like a lot of money for a meal.   But we left stuffed, and with leftovers for the next day.   

The staff was great.  They really worked together.  Rather than \"this is my section\" type of servers, everyone seemed to genuinely work together and check on the customers.  Having worked as a server for a number of years, this dynamic was both unusual and impressive for a diverse group of people.  Loved watching it.  Loved watching people get along.  Class act!  And everybody, bar none, was professional from the hostess, to the waitress, supervisor, manager and everyone else.   

I also notice that management actively reviews and listens to customers.  It shows.  Your staff aims to please, and it shows that you're actively involved.  Nice to see!  

We dined on June 26. 

Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"We arrived 6 pm on a Sunday and told 30 minutes for party of 3. We watched as party after party, including a group of 19 were seated in front of us. Finally told we were next then saw yet another group seated in front of us. We left at 40 minutes and went to Longhorns. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great beer and pizza, Chicago style. The Cajun pasta is also really good. And don't forget to order a Pizookie. Proceeds support cystic fibrosis so you don't even have to feel bad about ordering dessert."}
{"text":"BJ's is always a great place to go eat, and drink if you choose.. Always great service.
Nice menu, popular prices. Lots of TV's.  Love their burgers,. Soup and Salad a greart deal. Salads great,  Just enjoy BJ's.   A solid value. What more can one ask for,"}
{"text":"Friday at 4pm the three of us came to have an early meal. Place was empty upon arrival. The hostess (Vanessa) gathered our menus to seat us when the phone rang and asked if we could wait a moment. No problem. The call lasted for quite a while as we waited. When she hung up another couple came in and she began speaking to them, asking questions, checking them in as we continued to wait. Irritated at the lack of priority we went to seat ourselves (with a comment from another couple saying \"We don't blame you!\"). We told the manager, Wayne,  what happened and he apologized and said he would address it. Ordered our food and pizza, specifically saying no green peppers on the pizza. Our orders came and it was the wrong pizza covered in green peppers.  Waitress apologized saying she told them the wrong pizza and the manager was going to come to our table. He never came and pizza came after the others had finished their meals.  Ordered a pizookie which was delicious but how can you mess up a cookie and ice cream?  I thought after this embarrassment of errors at the very least the dessert would be comped. Nope. Nothing.  Worst service ever to celebrate my little one's Straight A's in school."}
{"text":"Rebecca A. at Superstition Springs BJ's in Mesa is absolutely amazing! We were waiting for our server to come greet us and after 20 minutes of no service we decided to leave. We were walking out and the bartender, Rebecca came outside and apologized. She asked us to come back inside and sit at the bar. She let her manager, Steve know and he paid for one of our meals. We were very satisfied. Thank you for making it right guys! Customer service is everything!"}
{"text":"It's B.Js. I obviously go in with lesser expectations than I would have at a fine dining restaurant but come on just because you're not a fine dining restaurant doesn't mean you shouldn't expect to have  regrets but I always do. I can't complain about the food it's just crazy that it doesn't matter what time of day or night you go how many people are actually in there you are always going to wait wait to get seated wait for your food mostly just the amount of time I wait for even the smallest order aggravates me. You ask me why I keep going. Well because the staff is nice, the menu is so large that everybody can find something to eat. We live in Centennial Hills, the options are limited out here, so I honestly think that's why BJs doesn't step up their game when it comes to production time."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I don't think they train their wait staff.  We waited 12 minutes to get our water and they never dropped off menus."}
{"text":"This place is a chain. The atmosphere is well constructed, even though it is a bar it can feel very intimate. You are separated into small clusters through out and it doesnt seem as big as the venue is.

As for service, they got our order wrong and forgot to put in the appetizers.. before we even had a chance to get upset, the waiter said it would be compted, apologized several times. The manager came by, apologized several times.. wow. I felt really appreciated and the service was great. They do really value their customers!

As for food:
- I got the Scallops - OH MY GOODNNEESS. So good, these are perfection, and in their EnLIGHTened menu. So one of the healthier choices and very filling.
- Like always my eyes are too big for my stomach so I also got the chili. This was alright, nothing out of this world.. and it has a lot of sour cream, so if you hate it as much as i do you will spend several minutes just scooping all of it out. 
-Appetizer: Stuffed Mushrooms. So good! And fancy.. so great!
-My bf got the Hamburger - Now... this is where it all went south. The hamburger was underwhelming, not juicy, not spiced, not anything. It just was a hamburger. Not memorable at all.

Solid 4 stars. And dont get a hamburger!"}
{"text":"We always get great service at this BJ's location.  We were there on a night that was super busy due to a promotion/discount, but we still got excellent service and the food was great.  The manager even checked on us and made sure that we were happy."}
{"text":"We go here pretty often. Always a good meal and little one looooves the skinny French fries and Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"So it's been about 6 months since the hubby and I have been back. I was craving a pizookie . We dined on a slow Wednesday at 5. The service was 10 stars! Matt A. Was our server and wow so attentive. Here's an example of how attentive he was. My 2 year old son was playing with he's straw and \"accidentally\" dropped it. Without any hesitation Matt brought us another straw. 

The meal pace was great as well. We ordered fried cheese curds and they were out within 10 minutes. We ordered our entrees and were out in 20 minutes and then we ordered the salted caramel pizookie. I specifically told Matt to remind me about the pizookie because that's the only reason we're here! It was out in 5 minutes. I'm so happy with the quality and service and I'm more than happy to update my review and give BJ's Brewhouse a 5 out of 5! Please see our food selections in my photos! 

See you soon BJ's!"}
{"text":"Been here before but disappointed this time. I had the Lemon Thyme Chicken. The chicken was very tender but the roasted Brussel sprouts and brown rice were swimming in the liquid. Very sloppy. The flavors weren't that distinctive. Just a mish mash. The chicken tasted more poached than grilled. 

One of our diners ordered her entree when the rest of us ordered our appetizers. When she ordered her enter the server said it was put in with the appetizers and couldn't be changed. Wrong answer!  The server was rather surely. Even seemed bothered that my wife asked flor extra ranch dressing. 

We'll be back but we hope our experience and will be back up to our previous times."}
{"text":"Best to eat here for happy hour!

My friends and I got:
Avacado Egg Rolls. Rating: 4/5
Fried Calamari. Rating: 4/5
Stuffed Mushrooms. Rating: 4/5
2 drinks
1 Pazookie

And the bill tab was only $13 per person - so cheap! They've also got good beer!"}
{"text":"First time we went here, it was amazing. Great food and service. Second visit though- our dinner turned into a two hour sluggish snooze feast with mediocrity on my plate. We went on a Friday night and expected slow service, but the place was not busy, we went late at night, 830pm. Didn't get out till 1030. Our server was nice enough but very slow getting our drinks, taking our order, getting refills, and so on. Then I made the mistake of ordering a piooikie. It was delicious but she should have told me it was an additional 20 min wait for one. I almost go up and left. If she had come over and said something to me about the wait time, this review would have earned another star. Good food doesn't mean anything if you can't deliver it in a decent time frame. I got the seasonal fish and chips and the mushroom salad. Best part of my meal was the five dollar salad. It was amazing. Could have done without the fish and chips. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"This is one of these types of restaurants that when they get busy they seriously don't pay attention to customers.. first time we went it was a decent experience and food came out somewhat quick.. the last time I went food took a good 45 minutes to an hour.. and I ordered a simple Pizza nothing spectacular.. an our waitress was absolutely horrible... She came to check on our table once... That's right in 45 minutes she came over to our table once,.. and it wasn't even for drinks.. probably not going to go there for quite a while"}
{"text":"We had a party of 25 for our wedding rehearsal dinner.  The manager Nikki was unbelievably helpful  along with the rest of the wait staff.   Great food and drink but most importantly Nikki went out of her way to make sure that this was a flawless dinner.  I would highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here in the middle of the week around 7pm, place was Half full and we got set right away. The server was with us and got the drink order on the spot. Great service quick and with a smile. Loved the food came out hot and right on time, didn't have to wait almost. Will come here again next time I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"Why with a the competition for eateries does the food arrive and it's not hot? Flatbread good flavor but barely warm, Mediterranean chicken tacos on pita, great portions but again barely warm. Hamburger with cold cheese. Getting the point here? If it was one of five items barely warm okay but everything was not hot!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few times and everything was excellent. Decided to dine here tonight and ordered the same thing I always do, Avocado Egg-rolls and Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Egg-rolls arrived and they tasted weird. Couldn't figure out what was wrong with them. When the entree arrived, it looked as if it had been dropped on the floor and then re-plated. I pointed out to the server that it looked like a disaster and her response was \"Yes, they do throw allot of stuff in there\". I took a few bites and it just tasted horrible. Sent it back and within a hour I was sick beyond belief. Not sure if it was the egg-rolls or the salmon but I'll never eat here again. They should have better controls to check the food quality before serving it. It only takes one time to lose a customer, especially when you get food poisioning. 

However, the server was very friendly. After I sent the food back she came and told me that it didn't look right (wondering why they didn't see this when they served it to me).

If I ever decide I need a full body cleanse I'll make sure to dine here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Beers are amazing there, the Piranha Pale Ale is definitively my favorite. 
Food is also great, I tried several things on the menu and I never was disappointed. Their lunch specials are very good deals. Refill soups and salads."}
{"text":"Had a deep dish cheese and chicken pizza that was great. Service was horrible from the seating to the server."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. We have eaten chicken Parmesan, southern fried chicken, sirloin steak, and the Ribeye. Each and every time the meals are prepared properly and the food is delightful. The cheddar mashed potatoes are a must have. The kids have enjoyed the kids menu items and the pazookies are a wonderful dessert. This is definitely a value to the neighborhood and a regular eating spot."}
{"text":"Happy Hour:
M-F 3pm -7pm
Sun-Thurs 10pm - Close

$1 off all Draft Beer and Cocktails
1/2 off Mini Pizzas
$2 off all appetizers

It's BJ's.. it's a chain.. anyone from California knows what they're about.  The Happy Hour prices make me happy.  I like the Buffalo Chicken Pizza as well."}
{"text":"We at BearBytes were a table of hungry bears looking for a quick bite before a movie at Harkins. A vast and intense menu drew us in with there being something for everyone. On a busy Thursday evening we were seated almost immediately with a short 5-10 min wait. We ordered hefeweizen beers and hand-crafted root beers with ok results. The beer was strong with hops and the root beers were heavy of sugar and syrup in barely cold mugs. The house salad was very colorful and quite delectable if it wasn't for the tart ranch that smothered it. We were sold on the \"Thursday Special\" and also ordered soups to try something different as well. The Special unfortunately was not as good as we hoped - the ribs were slightly overcooked, the green beans were soaked in a vinegar/sweet reduction that was too overpowering, and the broccoli was super crunchy and not even seasoned (not even with salt). The soup had a better rating with a flavorful taste and well made sourdough bread. The mini chocolate chip pizookie was the best part of the meal with a sweet and heavenly scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The service was nice but when it came to getting the check back with our card it took quite a while with us almost missing the start of our movie. Pricing was decent and the atmosphere was fun and open - but the food was not impressive. We do plan on returning to BJ's to try a lunch service but we are hoping for a more savory selection of options and a better preparation of sides."}
{"text":"This is my and my friends' favorite place to eat! No matter how late, the people are always nice and recommending the best on the menu (as well as the little secrets not on the menu).  This is definitely a place to go with two or more people."}
{"text":"Great place for good food during HH! I invited my picky friends here and they loved the food! Yes yes yes, they have an \"enlighted\" delish menu. BIG thumbs up for that. Menu is similar to that of Cheesecake Factory? super long w/so many choices. We had the shrimp lettuce wraps on the patio and Chicken ala fresca with veggies (minus rice).  It was prepared exactly as asked. One friend had the burger grill which looked super yummy...They even have a \"light\" version of the draft for you beer consumers ;) Overall? Dont let the name fool you, this place is good for a really nice, clean, healthy, fun and chilaxin time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I only tried one of the beers, their porter. It was decent, but it did not really stand out. The salad I ordered on the other hand was very good. It had candied pecans and a variety of greens. The wait staff was also excellent. Attentive, but you hardly noticed they were there."}
{"text":"They will not fill any growler that is not from BJs. They want you to buy a BJs growler first.

This was disappointing because if you walk into ANY other brewery and hand them any growler... They will fill it. 

I'm trying to give you my money. Why won't you take it?"}
{"text":"Stopped in to give it a try.  Sat in the bar area.  
Was looking for Sean K. since he seems to like BJ's!
Service was good but our meal took longer than you would expect. Did not time it, but was more like a fancy restaurant.
Had the Shrimp tacos that have chipotle mayo and some sort of dressing with Napa cabbage, red onions and supposedly cilantro. It come with an avocado cream sauce, fire roasted tomato sals and tortilla chips.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, warm and tender but there was little taste to the sauce or the taco.  Was looking for some of the cilantro flavor and it was none existent.  The tortilla chips were pretty good but was not a fan of the fire-roasted tomato salsa since it just tasted like smoke.  The avocado cream was OK but I wish it had a little richer avocado flavor.  
My associate had the Jambalaya and said it was very good and something he had on a previous visit."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for a couple years now with okay service. But today I had Anthony as my waiter today. He was absolutely amazing. The best waiter I have had hands down in years. He was so attentive, and gave us plenty of options. Hold onto this guy. I will be going here more often because of him. Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"I typically love this restaurant. I recently used their app to order food to be delivered. The app was very easy to use but I was charged twice. I called the store to ask them about it and spoke to a man. He said that he can't see anything yet because it is sent through Uber Eats first then sent to them. I asked him if I should call back after it's delivered. He said yes but he would talk to the manager to see if they know why it's happening and he would call me back if he found anything out. The food was delivered and was great. I called back and asked for a manager. They got the manager on the phone and I told him what happened and that I called earlier. He said that he was the person I talked to earlier and he is still only showing one charge. I was a little confused because when I called the first time he told me he has to talk to a manager and now he's saying he's a manager. He said to wait a few days to see if one of the charges drops off and if it doesn't to call back. I'm hoping this gets figured out but I'm a little bothered by getting the runaround. I really don't want to pay $80 for a $40 meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the friendliest of service.
Food is of consistent high quality.
The only draw back is the noise because of several high volume TVs making conversation difficult."}
{"text":"Ladies luncheon day. Somedays the service be on point and other days I get very slow service. I guess it depends on the influx of customers, the food I will say is always delicious and made perfect. This location seems to have people always training but I'm not a picky person especially when it comes to someone learning. Lots of parking and lots of indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and not to mention those to die for pazookies! But, this time my service was extremely slow. Our waitress didnt have very many tables but yet never had enough time to see how we were doing on our meal. I come for the food, not for the service!"}
{"text":"We love the appetizers (potato skins and cheese curds).  Chicken sandwiches and burgers are great, but we've had the pizza a couple times and it's always a little doughy."}
{"text":"OK I know you can't tell by my reviews, but I regularly eat here. Tonight I overindulged! I absolutely had the BEST Prime Rib that I've had in the last five years. It may seem a little on the high end but it was the best!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at other BJ's and wasn't too impressed. This location stands out for the service. From the moment we walked in, the staff were friendly and attentive. It is super kid friendly. The food came out quickly and was delicious. We also ordered takeout several times with excellent results. Overall, a solid chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the late happy hour, especially when I'm craving a Jerry Burst! Food and service are always good."}
{"text":"Great food as expected from BJ's. Love the Jerry Burst and potstickers. Great service and awesome happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Not even busy.  The greeter/hostess was insistent on putting us in the bar area, after telling her we'd rather have a booth...then directed us to a dirty booth in the bar area while they sat other parties of two who came in after us.  We did not have menus or a server.  I asked the manager for some service and told him our complaints and was told \"what would you like me to do about it?\"...absolutely nothing buddy!  We left and will no longer eat here.  Customer service is a lost art and BJs proved that.  1 star..."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few places for steak that l decided yesterday for my birthday I was going to get a ribeye from BJ's it was the worst piece of beef ive ever laid my lips are first they had to Bring me another state because the first one the girl asked me to cut into it the knife wouldn't even cut through the meat they bring me out a second one it's the same way the managers like well you clearly don't know how to code piece of steak if you have to saw through a piece of steak obviously it's not made properly"}
{"text":"I wish there was a fabulous locals bar in Henderson with consistent affordable food for me to show some love for, but honestly I have yet to find one as good as BJ's ! 

Some updated reasons why I love this place:
*Happy Hour pricing during all football games
*They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck
*Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express, but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain.
*They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast . 
*Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once, perfect visibility, HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching.
*No gaming, no smoking
*Huge menu 

Sadly, it's just a corporate chain, but they are consistent, cheap, and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !"}
{"text":"Stopped in before work to grab something and they had a veggie burger... It was so good... If you aren't that big on eating meat or just want a good veggie burger... Go to BJ's... The potatoes are really good too..."}
{"text":"Update: The general manager interrupted his personal vavation to reach out within hours. He seemed sincere and I suspect the night would have been different if he was there. As stated below, my mom has had nothing but good experiences before this visit. So I'll try again another time and update my review. 

Original review: Zero stars. Went here last night for my 30th birthday with family, party of 11. Long story short, the food was meh. Many dishes came out luke warm so I regretted my choice of Ahi Tuna Salad for fear of poor food handling. No food poisoning this morning and my boyfriend enjoyed his steak. Server wanted NOTHING to do with our table. I was the youngest person there, so it wasn't a group of loud kids or anything. Server was rude from the start and very inattentive so my mother and I complained to the manager after appetizers arrived. I suggested to the manager perhaps we have a different server because I didn't want to pay a mandatory tip if the server was going to be flat out rude. He said he would talk to her. To her credit she wasn't rude to us anymore BECAUSE SHE FLAT OUT IGNORED US FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. NO LIES. We had to flag other severs or her down to get anything. Never checked on is to see how food was or anything. We waited nearly 30 minutes staring at all our dirty dishes after boxes were brought out for any follow up. No exaggeration because we were watching the Cavs game. It was in the third quarter when we started boxing up food and the game had been over for a while before anything else happened. You do the math. Let's just forget we had a cake on the table to cut with no knife, forks, or plates offered to us, or room for anyone to eat it. I honestly just wanted to leave but they wouldn't even bring us the bill!!! We were trapped!!! Finally my mom hunted down the manager and spoke to him privately. She said he had checked in with the server and she reported things had been good since he told her about our complaint. WHAT KIND OF MANAGER ASKS THE SERVER AND NOT THE GUESTS??? He never even walked by our table to even eyeball the situation so I guess he didn't want to be bothered either. He didn't even come to apologize to the table or me that I had this experience on my big night. At the end of the night, there was no mandatory tip in the bill and the manager offered my mother a couple gift cards. I flat out said I didn't want one because I had no intentions of ever returning. Since this was my first visit, I'll leave you with what my mom told me. She said she has been to many BJs locations and even that one and had excellent food and service. She felt the night was ruined by a server that wanted NOTHING to do with us. I'll try a different location since I was given a gift card but North Olmsted will never see me again."}
{"text":"The service sucked. But the fish tacos and Mac & Cheese did not. 

Our server never smiled, checked on us once, I had to ask twice for water, and never got a refill.  Usually, I would avoid us too, but my kids were even behaving today!!  

I love BJs. I hope this is a one time bad time."}
{"text":"I've been here before. It's clean, the prices are decent. Great beer and liquor selection- lots of cocktails. Pretty diverse menu but stick with the pub grub. Service was great last night and we had a big group. Downside, beers a little warm and I tired a steak for the first time. Don't bother. Yes, dear, I ate the asparagus and it was quite good- but the fries looked better. All in all, ik place to go but don't stray too far from the traditional menu."}
{"text":"This was my third time here, and it was ok. The restaurant is clean, staff is nice, and the menu has alot to choose from. 

Unfortunately the new roast beef dip sandwich wasn't very good. The meat tasted like the flat top was dirty? Not sure how else to describe it. We did enjoy the flatbread pizza appetizer, that was good. The beer was good too. 

I would go back, but just not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Delicious pazzokies, definitely recommend getting the sampler of 3 of them. Our server Julian was excellent and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I could eat here at least once a week. They have such a vast menu and I feel that is still haven't tried everything. Love it!"}
{"text":"The interior is impressive and this might be great place to watch a game and grab a brew. However, the food quality is less than impressive. I will not come here again to dine. It is a waste of money for the bland please-everyone generic style of food they serve. No surprise that the menu has everything from salmon to corn dogs to spaghetti."}
{"text":"Enormous menu that the servers don't understand. Equal with the drinks. Food and drink can be good but you have to get lucky."}
{"text":"Never again! Okay, let me start with i am not the type to complain about restaurants in this fashion. Usually i just say \"wow! That sucked\" and avoid the place. But this place needs to hear how bad this was. First, it took 50 minutes to be seated. It's saturday night..it happens. Then it took 45 mintes to get our food. (I had to send mine back because it was cold, of course.) On top of it all we only saw our waitress 2 times in 40 minutes(in the first 10 minutes) because we ordered drinks. Thank god the bartender was on point that night, that was about the only thing that saved our night. By the time our food got to us though the drinks had watered down from us trying to make them last..... never ever again. Also, it took me 20 minutes to pay my check.  All in all 3 hours at BJ's for a burger, pasta, and jambalaya. I'm just done."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of this franchise but at the local Summerlin location. This restaurant by far has the worst customer service. The hostess have no idea what they are doing while standing at front counter giggling. The restaurant is always under staffed for servers and you will sit and wait for 20 minutes with a room full of open tables. After waiting 20 minutes the hostess lead us down a row of tables to a spot the server advised he could not seat anymore people in at this time! I would not recommend this location for dining."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the last four years of sunbirding here in the desert.
I have tried many different things and with one exception have always been pleased.  The service is prompt, friendly and knowledgable.  The house chard is a generous pour.  Their cookie thingie - Pizookie I think - is dangerously nummy!  

Some of my favorites here are the tomato basil soup, the shrimp tacos which I enjoyed last night, the vegetarian pizza in the Light offerings, the turkey burger and the fries.  Any of these are great!   

I'd go back any time.  Always get great value for the money."}
{"text":"So lunch time rolls around, and I get told, \"Hey, we are going to BJ's.\" So at first I thought they were talking about a buddy of mine named BJ lol. Turned out it was this place :) All in all this place was pretty dang good. I got the fish and chips. Nothing super special but they were just how fish and chips should be. Had a go at the Octoberfest brew and I liked it; nice full flavored beer. So I would have to say, I am a fan."}
{"text":"Delicious cider as well as the salads, the salad that I tried was the seared ahi salad, which exploded with flavor!! Sadly I didn't recognize the wasabi and shed some tears lol! Will definitely come back to try more of the great food that is served here!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location. We ordered the balsamic chicken, chicken alfredo, sliders and gourmet Mac and cheese. All of the food was fantastic! We had a few requests, and they were given to us with no issues. I forget our server's name, but he was a very nice young man and did a great job. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Fish n chips was extremely overcooked, also extremely spicy. I don't mind spicy but on this dish just wasn't good. Manager said the cook probably put it in the wrong fryer.  jambalaya had a powder loaded on top of it which ruined it. Broccoli cheddar soup was cold and clumpy. Server was Shanna and she was very nice trying to help me out. Manager definitely should have compensated more for the inconvenience. All she did was take off our dishes (no shit, we didn't eat them.) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Done with this location."}
{"text":"Long wait, but the food has never disappointed.  I give it to the staff though- they started handing out complimentary pizza after we waited for 30 min :)"}
{"text":"Brit was a great server, she helped us make a steak Caesar salad within menu options and was attentive to our needs. Always had a full water which is great."}
{"text":"Man did this place suck.  Sunday night, dead as dead can be.  The only time we saw our waitress was to take our order and pick up my credit card.  We had to flag someone down in the middle of our meal to get some waters (which we never got)

Food was sub par.  Avocado egg rolls were just deep fried guacamole.  It felt like I ate 2 avocados as an appetizer.  One minute after my first bite, we got our salads (now I'm feeling rushed) My wedge salad should have been called \"Sliver Salad\" or \"Molehill Salad\"  Not good.  Wife and I shared a pizza which was decent but nothing like the picture in the menu looked like.

Truthfully, I would have returned all my dishes but there was no one to talk to.  I felt horrible for the table next to us.  They had triplets who couldn't have been older than 3.  They waited at least 15 minutes for the server to come up to them and another 15 minutes to get their drinks.

My wife went to the bathroom and saw our waitress in there on the phone complaining to her friend about rent money.  She'd make that money if she focused on her tables.  We left her 10%.  I walked in planning on leaving her 50%.

We'll never go back again.  What a shitty corporate establishment.

My amber ale was good."}
{"text":"A great place and surprisingly good lunch specials were on-hand at BJ's.  We recovered from a long hike at Red Rock with some tomato bisque and toasted sandwiches, and both the price and selections were great.   We had pretty good service, too.

I still don't quite know what a pizzookie is.  Perhaps it's best left one of life's secrets."}
{"text":"Went here for a mother's day lunch and had nothing to complain about. My dad and I got the same burger (don't remember which one; whatever the most original basic one was) and he was in LOVE with it, although I was not impressed.

My mom and brother enjoyed their meals, and our server was nice enough.

Not much to say. Food was fairly prompt. Certainly a just fine restaurant."}
{"text":"The only item that is outstanding here is the Pizookie. They have a large variety. My favorite Pizookie has to be the double chocolate flavor with vanilla ice cream. I also prefer caramel sauce on mine."}
{"text":"For $25.00 I expected a killer pizza.
I thought it would be drowning in toppings it was not.
In actuality I've had very comparable $8.00 pizzas of the same size in recent memory,  so...

Like the restaurant not the pizza so much."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for a late lunch with my family. My dad and I were immediately sat and we had Athena. She was a delight! She always kept our drinks filled and got our orders right. I kept it simple and got a mini cheese pizza and my dad ordered a crispy chicken salad. Both came in a reasonable time as well. We ended up having a couple more people join us as they were getting off of work. It wasn't an issue to have them join us in our booth and Athena was on point as well with what they wanted as well. 

It's been a while since I stopped in here because for a while our to-go orders weren't correct a couple times in a row as well as a few dine in experiences as well. Glad I decided to come back and had a better experience!  Hopefully I can bring my husband next time and change his mind as well!"}
{"text":"Met a group of former coworkers for dinner and had one of the best meals I've had at BJ's. My boyfriend and I ordered the sliders with cheese & bacon along with the carnitas fries w/ chile verde. The mini burgers were so juicy and delicious! The carnitas fries were so flavorful. They use the shoestring fries but there was one wedge cut fry in there too and it was very tasty! My only complaint was they had onions on top and I didn't know that when ordering, so we had to scoop them off. We had the same server as last time and he did a great job, with the exception of our waters going dry during dessert. We got the Pizookie trio with pumpkin, cookies & cream, and chocolate chunk! Really good meal. 4.5 stars rounds to 5!"}
{"text":"Had lunch 9/1/16.. 1 Clam Chowder , fish taco, dish Titi, 2 ice teas..  bill $38... 
Clam Chowder was Luke warm..  Very Average at best
Dish Titi..  pasta was uncooked, very small portion.. not tasty

Service was rush.. rush.. cleaned off our table before we were 
finished.. stood at table waiting for us to sign bill.. that's a first

Very over priced ..  service and food below par

Very over rated..  it's a shame nice atmosphere

Won't return.."}
{"text":"My first, and last visit to BJ's was earlier this week for my 22 year old daughter's birthday.  Finally when someone came to take our order (about 20 mins.)  As we were looking through the extensive menu, I found dried up food on a page in the menu.  My mom's menu was sticky.  When the server came to the table to take our order that was also a lengthy amount of time.  Once the server started serving the food, it took 20 minutes for everyone to be served.  If we would have waited until each person to be served, our food would have been cold.  The portions to way to small for the amount of money each entree costs.  When we were done I spoke to the manager, Heather, who apologized, but did not other any sort of discount or remedy.  Needless to say my family will not be returning to BJ's after this atrocious after what was supposed to be a celebration."}
{"text":"Another chain restaurant my friends - in the chain restaurant capital city of Mentor.
The beers and beer selection are great. 
The menu is actually good, but the food verrrrry salty. 
Usually so crowded, you may have to go down the street to one of the other many chains."}
{"text":"Firstly I just wanna say I LOVE this place, the food is consistently good and well as the drinks and this review is just about one particular experience at this establishment. My boyfriend and I came in on a weekday night probably around 7 o'clock. They weren't too busy so we were sat right away at one of the smaller 2 person booths. Our server Nick took awhile to get to us, but I'm a server as well and I could tell he was a little flustered which happens to us all. We're pretty patient people so it didn't really bother us. When he got to us we were ready to order everything. We ordered drinks and our dinner. Everything was good, food came out and Nick even came and checked on us. It wasn't until after he came and took the plates away and we ordered the snickerdoodle pazooki(which omg I just die for it's so good) that things took a.. weird turn. While we're waiting for our desert to come out our server comes and drops off ketchup and mustard at the table. My boyfriend and I just looked at it confused and laughed. 15 mins later we're even more confused as a hostess comes by and drops off fresh silverware roll ups at the table. Our server comes over and says \"your food will be right out.\" And my boyfriend is like \" huh? We ordered a pazooki\" and the server is like \"but you still need your ahi salad and burger\" and we were like \"nooooo we already ate dude\"! HE FORGOT WE ALREADY ATE I mean honestly. I've been serving for 5 years and I have not once forgotten my table has already eaten their food. That's not even the end of the story either. After that he comes to tell us that they're out of snickerdoodle so we say we'll order the Oreo pazooki. THEN he comes back and says never mind we do have the snickerdoodle so we'll just bring both of those out to you. THEN a different server comes out and brings an Oreo pazooki AND a completely different pazooki that is not snickerdoodle. And this point me and my boyfriend are like whatever we'll just eat it and leave. THEN our server comes over with the elusive snickerdoodle pazooki and makes a scene at our table saying the other server messed up and shouldn't have brought that to us. Then the other server comes back and they start arguing with each other at the table in front of us. It was incredibly awkward conversation all around. And at this point the whole experience was complete fuckery and it was almost more comical than annoying. After all this no manager comes over, and nothing got comped off our bill. I'm not sure what to end this review with.. umm I guess just don't sit in Nicks section and don't order a snickerdoodle pazooki because your night with descend into chaos."}
{"text":"Yelpers, I'm sure you noticed I'm not a huge chain fan.  Of course with the exceptions of supermarkets and White Castle;) that's my disclaimer!
A few friends and myself dines not far from here and one suggested they were craving the cookie dessert.  Hence, we went. 
The bartender was absolutely friendly and courteous.
Would I return, only if said friend has a hankering for the dessert again. No, I would not venture in on my own and as for that cookie dessert- eh.  It was not even luke warm:(
Last time I was in a BJ's was over 5 years ago.  Enough said:)"}
{"text":"Was there recently and usually when I go everything is fine but this time I ordered chicken wings my usual fave and got the worst food poisioning from them  staff need to retake their health card quiz and know how to handle chicken properly so people don't become deathly ill!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful at this location. I have came here 5 times and it is time for my review. The hostesses at this location are always talking and do not acknowledge customers even where there is not a lot of people, they stand there with no direction. My fiancé and I get to our table the seat was covered in grease and pizza crust. I asked our hostes if I could get a towel to wipe it down and she replyed with \"oh my god\"  and returned half way through our meal with a rag. Our service was absolutely awful like always and waiter got our food order wrong twice. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Same as Chilli's, but now that I think about it, I prefer Chilli's. New Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita was awful too much Minute Maid lemonade and the Mojito, the same; bartender didn't know how to make those drinks. Santa Fe salad, iaaawwkk! :( The chocolate chip cookie with ice cream didn't have good presentation and the cookie was very thin that it was stick to the metal plate in were it was served.  First & last time.."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped at this location for dinner around 5:30 in the afternoon on a recent Wednesday after I had been on a plane all day coming home from a trip out of state. Even though the restaurant was pretty busy, we were seated quickly, and our waitress was attentive and polite. I had an e-coupon from a different location out of state as compensation for a less than great experience from the city I had traveled from, and although, the hostess wasn't familiar with the coupons, she handled it with professionalism and ease. I ordered one of the salad entrees, and my daughter ordered the chicken alfredo. Both our meals were excellent, and the portions were more than generous. I have eaten at one other location in Las Vegas, and had a similar experience. There is a great selection on the menu for both food and beverages, and the prices are reasonable. I like this restaurant, and will go again."}
{"text":"Stick to the beer! Mixed drinks mixers are syrupy sweet! I'm very annoyed with being asked if I am a club card member. I told my husband, nice we'll probably get a crummy seat. The hostess said it was so the waiter would know. Then the waiter came and asked the same question! I said I thought you knew already. I am so sick of these gimmicks!  It reminded me why I stopped visiting here 2 years ago. My husband and I used to come here at least weekly, and were back for the first time in a couple of years. We spent $42 for lunch before the tip! We had a mini pizza and house salad. We shared both items. My husband had 2 beers. I sent one cough syrupy drink back, and had an equally syrupy top shelf margarita. We spent too much money to be treated like we're visiting Costco. I promised myself I like the craft cocktails at Yard House much better, the beer choices are great, and not being asked if I am a member. Probably will be going to Yard House, and not here again!"}
{"text":"Service is wonderful. The biggest surprise has been how fast the food comes out while still being fresh and full of flavor every time."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend yestarday to grab a bite to eat for lunch. The atmosphere was dim lighting, cozy type of feeling.  I was promptly greeted by their hostess and escorted to my both. My waitress was there with in minutes and brought our of waters with in minutes. We wornt sure what to get for a appetizer so we asked the waitress what she would recommend. She suggested the avocado spring we went with her suggestion. They were pretty tasty. What ever the sause that they gave you for the dip was amazing. You literally could drink it tasted so good jkkk. My friend ordered there bacon guacamole cheese burger and subbed the french fries for a soup. She really cheeseburger phenomenal. I took a bite of the burger and it was pretty good. I ordered their California club sandwich at the recommendation of the Waitress and sub the Fry's for there Caesar salad. I was surprised at how big the saled was I couldn't even finish it. The sandwich was very good chicken with season  perfectly . Good portions I would only eat half of it. For dessert we ordered there mint Pizookie which was phenomena. 
The only done side was we waited forever to get out desert. Waited way longer then we should have. We did not mention this to our server. After out check arrived the Manger came over to apologize abiut how long ir took our desserts out. That was very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Sunday fun day Vegas.   Go Miami go.  Sunday's are looking brighter if they can pull out a string of wins.  Bjs.  Thank you for the good food and big screens.   And Patricia.  If your listening.  Thank you for the great service."}
{"text":"Nate is a prime example of the best service you could ever get in the food industry! He is killing it in the game as a server... like seriously this guy made my day so great he made my day for tomorrow too lol #GiveHimARaise #PromoteHim
Definitely coming back for our guy Nate here!"}
{"text":"Been here before and numerous other BJ's. Not sure if I came here on an \"off day\" but neither food nor service was great. Food was just blah this time around and I usually get the same, fried artichoke hearts, chiken  bacon ranch pizza and oreo pizzokie. None of them were as good as I remember them in the past and the oreo pizzokie didn't taste if oreo and it was really salty. Might be willing to try again but with all other options around the area it will be hard to get my business back."}
{"text":"Although previously unknown to me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a part of a large, multistate chain.  Their standards of food and service easily identify this realization, in spite of the fact that it is stated on their menu.

Not to be misunderstood, the turkey club sandwich that I ordered wasn't bad, and the requisite flavors were all there.  Sloppy assembly and plating, however, illustrated the plight of a kitchen slammed at lunchtime and simply trying to move to the next order.  To say that there was no \"love\" put into this sandwich would be an understatement.

Our server (I believe that his name was Johnny) was apologetic- even funny- about how backed-up the kitchen was.  Yes, service was slower-than-slow, but a personable and attentive server made the extended wait somewhat bearable.

Their desserts looked great, and I'm not a dessert eater.  Unfortunately, we wouldn't have had the rest of the afternoon to wait for them.

So yet another restaurant chain is added to the list of those that I will try to avoid in my frequent business travel."}
{"text":"We won't be going back to BJs (at least at this location) for awhile. Our previous trips have been OK, but this past trip the food and service were terrible! My dish had cilantro in it (which wasn't listed on the menu) and I hate cilantro! I picked through the side and ate the fish.  My husband had to send his dish back because it was so spicy he couldn't eat it (and he likes spicy food). In the mean time I was finished so I ordered a dessert. My husband's new dish arrived, and he had nearly finished it before my dessert ever showed up. When we finally got our check they had charged my husband twice for his meal."}
{"text":"To explain my rating, please remember that 3 stars means A-OK, it is not a bad rating, but it doesn't mean excellent either.

A group of 9 of us stopped there just after 8 PM on a Saturday night.  One would think being able to get in to a restaurant at Desert Ridge on a Saturday night would not be easy but they seated us immediately.  The place was full but not packed.  It was a pleasure to go to a place that is not so noisy that you can't have a conversation with the others in your group.  I think part of that is that BJ's was designed with good acoustics.  We were surrounded by other diners but the noise level was well tolerable.

Our waitress was generally pleasant, but we agreed she looked bored, or even upset. She messed up numerous times throughout the meal in taking orders and bringing the right items.  Again, the place wasn't that busy that she was overloaded.

As far as the food is concerned, I give BJ's high marks.  I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants (although BJ's isn't as huge a chain as Olive Garden for example).  The menu is creative and varied and surprisingly inexpensive.  Most of us started with a beer, and we all liked the featured selection.

Although BJ's originally started as primarily a pizza place, they now offer a lot of different types of foods, many of which are not usually found in restaurants of this type.  None of us had Italian food however.  My choice was Cajun Talapia, two large filets cooked as perfectly as you can imagine, over a bed of rice and seved with a spring salad.  The entre was served with a half lemon that was blackened at one end, perfect to squeeze on the fish and salad, resulting in a low calorie meal.  Although the entre was under $10 the quantity of food was quite filling.

Others in our party had burgers, jambalaya, thai shrimp lettuce wraps and a nice Ahi Poke, all of which looked delicious.  Everyone in our group agreed the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  Our only negative was that the waitress wasn't that great.

BJ's is a cut above the typical chain restaurant but not at a higher price.  Just an informal place to enjoy a decent meal with family or friends."}
{"text":"New to Vegas recommended by a local friend was pleasantly surprised! We will definitely come back to  this place as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We went here last night, about 7:30. We were seated right away, no wait!

Our waiter was Shannon, the menu is extensive, lots of choices in all categories. When the menu comes in a spiral binder it just says manufactured, portioned foodservice packs, prepared by less experienced people, \"food warmers\" using Turbo Chef microwave ovens.

The service was sub par, we ordered a Supersalad with Cajun Shrimp, a glass of wine, a cup of hot tea, a bowl of claim chowder, and a Cesar salad, pretty simple.

Our waiter Shannon didn't know anything about tea, we wanted decafe, he had to go ask someone else, he came back with Chamomile as a choice which we ordered. The wine arrived first with iced water, my wife declined the iced water and requested water no ice. Shannon reported all the mugs were dirty and needed to be washed, really who is running the back of the house,  no clean coffee mugs in a brew pub!

10 min. later the salads arrived, delivered by another good server, when the young server asked if we needed anything else, we replied with where's the hot tea? The young lady replied with a shrug of her shoulders \" I don't know you have to ask the waiter\" Wrong Answer, who is training these people? 

Shannon came back and we asked about the tea, he replied he had to  push a tray of mugs into the dish washer, then asked what we were missing? The waiter should know what food arrives against what was ordered, we told him the soup!

The tea arrives, I am already done with my salad which was okay, nothing to brag about. 3 min. past the soup arrives it isn't in a bread bowl like the picture in the menu and it is luke warm. If the soup is advertised in a bread bowl it should be served that way. If there is another option, the waiter should ask a qualifying statement like did you want it in a bread bowl or in a soup bowl? Then seconds later another bowl of soup arrives, which we didn't order, it is luke warm as well.

If you are going for drinks, brews and the like this is probably a good place to go as they have a great selection,  the food is worth the price and the wait staff and back of the house are ill trained."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place for my wife and I. The service and food are always very good. The desert is very good also. We have been here quite a few times and have never been disappointed. Make sure to try the lemon pepper wings and the thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients made for very good food.  Their beer was great especially during happy hour.  Got our food quickly and had very good service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bjs has always been one of my favorite places. On valentine's day my husband and i came here for a quick bite to eat because he had to work. We were notified they no longer had the crispy thin fries. Appalled, but decided to give the new ones a chance. I HATED THEM. lacking flavor and to be honest i'd rather have their cold thin fries over these any day. They definitely will be losing our weekly or even bi weekly visits. Up the price if you're losing money, but don't change something so good."}
{"text":"I had a salad wedge and a basic burger. Both were okay. Bun was large. I only ate half."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and I just have to say the service I had tonight was superb. 5 star to the maximum Luis C our server was top notch other employees need to take notes from him"}
{"text":"A group of us went during the work day in between meetings. We were a group of 6 and were quickly seated in a very comfortable booth. It was 11:45 and busy so the getting a large booth right away was nice. Very pleasing ambience, and yummy smells were noticeable on the way to our booth. Our waiter was nice, but a little condescending. We ordered drinks, and he eventually got it right. Our food came and all were satisfied! I had the fish tacos and they were divine with a little avocado and salsa on the side. Very ,very nice, and very ,very tasty. Others had the giant stuffed potato-they were giant, and loved them. The 2 salads that arrived were so fresh and crisp. The people that ate them said they were delish. It took a little while to get our bill, and then to get the change. At lunch, I'd like to see that happen a little faster as we were almost late back to work. All in all, a nice experience with really good food."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Have been here before and gotten great service, but not his time. Less than  20 people in this place when we came in. Over 45 minutes to get coffee. Service was slow, waitress told us she didn't know we were even there. Wasn't her table. Took over 45 minutes to get our food, 15 min or more to get a refill on our coffee and when our food came, most of it was barely warm and one was actually cold! Never again!"}
{"text":"Need some sort of management here. My review is based upon my inability to eat here. 30 minute wait quoted so we wait 4 adults 2 children. Then after 45 I ask where we are at and they tell me 30-40 more minutes. All the people that walked in at the same time were already sat. So we left. Thanks for wasting our time."}
{"text":"Wait people, wait!!!!  That's all I have to say about this place.  Give it several months to get in the groove before you come. We have experienced all service problems other posters reviewed- in particular a sketchy front desk system and many wrong orders coming to our table.  And the kicker is the place is packed at 3:30 on a Sunday, we had a 1.5 hour wait, we have been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks and there is a gaggle of servers standing right behind us just chatting away.  They are obviously getting to know each other but seriously girls, you are in the weeds!!!  Won't even review the food however menu looks good.  If you have a ton of time and are not easily aggravated then come now.  Otherwise wait for a few months."}
{"text":"New place with a good vatiety of either hearty bar fod or light healthy options.... i  had the spicy soba noodles ...and calamari....the wife had soup and salad and chose from different soups and salads with free refills. ..... there was so mny people wotking there i expected someone to explain about this new place or even ask how everything was but they all kept to   themselves..... the food was great...."}
{"text":"I just love this local brewery tucked away in one of my favorite areas of Summerlin. The food is always consistent and yummy, the service is impeccable(you are truly treated like a guest) and we never leave disappointed.  

Amazing Bonuses:
Their deep dish buffalo chicken pizza
Small Bite Menu (affordable and perfect portions-our favorite is the artichokes)
The salads (I love the Cesar and market)
Lunch Specials
Half off wine night on Tuesdays!

I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious food in a relaxed environment.  Keep up the consistency, BJ's!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, staff is nice, the ambiance is nice, wait time for the food is NOT acceptable. My boyfriend and I were running errands in the area and have passed by this restaurant multiple times and always talked about wanting to try it out. We figured it was happy hour, so why not. We decided to sit in the bar area and to my surprise there were children running in between the tables and chairs! First off, I don't see how some parents let their children run around like crazy in a restaurant. Second off, are they even allowed in the bar area? Anyway, we put our food and drink orders in. We ordered the crispy calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, and boneless wings. We watched the soccer game while we waited (Russia vs Korea). They have a nice huge tv screen right above the bar, so seems like a good place to watch sports. We were both really hungry and ended up waiting OVER 30 minutes for anything to come to our table. Really? Over half an hour for food that are considered appetizers? Thank goodness we didn't order any entrees because who knows how long that would've taken. Of the four dishes we ordered, the avocado egg rolls were the only thing that really stuck to me. Everything else was okay. We moved onto dessert, my favorite part of any meal. We decided to go with the peach and candied pecan cobbler, which was very delicious, but ended up waiting another 20 minutes. Overall, it was just okay. Will I come back? Probably only for the avocado egg rolls and cobbler."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!  BJ'S ON CHARLESTON IN VEGAS

I'm in vegas on vacation (here for a month)  and this  visit to BJ's was  an  EPIC FAIL!!!  
My party consisted of two, we were seated, I ordered a cappuccino and it was delicious and hot upon arrival, however  my food arrived cold and I told my server 3 times that I have allergies (I carry an Epipen). 
I ordered the turkey burger with NO Avocado, NO Tomatoes and NO Cranberries and my friend ordered  a different burger.  My order came with EXTRA Cranberries, Cold french fries and my friends burger was cold along with Cold french fries as well, When we flagged down the server,  and told him about our order, he offered to take it back to the kitchen but due to fear and bad experiences with the food being returned we declined and LEFT!  
The server didn't offer any type of discount or condolences for our loss of appetite and acted as if his mind was on other things, possibly day dreaming of another job etc.   So a waste of $40 and we ended up going somewhere else for Lunch AGAIN as replacement for the food purchased at BJ's.  THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!   

Management needs to take these complaints seriously, if this keeps up this restaurant will have to be shut down for good for lack of business!!"}
{"text":"We love this location. The service we receive from Cinnamon O. is spectacular (being in the industry it takes alot to be amazed by a server). She was friendly right from the get go. She asked us questions and was genuinely interested in our answers. She was accommodating when our party size kept growing. She managed to keep the drinks and the conversation flowing on a football Sunday. This will be our new after work location on Sundays thanks to Cinammon O."}
{"text":"Good ambience, strong drinks, and tasty food. The hostesses were prompt and friendly. Our server was outgoing and very helpful. We got our drinks immediately, I originally got a paradise mule, which was a bit too sweet. My friend and I switched and I drank her original mojito. Yumm! The entree was good. The sirloin was cooked well and the baked potato was crisp oustside and soft on the inside. The wedge salad was very fresh. My friends and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great brunch. Took the family out for Mother's Day and was not disappointed. Planned in another place but line was longer than the unemployment office. Worked out because the food at BJs was awesome. Mimosa was great and actually had champaign in it, usually you get more juice. Anyway kids pancakes where the right portions and fluffy. Only negative and why I only rated four stars is my scramble needed more veggies and bacon, but hey I'm a hard ass! All in all we will be back and I highly recommend the Green Valley BJs."}
{"text":"Large menu with tasty food. Also their pineapple moscow mule and long islands are pretty good. Nice outdoor area and modern interior. This place is good for a casual meal."}
{"text":"A staple of Chandler Fashion Center and my go-to for going out to eat. I have frequented this restaurant more than most people have, and have yet to have a bad experience.

Honestly, it is hard to go wrong ordering anything off of the menu, but there are a few things which I highly recommend: the avacado rolls (warm, fried, slightly spicy, and a little messy), tortilla soup, ANY of the beers, the flat bread pizza, any of the burgers, ribs, french dip, and the pastas.

This place is huge, so I have never had to wait long for a table. I would advise making a reservation ahead of time to skip the line (if there is one). It is also located close to the mall, so this place is a good stop for lunch or dinner (or both)! Great for groups and company outings.

There is outside seating which is very pleasant throughout most of the year in AZ. Try the Red or the Porter as those are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Update time!  

I love most of, if not all, of the food I've tried here!  It's such a huge menu to choose from.  For dinner, my favorite meal is the balsamic glazed chicken.  

I absolutely the adore the sodas on tap.  Black cherry and orange cream are my fav's. 

And the pizookie... well, I just can't pass up a pizookie.  I can't find anything wrong with a warm cookie topped with ice cream, except maybe for how long it takes them to make it (so order early) and how bad it is for you lol.

The downsides for me: dinner, drinks, and dessert at this chain restaurant really add up.  It's not the cheapest.  Also, the service can be pretty slow and the place gets packed.  You can call ahead to put your name on the list so I recommend this if you're going on the weekend.  

I'm so pleased with the food here that I'm sure I'll keep on coming back.  I've had worse service for way less delicious food so I can overlook it..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the holidays. The restaurant is huge but was pretty busy. I had the BJ's favorite mini pizza, which is perfect for one person. The pizza was thick and delicious! For dessert, we shared a pizookie trio. The peanut butter pizookie was amazing. It was cooked to that perfect doughy consistency and melted in my mouth. We also had the salted caramel pizookie and the classic. The salted caramel was delicious as well. Overall, a great place to grab lunch in the South Hills area."}
{"text":"Always eat here with my boys. Love this place. Ate Saturday before Father's Day and had a great experience. I've only had one shortfall in service here once and the one time I did, I didn't have to bring up. BJs staff recognized on their own and apologized on their own!  Great staff and management team here!!!  Always come back!"}
{"text":"Decided it was time for a half-pound burger, had their bacon burger which was very good.  Not a real fan of the ambience and might stop by here on occasion."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to BJ's.  We dined at a time when the sun setting and the shades they have are not sufficient to block it out. We were all seeing spots in our eyes for quite a while  from the brightness. We asked to change our table, and the second one was a little better but there was still too much sun filtering through the shades. they have what looks like wooden blinds in the front of the restaurant that they should also put on the side windows. 

Our server was very friendly, but severely lacking in being observant and listening. She took drink orders for my husband and son, but didn't ask me if I wanted anything. 

I ordered a dinner salad with chicken. Son had a steak and husband had a quinoa bowl. I am a rather slow eater, and my family finished before me. The server came over and asked if we were ready for dessert. I was shocked, as I was clearly still eating. I told her I was still enjoying my salad and she said the pizzookie takes a while, so we should order it even though I was still eating. Well, here I am eating my dinner and less than 5 minutes later the food runner brings this hot cookie topped with ice cream over to our table. I called our server over and told her I was still eating. She asked me if I wanted a box for my salad. I said no, and SHE TOOK IT RIGHT OUT FROM IN FRONT OF ME! MY FORK WAS STILL IN MY HAND!  She also left the check and told us to have a good evening. 

When she came back for the check, I told her I was shocked that she insisted we order dessert while I was still eating and that she also took my meal before I was finished. She smiled, asked if I enjoyed it and made no apologies. When I asked for a manager, she said she was new and would get in trouble, left the check for me to sign and we didn't see her again. 

My son said while the steak was good, he felt a little queazy after the meal. I enjoyed the salad, but would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to finish it. I hope a manager reads this and responds appropriately."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on here but the managers need to step it up!!! Brown lettuce on the wedge and the roast beef sandwich was like crap as well. BJs is normally very good but it sucks today. Most likely the B team is working today."}
{"text":"I can't speak for everyone in our large group as far as how they felt about their food, but my fish and chips was the WORST I have ever had!! I love fish and chips and order them often. It doesn't even have to be that good for me to enjoy! If we weren't there with a bunch of my hubby's co-workers I would have returned it!! I didn't even take the leftovers home despite having a convection oven to reheat it it up perfectly. The waitress took the entire meal and never even questioned if there was a problem! Also their \"tarter sauce\" is runny!! I will say the wedge fries were very good! My husband was \"okay\" with his food. I am not interested in ever going back."}
{"text":"BJ's is one of our regular spots.  The craft beers are always good, the food is good, and the service is good as well.  That's what we like about BJ's, it's consistently a good place to grab dinner and you know what to expect."}
{"text":"I love the customer here, it's kind of slow but overall it's great. Terry the handle an issue I had with an take out order that really made my day."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. Have been to BJ's twice now, this was the second excursion Actually give the food a 5 and service -2.. This is a new BJ's for the valley. Will say out of the box the menu is vast and all offerings at great. Both of us had salads..and they were fantasic...so no quams about the food...My rub is w/ staff. This is a new restaurant and hoping they are just working out the bugs so will see in the future. Our hostess met us and we as she said \"strolled\" to our seating..It was a very, very slow stroll. If I had known where we were being seated I would of walked past her. We arrived at 4:20 pm..my concern was if we would get to our seat before the dinner rush. Other rube was severs/wait staff are overly attenative. She must of interupted us 7 times during our 1 hr dining experience..she was way over the top. After she presented us w/ the bill she actually returned 3 times w/ in a 5 min period to try and collect.  Be watchful where your seated. If your adverse to small children/tikes around you..I come for a pleasant dining experience. If you are seated in the area furtherst from the bar area you might find yourself in a child day care area, with screaming children and parents who think thats cute....Don't bother asking for comment cards to express your concerns they don't have any."}
{"text":"First time to BJ's, glad they are opening a store up north on Centennial!!
This place was awosome...Monday nite visit, place was jammed, but only had a 15 min wait. Very nice decor, very expansive therefore very loud. Server was great...beer selection is huge, took sometime to select a few brews. Ordered a two appitizers, potstickers/avacado spring roles both were really good. Ordered a Southwestern pizza, more than enough for two people, actually took 4 pieces home.Finished off w/ a pazookie..1st time it was wonderful. Somehow would like it if the could create a creme brule pazzokie!!...For being a chain  they are years ahead of TGIF,Applebees,etc.......Great for brews and food"}
{"text":"We are a regular at this particular location.  It is a great place to hang out.  

The portions are large and we frequently share a dish.  The atmosphere is enjoyable.  It is a sports bar that actually feels like a nice restaurant.

Great value.  We go there once a week."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with this branch of the chain. We visited one in Florida and had a really good experience.  Not so much at this one. Not that it affected my food but the floors were slippery like someone had left soap on them. That was the initial impression. Not the best start.

The wait staff seemed pretty burnt out and they were busy. Our waiter was probably one of the best and made sure our appetizer came out on time and our drink orders were rapid. He had to go get the chili to go with our queso because the kitchen didn't put much in but he made it right. 

I got a flight of beers and it was good. Wife's mixed beverage was overpriced and weak. 

Entrees were a big disappointment. Seared ahi tuna salad was half-heartedly slapped in a bowl and presentation looked like something I could have done at home. Tuna was chewy in several places and wasabi crust was not evenly distributed. I ordered this dish because I had it once before and it was awesome...not so much here. Greens were not rinsed well and led to an overall disappointing meal. Pizza was average, piadina was average...average average average. 

When shelling out $100 plus for a family dinner, there are 10 other places in the immediate area I would recommend over this place."}
{"text":"Went here last night for deep dish pizza. My wife, being from Chicago was having withdrawals, so off we went. We really do like this place in general, though the parking can be horrific. We started with the chicken won tons; Thai style and they were wonderful. When our pizza showed up and we began to eat, my wife loos at me and says \"is there any sauce on your pizza\"?\" Nope\", I said and we waited for the waiter to return. He said something to the effect of, well do you want me to have them put more sauce on it or are you going to eat it like it is. I said, well we'd really like another pizza, this time with sauce. The manager comes over a few minutes later and says something about \"miscommunication\", apologizes and asks us if we ordered it without tomatoes. No, just standard sausage pizza we said. Well, she explains, \"our pizzas are lightly sauced\" (apparently before they have fully risen) \"and sometimes it soaks in or the top rubs\" (against what I didn't ever understand) and may have accidently removed some of the sauce\". So we had to sort of pick apart the pizza in front of her, while she gave us that condescending \"not really a smile-smile\" as if we were mentally challenged, to show her that what we got was essentially cheesy garlic bread with sausage. She wouldn't even glance and it...just kept that artificial smile on her face and said \"let me know if there is anything else that I can do\". As opposed to the nothing that you have already done you mean? That was my inner thought, not to worry, I didn't actually say that. SO, by and by our replacement pie comes out and the waiter says\" don't worry, I told the kitchen \"extra sauce\" and watched them make it. Wonderful, now we got a pie that more resembled spaghetti. Just soaked with sauce. At this point we just give up and ask for our check. The waiter then tells us that due to the pizza issue, we would like to buy you desert. No thanks, we said. He brings us our check and announces, I had that pie taken off your tab (we had a couple of beers and an app as well, so  I wasn't paying that much attention to the total), until my wife pointed out that there were two pizza's on the check and that they took one of them off. I don't bother saying anything at this point, as free food was not what we came for, but I will say this. There would have been one heck of a ruckus if they had charged me for two pizzas. Just a crazy, out of body dining experience. Almost as if they were on the other side of the Dome."}
{"text":"Yuck! Worst meal I have had in a long time. The entire experience was bad. I walked in t this restaurant and was greeted by a nasty hostess who had the worst attitude. What a B*&$%!!! I had to complain and the manager came right over and apologized right away. 

Ordered the Potato Skins for the app. Since when do you deep fry potato skins? These were deep fried with no cheese, bacon or green onion. Just plain with sour cream sauce. Blah, gross!

Next up came the meal. The BF ordered the BBQ Beef Sandwich with coleslaw. It was so bad he could not even choke it down. Usually he can eat anything, so this had to be bad. He said it was the worst tasting sandwich he had ever had. Mine was the Angel Hair Pasta that I have ordered several times here and it is usually good. The chef didn't drain the noodles so the bottom of the bowl was full of water, there was no sauce at all, just a few canned tomatoes and trust me, all I could taste was the metal from the can and a half of teaspoon of feta. This went back immediately. They brought me a bowl of their famous clam chowder to replace the pasta. Hahahah-- famous clam chowder?? You have got to be kidding me. 

The only good thing was the beer that we had. They have their October Fest beer now and of course their famous Jeremiah Red. Funny how they are famous for so many things. NOT!!!"}
{"text":"Recently came to BJ's for the first time. The host was so friendly and made conversation with us on the way to our table. Our waitress was awesome & very helpful; you could tell she knew the menu well & was familiar with everything. She even informed us about signing up for the BJ's Reward's program & then getting a free Mini Pizookie! I went to the BJ's in Henderson the next week & was not disappointed there either! One of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"I do not get the draw.  Always packed, mediocre food and service.  Are we THAT desperate for a decent restaurant in the East Valley that we have to resort to this place?"}
{"text":"I only gave it four stars because of the chocolate chunk pizookie.  Sometimes I go to BJs at least two to three times a week just to order the pizookie. I LOVE IT. 

Other than that, BJs service and food is mediocre."}
{"text":"BJ's is a great place to have some good food and a great dessert which is a pizookie.  If you have been in the Eastern location, then there isn't much of a difference in the Summerlin location.

I ordered the Mahi-mahi tacos which consisted of two tacos, nachos and a dip.  I really really liked it a lot.  However, it needed a little more of the sauce to put in.  Brad T. ordered his favorite pizza the buffalo chicken.  Lastly, we ordered a white & chocolate pizooke.  As always it tasted amazing and chocolate-ly."}
{"text":"Service is wonderful! Easy to get a reservation with the app. We ordered the new Enlightened menu. Dear husband had the Peruvian bowl with chicken and I had the spicy peanut with soba noodles and chicken. The chicken was over cooked in both dishes. Both had great flavor. Mine was not spicy, I added red pepper flakes to kick it up!  And of course we had the Pizookie!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 1 stars because of our excellent server Jeremy.  I ordered the BBQ Ranch Chicken salad.  It was the worst salad I ever had.  did not want to complain seeing my friend was buying me lunch.  the lettuce was soggy to the point that it was mushy and wet looking like a noodle.  I could hardly find any chicken on it and the taste was very bland.  and then I heard our server tell the next table that deep dish is Chicago style and I grew up in Chicago and trust me it is a very thin crust with ingredients covered in cheese and then cut in squares.  Deep dish did not catch on till the 70s.  so since BJ's says its Chicago style, they could learn a lesson on history of pizza there.  but all in all I am sooooo disappointed in my salad, that I had to stop for a burger a few hours later cause I only ate wilted lettuce for lunch.  yucky  It is making me wonder if I will ever return there again for any meal."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been here. I remember fond memories of this place, but this time around, I am beginning to wonder why. On several occasions I was told to go for the happy hour because they are suppose to be one of the best. 

With a dollar discount off of appetizers, I cannot say I am too impressed. Alcohol is not that cheap either; beers range around five dollars, dollar off of certain mixed drinks, and $4.25 for well drinks. I can think of many places that offer  better deals. 

We started with a platter of potato skins, which were made perfectly. They were golden brown and remand crunchy even as we slowly ate them throughout the two hours we sat there. The sampler seared ahi is just that, a small taste, so do not expect a lot.  

The real savings is if you decide to do the individual pizzas because they are half off. The pleasant memories of this deep dish pie is nothing close to the past. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. The crust was mediocre. It had a crisp edge, but the center was too doughy.  I usually can tolerate Chicago style. but the lack of sauce and dryness of the chicken made everything difficult to get down. 

My friends ordered the mac & cheese, a bacon cheeseburger, and a chili cheeseburger. They were all satisfied with their orders. The chili cheeseburger took ten minutes longer than everything else. We were shocked by how many people apologized for the delay and the manager even stopped by to tell us that the burger would be comp. Even though we didn't think too much about it, this gesture was really impressive. As one friend recounted her disappointment with the pizza the last time she came, I should have took it as a hint to not order it and go with something else. 

We ended our dining experience with a chocolate chip pazookie. The cookie was a bit on the raw side, but I didn't mind it. Eating cookie dough was always a bad habit I had as a child. With two heaping scoops of ice cream, it disappeared fast."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to here to BJ's for lunch on a Sunday afternoon our meals were fine, but when you order fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli you'd at least expect to get what you ordered, we'll I received 1 piece of BROCCOLI, I was very disappointed because the picture on the menu shows broccoli all over the place, and    The waiter didn't notice that, that's even more sad ! His service wasn't very good either, he seemed to want us to hurry up because we weren't making our ticket big by ordering everything he was recommending, if we do return I hope we're not served by that waiter again !

Like I said the food was good, just they need to pay a little more attention to detail and remember this is Las Vegas, we expect out of this world service !

If management would like to know, we have our receipt !"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Samplers of beer are fun to try and their specialty/seasonal stuff is very good"}
{"text":"So this wasn't our first choice, or our second choice, or even our third choice. But it was lunch time on Mother's Day (I know...good timing), so we took what we could get without having to drive around town. They were really busy (I know, big surprise!), but they took really good care of our large party, the manager was our savior that day! The food was typical BJ's, I've eaten here before, Fridays/Chili's chain type food, it's average but not at all what any of us wanted (it's not their fault). 
I was in dire need of a cocktail at this point, I got the Tickled Pick, a bit sweet but good. We all shared some of the Children's Captain Crunch French Toast, it was good but you couldn't tell it had Captain Crunch on it:( I ordered the Shrimp Tacos for lunch, they were surprisingly better than expected.
South Eastern Avenue has such a wide array of food choices I doubt I'll be back anytime soon, but it works when your stuck between a crepe and a closed place. (Inside joke)"}
{"text":"This is a great BJ's, our waitress has been awesome.  The service here is and has been . We've landed the same waitress twice and we're so happy. The food has also been good and definitely recommend coming here for lunch. 
We got seated pretty fast, so that's pretty good."}
{"text":"I normally love BJ's, but had a bad experience at this particular location.  Husband and I walked in last Saturday afternoon around 2:30 pm for lunch.  The restaurant was not even 30% full, and the idiot hostess tells us it will be 10-15 minutes for a table to be cleaned off.  There were THREE girls \"working\" standing around the hostess doing nothing.   We called her on it, and the hostess proceeded to make all these excuses why it takes 10-15 minutes to clean a table!  Of course we walked out.   OMG!!"}
{"text":"Main Points:
-Variety of beer and food
-Good portions on dinner menu
-Great for groups

Review:
If you're looking to grab some food outside of the mall's food court, consider stopping into BJ's. They've got a very extensive menu with various types of cuisines, so it's sure to suit everyone in your group or the individual who just can't decide on one food type that sounds good. 

I've tried several things on the menu in the past, and I've thoroughly enjoyed their signature gynormous potatoes, tasty beer, and melt-in-your-mouth pizzookies.  If you're looking for something with a little bit of spice, try their jambalaya - not sure how it fares with authentic cajun cooking, but it hits the spot.

I may have to give the lunch menu another try, but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch, Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school, Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special, and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor.

Despite my lunch experience, I'm giving them a 4 because my past meals have been consistently good. I like the variety of food and beer, good service, my fav dishes,and the convenience of the location, and their ability to accommodate groups."}
{"text":"Conveniently located and never had any problems with service or quality of food. good in my book and it's somewhere my girlfriend and I go regularly."}
{"text":"If I had written this review earlier, it would have been 5 stars.  After last week, they get three.  We had visited on some very busy occasions and each time, the wait time was reasonable, service was good and the food was great.  The bf loves all the brew choices and would be happy to dine here everyday of the week!  

We have tried items from their Enlightened menu, keep in mind even though the calorie count is fairly decent, the fat content is still pretty high.  We tried both the salmon and the chicken/spinach quinoa bowls and both were very tasty.  We also tried the barbocoa chicken and the Asian chopped chicken salad, delicious.  My favorite meal here was the bison burger served with tasty slaw.  The bun was perfectly toasted, the meat was a perfect medium well.  Not from the Enlightened menu, the bf had the clam chowder in the bread bowl.  Best bread bowl ever.  Amazing.  One time, we even tried a calorie laden Pizookie.  

With all these raves about the food, why only 3 stars?  As fans of the restaurant, we had downloaded their app and used it on our last visit to get added to their \"preferred wait list\". We were given a 40 minute wait time estimate, so we planned our arrival time around that.  When we arrived, there was only about a dozen people waiting.  We were told, so sorry, but the app doesn't really work and we should have called instead.  But they would do their best to get us a table in about another 20 minutes.  We went shopping at Trader Joe's and then decided not to wait for BJ's and went elsewhere for dinner.  Wouldn't you know, we had finished our meals when we got the text from BJ's that our table was finally ready.  Needless to say, we have not been back.  After being open for 2 months, customer service should be improving, not going downhill.  You give a guest the expectation of being seated in 40 minutes and you can't deliver that in over an hour and a half?  Ha."}
{"text":"My family and I drove 30 long minutes to come and enjoy the delicious smores dessert. I was devastated to learn that the smores dessert as been obsoleted from the menu. As Mr Wonderful would say, you are dead to me."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars. I had the ribs, French fries and house salad. 

The ribs were delicious, not dry or old. Not that much meat on them so you need to order a full slab. Bbq sauce was good. Nice sweet flavor. 

The shoe string fries was delicious as well. 

House salad was ok. I'm just not a big fan of spring leaf lettuce. 

Server forgot somethings we ordered also seemed like she was irritated with the fact that we had questions about the menu as it was some of my guests first time there."}
{"text":"Not a great experience....we have been to the Boardman OH location and really liked it....here not so much.   Very nice waitress but burnt, really burnt appetizers...steak ordered medium was raw inside burnt outside.  hubby ordered captain n coke for 2nd one stated they were out so he ordered something else....then they found it?  Hubby got pasta and meatballs...meatballs were mushy 
:( Was told 30 minute wait, it ended up being 50 because the amount of call ahead seating....will not be back"}
{"text":"BJ'S has been our go to neighborhood restaurant since its nearby. The food is good but I've noticed each time we go there's always a difference with taste, quality, or presentation. It'd be great if these cooks maintain their menu the same way its prepared. My husband and I like to order the garlic parm wings and some visits it'll be perfect and crispy. Other times it'll be soggy with no sauce or seasoning?! We enjoy the great white and bjs favorite deep dish pizza. 

Great white is an alfredo sauce base pizza with chicken breast, cheese, tomatoes, roasted garlic, and mushrooms... soooo yummy! 

Bjs favorite is pretty classic. Red sauce, meatballs, pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, olives,  onions, and tomatoes. 

You can order their pizza by halves so you can try 2 flavors or what have ya! 

Three star rating because their service ain't consistent. We would order ahead and put ourselves on a waitlist. Upon arrival, we are still waiting at the lobby.. what's the point of the app sometimes. Well the app is good to download so you can earn points and get discount rewards in the future. Also, an option to order for curbside/takeout if dining in is not an option for you.

Pazookies are their popular dessert. It's a Warm baked cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. They got various cookies to choose. (Chocolate chip, oreo, peanut butter, etc)"}
{"text":"I like coming here for free pizookies on peoples' birthdays.  Other than that...this place isn't extra special or anything.  It's just kind of one of those places you go to because you can.  I like their broccoli cheddar soup too though.  Its consistency isn't too thick and not too watery.  This place is actually really nice during lunch time hours because their lunch menu is reasonably priced and there are a ton of selections.  When I was in high school, we used to go here before games and stuff and it was a good go-to because of all the selections.  The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff at both west side and henderson locations are always really helpful.  Food-wise, it's kind of like better than Denny's?? I like it, but it's not like OMGARSH WE HAS TO GO HERE. Sometimes I crave it, or it's just a place my friends and I can hang."}
{"text":"The best Jalapeño burger in town!  Deep fried Jalapeños a half pound burger that is cooked to perfection!

I have had it three times and each time it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Well - I tried to make a large party reservation. The hostess said I needed to speak to the manager. A few minutes later the manager got on the phone and said \"he could not do it\" I asked what he could do. The manager said he could only do a parties of 5 reservation. I then suggested that was fine we would break up the group accordingly He indicated that would not work either. I asked if it was a staffing issue. The manager said no. I felt by his tone  he was being bothered rather than being apologetic. Not a good first impression for the new Mentor location. The manager's nearby competitor was happy to accommodate."}
{"text":"BJ's rarely disappoints. It is a good place to go when you aren't sure what you are in the mood for. The menu is small enough to make your decision easier, but varied enough to ensure you don't get stuck with something you didn't really want. Our last trip here, we sat at the bar and received great service. My fiance had the gourmet five meat pizza. He said it was delicious. I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. This is probably the best thing I've had from here. The fish was cooked great and perfectly seasoned, but the real star was the pineapple fried rice. I'm not always a fan of sweet and savory combinations; however, this rice was phenominal!"}
{"text":"Came in at 4:45pm. 300 people waiting for a table. Hosteses clueless. Told wait was 10 minutes. After 45 and the line not moving we walked out."}
{"text":"Great beer on tap.  The menu is very large and I found it to hard to choose!  If you are looking for great beer this is your place but pass if it is a great meal you are in search of. My review is based on similar to its price range."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see myself reviewing conglomerate type restaurant like BJ's.  However my most recent experience inspired me to take a few minutes to spread the gospel on some great things that most people are probably missing out on.

First off their fish & chips have the most uniquely delicious batters I have ever encountered.  I don't know how they do it, but the batter is flavorful, crispy and surprisingly flaky.  It absorbs the malt vinegar or lemon juice while still maintaining its crunchiness.  Every other beer batter I've tried, the vinegar or lemon juice just glides right off and makes the batter soggy.  They've learned how to break the laws of physics with this magical beer batter.

Second notable item offered at BJ's is their Irish Root Beer, which is their micro-brew root beer mixed with Jameson, Butterscotch Schnapps, and Bailey's.  The drink comes out frothy, messy, and overflowing like a great root beer float.  If you've never tried it before, you don't know what to expect when you taste it.  The best way to describe this flavor of this drink is with words from that guy in that Daffy Duck cartoon.  BJ's Irish Root Beer is... \"Amazing! Marvelous! Stupendous! Colossal! Tremendous! Gigantic! Astounding! Unbelievable! Spectacular! Phenomenal! And it's good, too.\""}
{"text":"Honey Siracha Brussel Sprouts are a must. Great beer, great staff, wonderful experience. Jambalaya is awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I wait.
Its approaching 30 minutes that I have been waiting (no exaggeration) for the $5 Mac and cheese.
The couple next to me has had a drink and then ordered and then got their food before me.
I'm not really sure why I haven't asked for a refund yet..
Its sad because the food is really good.
But I feel like the biggest sucker every time I come here.
They are consistently slow with the service and food delivery.
Its to the point where I have made friends with other people eating here because we start joking about how sad this wait for our food is.
I've given them the benefit of the doubt a few too many times. 

This location seriously needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Service is always terribly slow. Pizza is mediocre. Never wear heels- super slippery floor!"}
{"text":"Try the spinach stuffed mushrooms! They are to die for. Even better, Roy was an amazing bartender. I'll definitely be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner. 

Juicy Moroccan Salmon with some fun nuts to join it. The stuffed mushroom appetizers also really delighted our mouths. 

Such a friendly waiter. 

Would definitely come back next time to try the beer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided that he wanted to have his 22nd birthday dinner at Bj's, it made sense because we were going to Dave and Busters afterwards. I called about four days in advance to make a reservation for 15 people at 8:15pm. I spoke with a manager and everything was worked out. We arrived a little early, around 8, and were told that our reservation had been changed to 8:30. This was unbeknownst to me which was irritating because they had my number on file and I had 15 hungry people showing up expecting to be seated at 8:15.

Well, unfortunately this was just the start of things! We didn't ACTUALLY sit down at 8:30, we didn't even get seated at 9! We sat down to eat dinner around 9:15, PERFECT! By this point most of us were tired and mostly just wanted to go home. Personally I didn't even care about the fact that I was hungry anymore. So they assigned two servers to our table because we were such a large party which made me happy, I thought that would mean better service oh boy was I wrong! Our drinks took 20 minutes to come out, seriously? So we all put our order in and instead of entering all of our orders AT ONE TIME in the computer our servers entered them at randomly different times so all of our food came out randomly. Now let me add that everyone in this party has either served or worked in the restaurant industry before and we all know that when there's two of you, bringing 15 people drinks and appetizers should NEVER take 20-30 minutes. Now as far as the food goes, EH. Mediocre at best. The Long Islands were ten dollars and they tasted like shit. I had a five dollar Mai Tai and it was probably the most delicious thing I had all night! The ONLY thing I can give them credit for is their spinach artichoke dip, that was heavenly.

Now we had all planned on leaving Bj's around 10:30 because Dave and Busters closes at one on Fridays. We didn't even get our checks until 11. SHOCKING. So we didn't end up walking out the front doors until 11:30. I was furious to say the least.

All in all, I would NEVER EVER EVER reccomend this place to ANYONE or EVER come back here again."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great!
Brandon has a big booty 
PHAT if y'all know what I mean.

No but really..

This location is slightly off the strip in a great location. Happy hour is murder! It took everything I had to reject one of their amazing looking cocktails. I will be back to try each margarita on that cocktail list! Mark my words =]
Brandon was adorable, helpful, patient and very attentive. Even with a full row of bar booths. 
From one industry person to another. Well done Hun."}
{"text":"Samantha was our waitress and she was AWESOME. It was a busy night because of the VGK game but she was so on top of it. Super happy and helpful. We had a great experience."}
{"text":"We have been twice over the past month. Had never been before. The first visit, service was poor. Waiter serving us was very low energy and just didn't seem to want to be there. The waiter serving the table next to us was running circles around ours, and smiled. The food was salty, salty, salty (beef sliders and the turkey dip) The draft beer menu is impressive. I ordered the Nutty Brewnette which was really good. Once we gave our main course order, I ordered a \"flight\" of beers. I literally asked for the flight to be sent along with main course 15 seconds after ordering. This seemed to annoy the waiter who said \"it's already been sent, I'll let them know.\" This was an odd claim because the waiter hadn't left our table yet and we were very close to the bar. On our second visit, the service was great. Our waitress was on point, energetic and welcoming. Unfortunately the food was salty again. I ordered beef sliders which tasted good, but one of them was literally the size of a quarter, like as if they ran out of beef. We also ordered the boneless wings which were terrible. The level of salt was truly unlike anything I've ever experienced. I drank plenty of water and could not finish even though I was hungry. If they could step up the food quality a bit and show some enthusiasm and knowledge of the craft beer menu, I'd be happy to give them another try. Sadly, I don't think we will be back a third time. They should try to emulate Gordon Biersch in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been to this BJs location several times and their food is a solid 4. They have great appetizers, main dishes and desserts, not to mention a good beer selection. What makes this place a 5 though is the service from Savannah, who has taken care of me several times when I've sat at the bar. 

Savannah is one of the best, if not THE best server/bartender I have ever encountered. She's friendly, attentive, and so knowledgeable about the menu and restaurant as a whole. She always makes sure any substitutions are always accurate and any time I ask for an additional side of ranch, etc. she is never annoyed and always delivers with a smile. I've had other servers check out once you place your food orders, but Savannah stays right with you until the moment you leave. I'll always sit at the bar if I see her!

When it comes to the food, I've had many solid meals here. From the honey-crisp chicken salad, to burgers and tacos, to the occasional brunch with eggs and pancakes, I've never had a bad experience here. Not to mention their pizookies are sooooo good. Their own beers and cider are delicious too. Anytime I'm in the desert ridge area I'll stop by!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! 

The pazookis are ridiculously amazing. Seriously a must have. Yummy pizza :) 
I always end up getting beer, appetizers and of course the pazookis. Excellent customer service no matter what time. I usually end up here with the girls around 11pm and they are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"BJs is always amazing! Tonight we had a server named Jared S. Excellent service :) he was engaging and prompt!!! We waited for about an hour to be seated; it was well worth it to get excellent service!"}
{"text":"We love BJ's. Great date night place. Highly recommend the chicken Alfredo with broccoli. It's delicious. And always save room for the pizzookie. The cookies and cream one is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been to this BJ's once, and it was a good experience. However, it seems that being new, this location needs some time to figure out what they're doing. I've been to another BJ's, which had a much different vibe to it. The food, like any chain that knows what it's doing, is consistently good, and the menu is huge. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu, but I can't say this is one of my favorites (yet)."}
{"text":"Our first experience here didn't go very well, the waitress spilled an entire tray of drinks on my husband, they offered him a free T-shirt!  We haven't been back since.  So when my husband decided to give it another try, I was a little hesitant.  

We got a couple of appetizers, a flatbread pizza, which had fresh mozzarella cheese and sweet tomato sauce. Garnished with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  We also got the crispy fried artichokes.  It was lightly breaded artichoke hearts fried crisp and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Both of these were very good.

For an entree, I got a good old bacon burger, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, smothered with their special sauce.  It was juicy and very good.  I love bacon, so if I would change anything, I would add more bacon!

Service this time was very good, I enjoyed the food, my husband was disappointed with his choice of entree, the old fashion pot roast.  He said it was truly \"old\" as in taste, he felt it was the left overs from the night before.  

But the menu had some nice looking items, especially deserts that we might have to return for."}
{"text":"Jared was awesome! This was my first time to this location and it was really nice. Most other ones I have been too seem very crowded and not a lot of space but this location is spacious in the bar and restaurant area.  The food was great as always, the service was awesome and the atmosphere was good.  My aunt goes a lot and she was surprised how empty it seemed to be but even with a few larger parties and people sitting near us, it was not overly noisy!"}
{"text":"Solid place I always love BJ's... Either get the balsamic chicken or the Parmesan crusted chicken always a good choice don't forget the Brussels sprouts!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a lot. Lol. Every time we come we enjoy another entrée. They have homemade root beer and other cool products that are homemade as well as a magnificent amount of different beers. Please save room for your favorite dessert Pizookie. It is always busy and a bit load but the food and beverages are worth it. Make sure u use there app to checkin in before you leave for the Resturant."}
{"text":"Ok first of all any and all dog friendly restaurants get 4 stars. Bjs also happens to have a wide variety of tasty eats and they brew there own beer...big bonus  and a wide variety of other brews and cocktails. 

 I mostly get veggie burgers,you can substitute veggie or portobello on any of the burger selections. They also offer vegan friendly apps etc. 
 My wife gets mini deep dish pizza and says it's fantastic. 
 Today I had Bjs Jeremiah Red house beer and then tried the Jerry Burst, that is berry burst cider mixed with Jeremiah Red. Pretty tasty it turns the beer into more of a sweet treat. 
 That wraps today's visit."}
{"text":"I ordered Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich with fries and my friend got pizza. My sandwich was ok. My fries were room temperature. My friends pizza was soggy. We told the server about the pizza and she promptly removed pizza and apologized. She had a new one made and even offered a salad for him to snack on while waiting for new pizza. The manager came over with the new pizza and apologized. Both the manager and server came back to check on him. He said pizza was ok. They comped both pizzas. I've are there before and I liked it, but today was awful. The service was great and because of that I'll give them another try sometime. My friend said he will not be back."}
{"text":"Love  BJs service was great as well as the food that's why we always go back. My. Husband loves the clam chowder here it's the best in town . Took a little while for the food to come but we enjoyed celebrating my oldest Daughters Birthday. Keep up the great work and food and  we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I knocked off a star because of one reason. Which is the slow service. I have only been here once but the service was bad. The 4 stars are for the great food I had to make up for it though. The food is great and so is the customer service although it can be slow. It is fairly priced and the quantity for what you pay for is good."}
{"text":"Sat at the  bar Alenka was the server.   Service was excellent.  Pizza was very good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good, the food is really average. I felt like the server although friendly was rushing us. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which turns out to be a lot more lettuce than actual chicken. Prices are a little above average. Not really impressed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely not impressed this time around. I've been to many other BJ'S locations, however this one...uh...not great. We both ordered the jambalaya. Huge mistake. Both plates came out really cold. We sent them back (they microwaved them....); came back extra salty (I kid you not). We left. Probably won't be back. :("}
{"text":"This BJ's is hit or miss.  Tonight is a huge miss. 

Service was slow.  They seem to be understaffed. 
We had to ask for water twice, and when it came, the glasses were filled right to the brim, as if somebody was hoping we'd spill on ourselves. 

I usually have two beers, but I don't have enough patience tonight. 

But the low point, surpassing the constant stream of apologies to the booth beside us, was the TV sound. 
Apparently, a basketball playoff game had been on earlier, and nobody noticed when it ended and the network began a very talky and gleefully description true crime show.

Not what I want blaring in my ear during dinner."}
{"text":"We usually just go for the pizza and pazookie! But wow was I amazed at how good their bread bowl soup was! The place is kinda tight and it's always packed but like I always say... must be good food if it's packed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Calamari was the consistency of rubber and tasted awful. When our food came to the table, i unrolled my napkin and there was chewing gum stuck to the silverware and napkin. After eating, i asked for a to go box and it took the server yet another 20 minutes until he brought us the check, which I already asked for twice within the 20 mins from 2 other servers. Worst BJ's I've ever been to hands down. $0 tip left. Shoulda brought it up the manager but was pretty pissed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and am unimpressed. We've had a very bad experience one of the times, which the manager made good on by comping some of our meals, giving us a free dessert, and a $50 gift card. However, while the next visit was better, it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"BJ's is one of our options when the whole family goes out for dinner. They have the seating and are usually staffed to handle larger parties. The restaurant is spacious with plenty of televisions so you can take a peek at your favorite game. Their menu is huge and everyone can find something to eat. But there's only a handful of items that I personally would consistently order though.

For me, of course I'm a fan of their craft beer. They have a nice selection that runs the spectrum of flavors with the Jeremiah Red and PM Porter being my favorites. You can order a flight if you're having trouble deciding or want to try multiple beers. Their deep dish pizza with the thick, crunchy, and slightly greasy crust has always been pretty consistent. The Pizookies are a must order. A warm cookie with ice cream is a slam dunk.

On our most recent visit, I decided to go with the 14 oz. ribeye ($21.50) with brussel sprouts and asparagus. I wouldn't order this again, nor would I recommend it. It wasn't terrible, but for the price, I can get a better, larger steak from the butcher. The brussel sprouts were mush and I couldn't finish them. We finished with the salted caramel pizookie which was delicious and completely annihilated.

I made the mistake this visit by going away from one of my staples, but I wouldn't think twice about coming back for drinks at the bar or bringing the group for a meal."}
{"text":"We always end up at BJs at one time or another because it's such an easy and casual place to grab a bite to eat and drink to drank! 

If you're looking for a wide range of food choices, great drinks and beer, a casual atmosphere and friendly service, BJs is a great place for lunch or dinner. 

We've come with family, friends, and our little one and it never disappoints. The food is a-okay and nothing to write home about but filling for what you're craving. 

I love the roasted brussel sprouts, salads, and sandwich combos!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night for the first time with a couple friends. I know the place is new and they are still working out some kinks. Service was fast and our server was extremely nice and laid back. He took the time to explain some of the menu and suggest some of the BJ beer. The best part of my meal was dessert. I had the \"triple chocolate peanut butter smore\" absolutely amazing. I'm hopeful I can go back this weekend. The menu is huge and has something for everyone's taste."}
{"text":"The beer and drink is terrific. The service was fantastic! Our waitress, Maria, was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. The food was not good. The flat bread we ordered was okay. The entrees, ugh. I chose the Hawaiian Mahi Mani. It was a stir fry kind of dish. The fish was overcooked and I think there was an entire onion mixed in with the over-soyed rice. The rice was soggy. The hubby got the \"dinner\" sized portion of the southern fried chicken. It comes on a bed of corn. He got two small pieces of tough, stringy, over cooked pieces of dry chicken on a bed of overcooked corn. Not good. I feel like the menu is way too big. Maybe if they focused on bar type food it would be better but we won't eat here again. Beer and drinks for sure but food, no way!"}
{"text":"The beers are very nice.  Always good.  The pizza is deep dish and the pans are nicely seasoned as to give the crust a buttery flavor.  The service here is great.  On the down side, it can get a bit noisy with the high ceilings and hard surfaces, but hey it is casual dining."}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014 #169 - #365

We were with spending time with our family friends and decided to dine out. We decided on BJ's because my Mom was familiar with the BJ's in California and we always have a good experience. Through the huge swivel door, you're greeted into this urban style restaurant that you'll find any other BJ's franchise.

The floorplan is almost the same as the one we return to in California but a little smaller. Food and service was ok and there was nothing to fault on. To sum it up, it was just average and nothing spectacular. If I were to come back, I would just hit the bar for some good craft beer and bar food."}
{"text":"First let me start off with the positives, the cookie ice cream thing was delish. Their soup was amazing as well, had two pieces of chicken but was still good ( chicken tortilla soup) Which is the only reason I am giving this place two stars. 
This was my first time here and I had heard about the service prior to going but kept an open mind. I feel bad cause our poor waitress was either new or just having a really bad day! I was fine with how extremely slow the service was until I started seeing tables that came after us (group of 4) started getting their appetizers before we even got our salads. So I started to get increasingly annoyed by this point. After 45 min we finally asked where our salads were. Which came about 5 min after that. So 50 min just to get our salad. So then our food arrives about another 15-20 after that. Omg the pizza was terrible. It was so dried out that it didn't even look like they put cheese on it. 18 bucks for a dried out 8 inch pizza with pepperoni and olives. OUCH. 85 bucks for the 4 of us and 2 hours later we could finally leave! I don't think I will ever go back here. For some reason it seems to be a trendy place to go but the food and service suck. So if you want to go there to be \"cool\" by all means go. But don't be in a rush and don't expect  your food to measure up to the price you pay for it!"}
{"text":"A picture is worth a lot- Due to the contamination by poorly handled meat products in the kitchen others could be at risk.  Didn't have much concern for me- so likely didn't take much action behind the scene either.  Meat that raw is truly a danger. Oh but took off that meal and  1/2 off the pizza  and 1 root beer  -I was so nauseated we needed to get up and leave-but had to wait for card to be returned.  If I get sick there is proof in pics"}
{"text":"First time trying this BJ's , honestly over all it was pretty good. We got a salad which was delicious and a fried chicken burger with a spinach dip. Let me start by saying the service was amazing, but ... the fried chicken as funny as that sounds is a beef patty, but that's not the issue, my issue was the patty smelled and tasted funny. We let the waiter know and he jumped to take it out of the bill for us ... which is fine, but honestly I would have much appreciated if he had asked what the issue with it was so it doesn't happen again than just taking it of the bill. It didn't make me feel good to have him not ask what the issue was and follow up on it. 
Other than that, the rest of the food and the ambiance was pretty good."}
{"text":"Fabulous.

Extremely reasonable. Great culinary selections. Their Pizookies will set you FREE!!!
If you ever have a question about what 'service/ should be, BJ's defines it. Anyone I've every escorted here has demanded to return the very next day.  Go figure.

{"text":"Went there on fathers day with family we had reservations but they could not find it. The manager did get us a table pretty quick though. The food was not bad and I did try one of there ipa's and I was not bad either. Huge menu prices are okay and the food is not bad."}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place ! I have gone 4 times. The first time was good. I ate at the bar with friends.  Had a pizza and some apps and it was great. 

Second time I went with my husband. I got a salad with shrimp and the shrimp were absolutely horrible. Tiny and tasted so fishy and old. Not the way shrimp should taste. Waitress took my plate, and pretended to not notice that all my shrimp were pushed to the side with my salad barely eaten. 

The 3rd time my husband and I went with another couple, and their twin babies, who were 4 months old. Our waitress started out great. Really friendly. But then almost got too friendly where she felt comfortable enough to complain about working so long.  She put our appetizer order in, and the apps were good. About an hour later, my husband asked about our food. She said \"don't worry it is coming!\" After another 15 minutes, he asked again. She had a distraught look on her face all of a sudden, and said she'd be back. Then the manager said she forgot to put our order in !  Let me remind you the 2, 4-month old babies who were with us. About 20 minutes later we got our order. The waitress came to our table, did not apologize or even acknowledge anything was off. It was so unprofessional. 

My husband and I went back a 4th time this past weekend and got the siracha cheese nachos for our appetizers and the cheese was cold, and was not spicy or tasty at all. He ordered a chicken salad and I ordered a pizza (cuz at this point I'm nervous to order anything else, to be honest!) and my pizza was so cold when it came out, and my husband (who isn't picky about his chicken) said the chicken was really rubbery and tasted old. 

I really wanted to like you, BJs, I just think you need to work out a lot of kinks before I'll go back for a while unfortunately."}
{"text":"I cant say enough good things about the BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse in Chandler, our favorite restaurant!! We are on a first name basis with David the manager who is always friendly and visible. The man works hard as we see him during practically every visit. During our most recent visit we met server Crystal and had a marvelous experience with her. She was attentive, engaging and very funny. She completed yet another wonderful dining experience! The food is consistently delicious no matter what you order from their extensive menu. They also offer different/new in-house micro-brews throughout the year. Its always a treat trying their latest concoction! Last, if you have not attended one of BJ's \"Beer Dinners\" you really need to make it a point to do so. During the beer dinners you are served a variety of BJ's delicious foods, usually 4 courses, accompanied by a beer selected to compliment the chosen food and of course, your palate. Again, BJ's in Chandler is by far our favorite go-to place to eat where we visit monthly!"}
{"text":"I like this place. They have a HUGE menu, lots of TV's, and the service is fast and friendly.

They also have a 'skinny menu' where everything is under 550 calories. PERFECT.

I got a grilled chicken and mango salad and it was amazing, been craving it since.  They also have a large selection of ice teas if you are into flavored tea!

I have now been twice and plan to go again. It's casual like a Chili's or Fridays but with better food."}
{"text":"It's a good place for happy hour with my friends. Not into sports or beer but their poke is pretty good. Not my favorite but close to my house and easy to get to."}
{"text":"My fiance and I met a friend for a birthday party a few days ago, along with 16 other people.  It was my first time visiting this location, or any other one for that matter.  The one thing I was impressed by is that with the amount of people that were there, it wasn't as noisy as I thought it going to be.  Yes, you did have to raise your voice a bit, but it wasn't to the level of shouting, which is a definite plus.  Perhaps it's the high ceilings.  Anyway, my fiance and I opted for the appetizer (mozzarella sticks - you really can't go wrong with those) - they were good, but it's the marinara sauce they give you that make them even better!  My fiance ordered the bison burger, which I had a bite of and thought it was delicious.  My dish, the parmesan crusted chicken, was also quite tasty.  I love the sauce they put on it with the sun-dried tomatoes.  

The reason I'm giving this location five stars is simple:   the service.  Our server, Joanna, was amazing.  She was very attentive, but not overly annoying.  After everyone got their food, my dish still hadn't arrived.  She went back to check on it, and apparently, my dish went to another table by mistake, so she had the kitchen rush my dish out and even had the meal compensated without hesitation (I didn't even ask for it).  She was very apologetic and sincere about it, which is rare these days.  There should be more servers like her.  We will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We've been to the Polaris BJ'S many times, so we were excited to see one go up at Great Northern. Decided on take out given the holiday shopping parking extravaganza. 

Very disappointing.  The app to order pizza is confusing. We thought we were ordering 5 Cheese Pizza, but we got no cheese. Just crust with tomatoes.  The Caesar salad for $10.50 was pitiful. A couple handfuls of romaine, a few croutons and a very light sprinkle of cheese. The boneless wings were soggy, and food was cold. Apparently, no one figured out that the baked potato takes longer to make than the sandwiches and fries. Everything was done, but we had to wait 10 mins for the potato.

We won't do take out there again. Too bad, because the food dining in, at least at Polaris, is always good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I would go back. I gave it 4 stars because whenever we order something med it usually comes out very over done. But service is always nice and friendly. take out is always good as well."}
{"text":"visited BJ's for the first time while attending a company holiday party. they had a great buffet style setup for the entire group-appetizers, pizza, and cold drinks.  we were all in the patio and it was chilly but still comfortable. the restaurant is nice and open.

we went back and the pizza was just as good as when it was not on our dime.. I like that. Chicago style pizza awesomeness! OMG.. one slice fills you up. the pizza is on the rich side so not the kind of pizza you eat often but a great place to treat yourself. looking forward to trying the beer and thin crust pizza...btw, they brew their own beer."}
{"text":"For a chain I'm a big fan. Keep in mind that it's nothing super unique and more like Cheesecake Factory than anything else. Along those lines, it has a huge menu but focuses on pizza and burgers which I like. They have some entrees of course but they aren't trying to do every single type of food out there.  The place is very large and can accommodate large parties well, but does get busy. Servers are good and the prices are pretty standard.  They have a large bar and a ton of beer on tap. Food-wise the pizza was great with tons of different types and sizes all the way down to mini. The apps were great too, stuffed mushrooms and all the different fried ones were cooked very well. They even have their own brews and can do flights and pitchers of all the different types they make.  This disappointing thing about this location and why I took away two-stars is because they don't brew their own beer like all of their sister locations.  WTF - C'mon!  This is the whole reason I go to BJ's over competitors.  I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Much better than expected.  We got the brush-off from the first server, I guess she didn't want to deal with a handicapped, old, quirky family member that was dining with us.

Our second server was perky and funny.  They ran out of both the homemade root beer and homemade cream soda and it was a running joke for the rest of the meal.  BTW, the homemade orange cream soda was great.

I had a salad that was huge and flavorful, and the other two diners had fish and chips, which again were an enormous portion.  We split a mini deep dish pizza which we said on numerous occasions that it was supposed to be served as an appetizers.  We even ordered it 15 minutes before our entrees.  Low and behold, it came out at the same time as the entrees.

As for the drinks, the Frosty Peach was amazing.  I would go again just to get hammered on the drinks."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend not busy at all in the place. Service was okay nothing spectacular server seemed like he had better places to be than serving us. We shared the baked ziti because we were catching a movie after. The dish was very yummy we were quite impressed. Then ordered the pizza cookie with the chocolate chip and peanut butter it was okay much much better at oreganos and you get a lot more of it. The dish is very shallow and he amount of ice cream outweighs how much cookie you actually get. I might come back for happy hour sometime to try that out."}
{"text":"Fun place to have lunch or dinner. Great for sports watching. Lots of food choices and great choice of beers."}
{"text":"I've gone to this BJ's quite a few times, and evertime it has been alright. The food is ok- they have a wide selection of things which is good, but unless you know what you are in the mood you could be searching for a while. 
My favorite item (besides the Pazookies) is the Fresh Mozzerella and Tomato salad in the small bites section. I've had a mini deep dish pizza, and it was good, but I haven't had many deep dishes so I don't know how it adds up to a real Chicago Deep Dish. 
The downside is that this location is ALWAYS packed. I know it is newer to the Centennial area, but geez, it seems that every night everyone and their mom goes there so you are left with waiting for a while. 
Service has been great everytime I go. I haven't had a problem with them yet. 
Pricewise it could be a bit expensive if you go all out. The best deal is to get the Pazookie Trio and try three different types of Pazookies for half the price of one big one. The Small Bites section is pretty cheap; they use to have an awesome Seared Ahi Tuna dish that was a great deal. I guess it was such a great steal that they had to stop it because it is no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"This is your typical BJ's, with the giant menu and the cookie pie things. I've been here a few times, and the service is better than in Centennial, you get in and out quickly. I've never had an issue with a waiter or waitress. 

They are located by the Red Rock casino so you can always go to a movie and cross the street to eat here, or just get dessert like I do some times."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming food. We went to try this place out because they had a huge menu with a variety of choices. 
We split a calamari appetizer. I did tomato bisque with a caprese salad. He has a individual pizza. The calamari was just ok. Greasy. The dipping sauce made it have flavor. 
tomato bisque was good and the caprese was chopped up onions with mini tomatoes and mini mozzarella cheese balls. Surprisingly bland. I had to add a lot of salt. I don't usually salt my food. 
The pizza my husband said was bland as well. 
Service was great. Our server was really nice and attentive. Just the food was meh."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a date night with my husband and this was the best part of the night. Our server Lynn in the bar section was so AMAZING!!  She is just so bubbly and friendly. She is the epitome of customer service. She makes you feel like you are the only person around. This place is now our new favorite spot.  The happy hour is great as well. $4 for a pint of beer and $6 for a burger and fried. Plus the pizzookie is only $3 this month. My whole meal with dessert is under $15.    We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Had a great experience as usual. Our food came out so fast and thank goodness, because my pregnant sister was starving. Always a great experience. Excellent service. I ordered the barbecued chicken chopped salad it is amazing, always the perfect amount of dressing. A++"}
{"text":"I love this placeeeee. Mixture of the yard, and the cheesecake factory. Great ambiance here.

My veggie pizza with the jalapeño was phenomenal!!!

The trio pizzookiieeeeeee. Ahhhh. Loveeee."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.   Called ahead for party of 6 to be seated at 6:30.  We arrived are 6:15 and were seated at 7:30 to a 4 top table with 6 chairs.  They realized we didn't fit so ended up pulling 2 tables together. Finally we order,  one of our party is a pescetarian and asks for salmon, they are out if salmon.  She asks what  pescetarian friendly dishes  they offer and the waitress who was vegan recommended that shrimp dish.  So now all salads are delivered however we still have no flatware we asked two different people for silverware and it wasn't until our waitress came to the table to see how are salads were that she realized we couldnt eat therm.   Next comes the food.  The shrimp dish smells like chicken.   We ask them to check and found that the dish was made with chicken stock.  Our server cane to the table apologetic.   She asked if she could bring something else.  We asked for the stuffed mushrooms, the server  rushed it however they still did not get to the table until we were done with the rest of the meals. Check please...I find that we were charged for those mushrooms.  As far as the food goes the ribs were good everything else on the table was Applebee's quality. Beer was great of course.  This was my son's birthday dinner so I guess my disappointment was intensified."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love or like the food here...But, it was just ok.  Let me elaborate, the service was great! The salad was great, the calamari was ok.  

And...the chicken Alfredo was salty and not good at all.  I usually love chicken Alfredo but their version of Alfredo was too salty for my taste!  No bueno!"}
{"text":"Went to BJ's the other night for the second time, bad mistake! Ordered their deep dish pizza; very dry with lack of incredance which I would not have mentioned, although the pizza came out cold. I told the server and she took it back to be warmed up. When it came back out after another 15 min wait, it was hardly warm! This happened to me on first visit to BJ's getting a cold meal from the kitchen. The manager did reduce the cost of my bill based on this, although after having this happen to me twice now, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I always end up going to BJ's if we don't know where to eat and I've never been disappointed yet! I always take the longest time to order here because they have such a great variety to choose from. Some dishes I've tried here is the Chicken Alfredo, the country fried chicken burger, and the ribeye. They are known for their \"pizookies\" which is their dessert. It's a warm, freshly baked cookie that is topped with icecream. Recently I came in and tried their Churro pizookie which is just a bunch of mini churros with a scoop of vanilla bean icecream on it but it was so good because the churros are fresh and warm (It's only offered for a limited time too)!!! Anyways, this place is a great place to go to if you are in a group and you don't really know what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"Great selection of draft beers and cocktails. Menu has a lot to chose from ranging from soup and salad to deep dish pizzas, and of course, burgers. Great place to catch the big game and to take the family. Download the app and order ahead."}
{"text":"I haven't been impressed with BJ's the last couple times I've visited and I'm not going back. I am newly gluten free and they have limited menu options for a GF person like me although I do appreciate that they offer a GF pizza. I can usually find something on a menu that will fit the bill so I ordered the Thai mango chicken salad. It was certainly nothing special considering the $12 price tag. I was disappointed to see that all their salads ran that much with the exception of the garden salad which was $9.75 + $3 extra to add grilled chicken. They've really increased their prices. My husband's vanilla Dr. Pepper was $3 and he was not offered a refill. So, like I said, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We are always sorry we came to eat at BJs, none of our specifics of our order came out as ordered. Can you imagine roasted asparagus being spicy and not described that way on the menu. With my tongue on fire I said I'll have the green beans instead, nope those r spicy to. They remade my meal this time as ordered 
Ribs light sauce this time the baked potatoe was not hot enough to melt 
the soft butter! Like I said never coming back. Now we are observing a health code violation live, busser is using same rag on table and seats"}
{"text":"This location is too busy and not worth it.  We went to the Centennial location when we lived in Aliante and thought the minimal wait was worth it.  But given the wait in Summerlin, I'd rather eat just about anywhere else.  We put our name on the waitlist via the app.  We checked in and were told 20 minutes.  At the 30 minute mark, I inquired about how much longer?  She told us there were 5 more tables ahead of us.  All the while, we waited, she kept quoting everyone 20 minutes....clearly not accurate.  It was so bad, there was a family with young kids that had been waiting over an hour and the kids were crying from hunger.  Other families with young kids left while we were waiting as well.  We also gave up...."}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's daughter's birthday per her request.  This was our second visit. 
Service was very poor with inattentive waitress that had zero personality. 
I really don't understand this whole runner concept. Our food was literally dropped off at our table & there was no sign of our waitress to see if we needed anything, which we did.  Our son in laws order was wromg & there were no condiments for hubbies fries. So we waited & waited.  
This is unacceptable for the prices we had to pay for rather mediocre food at best.
We will not return again. There are too many good places that we can go to.
Don't waste your time or $ here.
Also when I asked our server for J&B scotch she didn't think they had it.  She was unwilling to go check & after some reluctance on her part found out they did have it.  Go figure."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich,  BJ's pizza, and a double burger hit the spot eveytime. We gotta love us some BJ''s."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy! I went here before my junior prom and the food was surprisingly fast for how large our party was!"}
{"text":"Just last night we left the Yuletide and headed out to grab a bite before heading home and BJ's is a good place to grab a bite and maybe a great drink. We walked in and were seated right away but sat for quite some time before ordering. The waitress brought our drinks and then disappeared until our food came out. We ordered the chicken club and an order of potato skins. 

The potato skins were done well and came with all the necessary fixins.. Cheese, bacon, scallions and a sour cream like sauce. 

The Chicken Club was perfect, Lightly toasted Garlic Sourdough with chicken breast, bacon, avocado, tomato and lettuce. 

I really feel bad about this review only being 3 stars because the food was great as usual but the service was far less then lacking.. My water went empty and stayed empty throughout the entire meal, and we had to wait for quite some time for our check to come. With a small meal at BJ's taking an hour and a half I would say there was some sort of hang up or issue with the service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here now about 1/2 dozen times. Consistent. Nice staff. Reasonable wait times when busy.

Burgers are all tasty and good portion size. The rack of ribs is giant and very tasty. A lot of meat.

The pizza cookie - still can't get over that they own a trademark I was convinced was owned by a local Italian restaurant - is mighty tasty. I like the Ghirardelli one the best of all of them."}
{"text":"Still a solid 4...just a couple added thoughts:

The flat bread pizza is only so-so. Not worth it at full price. Maybe worth it for the weekday special deal. The crust is like a Saltine cracker. The amount of meat protein toppings is seriously lacking. You're better off doing the \"make your own\" at one of the flash-fired pizza places.

The pot stickers were surprisingly tasty. I guess I just didn't expect that from a brew pub with such a varied menu.

The ribs are inconsistent from visit to visit.

But the Ghirardeli triple chocolate pizzookie is really tasty. The cookie is not as good as the local pizza place one might think serves the \"pizzookie,\" but the ice cream is much better quality."}
{"text":"Good enough. Their weekday specials are the draw for me. The quality is right at this price. But, I would not order the same items at full menu price.

My fav is the Thursday night rib deal. Get the full rack. For the money, it's a better deal. And, it seems the serving size is always more than double the \"half rack\" size. 

Clam chowder is done well. Tomato and mozzarella salad is very good. Skip the Caeser. Fries are cooked well done and salted to the point to motivate beer sales. Broccoli is hit or miss and can be unripe. I'll never order the asparagus again - wilted and the tips where brown. I commented several times to the server but she never picked up on it. Ribs are usually cooked well and the BBQ sauce is excellent. Sometimes the meat is overcooked and, with the sauce basted on, can be caramelized to rock hard. The Pizzookies are always wonderful.

This place is a worthy venture. I've not tried their beers but I'll venture they do a good job. And, for a sports bar/restaurant, the place, though nearly always packed, is no noisier than most Valley eateries.

Go, but do treat yourself to a Pizzookie!"}
{"text":"This would be a weekly stop, except it's an hour from my house.  This is upscale atmosphere, design, and cuisine!  I can't wait to go back for the many things on the menu!  Every day of the week they offer an amazing special 1/2 price pizza on Monday.  But wait!!!! The pricing is ridiculous....seriously, for what you get.  Can you say the words \"impressive\" and \"value\"??? 
Dine on my friends."}
{"text":"What an amazing menu!  I have a list of menu items I MUST TRY!  
Very upscale! But reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night and me and about 10 other people decided to go get some Pizooki's from this place. The waitress seemed so annoyed to handle our two tables. I even told her we were only getting a desert. It's very easy tip money. The wait time was longer than usually but I understood. They did not once check on our tables. Our server gave us attitude when we asked for water. It's not that hard to smile and get some water. When it came to time to leave and pay they did not ask how we would like our checks and messes everything up for us. We spend 10 minutes trying to ask our server to split up the checks. The serve gave me and my cousin a lot of attitude when we tried to see the check and help him organize it. Even the manager came and was not helpful at all. Not once did he apologize for the confusing or any basic customer service. When he was ringing us up in the front did not once say he was sorry or even smiled. McDonald's has better customer service then this place had at night. Hopefully we never come back to this location."}
{"text":"The service is slow but the pizza is great and happy hour is not bad as long as your not in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Excellent  service!  Anthony was great!! The food was delicious and the beer was cold! Will definitely be returning soon! Happy hour prices during the game!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat if you live in Summerlin or staying the night at Red Rock."}
{"text":"The menu had many great options and the pricing was fair. We enjoyed the craft beer and appetizers. However, the service was slow and almost nonexistent."}
{"text":"I am upgrading my rating because of BJ's new menu which includes now more vegan dishes."}
{"text":"As a server being served I wish I could have one person serving me. If you can't handle the pressure don't be in the biz. Why is every plate dirty? Drink runner?! LMAO!! Amateurs....."}
{"text":"I met a friend here last night for happy hour.  It was a pleasant surprise to find out that bottles of wine(and glasses) were half price!  I believe that's just in the bar area though.  I live near BJ's and we frequent it often.  It's been hit and miss in the past.  Last night, we had a very sweet and attentive server.  I had the chopped salad and a baked potato and my friend had the gluten-free pizza.  We both enjoyed our food and our wine.  I am hoping that BJ's has made some extra effort to step it up with their customer service and quality of food as it seemed improved last night.  The food is a little pricey for a brewery, but all-in-all, last night was an extremely pleasant experience so I will be back again."}
{"text":"BJ's is a great spot. They have a huge menu. You can always find something delicious. Great for groups or big families when everyone wants something different unique. Wide range of entrées. 
Always great meals here and service has been great too. Ohhh and the beer here. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Good for beers, snacks lunch, dinner. Terrible for breakfast. Service was slow or poorly staffed. The breakfast was average."}
{"text":"Called at 12:30 to place a reservation only to find they don't take reservations for parties under 6. They offered me a \"call ahead\" and I set it for 7:30 that night.

When I arrived at 7:30 they let me know there would be a wait and there was! We were finally sat at 8:30.

Pleasantly surprised the food selection was great and the taste was worth the wait. They won my heart with the flavor and service.

It was their first week so I cut them some slack.

Bria was great! Friendly and easy to work with. Enjoyed her attention to detail and bubbly personality.

Great job to Damien for taking care of my wife so promptly. He used words like \"right way\"
And \"no problem\".

Take notes fellow waiters/waitresses be of service and willing to go above and beyond for your patrons."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at BJ's, but for some reason I'm feeling like I wont be back. I can't quite put my finger on it.

I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. They were a good size (you get 2 per order) and had lots of flavor. It was served with a side of grains (rice, red quinoa, cous cous maybe?, cherries?) It was different, but very good. Nothing bland about this meal!
My iced tea was fresh and I was content with the price. My friends also seemed happy with their Ahi (Tuna) Poke Bowl and Artichoke Tavern pizza. A stand-out appetizer: The Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts. Wow. So delicious. Crispy and spicy and flavorful!

Our server was a riot. Very attentive, loved her job, tried hard to sell us on the downloadable app and pazookies and very, um, present.

I think what I didn't love was the menu. It was way too much to look at and decide from. Some menu options were repeated which just unnecessarily bulked up the heavy book. 
Another down side is because the restaurant is in the mall parking lot, parking was scarce. On a Monday evening."}
{"text":"Meh. I've driven past this place several times and finally tried it. Was surprised that on a Friday night there wasn't many people there. Maybe that should have been a clue. Ordered a PM Porter which was just ok and the Ahi Poke which was phenomenal. My friend had the Dark Side of the Moon blended beer which she liked and the stuffed mushrooms which were also very tasty. Then we also ordered a dish of carnitas fries topped with green chili's, pork and onions and it was awful. The service was just as bad. A waitress with zero personality. Also, the wait was ridiculous for not being very busy. We ordered dessert but after waiting twenty five minutes waiting for it we got the check and left. The bad outweighed the good and I'm afraid I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by simply stating: DO NOT GO HERE. I repeat.. DO. NOT. GO. HERE. The service is horrendous. If zero stars were an option, they would have earned it. I had the worst experience I think I've ever had at a restaurant tonight. They made my family and I feel totally uncomfortable. We actually ended up leaving before our food came. It was THAT bad. Both the waitress (Toni) and management staff (especially David)  acted totally unprofessionally. Additionally, I've been here on several occasions and wait for way too long every time to get seated and receive food. The service is NEVER good, which isn't surprising considering how I'll-suited their manager is to MANAGE. As a business student, I am well aware of how a manager should treat patrons, and this is not it. My family and I have lived here for over 15 years and have frequented this place since I was in elementary school. I vow to NEVER go back. Seriously, take my word for it. Plus the food is subpar at very, very best. It really was just close to our house, that's the ONLY reason. And now I have no reason to ever come back. I have called the corporate office and am waiting for a response. They must know how horrible this experience was."}
{"text":"So this is actually one of my best places to go for happy hour. Good drink selection and a nice ambiance. Second time around did not disappoint me. Calamari was great and do try to Mediterranean veggie pasta dish....very healthy."}
{"text":"Bj's is a staple of Las Vegas and a perfect example of the ONLY good chain restaurant that I have ever been to in my entire life. My friends and I constantly go here, I have probably eaten half the menu including the bbq deep dish, gluten free pizza, pesto deep dish, meat lovers deep dish, turkey burger, patty melt, mashed potatoes, steak fries, chicken santa fe rolls, avocado egg rolls, calamari, wontons, chicken sandwhich and honestly, I was never let down by Bj's. It is a safe bet, and this is my favorite location because it is never super crowded and on Sundays they offer a cheap and awesome brunch (which has captin crunch french toast and a breakfast pizza, must trys!) Their white peach margarita is also one of my favorites as well as their homemade berry burst cider."}
{"text":"Love this location and the service here. I try to avoid peak times (weekend lunch/dinner). The food is fantastic and I love their craft brews and soda! I've been here 20+ times and they never let me down."}
{"text":"Me and my buddy were meeting up at the mall for dinner but we were not sure where to go. He suggested here because they have a diverse menu, \"which can be bad and good\". After deciding to go here we started ourselves on the patio outside. We went ahead and ordered some beer which was delicious! Hefeweizen was our choice.

After looking over the menu and unsure what we wanted he suggested the avocado egg rolls, my oh my how they exceeded my expectations, very delicious, flavorful with a great spicy mayo or some sort of spicy condiment inside served with a thick teriyaki hybrid dipping sauce.

For our meal we both went with the same thing although it technically was not a menu item. We had ordered the chicken fried burger, but substituted with the Nashville hot chicken breast. It was topped with Monterey Jack, a fried egg, sausage gravy, tomato and avocado. It was tasty and VERY messy, however there was so much going on with this sandwich that all the flavors mashed together and nothing was too distinct. But then again we are the ones that altered our sandwiches. I will say it was filling and very tasty, just not as much flavor depth as I wanted due to so many ingredients on the sandwich. 

I will say that I will be returning though!"}
{"text":"I've been to BJ's elsewhere and enjoyed them, so I was happy to see one open locally. I stopped in yesterday, and it's the first week of opening, so I'm sure things are still shaking out. In spite of that, service was very attentive. Food and drinks arrived quickly, and we had an enjoyable experience.

In terms of the beer - I tried both of their seasonals - Grand Cru and Bourbon Barrel Stout. I enjoyed both, but the Bourbon Barrel was the superior of the two, IMO. They also brew their own NA root beer, and it's got a very flavorful blend of seasonings. 

In terms of food - We did salads and the pizza. Yes, the menu's a mile thick, but if you go here and it's not for pizza, you've made a poor choice. Their pizzas are excellent. I prefer the deep dish, but the thin crust is more than passable. They also have a GF option, which I'm told is excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night and we both ordered burgers. Mine was undercooked and both of ours was sooo bland (Denny's has better burgers) then My infant and I got a lemonade spilt on us by our waiter. We didn't get a discount or an apology so I did not tip and we won't be going back. I recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for the first time for dinner and loved it! The menu is very extensive- there's something for everyone. We shared the Mediterranean Tacos as an appetizer and loved them! My boyfriend had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was great. Perfect dinner spot if you're heading to Chandler Fashion Center. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars for a great menu. We have been to the north Olmsted location 4 times now. The first time was late night and it was fine. I was excited to see so many healthy and interesting menu options. We sat at the bar and service was quick and friendly. 

The second time was Father's Day. The food took a long time but that is to be expected, it was very busy and a holiday. We were given a 20% off card to return by July 9. I guess it was a Father's Day promo. Food is good but not amazing. Servers kept coming to the table with food that was not ours. Like 3 times. This did not affect us but made me wonder why it kept happening. 

The third time our food took a reallllly long time. I would say 45 minutes. It was a weeknight, not super busy. One of the items ordered came out wrong and had to be remade so more waiting. We weren't super happy but I have worked in the food service industry for many years so I get it, and I am super patient Service was slow but friendly. Our server was training someone. They didn't seem to notice how long the food took. 

The fourth time is the time that makes me think I will not go back. It was a weds. We got there at 6 and did not leave until well after 8. We took a while to order. Probably 15 or 20 minutes. Then we waited. And waited. Again, twice, food that was not ours was almost dropped at the table. This time it was annoying because we were starving and waiting so long. I mentioned to the server that our food was taking a while. She said \"I know\" with a sorry about that look on her face but did not say sorry or \"I will check on it\". Finally our food comes out about 50 minutes after we ordered it. Mind you, we had kids meals, salad, sandwich and soup, and a medium rare steak. The soup was the wrong soup. My mom ordered broccoli cheese and they brought tomato. The server again did not say sorry, she said \"oh I thought you said tomato\". Good thing my mom liked the soup because the server never brought out the right one. She probably forgot about it because I pointed out that I didn't get my vegetable with my meal (she said \"oh yeah, I don't know why\") my mashed potatoes were cold, and worst of all, the medium rare steak I waited almost an hour for was a dry hockey puck. Again, no sorry, just \"oh I'll get a new one, the ticket will be a priority\". Now, everyone one is done eating and I still don't have food. She says a manger will be out. Sue? I think that's what she said. A woman brings the steak out. Nooooo sorry. Not at all. No smile. Asks me to cut it. It's cooked perfectly. Asks me if I need anything else and leaves. I'm sitting here with my food feeling like I have to rush because it is now after 8pm on a work night and the kids that finished eating a while ago are getting bored and acting up. Now another manager (a male) who was very nice came by and FINALLY someone apologized. He said he would take the steak off the bill. 

Well thank goodness he came by and said \"sorry\" and took it off the bill because I was going to have to complain and I NEVER do that. I don't like it. I feel like if something is wrong, you shouldn't have to ask for it to be made right. And like I said I was a server for YEARS. I have to say my experience is what made every problem even more glaring. I am still discouraged with how the server acted. I have been in her shoes a million times and I would have been bending over backwards to apologize and fix the situation or at least let my guests know that I gave a crap. If the nice manager would have asked me if there was anything else, I would have told him our food took way too long. I also know from experience that he probably already knew that. At least if he's paying any attention, he should be well aware of ticket times. 

I don't think I will go back because while the menu looks good, looks can be deceiving. I never had anything there that was worth the poor service and long waits."}
{"text":"Good beer - had a flight, liked all of them - tried the Piranha Ale, Brewhouse Blonde and Berry Cider. Nice lineup of different beers. 

Ordered large pizza for table on Monday - large pizzas are half off - good deal. We had cheese only pizza and is was pretty good. I would order it again. Side salads are very small! It is not worth the $4/5 for one. 

Waitress was friendly and service was good. 

Menu has a lot of variety - nice addition to Mentor."}
{"text":"Well, wow this place is getting slammed!!! maybe rightfully so, but I have never had a problem with their desserts, my girlfriend and I will sometimes go there just for dessert and that is it. We ate there once and they did take a few more minutes than I thought they should have, but wouldn't stop me from going back again."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this location, but I've been to many many other locations over the last 15 or so years in California and Washington.  I always liked it, but for some reason over the last few years I don't think the quality of the food has been good.

My husband and I went here a few weeks ago for a quick meal because it was so close to our home and we hadn't eaten all day, since I was testing for my PMP exam that day (I passed, yay).  I probably should have dragged him someplace better to celebrate, but I was so exhausted from not sleeping and stressing over this exam to the point where I was sick, that I just wanted to go somewhere and get food and unwind with a few beers.

I had the grilled shrimp tacos because I wasn't in the mood for pizza with a side salad, and my husband got a medium pepperoni pizza.  The pizza is the same here as the other locations, has the big chunks of tomato with little sauce (unless you ask for extra like he does).  The shrimp tacos were pretty mediocre, but being that it was a deep dish pizza joint and not a mexican restaurant, I didn't expect them to be wonderful.  But I also didn't expect them to be so \"blah,\" either and I wouldn't order them again.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, and I think the beer at Ellis Island is much much better.  However, being that it was down the street from where I live, I'll probably go here again."}
{"text":"Came in for an early New Year's Eve dinner with my family. My wife ordered her favorite Seared ahi salad and the tuna was seared perfect. Our server, Francisco was awesome. Always made sure we were ok. Awesome place for a quick bite and for some drinks,"}
{"text":"Slow service.  Flavors certainly didn't come together with the scallops, except just too peppery.   The rice side was bland, and the asparagus are tiny twigs. Even the pink lemonade was just too bitter. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very sad service.. took 45mins too receive water and no help too order food. The waitress excuse was that she was the only working tables. No team help 3 guys was just talking with no care too help out.. the menu is like a book with very sticky pages way over price and I would never go back.."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for six people. The service was great! The food was hot and they got the complete order correct. That is why we continue to order our take out from this B'J's. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater, my husband says a waitresses nightmare. I'm always satisfied with this BJ's but it's kinda noisy, especially with a group. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Who loves BJ's ?? ok kids get your mind out of the gutter.  

Let's talk about the food.   They have a variety of food from burgers, pastas, salads  and pizzas.  I know they are popular for their pizzas, but it's too \"doughy\" for me.  I guess similar to like a deep dish pizza, so when friends want to share a pizza I suggest the flatbread.  I've tried various dishes on their menu, even visited during happy hour, but the only dish that I enjoyed is their ahi tuna salad.      

ok ... the REAL reason why I come to BJ's is when you have that craving for a warm cookie topped off with ice cream ... pizookie yuuummmm!! White macadamia used to be my favorite, but now they have salted caramel and I definitely won't choose any other.    

Oh and if this place becomes a place you enjoy don't forget to ask for a BJ's card. COME to BJ's ... earn points  (once again mind out of the gutter).  This is cool because they send you offers periodically, and the points accumulate to free entrees or desserts."}
{"text":"C's school was having a family dinner night fundraiser. Since BJ's is just outside of the mall near the theater, parking can be a pain. Luckily C & I found parking within a few passes.
BJ's is a large restaurant with a menu that offers something for everyone. We had a short wait to be seated, maybe 10 minutes. 
Our server didn't introduce himself. He brought drink refills when needed but was absent most of the meal.
C ordered the kids 6\" deep dish pizza. Fruit salad as a side. Our server informed us that the pizza did not come with a side like the other kid's meals. C likes fruit so I said fine, add on the side of fruit. C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet, like Old Chicago's, but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic.
I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole, Smoked Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Red Onions, Jalapenos & Tomatoes. The burger was cooked right. The chipotle mayo was pretty lame. Not a whole lot of flavor. Overall, it was a decent burger and the side of fries were quite tasty.
OK service, lousy fruit side, decent burger & fries, not a very attentive server. 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant last night. It was a little after 8pm. Went to check in and was told there would be an hour and a half wait. We decided to order to go. After ordering was told It would be about 20 minutes.  That wasn't the case. We were probably there an hour waiting. As we looked at the line to eat in the restaurant,  all of the people that were before us and about 5 more people got seated before we even got our order. It seemed like a cluster going on. I even watched a manager give another to go order for free because it was a mess. The food was ok. It was a cold. I don't even live 5 minutes from the restaurant but the food was already cold. I was very disappointed in this visit."}
{"text":"Over the years, we have been happy with BJ.   However today, we had the worst experience ever.   My water glass still have food stain upon delivery.  We order a stake medium rare, it came out well done.  Request to be returned, the waiter didn't even apologize. All he said was \"Do you still want the stake?\"  Really nasty attitude!   The Ziti was way too salty.  The salad tasted it was left over from last night.  The salad was soggy. It's a competitive market in this town, the unprofessionalism of the staff plus the cleanliness just doesn't work for me."}
{"text":"Great service even when they are very busy. We were seated immediately in the bar area and our server (can't recall his name, started with an M) was great! We redeemed our coupon for a free pizookie too. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I must admit that this is the 2nd BJs I have visited and I was a bit disappointed to learn that they are not alike. They APPEAR alike because this restaurant is an exact copy of the one I previously reviewed at South Hills Village.

We had a 15 minute wait to be seated. I have the app but wasn't sure when the rest of our party would arrive so I did not reserve ahead of time. When you have to wait you give them your name and cell number so they can text you when they have a booth waiting for you.

The menu and beers are identical to the South Hills one. I showed my waiter my rewards number on my phone so he took note of it. When you spend so much on a tier then you get a small reward. My son and daughter decided to split a large deep dish pizza since on Mondays pizza is half off. I went with my lunch portion of the thyme chicken I had before. 

I sampled their pizza and it was very rich and quite filling. When I started my meal again I found it was not heated up. So I asked my waiter to heat it up which he did. Later I found the ice had melted in my tea so I had to wait a while to get a cup of ice to cool it down. The food is the same and was just enough for me.

We decided to order the pizookies for dessert. This time I got the chocolate chunk mini and my kids got the chocolate cookie covered with ice cream for the dessert. As always they were very good. The waiter brought my check early and then when he added in the desserts I later found out that I was not awarded my points for this visit.

I found that out after we left so I called over there and spoke to a manager. He told me he would credit the points to my account but it would take a few days. Normally when I ate at the one in the South Hills I would get an email immediately . He told me this wasn't the case. This BJs sits in a strip mall which is part of McCandless crossing. I also learned during this visit that they are planning on building a third location out in Robinson. My guess would be Settler's Ridge but time will tell if it will go there or among the restaurants near the mall of Robinson. They also plan to build one in Cranberry as well."}
{"text":"For those of you tired of going to the North Hills BJ's has now opened a second location on the grounds of the South Hills Village mall near Jared's.

When I arrived I was greeted warmly and i got to meet the manager. The place was wide open so I could seat either at their craft draft bar or at a table. I opted for a table. The waitress and her assistance went over their points program where you install their mobile app you get VIP treatment. According to the brochure the app allows you to get on their preferred waitlist, order ahead of time, receive special offers, pay directly from the app, and earn points. Since they just opened on 8-8-16 I was told that if I download their app I was entitled to a free mini pizooke which is really a type of warmed cookie covered by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So I did this and created an account.

They explained to me their history and then told me they were especially known for their pizza and craft brewery.  I decided to order a lunch special which they call lemon thyme chicken. It comes on a bed of rice and some vegetables including tomatoes and brussel sprouts. They even give you a tablespoon along with your regular utensils. When I got it I noticed it was lukewarm so I had it sent back and got a whole new entree. It was very good and quite filling. The place has free Wi Fi but for some reason I was having a little difficulty with it.

Nevertheless I ordered my pizooke where you have a choice a caramel cookie, chocolate chip or peanut butter and covered with ice cream. Since it was a mini it was a generous portion size for me and more than enough. The cookie literally melted in your mouth since it was heated. The ice cream is your standard vanilla. Nothing overly exciting about it.

They do have an extensive menu and a listing of all the craft beers on the wall for you to choose from.I do like the fact that they offer more of a variety than a competeter in the mall. I also noticed as I was leaving the place was filling up fairly quickly. It may be because they are new but they do offer some variation to what this mall needs in terms of restaurants. I was grateful for a new place to go next time I visit. Please note that it is not located in the mall itself but towards the right side in the parking lot. I would imagine it is similar to the one currently open in McCandless."}
{"text":"Generally this place is pretty crowded. We came about 5:30pm and had a 10 minute wait (which didn't seem long at all, considering the large crowd). 
Our waiter seemed impersonal and distracted but his service was adequate nonetheless. 
BJs has a large selection of food and beverage. I had the pink Cadillac martini which was more fruity and less vodka-y than expected. But still good!!  
I enjoy the wide variety of menu options, and that despite the crowd, we're generally seated in a timely manner.  Our waiter could've been more outgoing but no major complaints."}
{"text":"I give BJ's ONE star because every time I order something from the bar it's 99% ice and 1% liquor. I asked for a Long Island Ice Tea and I already know that restaurants fill a tall glass with ice and add as little alcohol as possible. But this last time was ridiculous!!! I couldn't even get my lips to the beverage because the ice was pouring out of the top of the glass. I ordered another one and asked the waiter to have the bartender go \"easy on the ice\"...I got the same thing!!! CONSIDERING BJ'S HAS NO HAPPY HOUR, $10+ FOR A GLASS OF ICE IS OUTRAGEOUS."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this place.  The prime rib sandwich was melt-in-your-mouth tasty.  Cheese curds appetizer was on par with what I had in Madison WI earlier this week.  Pot stickers also very tasty."}
{"text":"after hearing alot about this place & reading tons of reviews. we finally checked this place out. me, my hubby & our 3 month old went here for my birthday. they are kid/baby friendly(one of my worries because i thought since it had a bar that it wouldnt be smoke-free but it was) they provided a sling for our son's carseat which was very convinient not having to bring the stroller inside. i love the ambiance and feel of the place. we were given a table as soon as we got there. our server was soo awesome he was very warm and he really knows what he is talkin about especially when about the menu.(so we gave him a fat tip) they have a wide variety of food on the menu. so we got chips and salsa 5.95 more than enough. i also got the SEARED AHI very small portion 3.95. my hubby got the grilled  PORKCHOPS which was really good 14.95 and i got the JAMBALAYA! omg to die for!! for 15.95 worth it. soooo addicting! good sized portions which gave us leftovers. aaand since it was my birthday a complimentary PIZOOKIE :] soo bomb! they also have a wide variety of beer.. if you guys love beer. we do lol 

so overall yes we would def keep comin back here.. all i can think about is the jambalaya as im writing this lol"}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the NBA playoffs and grab a bite.

The restaurant has an older crowd... 

I ordered some mojitos but they tasted just like a citrus drink with no alcohol.. 

The Tanaka Stout was good.

Our waiter was staying on top of things... The food came out hot. 

BJ's is affordable, quick.. It did bother me that the cocktails were not good at all."}
{"text":"Having moved here from So. Cal about 3 years ago, I needed a new local hang and this is it. Good food. Good service. Fun regulars. Great bartenders! Special shout out to Ben, Tyler, and Kevin. These guys are fun to hang with and take care of business. Norris, Kayla and Aubrey are all great too, just not so sports minded which with that awesome TV is well....... Okay. Just not as entertaining. I give it five stars because its my new comfortable home away from home."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile but it was always so packed and I didn't feel like waiting for an hour, fast forward to may 24th and it's finally no wait!!! I come in and am thoroughly surprised at the size of the menu. They are their own brewery and the beer is EXCELLENT. I came with 2 friends and we all ordered different things, I tried everything we ordered and every single item we ordered was superb. It's a little pricey but not overly pricey, you get what you pay for definitely. I would totally recommend this place to anybody and I will most certainly be back in the very near future."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here Friday night but it was a 90 minute wait. So I didn't eat here I do have to say the revolving door to enter is crazy. I watched two people get run into as other people were exiting the door. There is not enough room in the entry way to have this type of door."}
{"text":"Service is OK food selection is good and they have a low calorie menu of under 700 calories. I got the mahi mahi and it was DELICIOUS!  The siracha wings are good too! 

We came on a Friday night about 7 and were told a 30 minute wait and were pleasantly surprised when it was only about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything is great. Wish they had Pumpkin Ale all year!"}
{"text":"The food is always very good. Each time I have been to this location our orders were right and cooked well. However service is lacking, which seems to be the theme of their reviews. Waiters just don't seem happy to be there or too service oriented. Like they're all robots just going through the motions. On one occasion I did ask my server for a red sangria. I was told they only serve specialty sangrias and that the bartender just couldn't make that drink for me. Only the drinks on the menu. What? Any bartender with a proper license and training should know how to throw together a simple sangria. If I could do it myself at home, how could a \"professional\" in a well stocked bar not be able to? I will try this location again but it won't be first on my list, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered to go
No curbside pickup 
No reserved spots for to go customers 
They did good though 
As always PIZZA was great
Definitely eat in next time"}
{"text":"I went here with my grandma and brother, and we had a great time. The waitress was extremely friendly and check on us constantly to make sure we were doing good. We also talked to one of the managers because we had some questions about the store chain, and he was very informative and seemed to really like the history of the restaurant. The food and beer were great, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Never eating here again. Had the ribs on Christmas Eve. Spent the night vomiting the ribs. Ruined my Christmas. Never again."}
{"text":"BJ's is a fun place to go if you aren't on a diet.  I am not certain there is anything on the menu that is a healthy choice, even items listed as a healthy choice.  BUT, if you go there for the food, you won't be disappointed.  From their Avacodo Egg Rolls to their Chicago-esque pizza, they know how to make their food.  They recently added \"small plates\" to their menu, 8 -10 mini appetizers for between 2-4 dollars each.  We decided to sample as many as we could and ordered Thai won tons, meatballs, a mozzerella salad, and fried artichokes.  The Artichokes were surprisingly good with large pieces of artichoke beneath a breading that didn't zap the flavor of the choke.  The dipping sauce was good but not perfect.  The meatballs failed miserably as they stunk like yesterday's laundry.  They tasted ok but the smell really curdled our appetite.  Luckily the Thai chicken won tons were excellent.  Add to that a wedge salad, housebrewed root beer and cream soda, and a kids meal and the three of us got out for under $40.00 with full tummies!  And the kids Pazooki comes with their meal and is big enough fo the adults to sample without stuffing it in."}
{"text":"We were shopping in the area and wanted something cool to drink, also realizing we probably could handle a snack as well. Rather than hop in the car and head somewhere else, we popped in here to check it out.

Three words: Small bites menu. 

The spinach stuffed mushrooms were plentiful and really tasty, with just a hint of spice. The caps were large and generously stuffed.

The caprese (mozzarella salad) was OK. Not bad, but just OK. There was something odd about it and I didn't care for the parmesan cheese. Let the tomatoes and mozzarella do their thing; something about the extra cheese and the way it was dressed just made it... well, OK.

The fried artichokes were a bit heavy for me, but that's just personal preference talking. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and really, really tasty. My guests dug into them with abandon and didn't leave a crumb untouched. Very well done.

The seared ahi was absolutely perfect. This was really the only dish that was small - four pieces? - but at the price they offer it, it's a fabulous little snack and exactly what they portray it to be. The dipping sauce was flavorful, didn't seem laden with salt (a very good thing) and had a great little kick to it. Standout little dish.

We also had a couple of salads that were really fresh; the flavors of the vegetables and toppings were bright and clean. 

The \"spicy\" bloody mary wasn't; the waitress admitted it was from a mix and that they couldn't really do much to it for me. She brought some Tabasco sauce which helped, but as it wasn't fresh, it was really just a mix with some vodka and Tabasco. Not horrible (of course I drank it!) but not a good, hand-crafted bloody mary.

And, all this for less than $30. 

It's a 3-star (A-OK) place, for sure. The service is what made it a 4 for us. It's a chain and it's a bit cookie-cutter, but that works here. Definitely a respectable, repeatable dining experience."}
{"text":"So..I go to BJ's with my wife and two granddaughters for an early dinner at 4pm on a Saturday.   We were promptly seated and our server was Shane.  Shane was at first attentive and provided us drinks and took our order.  Then the group from hell arrived and took all of Shane's attention.  It was a large group and they wanted the tables set up a certain way so Shane was moving tables around for 15 minutes.  I had to wonder where was my food?  Was it waiting for Shane who had no time to check on our order as he was being ordered about like a servant from the group from hell.  Finally the food came.  The food was good and we enjoyed the taste.  But then our empty dishes sat until Shane had more time for us.  Our plates cleared we now wanted desert.  We waited for Shane. We finally ordered our desert which was good and we're finally ready to depart.  The check came with our desert so we didn't have to wait long.  Our credit card was charged promptly and returned to us quickly.  We were ready to leave this restaurant which was now so loud from the group from hell that acted like they owned the restaurant that we could barely hear each other.  Awwww peace and quiet (and hot) outside.  It is now 5:30 pm.  An hour and a half to get two sandwiches, soup, and Childs macaroni and cheese along with desert....FYI we tipped Shane $8.00 which normally would have been $10.00 on a $50 tab.   Because we were not sure if Shane requested that he be allowed to work the large group and smaller tables or if the host just seated us where he had to attend to both of us.  Anyway we had not been to BJ's in a while and based on this experience doubt we'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to home so I wanted to love it. They do have a nice selection of beer and their own beer is decent. But the 3 stars goes to their food. It looked really good but the taste was just mediocre. I was also disappointed that they don't have outdoor seating. I'll be back but probably just for drinks because there are better food options within walking distance."}
{"text":"This is the second time this year that I went here and both times were horrible.  The wait for the food was long above all days, yesterday was my birthday.  Our appetizers were served cold and I witnessed a server chatting with a couple practically the entire time I was sitting at my table.  I asked the employee who served the appetizers for plates.  He got 2 plates and said he would get another plate in the kitchen and never returned.  There was 3 of us.  Some of the items we requested were not available.  My son ordered a burger which comes with fries but the fries wasn't served with it.  He ate half of his burger and I asked the server, can you check on his fries because he is almost done eating.  The server was surprised and went to the kitchen to check on it.   15 minutes pass, still no fries.  I asked another employee again to check on it. Finally, it was served and my son was already done with his burger and he didn't want to eat it.  My son asked for a box to a waiter that was walking by, my son asked, \"Excuse me sir, may I have a box?\". He looked at my son and continued walking without acknowledging my son's request! I really cannot recommend this place and everyone I spoke with had a BAD experience at this particular restaurant. Oh and the restaurant was not even busy!!!"}
{"text":"I kinda feel like BJ's is the working mans CheeseCake Factory. HaHa.

Favorite Appetizer is the Stuffed Mushrooms and their brewed root beer is pretty good. I like how there is refills on the brewed root beer. 

I've yet to get something there I haven't liked. I love the blonde shrimp and can't ever go wrong with their BBQ chicken salad.

The pizza cookie is pretty good. 

Service has yet to be sub par. I frequent about once a month. And its always what I expect."}
{"text":"Usually we really enjoy this location but the service and food quality has gone downhill. Waiter did not take empty drink glasses from the table and was not very attentive. Some serious re-training needs to happen."}
{"text":"From the time hubby and I entered to the time we left, we were HAPPY!  The host was super friendly and seated us promptly.  Our waiter was quick and attentive.  He brought our drinks out fast, with care and always had refills for us.  The food was AMAZING!  I originally wanted to try the avacado wrap appetizer, but unfortunately, they were out.  We ended up ordering calamari.  It was cooked to perfection and tasted WONDERFUL!!

Our meals were also cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful.  I got a burger and asked for medium.  They were RIGHT ON!  PERFECT and JUICY!!  Well seasoned.

I did not visit the restrooms on this occasion, but the whole place screamed casual ambiance.  It was clean, neat and well decorated.  I can't complain about anything.  Why 4 stars you ask, if I liked it so much.  I really hated that we arrived at 11:30am, shortly after opening and they were already out of stuff.  

So, in short, YES I would go back.  Worth the price.  Great service!  Great food!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try BJ's since I've had some positive experiences with Brewery's in the past few months. However, I left unimpressed.  I can't say the food was bad, but it wasn't remarkable. I had the burger, which was okay, but very greasy. My wife had one of the pizzas that had what appeared to be canned or stewed tomatoes on it which she thought were rather bland and tasteless.  

I wasn't able to sample any of the brew selections due to constraints of the diet, but my wife did have a pint of their featured ale and she said it was really good.  The service was decent, and there was about a 15 minute wait to get seated.  All in all, I don't think I'd go back and so I'm filing this one under, \"been there, done that...You can keep the tee shirt.\""}
{"text":"My husband and I had a date night here the other night. The food and ambience were pretty good. I loved the Brussel sprouts appetizer. The service started strong, but declined as the night continued. The server became increasingly irritable throughout the night. It could have been a bad night, understandable. When we go out we like to relax and take our time- a departure from regular life. So the kicker for us was that the server dropped the check before the dessert even arrived and continued to point out that the check was there. I get it- you want to turn your table, but this was inappropriate.  I would think that this isn't company policy to rush their guests out the door.  Assuming that this is just a fluke we will probably be back because the food was delicious. 

Update:
So hubby and I returned to indulge my preggo craving of potato skins. I read an article that featured BJs in the top 10 of potato skins in Phx, so I was sold. Soooooooo glad that we did. Those little nuggets of carbs and fat were delectable. My little boy was dancing in utero out of gratitude. Our server, Erin I think, was fantastic. She appeared swamped but handled it like a pro. There was a tiny issue with food (not her fault) but her approach was top notch customer service. So glad we came back to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Bravo! Mother's day for all restaurants is the busiest day of the year. We went to BJ's today at lunchtime. It was packed as were all other restaurants. We were seated right away, our server Nick greeted us right away. He took and placed our order on an e-tablet right away. Wow! We were greeted, served, ate and left in less than forty-five minutes. Wow! The service, food and management were exceptional on the busiest day of the year. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love BJ's Brewhouse! They have it all; great service, a wide variety of beer selection, excellent food in appetizers and entrees, and a beautiful restauran. I have rarely ever waited to be seated and their service is fast. I like to order the Harvest Hefeweizen, it had great flavor and is spicy enough for my taste. We always order their chicken wings - I like the hot and spicy sauce. My favorite entree that I always get without fail are the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, they're delicious, light and refreshing. I have loved everything I've eaten here and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar faire for Vegas.  The hostess was a bit of a biatch and did not listen to me about the table choice.  The server fixed it for us because she cared.   The four entrees our party ordered were all tasty and well prepared.  The place is clean and well cared for.  The decor is a bit over the top but it works.  

It is not someplace I feel a burning desire to go but not a place I frown about either."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight with some friends to try something new.  Arrived about 5 and had a 25-ish min wait, which wasn't to bad considering it looked like everywhere in this area had a line. Hostess at the check in station was very pleasant and polite, as was our server Willis despite the rest of the staff who didn't appear to be the least be pleased to be at work.  Willis was as amazing as the menu selections and the house made root beer.  One of my dinner friends is a total jokester and was on point tonight and Willis played along with the cracks and jokes very well.  
On to the food we shared an appetizer of the California flat bread which was very good, the garlic aoli would have been good on anything! Two of us ordered steaks and the other ordered the BBQ brisket burger.  I know people think it is crazy to order a steak well done, but I don't like blood or red coming from anything I eat so I ordered my steak well done.  This was the negative of the night, when my steak was brought to the table there was pink juice on the plate I gave the benefit of the doubt until I cut open the steak and it was MAYBE Medium to Medium Well but definitely NOT done.  Willis appeared with in moments and took my steak back to have it finished to a well done.  Glad I had enjoyed my salad with ranch (also very good but seemed house made as it had a different flavor) and my baked potato from my main course to enjoy until the streak came back.  It came back and was done enough to cut and enjoy, I had to add salt to the steak as it had no flavor other than a lot of char.  I realize cooking a well done steak takes some finesse and know how to not burn the outside but get the inside complete, I just wont order a steak here next time.  The other steak that was ordered did get delivered cooked correctly but he also commented that it lacked seasoning.  The brisket burger was enjoyed along with both types of fries were tried at the table and we all enjoyed them both. 
Over all there are quite a few things I wouldn't mind trying here, sure we'll be back at some point when my husband returns home because he enjoys tasting crafted beers. I do with there was no beer cheese soup or pretzel with cheese dip; that's one of my favorite things to try at brew-houses we visit.  
Do try the Roo tbeer- AMAZING!!! I really enjoyed the orange creme too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. We went last night, and it was busy. Our server did not seem that attentive; however, the food was pretty good. It was just an average visit."}
{"text":"The first time I went on Saturday it was just average. The burger I had was ok but the fries were great. Everybody's meal was average. Got a gift card and decided to combine it with the $10 off $35 deal they have going on. I went back with my sister last night just to use the gift card. Initially I was only going to get the beignet since that's the one thing I did enjoy during my first visit, but I saw the pizza on the menu and decided I would give it a try. The pizza I had was greeeeaattt! I can't wait to go back I've been craving it ever since I left. My sister got the ahi poke and salad and she really liked her food this time as well."}
{"text":"On a week long happy hour hopping experience -visiting 10 spots in the pheonix/scottsdale area, this place rated #10, last. Really disappointing - especially after having come from yard House and Roaring fork - this place - the pizza tasted like a kids meal, price was same as another restaurant yet half the size. Was thankful for a good champagne split. Wings were okay nothing great - good bar if you want beer and TVs, wouldn't recommend it otherwise and definitely wouldn't spend money on a full price menu."}
{"text":"Pizookie near my house, ahhhhhh!!!!! 

I am so happy BJ's opened up in Centennial. I was so excited when I saw it being built and could not wait for it to open. I can hope for shorter lines than the one in Summerlin! 

Well I went to visit this place last Friday for lunch and enjoyed my experience. The decor is pretty much the same but I love the big open windows because the one in Summerlin feels like its in a casino. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive, a little to much at the end after we paid but she will get over it, haha. I ordered the club sandwich and my friend ordered the pulled pork. Both were very yummy and came out in a timely fashion. Of course we than had to have some pizookies! I ordered the red velvet and wow that's one sugar rush. It was so yummy! I was hurting at the end. 

Even when its busy I love coming here just because the atmosphere and they have some good food and beer! I am so happy this place is so close now. I may need to go to AA for Pizookie's!"}
{"text":"They sat 27ppl at 2 tables around us shortly after we ordered.  Our waitress was way over whelmed to say the least.  Our drinks sat empty and we waited 45mins for our food.  Which was cold and obviously had been under a heat lamp for several mins.  No other waitress or manager helped.  Finally had to yell and waive one down to get some attention.  Food would have probably been good if it was hot...sucked bad.  Won't be back..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I asked for a recommendation on draft beers and the bartender was very knowledgeable about all of the beers.  I really like the open layout of the whole place.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and added a star because the service is great and the beer is solid, however the food is very weak.

I first ate a BJs in Southern California about 10 years ago. The deep dish pizza was amazing; hot and fresh and very delicious, as was everything else. Now, the food at this location or perhaps at all locations is extremely subpar compared to what they used to serve. It almost always comes out room temperature and has obviously been pre-prepped and then slightly heated before being served. A deep dish pizza that comes out at room temperature is probably one of the most disappointing experiences a man can go through. However, if you can get the food made fresh, it is still great, but that's the problem.

A couple visits back I had a dish that was as stated above, room temp and old. I let them know and they brought me a fresh dish; it was great. This is not how a restaurant should operate; especially not BJs, when the food can be great.

I am pretty sure they keep this up because most people just accept it; sad. If you guys get your stuff together and start making the food fresh; let me know and I will give you another shot. Until then, no mas BJs for me.

Why are people so accepting of this and still flock to this joint?!?!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, the pumpkin beer was actually good.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is, the Cubs were still playing and they felt it necessary to change every tv to the D-backs game. They could have left one on the Cubs.  Then Hank walked in.  He started drinking heavily. He was being really loud and his pants were falling down.  I recommend BJ's I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, & great staff, very friendly and accommodating! Been here quite a few times & will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Came to this location at 10:30pm on a Sunday night with a friend for a night cap. We got a booth right next to a TV so I could watch sports center while women ramble as usual. Any who.. I got dry rub wings and she got a portobello mushrooms salad, along with a \"Strawberry Splash\" with a little extra vodka inside ;-) 

Our server Brandon was great, he even took a few bucks off the meal simply because he's cool like that! Only other BJ's I've been towas in California. I didn't know they were a national franchise company. I'm sure I'll return soon. Now that I know about this location. I recommend this place for a nice dinner. Prices not too bad either. Bring 40- 70 bucks with you for 2 people."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out and have an awesome meal with friends. Great food and beer. fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of our local BJ's in Corona, so while in Vegas we decided to meet up with his uncle here while his uncle was in vegas on business.  We like BJ's because of their gluten free options.  Although this location didn't have the gluten free crust, they still had the menu and the manager even came out and personally addressed my allergy and indicated he would oversee the preparation to make sure everything went well.  I thought that was above and beyond and the first time a manager had done that for me.  Service was great and food was great as usual!"}
{"text":"Went at three for lunch after shopping.  Happy hour deals were good in the bar area.  Those with burgers enjoyed them and the guacamole was good.  Two in the group ordered a soup and salad combo for their lunch, which came out 5-10 minutes before everyone's meals.  We asked the waitress and she told us that the soup and salad always comes out first, which I understand if you order a starter salad or cup of soup but not a combo for a lunch.  This made our lunch a lot less enjoyable.  Otherwise the food was mostly good but not memorable."}
{"text":"Hmm. I feel a bit bad giving this a three-star, considering that I haven't tried their pizzas yet.
I'll update it later if I come back to try them.

I've been to numerous BJs over the years, and I know how their song and dance go: Order the pizza, order the pizzookie, and you're good to go - everything else varies.
Well, I decided to go against that formula and ordered a beef dip. Which was actually surprisingly good, considering that I've ordered the same in a different BJs and it was so-so at best.

So why in the world would I give this 3-stars and not at LEAST a 4-star?
Two things:
1) The service was a bit... lacking. They seated us timely, they were /fairly/ friendly to us, and they got our orders correct. But you could tell that they didn't fully care. They were struggling just to keep their smiles on and their heads on straight. It was later at night, with closing hours coming soon, so it's obvious that most servers would be a little bit conked out by then. But still - it's no excuse. And it can affect other things. Such as the fact that they didn't notice that we didn't have utensils until we'd been staring at our plates for a little while. They didn't fully care for us other than for our orders and our general services. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but I do wish they wouldn't stare at us like we're 'just a job' to them. Again, though, it could just have been the time of the day and the events that transpired before we arrived, but still... it's what makes me remove a star.
2) The pizzookie was... okay.
That's kinda' an atrocity for a BJs.
Pizzookies are supposed to be soft and gooey (though slightly chewy) and absolutely delicious with the ice cream on top.
This one kinda' stuck to the pan a bit more than usual... and was a little too thin in some areas... it was a hassle to eat, and not a mouthgasm as I'd expect.
You can't make a pizzookie just 'okay', BJs! Other restaurants are starting to copy the pizzookie idea - you can't be skimping out on the quality! -1 star!

Outside of that, everything else was lovely. If you haven't been to a BJs, come here and give it a shot.
If you have been to a BJs, I'm sure you know a better one somewhere else. This isn't a bad choice, but it isn't an excellent choice.

Again, though, I'm going to have to update this review if I ever come back and try their pizzas."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza here is always amazing.  I get the BBQ chicken and bacon with extra cilantro on top.....THE BEST!!!!

The service is usually sub-par but it's Vegas.  Unless you're at a high-end restaurant, you can't expect much."}
{"text":"Great beer and great dining experience. I ordered from their healthy menu items and my dish came out super salty but my wife's was good and so was the kids meal I got for my son. The Jeremiah Red is a great beer that they brew and I would definitely suggest you try it."}
{"text":"This place is ok, I like that they have guest beers on tap as well as their house blend. 
The pizza is good, no question. But the seared ahí salad is just sad. So sad it shouldn't even be served.  There were about 10 slices of ahi, the thinnest slices I have ever had in a salad. Sierra gold does a better version, with full pieces of ahi."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer, and even better pizza! Don't leave without getting a Pizookie (or 3)."}
{"text":"Omg! Best pace to eat. Being from Cali , I figured there would be so many great places to eat, the last place I wanted to try was a chain. But holy moly! Such a selection and everything we got was so delish, without being overpriced. Love the atmosphere and the service! Can't wait till date night!"}
{"text":"I really should stop eating at chains..

It's not that they do anything wrong, its that they don't really do anything really well..

I get it get the pizza, OMG the pizookie bleh.. any bj across the nation has this, what happened to chains having individuality with their menus? 

At least their beer selection is local and growlers are available hence the 3 stars, but I think I'll pass on the food in the future..."}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place is that they serve food until midnight, when most of the other places stop serving much earlier.  Their menu is huge- everything from pasta to burgers.  Everything I've had on it is good.  The building is newer- it's a clean, comfortable place with a huge wall of TVs and cozy chairs.  Huge ceilings, very spacious.  Service is adequate- nothing special but gets the job done."}
{"text":"So, as you all know, BJ's is an unfortunately named chain restaurant. I went last night with the BF and his parents as it was his mom's birthday and that's where they wanted to go. It was actually a pleasant surprise! We all got drinks, I had the skinny -rita, which was really good, tart and fresh tasting. The BF got a snakebite, which was, as always, delicious. For dinner, I had the soup and salad with a caesar salad and tortilla soup. Going the 'healthy' route (I know this was not healthy in any way). The soup was very good and flavorful. They serve it 'fancy' style, putting chicken, avocado, tortilla, cheese, and bell pepper in the bottom of a bowl and then pouring the broth over the bowl table side. Nice touch. The salad was fair. Everyone else reported that they enjoyed their entrees. We had pizzookie for dessert, a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream, delish. All of this for only 80$...pretty good deal. My only complaints are minimal and include: I wish they offered half portions at discounted prices....the portion sizes are way too big and there were a lot of things that looked good on the menu, but I wouldn't order them because I didn't want such a large portion. Also, this restaurant is busy and the wait to eat here is a little over the top....I wish that they took reservations. Overall, this place was good, especially for a chain."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. I went here for lunch with my grandma yesterday and it was alright. The one thing I really didn't like was that their menu had too many different types of food and the lunch specials, although plentiful, didn't look all that good to me. So we decided to share a few apps. We got the spring rolls, lettuce wraps, and the mozz and tomato salad. The salad was pretty good, the balsamic on it was tangy and it was a decent deal at 3$. The spring rolls were also just alright....they were like a tex mex spring roll....the plate has a lot of rolls, but the sauces they serve with it weren't very spicy or flavorful. The lettuce wraps were kind of the same way.... they were a bit bland, not bad, but not good. We ended the meal with the triple chocolate pizookie. This was the best part....super chocolatey and delicious. I'd go back if I were in the area, but for the price, it isn't anything special."}
{"text":"I took several of my Co workers here for some appetizers and a few drinks, with 6 of us... all laughing and having a great time. We had a total tab of $150. Including $60 of appetizers.... we had been there 55 minutes and the manager, a very young and inexperienced guy decided that he should cut us off, simply because we were being loud in the bar area.   We were not intoxicated, we were laughing and making jokes.  Of all the times I have been to a restaurant, and or bar. This was by far the worst call ever made by a manager on duty.   Luckily we were very close to a place called RTO Sullivan's.  We went there and had a great time.  BJ's ....You had an epic failure on Saturday night."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to BJs in a few years, try it now. Revamped menu has a wide range of dishes, and we have yet to find one that wasn't prepared perfectly and full of flavor. The enlightened options are excellent, and all within a reasonable calorie range. 

In addition to the strong selection of beers, they offer a good selection of wines by the glass and top-shelf liquor options, and their bartenders are well trained professionals. 

Even the pizookies are improved and diversified. 

Well done, BJs!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in the customer service of the host, Sam. She was extremely rude and due to her lack of clarification, we had waited 45 minutes to be seated when we were told about 20 minutes. When we asked how much longer our wait time was (after expecting to already be sat) she continued to say we were next, as minutes went by. The manager came over and sat us immediately and was confused why we weren't seated yet (as were we). The manager however was great, as was our waitress. The food was also good. Honestly though, I probably won't return. Nobody has time to wait nearly an hour due to a hostess with a poor attitude."}
{"text":"First time here and it was interesting. Spent ten minutes waiting for three different hostesses to find a table for me to sit at. There was practically nobody in the place. Food was good. Service was mediocre at best. Don't come here thirsty. They don't give refills even though the menu says free refills. Overall good but for the price and drive I will go across the street to Cheddars."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned at first because often times restaurants with large menus suffer in terms of quality but maybe my girlfriend and I just chose our options wisely this time. I had a pork chop with a side of white cheddar mashed potatoes and garlic asparagus along with a fruit cider to wash it all down. It's hard to remember the last time I had such a filling, savoury meal. The pork came with a Dijon sauce that was delicious to the last drop, I was almost tempted to ask for more. Definitely going to make a point to come here again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. Got seated promptly, hostesses were friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Our server was Aimee. She was personable. However, we got there just as her section seemed to be filling up. She started looking overwhelmed. I ordered a small deep dish, it came out as a mini. I was disappointed but tried to let it go. Then we started seeing less of her. Our drinks stayed empty, some random server came over and took our dessert order. I asked for chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla and she said sure, but when it came out it still had vanilla. I don't know what happened there but it was still annoying. She brought me a water out with dessert even though that's not what I had been drinking. She brought my boyfriend refills the entire dinner but always seemed to forget mine. I had to actually correct her and tell her I still wanted refills on the drink I payed for. It sucks that our experience was sacrificed because she was overloaded and being seated with multiple tables at a time. Food was yummy, people were nice, but smaller sections to focus on quality of service or a better way of pacing the seating is needed."}
{"text":"I want to start by saving I love the fact that there is a BJ's restaurant in the centennial area. This place is usually crowded because of the limited restaurant options this side of town. BJ's is a traditional American style restaurant/pizzeria/Brewhouse and I've been coming to this chain for over 10 years (I've even been to this location a few times). I love the blonde beer and coming here for happy hour (half off mini pizzas). Came here with my brother for dinner and I have to say, we got 1 star service. First, our server BARELY gave us the time of day. She was already walking away while I was trying to ask for barbecue sauce on the side (she forgot the barbecue sauce btw). I ordered a mini barbecue chicken and side of fries and it took 30 minutes for it to come out! (I took a picture of my timer, the timer says 20 minutes but I started the timer after waiting roughly 10 minutes already). The server NEVER refilled our waters either. It was just frustrating watching the server give a lot of attention to all the tables around us, but would barely glance at my tables direction. If the restaurant was packed and super busy, I could understand the neglect, but the restaurant wasn't even busy(I took pictures to show all the empty seats around me). I wanted to order a pizookie (they are delicious) to end my night but was turned off my the service I was receiving so much that I skipped dessert. I love BJ's restaurant but every time I've been to this location I had a poor experience. I think this was my last time here"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  I like sitting at bar with huge TV during sports.  Their pizza is one of the best I have had.  Salads are good .  Jumbalaya is awesome.  Menu is huge and I haven't had a bad thing yet."}
{"text":"Our waiter James was awesome !!!! Very good!! And he recommend the best beer ever for me !!! BERRY BURST."}
{"text":"Been to this location a handful of times with my wife. Food is consistently very good. Well, I'm not sure about all the food. We usually just get a pizza . Once we came in for lunch specials and we were pleased then as well. Excellent craft beer, Jeremiah Red is my favorite. The pizookies are amazing. 

Lastly, on our most recent visit over the weekend. We had a young waiter named James. He was completely swamped, and also one of the best servers we have had at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place it's always fun times.  Make sure you come early or you can be waiting for a seat but it's well worth it.  The food is amazing can't wait till my bison burger gets here.  The pizza is fantastic and the pizzoki for dessert is the best. If your looking for a good craft beer tap list it's pretty well done."}
{"text":"They recently updated their lunch menu only available Monday through Friday and it's so good! I ordered the chicken bacon ranch and meat lovers piadina and it's literally the best thing I've ever had here. It's like the fancy version of a hot pocket. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and I will definitely order it again. For drinks, we ordered the hand crafted margarita and the harvest peach margarita. The bar tender was not shy when pouring the margaritas, which made very happy. The peach margarita is seasonal and was my favorite of the two. If you're old enough, I recommend sitting at the bar - you're right in front of the TVs playing a variety if sports channels and have easy access to alcohol!"}
{"text":"Hello! First off I would like start off by saying I have nothing against this establishment or its servers, however I do have a problem with the hostess that was on shift tonight(June 5th around 7pm). I believe her name was Jen (she was blonde if that helps). My friends and I are regulars and we enjoy coming here for the pizookies and the great service! Shout out to Laith, he's awesome and usually serves us! Also shout out to Lorianne, because she was our server tonight and was such a sweetheart! However, after tonight we left with sour faces because of the attitude we were greeted with by the hostess. Here's the story: I come in and promptly put my name on the list seeing that it's going to take a while. I was told that the wait would be 35-40 minutes, which was fine because I get it $3 Pizookie Tuesdays. I informed the hostess that my party and I will be standing behind them because we didn't want to block the entrance and she acknowledged. As about 40 minutes pass by, I go back to the counter to see what was the status of our table. The hostess gave me the most condescending response saying \"We just called you.\" I respond saying \"I'm sorry I didn't hear you. It's kind of loud.\" She then begins to roll her eyes at me, begin shaking her head, and giving off a crappy attitude saying, \"Well, yeah we just called you and I heard the other hostess call your name. What's your name again? Now I have to put your name on the list again.\" She continues to roll her eyes and shake her head. Well I'm glad the hostess was able to hear my name being called, however I obviously couldn't. She was very rude and treated us as if we were a nuisance. I just wanted to call attention to this issue because apparently a certain hostess needs to learn the proper etiquette of customer service. My friends and I love coming here, hopefully that doesn't have to stop because of a hostess with a poor attitude."}
{"text":"First of all I'm not sure why I couldn't find this place on Yelp while I was there. Had to google it then locate it. Anyways... Came here for dinner and can't really go wrong here. Had a beer sampler and they had a 25 dollar special for 2 so my fiancé and I had it. It included either a soup or salad and a medium deep dish pizza along with their famous pizookie. Everything was delicious and our server was wonderful. This place normally doesn't get too crowded and the wait is very minimal. Will def be a regular here."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner before the movies.  Service improved a bit or maybe bc it was a weekday.  We sat at the bar area to see if the wait will be better.  Started slow but at least not as bad as last time, and our server got the orders correctly.

The hubby and I shared the 2 for $25, which includes a soup/salad, medium pizza and pizookie.  I had a cesar salad and hubby had the house wedge salad that has bacon, tomatoes, & vinaigrette dressing.  Both were what you would expect.  We had the BJs favorite deep dish (peperroni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, olives).  It was delish, but don't get it if you dislike raw and chunky veggies.  It was lacking in the meats though.  

The salted caramel pizookie was the highlight.  I'd say the 2 for $25 is a good portion for 2 people.  We had pizza leftovers.  We also had a very berry margarita (strong but tasty) and a wildberry mojito (pretty good).  Cocktails are pricey.  Happy hr is $1 off drinks.

I didn't see the 2 for $25 on the menu, so you would have to ask the server if they are offering it when you go.  One thing I noticed that's different here from other BJs is that the servers do not ask about your interest in the pizookie until you're done w/ dinner.  I can understand that that's probably more with etiquette.  At other BJs, they ask you in the beginning so they can time the pizookie perfectly since it is made to order.  I hope this place keeps improving in service."}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price. What makes the price so great is how big the portion size was. Pretty sure we have enough leftovers for a few extra meals. The beer flight was great too but I wish the glasses were a little bigger than the ones they serve. It was basically a shot glass. Of course, had to finish off the night with a delicious pazookie!! Overall loved getting BJ's!!"}
{"text":"Dining in a weekend, expect a bit of a wait time. We waited about 45 minutes for a party of 3. They do offer an app that you can put your name into avoid having to stand around in crowds of people. Our server was pleasant and when something came floating in our wine glass, she fixed the problem promptly by bringing a new glass. Before our meal, we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the Brussel sprouts. He egg rolls are alway a favorite of mine and although the Brussel sprouts were not my cup of tea, they were edible and my friends seem to enjoy them. I was able to pick an alternative side with my shrimp tacos, which were seasoned well and very delicious! My husband ordered the pork chop and as you can see, was quite massive! Our overall experience was a good one on this trip and we are sure to venture back."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch at 12:30 on a Saturday on a beautiful September day knowing they had patio seating which is what we were looking for. The host was rude, telling us we needed to wait to see if he could find a server who would be willing to serve out there. After a wait, he returned telling us he was unable to find a server willing to serve us on the patio and that we could sit inside... \"He didn't want us to leave... But sorry\". So, we left. We went next door and enjoyed a beautiful patio lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"So this is my new favorite chain restaurant since Yard House has been going downhill with the service and consistency. 

With that said, it isn't perfect. We have certainly gotten our share of inattentive servers (sorry to be sexist but the men tend to be the ones that leave us hanging for way too long, the women have been way more on top of their game here) and the hostess/seating people are fairly unfriendly. I always hate that the first experience walking in seems to be being ignored. Oh and the wait times can be insane, for that whole area of restaurants there, especially on a Friday/Saturday night......anyway, let's move on to the good shall we?

The pizza - I think it is delicious, and this isn't even my favorite type of pizza, it is more of a deep dish, which I am usually not a fan of, but theirs is almost always pretty delicious. They had this mushroom, balsamic one that was SO FREAKING GOOD and I almost cried when I was told they took it off the menu, but alas, the Sweet Pig is pretty yummy too, so that is what we often get. 

The other stuff - I have gotten some other dishes but honestly, I prefer the pizza over everything else. Can't really remember what I have ordered, which probably says something, but the last dozen times or so have been all about the pizza.

Now on to the PIZOOKIES - Soooooooo yummy. Little pans of cookies served up warm with ice cream on top. We have even gone just for dessert a time or two, they are really that good.

We also joined their rewards club and have earned enough points for free pizookies and $10 off our meals, so that is always a nice incentive to come back. They also run decent meal promos sometimes (something like soup or salad, pizza and pizookie for 2 for $20) so a super cheap lunch is always a good incentive too. The atmosphere is pretty typical for this type of restaurant, generally busy and somewhat loud, lots of TV's going, etc., but I find it to be a perfectly nice place to have a lunch or dinner out."}
{"text":"I used to work for BJ's in a different state and can say this location holds to the standards of the company. 
They have amazing beers and great pizza. Worth every penny! Happy Hour is a really good deal if you are looking to save a bit."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, as is the beer.  My favorite is during the fall when they have the Pumpkin Ale.  I love that you can buy growlers of the beer to take home, and the root beer is really good as well.  It is great to take home and make your own root beer floats.  The service is usually really friendly, but at times it's been kind of slow.  I prefer to go and sit in the bar area during happy hour, where they have great drink and food specials.  There is something on the menu for everyone.  I love the small bites and the pizzas, especially during happy hour when they are half off (in the bar area)."}
{"text":"We tried this place as part of our #secondsaturday dinner group. We have seven couples that take turns selecting a new restaurant each month. Everyone liked what they ordered and as we pass around all the appetizers and share big plate items, I can say that I liked it all. I was enjoying my Piranha Pale Ale so potato skins and pizza seemed like the correct \"pairing\". The skins were cooked perfectly and the pizza was a good thick and soft crust that BJs is famous for. The service was good and pretty quick even considering our party of 12. It seemed like we had a team of servers. The big hit of the night was definitely the \"Beer Tasting\" were you get four choices of their house drafts. Bring the gang and prepare for a good time with good food."}
{"text":"We would really like to like this restaurant. Visited four times and each time the food is uneven and the service. We have the watermelon and feta salad.  We asked for something to be substituted for the Feta. We were  told we could have avocado our surprise came with the bill, there was an additional charge. The avocado eggrolls were great. And they do hamburger and french fries pretty well. The price seems out of line with quality of the food. It's in such a great location we will probably try it again but if you're going for burgers and fries I probably would try the near by bistro or burgetory."}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp and asparagus pasta which I tried and did not like at all. The waitress was nice, but why charge full price for something that I mentioned not liking. She said to me, \"well at least you were a trooper and tried something new\". Did not bother letting a manager know or anything. Great way to fix the problem!"}
{"text":"Brak likes BJ's. For a \"brew house\" kind of joint, the food is WAY above average.  Some of the servers have been here for years and are great.  Others are horrendous - we've had service ranging from outstanding to unacceptable here.  But the food has been consistently good.  Brak likes the chicken parm lunch special.  The marinara sauce has an extra spicy kick that's both unusual and very tasty.  Would have granted 4 stars if not for the spotty service.  But the food has been consistently good, and is a regular spot on our office lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Every time my family and I have come here we've only had to wait about five minutes for a table. Even when it seems really busy on the outside don't let that fool you, the wait is usually minimal. The restaurant is always very nice and clean and the staff members are always very friendly. Do you have a great selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"We went here after not conning here for 10 years. It was the same experience 10 years ago.  It was average pizza and average service. I don't think we we will be back."}
{"text":"The food is always really good, and the menu has numerous options to choose from. The two for $25 deal is great because it gives you the same tasty food for a fraction of the cost. Most of the servers are good, but the last few times we have had one who is not very good. However, the food and drinks make up for it for the most part. The wait can be long at times, but if you call ahead to be put on the waitlist, it cuts the time down a bit."}
{"text":"Sucks! The service gets worse every time we go. Today we were seated, the server dropped off a couple of promotional napkins and then disappeared. No drinks, no way to order food...
We dropped off our member card on our way out the door for the last time. BJ's has NOT earned our business.
We went down the street to the Market Grille Cafe, we were seated, got drinks and ordered food in 5 minutes or less. Yes, they were as busy as BJ's. I suggest the manager of BJ's bring his staff to the Market Grille Cafe for lunch and see how it's done."}
{"text":"Since I am so anti dives and pubs, this place is a good middle ground for me and my guy friends. It's a great place for happy hour - I love the nice ambiance and cleanliness, they love the huge beer list.
And since it's right at Chandler Mall, I love that we can grab a drink, and I can hit up the sales. Perfect!"}
{"text":"My bestie and I stopped by for the first time last night. Overall the experiance was just ok. The restaurant is new in our area so I would imagine the staff would be upbeat and pleasant but it seemed everyone was just going thru the motions...maybe they were just ready to go home, that's the feel I got. We were seated and quickly greeted by our waitress. She immediately rambled off 3 beers for recommendations, no \"hey, how ya doin'\", just straight to the drinks, names we've never heard or had any idea or detail about. We asked for a moment to decide and after browsing the extensive drink menu,  she did offer me a tester of a cider I was on the fence about. The Berry Burst Cider was pretty good, if you aren't really into beer try it. 
We decided to order the lettuce wraps (meh), stuffed mushrooms (bland), root beer ribs and shrimp tacos. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were sooo yummy. The sauce was sticky and sweet which I loved. You get 5 bones and they are the babiest babyback ribs, smaller than ribs in a kids meal, delicious nonetheless. We had to ask for small plates and silverware. All the food came out at the same time except for the tacos, which the waitress zoomed by and said will be it shortly. We ate and chatted patiently waiting...no tacos. Our waitress stopped by to get our empty plates and asked us did we get our tacos :(. After waiting almost 10 mins out came the tacos...the late, dry, flavorless tacos. Unapologetic about the late entrée, onto the sales pitch of 3 different desserts. Now this is where BJs did not miss! OMG the Pizooki Trio was amazing! You can choose your 3 which we had the seasonal Pumpkin, Salted Caramel and White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, each were heavenly. The waitress dropped off the bill with the dessert and said no rush enjoy. 
So in all, the dessert is amazing, food is mediocre at best and service was as if waitresses no longer care about wanting tips."}
{"text":"I have usually gone here for dinner for pizza and beer but this time went during lunch.  They have some really good lunch deals and the lunch choices were many.  I enjoyed the half flatbread pizza and salad.  However, my companions had the pasta lunch special, chicken fingers and fish & chips and all was good.  We started off with the Fritos nachos which were surprisingly good.  Prices were very reasonable for lunch and will be added to my places to choose from."}
{"text":"Get the Mediterranean Pita Tacos (you can have chicken or go vegetarian) so good!!! I came here last night and got them for dinner and came back today to do it again. They have added some new iced teas so that makes me happy and their beer selection is always on point"}
{"text":"The server is nice and helpful, but it took 15 min for someone to stop by.
Maybe the host didn't communicate..? 
I will never know."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food & service! Also, this is a Pokestop"}
{"text":"While I try for the most part NOT to write negative reviews, I just couldn't help myself this time. I've been here for several lunch meetings and each time I think 'eh they're having an off day, next time will be better'. That's not the case. Every time I've been here (and it's only ever been for lunch), service is slow, servers seem confused and too busy (even though there are dozens of them on staff), there have been poor explanations of the dishes, food was served barely warm and of mediocre taste. 

The restaurant does always seem to be busy though, so apparently other people have had different experiences - good for them. 

... On a lighter note, the beer is delicious. I've had the Pale Ale and the Red which both awesome. Perhaps if I were to try it again (doubtful) that I should just sit at the bar?"}
{"text":"Went to this place for Christmas dinner with staff.
The waiter was messing up all the order placed after a long wait time.
Desert with cookies and ice cream was good
Will not go again with larger group"}
{"text":"After 15 minutes with no service we almost got up and left. Service was extremely slow.  There were multiple issues with our orders and one dish came out after everyone else was finished. We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Here now for lunch. Cesar salad was a bit wilted. Potato wedges were underwhelming. California chicken sandwich was just ok. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could. Gordon Beirsch kills this place. Service was fast and friendly so there's that."}
{"text":"Meal was going great until our server Jennifer came over to our table 5 minutes after dropping off our check and told us that we needed to sign our check so she could go home. We were still in the middle of eating our dessert. Poor display of customer service."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife and son for his birthday. Asked server for beer recommendations and he suggested one for each. Spot on! 

Each of us has different dinners from a huge menu, with a salad for one to baked pasta for another and to a bacon burger. Each one drew raves! Finished up with a peanut butter s'mores desert, called a Poozkie, which was perfect for three. 

There is a wait, but load their app, call ahead and get bonus! 

Will be back since there beer selection combines there house brews and a good cross section of others."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of these around the country, it performed as expected, middle of the road. Three stars says it all. Got the asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan cheese, guess the cheese was in short supply, a tiny sprinkle across the middle of the plate. The bartender was nice enough to ask how they were but really did not care to bring more cheese. Beer? It's ok. But then it's shipped from Arizona. That's according to the bartender."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter for dinner. They seriously under estimated the wait time. Then the dinner was seriously subpar. I had rice with my meal which in lauded hard baked kernels of rice in each mouthful. My daughters mashed potatoes were so bad she wouldn't eat them. I tried them and the tasted like poorly done instant potatoes . I won't return"}
{"text":"Monday at 8:30 pm.....why is service terrible?
Place isn't crowded, yet I gotta get up from the table to chase down the waiter for another beer.  Not being total hater, food was pretty good.  Really liked the thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and some really good apps.  Not a fan of the \"tacos\" because the shell is pita bread, no thanks. Deep dish pizza is more bread than cheese.  Pulled pork was good and also the Root Beer glazed ribs.  I plan on going back again for their beers and apps."}
{"text":"We came here after work for beer and pizza and the staff was very friendly. We ordered a bacon ranch chicken pizza with no onion... When our pizza came it did in fact have onion but it wasn't a big deal to pick it off. Our waitress offered to get us a new pizza without onion right away but we declined. Before our check came the manager came to us with a fresh pizza in a to go box without onion free of charge just to be sure we left completely satisfied. We were all very impressed with the excellent service!"}
{"text":"Always great food here. Sat at the bar a random afternoon to have a pizookie. The bartender woman Chris is awesome. Hard worker and great personality! She runs circles around the other girl! ...Love BJ's, it's always a great option when we are indecisive where to go!"}
{"text":"The customer service sucked. When you walk up to ask a question he turns his back to you.  They also said it would be 5 min more and it was 20.  Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"For my birthday every year, my parents come down from Payson to take me to lunch. We try to coordinate where to meet, and since I have a client in Gilbert, my boyfriend suggested this. Oh, and they wanted to go to Winco right after, so this seemed like a good spot. I had never in my life heard of the place. Sometimes, that's a good thing.
Today, though, it wasn't. Turns out, it's just a huge room with an even bigger menu. I chose the Cobb salad. 
Now, let me make one thing clear: If I am going to have a salad, I always get a Cobb salad. The Vig Uptown has my favorite one. I *know* a Cobb salad. The menu said it came with feta. F. E. T. A. on a Cobb salad. I asked the waitress to substitute the feta for blue cheese, remove the bacon (I knew it wouldn't be real bacon, and I hate bacon bits), and keep the dressing on the side. It also came with \"turkey.\"
Never in my life have I sent anything back to a kitchen. Ever. But there was no way I was going to let this pass. I've seen enough Kitchen Nightmares to know that Gordon would have told the server to have the chef eat that salad, just to see how horrible their food was. And that's exactly what I told her. The \"turkey\" were a bunch of cubes of white stuff on my plate, that had obviously been frozen, and had as much flavor as the iceberg lettuce. There were chopped tomatoes all over the place, and my \"cucumber\" was a tiny slice off the end of the cucumber. (see photo)
She offered to bring me something else, and I declined. I didn't even want the free *$&#*$&# pizookie, that's how angry and disappointed I was. They took the \"Cobb salad\" off our bill, and we went on our merry way. 
My stomach was rumbling on my way home. I fear it's going to be a looooooooooong night. From a salad. The worst salad in all the land.
I will never, ever eat at any location of this hole again. I had no idea it was a chain, or I would have picked something else.
I've never cried during a birthday lunch with my parents, but I was mighty close today."}
{"text":"I must say... BJ's has turned it around! There was a time where we couldn't seem to get the correct food or something yummy looking. However, we started seeing a different group of guys working the bar and times have times!! Yummy food, happy and friendly service, and always great beer choices.

PS.. Happy hour goes until 7!!!!"}
{"text":"Heaven!!! On. A plate!! Sorry no pics, I ate them all! I got the avacodo egg rolls w dipping sauce! Amaze!! Also a salad arugala and beet w these pine nuts! Hubby got sliders  their fries were good too! Mmm the steak dinner w mashed potatoes! Garlic mashed potatoes too . And for dessert! Drumroll pleaseeeeee......pizzacookie?!?! Something like that! I'll show u! Also, so many menu options. That was a bit overwhelming, I couldn't decide! We ordered take out n it wasn't as good. But the atmosphere was really cool too. I would def go back!"}
{"text":"This place is full of patrons every time I having dinner here. The wait staff are usually pretty friendly... Those are have been times where they seem frustrated and unattentive. Over all this restaurant will continue to receive my repeat business but I sure wish that they would step up the amount of time it takes to get our food and or our drinks. I can understand that they are busy, perhaps they should be hiring."}
{"text":"Great variety on menu.  Beer list is varied as well.   They sometimes have good beer from their own brewer.  The sound is loud. I like their bar and bartenders.  The Great White is my favorite white pizza and I usually don't like white pizzas but almost always at least order the mini here even if I am ordering other foods.   Their soups are all greAt!"}
{"text":"Met here for couples night out and it was our first time here. The menu was gigantic so there was something for everyone. The bar menu was very big also. Food was very good service was on point will go again."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite restaurant. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the size of this location and the wait time that results from it. You could come here on a Tuesday at 4:00 in a snow storm and you would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated. But the menu is an endless book of creative and delicious lunch, dinner, dessert & drink options! I've been here many times and have ordered something different every single time. I have never been disappointed. The staff treats their customers very well and they have a rewards program if you download their app! I could eat here every day and not get tired of it."}
{"text":"BJ's offers delicious eats, a family friendly environment, and courteous service! Our server was very accommodating and we had appetizing meals including buffalo chicken grilled cheese and fish and chips. We loved that the kid's meal side of fruit came with grapes cut in half. This is an extra step, and our kids only eat grapes this way. We will certainly be back, well done BJ's!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times for happy hour and the bartender has always been pleasant and/or at least doing their job however we stopped for lunch Tuesday after a horrid morning and we were pleased to find not only a friendly hostess but an engaging bartender. My guest check says Kymwonia so I hope that is correct because this girl is the \"BEST\". I have been here 20 years and rarely see anyone behind a bar with her qualities. She guided us through the B J Rewards app set up with the patience of a Saint. When I wanted to switch something up on the menu it was effortless on her part. My friend had a Bacon Cheeseburger and I had Mediterranean Tacos. Both were excellent and extremely fresh. If I have any complaint at all I think $6.75 for a well drink is outrageous because I know what it costs to pour that drink so for a \"locals\" hangout that can be a bit pricey. However management is on top of their game here and that is rare in the chain restaurants of the area."}
{"text":"Love bjs! Great food and love the beer selection! We like the poke app and like the buffalo chicken pizza! Also we like coming for lunch for there unlimited soup and salad! Tasty tasty! And only for 8 bucks! Last but not least is the famous pazooki!! Our favorite is the Oreo!! Also the new monkey bread is pretty good too! Overall good meal and good prices!"}
{"text":"BJ's Menu is expansive, the food is consistently good and the servers are always friendly.

My favorites:  Stuffed mushrooms, chicken lettuce wraps, market chop salad, Parmesan chicken, watermelon mojitos & margaritas.

The on-line ordering is easy as can be.  A great time saver for lunch on the run.  It's always ready when they say it will be and tastes just as good as when dining in the restaurant.

Serving a full menu until closing and open until midnight on weekdays and 1am on weekends makes it the perfect late evening spot after meetings or events."}
{"text":"So bad we didn't even receive service. Hostess told us it would be a ten minute wait. We patiently waited. Then we were sat in Michael's station waited 10 minutes without being acknowledged by ANYONE. I got up and asked the hostess for a manager. 5 minutes went by with no manager, the server acknowledged us after 15 minutes of waiting as we were already getting up to leave. Very disappointed. Went to Olive Garden instead."}
{"text":"BJ's has to be one of my favorite chain restaurants in Vegas! They have incredible lunch specials and literally everything on the menu is good. My husband and I eat here at least once a month. We usually share a small pizza, which is plenty. They serve deep dish style pizza, while not exactly reminiscent of Chicago it is no doubt delicious. There isn't really sauce on the pizza, but there are tomatoes which I tend to push aside. The pizza is best complimented with a delicious Cobb salad. This salad is fantastic with a creamy garlic dressing, croutons, turkey, avocado, and cheese. I also enjoy their sandwiches and you really can't go wrong with their wedge or shoestring fries. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like and they have quite an extensive menu. It is seriously delicious American style food.

If you find yourself here you really must get a Pizookie for dessert, it is required and I often come here just for a Pizookie! Who doesn't want a warm chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla bean ice cream? So unbelievably yummy. 

I have received spotty service at times, but overall BJ's is a fantastic go-to restaurant if you want quality, affordable, and delicious food that everyone will love."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times now and it's been awesome every time. The service is super friendly and helpful, and the food has just been awesome every time. The mixed drinks are super good but they are a little on the expensive side. They do have a beer sampler that you can try 5oz tasters of a few different beers, it's a very good price and pretty fun to do. Depending on the beers you choose you might end up a little buzzed after you try them all, we always do. Lol
We love this place. We definitely recommend it to everyone we know"}
{"text":"New stuffed mushroom appetizer! The food is always fantastic, but their is always a wait and the servers are stretched to the max. If you want something like say a drink refill, you will have to wait for your server to come back around which always seems to take longer than it should.  We will be back because the food is soo good, we have lowered our expectations for the service."}
{"text":"Great service by Kirsten...good beer selection.  avocado egg rolls good....bison burger better"}
{"text":"My wife and I feel like we were served by robots. The server stared at her little high tech gizmo as she took our order and never really looked up at us. Her voice was monotone. Everything took like a couple uneasy minutes too long. Like have you ever sat in a place and felt like you were being ignored and you were just about to stand up and leave without ordering and then from out of nowhere your server is hovering over you? Creepy. Then the server asked if we needed refills. We replied yes and she once again began playing with her little gizmo. Several minutes later an indentured servant would appear with our flat sodas. Our server never touched a glass a plate it was like she was too good for it. Then when I paid her fancy gizmo couldn't read my card so she told me my bank, dollar bank, wasn't as high tech as her gizmo. Man eat a bag o ****! Plus the food wasn't any better than applebees or fridays."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat for lunch or dinner or even just grab appetizers and drinks. 
This location in N. Las Vegas is always on busy side so be sure to plan ahead on your times to attend. Staff has always been great and service has always been on par even when its a full capacity. 

The bar location has bull seating, along with some table tops and booths. There are many TV's displayed around the restaurant but the bar area has the most options. The overall restaurant has many table and booth seating's and even an area for large groups. Park is pretty standard at this location and on busy times you may have to park a little farther out.

On this occasion I had early dinner with family. The drink menu is pretty extensive, mostly because they offer a large variety of beers. BJ's offers there own specialty brews, Today, I had the Tatonka Stout, very dark imperial stout, and a Brewhouse Blonde. Two completely opposite type beers but both are always a favorite when I'm in. 
With a full bar and beers on tap and seasonal brews your certainly able to find something to your liking.

Food has always been pretty good, I've had the steak before and was great and today I opted for more basic with the Chicken Club Sandwich and that was just as good. Chips and guacamole was a great appetizer as well, with the guacamole being a little spicy kick to it, not hot, just spicy. 

The other 3 all enjoyed there food and drinks. At the end we decided to go for the BJ's Famous Pizookie, Chocolate chip and of course no disappointment here with vanilla ice cream in the center of of a warm baked chocolate chip cookie pizza! 

I have been to another BJ's location in town and of course its just as on par with this location. I will certainly continue to enjoy my beers and pizookies at BJ's!"}
{"text":"The menu selection is great, the food was great, the service was okay- I don't know what the training is like, but I think the servers need to know the menu. Both the bartender and waiter had to look item up on their computer pad. That being said, we will return."}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite restaurant! Went on Friday and sat outside waiting for a table. Never mind the wait for their great food, but the smell of sewage outside was so bad that, by the time we got a table, I was terribly nauseous. Our clothes smelled of sewage. Felt bad for the waitress because we ordered drinks and had to take the check and leave. 

Don't know if we can go back which is really upsetting."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times. Their Sunday brunch was excellent, their regular menu is good, nothing too memorable except for the pizookie. Service was excellent this last visit for brunch. Would go here again."}
{"text":"My friends, family, and I all love this place. The food, the choices, and it's clean. The service however is often terrible. This location has been there a long time and it was amazing for years. The past year has significantly declined with friendliness and your waiter/waitress checking on you or never bringing what you ask. I really hope they get new management or employees soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food, terrible background music..(loud and blaring)and most of all terrible attitude from the manager...other than that, it was perfect"}
{"text":"The BBQ lunch platter is perfect!  Just enough to get my BBQ fix without putting myself into a protein coma.  Always get the best service at BJ's- what a great place! The waiter and manager made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"I have tried this place three times. I really wanted to like it. The food is overall good. The service is terrible. I sat at the bar each visit and the bartenders act as though they are too good for the customers. My last visit is my final visit. The bartender (I think her name was Bailey) was rude and arrogant. I was a server for years and I always said hello and treated all customers with respect. The bartenders act like it's a big bother for them to wait on customers. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"They have great food.  Everyone at the table loved their diah. The waiter was pleasant and always on top of giving us more water. The atmosphere was great not too loud and beautiful surroundings. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great Beer And the Ambiance is nice too. But over priced food, took long to bring are orders and the pizzas were barely warm, not hot. My sons hamburger was undercooked  and just barely warm. I guess our food was sitting for a while some where. If I go again it would be during their lunch specials. Ehh."}
{"text":"Not sure I will ever go back here. I had a bad experience. It took a long time to get sat and once we were sat, no one acknowledged us. Our waitress forgot about us the whole time and we didn't receive great food or service. The two stars are for the delicious cocktails I had at the bar."}
{"text":"The employees who answer the phones as a rule say whatever is necessary to get people in the door , multiple times I've called from the parking lot with view of the front door and was told everything from no wait to not more than a couple minutes. Always a great exaggeration."}
{"text":"Eh Its ok. I have been here a few times and barley remember what I ate here. Its a beautiful bar and dining room, but the food just lacks unfortunately. 
Nothing memorable, savory, or satisfying.

My mom got the steak once. Was not cooked how she asked for.

Like I said I have been here more than 3 times but nothing really stood out. Its good for groups and taking a girl on a 1st date."}
{"text":"I'm in the service industry so I was disappointed with the server that took care of us.  It was a Sunday night, and although it seemed slightly busy, I didn't like how she rushed us. The server didn't write mine or my sister's order down.  Our drinks were empty for a good 15 min and we waited on our food for a good 30 min. Got the food and it was just okay. We didn't get the extra sides of ranch and marina we had asked for either (we probably would have if our server had written down our order). She seemed annoyed of us, I don't know why but she probably felt bad after we tipped 20% (even if she didn't deserve it) and left."}
{"text":"BJ's has been around for a while, and I've always wanted to go.  I don't eat at chain restaurants often, but every once in a while I do.  Their specialty is pizza and beer, and I was expecting a lot from BJ's and came away not impressed, but it wasn't awful.

The good:
The fried portabella fritters were awesome.  They were crunchy with a lot of breading, but there was a lot of portabella in each fritter.  Dip it in ranch dressing and it's a match made in heaven.  

The pizza crust was excellent.  It was a deep dish pizza  and the crust was light, fluffy, and buttery.

The bad:
I got the BJ's Classic Combo pizza, which contained mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni.  The sausage was okay, but could have been better and lacked flavor(needed more fennel).  The mozzarella was actually pretty good.  What killed the pizza for me was the pepperoni.  The pepperoni looked like it came from the supermarket and was not high quality to me.  If I'm going to pay 15 bucks for a small pizza, I want to have quality ingredients all around.  

Overall, the food was okay.  They need to get better pepperoni."}
{"text":"Having a gift card was the perfect reason to try out BJ's. After a short wait to be seated, we were in the hands of the attentive staff. The menu was very extensive,  and that might be a problem. I ordered fish and chips. Simple enough, but the fish was very bland tasting. Probably not returning."}
{"text":"Elizabeth and I came over to BJ's after being thoroughly disgusted with PF Chang's next door... BJ has pretty good food, fairly good service and they seated us right away... There is not much that i would consider exceptional about BJ's except perhaps their extensive menu and the variety of choices provided.  There are plenty of Televisions and the selection of beer is great.  All in all \"A-OK\" is a bulls eye for rating this establishment... I had the Bleu Burger and it was very good.  My wife had the Miso Salmon over Japanese rice and she really liked her meal a lot.  The refills are sparse and you prctically have to throw a fit to get a glass of water, but this restaurant is a safe bet for a good meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"Very good bar food.  Had the deep dish pizza and it was very tasty and reasonably priced.  Also had one of BJ's own beers and it was also good.  They also offer other brands besides their own beer which is something other brew pubs don't often do.

They have some good weekday specials so I would like to return for that someday."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place doesn't have better reviews?!?? Service and food is great every time I come. The rewards program is awesome too! I eat mostly vegan and love the lentil soup, cauliflower tacos and penne pasta!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give 4 1/2 stars.......
I got a coupon from Facebook for 50% off a large deep dish pizza, you can't beat that!! So we headed up there tonight.

Now we come here often it's our go to place when we don't know what we want and I love it! 
However, I decided to get the BJ's favorite pizza tonight and its the most bland pizza I have ever had. (Which is why I knocked off a star this time) Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions were on the pizza. These can be bold flavors but tonight it wasn't there. I will stick to the BBQ chicken pizza if we get pizza again! 
Service as always was outstanding! Our dessert took 20 mins so the manager came out to take it off our bill, which was very nice!"}
{"text":"Service is always excellent and food is always on point. And that salted caramel pizookoe ooooohhh :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years. Today I stopped in with a friend for a post hike beer and breakfast. 

A bit slow to start as it seems like our server was just coming on duty. No other server could be bothered to get even a water or drop off a menu. I give those servers a one star rating. Our server was nice, and prompt and gets 4 stars. I've usually gotten decent service over the years...so this was just weird. 

Food, as always, is good. Eggs, french toast, applewood bacon....all good. I really like the crunchy chicken salad with honey mustard dressing here as well. Mini pan pizzas are also delish! Never an issue with food quality here.

The menu is extensive, and they have a nice selection of beers. Their Hefeweizen is nice. Everything from Pale Ales to dark. They also have on tap the usual favorites Blue Moon, Stella, etc. etc. 

I've always liked coming here, plenty of tv screens for sports. There is an offer on Yelp for BOGO. Try it out and see if you enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant! Food was awesome and service is still getting into the swing of the new place. But, I give it 5 stars for being the best new restaurant in 89149. It will be even better when they have the outdoor seating completed this fall."}
{"text":"Not sure how anybody could find this place good. Plenty of service and smiling faces, but you know that its not going to be that good when you ask the hostess \" What is good to eat?\" and they have no response. Menu was way to big. Took 10-15 minutes to get a couple of beers. The beer was good and cold, but I think I would rather have a Draft House beer. Had a side salad that was swimming in water and dressing took a few bites and put it at the end of the table. Shared the sliders. Over cooked meat on a bun that was was to big , no onions or pickles, just bread and meat. Also had a pizza, not a lot of cheese or sauce so it was really dry. We decided to use the rest of the gift card on a couple of beers, wasn't going to try anymore food, it took another 15 minutes to get a couple of beers that we had to down quickly to make our movie on time. Won't ever eat at this place again. Gross!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonite and it was a great meal!  It was fairly empty when I came but quickly filled up...but Francisco never skipped a beat!  Had the Baby Back Rib special and it didn't disappoint!  With a side salad and dessert, I was stuffed!  Thank you Frank and your great staff..."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with a craving for their fish tacos.  When the food arrived, there was only 2 tacos and maybe 7 broken yellow tortilla chips.  In the past this dish came with 3 fish tacos and half a plate of tri colored tortilla chips.  My fiancee got the Ahi salad and there was maybe 6 small pieces of tuna.  In the past, there was easily 3 times the tuna, and it was placed around the entire outer edge of the plate.  The price for each item was higher than in the past.  

Beware of shrinking portions and high prices here."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, they have every craving you can have , plus there alcohol selection is great."}
{"text":"Food is decently priced.  Good atmosphere.  I like to come here for lunch on occasion, their soup combo is fabulous.  Right amount of food for a good price, plus their drinks arnt too shabby!"}
{"text":"We decided to order the fish and chips...SAVE YOUR MONEY! Don't order this, you can get more satisfaction at McDonalds than this place. You may can get a better fish in the freezer section at the local grocery store. I think they have 14-17 years olds cooking in the kitchen and hope you don't catch it. Anyway, I will never go back to this one again."}
{"text":"Everytime I go I wait at least 10 mins to be acknowledged and seated with no one else in front of me. The food is good and the drinks but staff need to give better service."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN !!
We've enjoyed our dining experiences in this location before, it was the place for my family and I to enjoy family time, but our last visit really left a bad impression on us.
 They had a 20% off promotion if you order ahead on their app for dine in. So my family and I ordered on the B.J. app an hour before we arrived(we even called half an hour before arriving to make sure they got our orders). Once we were seated, no one served us. No drinks. No plates. Not once had our waitress stopped at our table. We were even ignored whenever we tried to call for any waiter walking by.
 A huge group was seated right next to us 15 mins later and they were able to get their drinks before we did, and we were there before them AND ordered ahead an hour before we arrived!
Ten minutes after, we were so close to walking out when our appetizer finally arrived, the waiter just placed it there and walked away immediately. At least they didn't fully forget about us. But, with no plates and no service, my family of 6 huddled around that one plate of appetizer to eat. It was horrible. I truly considered using the table or napkin as a plate.
I lost track of time after that because it didn't really matter at that point, but we finished picking off our appetizer and we were all thirsty and irritated(still no drinks) when my dad got fed up and tried to get the waitress' attention in front of him. She looked him in the eyes and continued to walk away from us. After trying to get any waiters' attention, he stood up and walked to one of the managers, himself.
 Apparently no one knew how to deal with dine ins with online orders so they all ignored us. Why promote something your own workers are not trained to deal with? The manager tried to help out after that and even assigned us our own waiter to make up for the lack of service, which I appreciated his effort, but at that point we just wanted to finish eating so we can get out of there ASAP. Still thinking about it leaves me in a bad mood. Worst. Experience. Ever."}
{"text":"Nothing extremely special about my experience other than the fact that our server, Matt, was amazing. He was high spirited and kept the table laughing. The food and high prices were pretty predictable, but the service from that gentlemen made it worth the trip there."}
{"text":"I love their Mediterranean pizza and they also serve great beers.  Piranha ale is my favorite, and definitely worth the drive to the suburbs."}
{"text":"We went to the grand opening for a free meal. The food was fantastic! Everyone at my table was happy with what they had. My father-in-law especially loved the brussel sprouts. I was most excited about the pizzookie. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Should have checked yelp before I went. Now I know why.  Slow service. Got my in house beer wrong TWICE. Saw two groups of people sit down then get up and leave. Who does that? When I talked to the manager all he said was sorry I'll let them know. Just get the ziti and pizookie. Paid $50 bucks for shit service. I probably won't be back to this location again."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEW:

I came here with my husband and two other couples for a Friday date night. Our server was horrible and so rude!

My friend comes here at least twice a month and has been for over a year. She always orders the margharita pizza which comes with basil and tomatoes. This time when her pizza came out, it only had basil. She politely let the server know that it was missing tomatoes and asked for tomatoes. The server rudely told her that the pizza never came with tomatoes and she got exactly what she ordered(even though it always had tomatoes every other time she ordered it). He was about to walk away but she asked that they please out tomatoes on for her. A manager then came over and said 'hmm so I heard your pizza didn't come with tomatoes and it should have. We're going to comp that dish for you, sorry for the mistake'. Ok cool, but then when the new pizza came out the rude server AGAIN had to voice his opinions that the pizza does not come with tomatoes and that she was wrong and he is right(EVEN THOUGH THE MANAGER APOLOGIZED AND ACKNOWLEDGED  IT SHOULD HAVE TOMATOES!)And next time she needs to order another pizza called something else that comes with tomatoes and sausages, and had to say 'YOU ARE WRONG'. wow! Seriously? That's extremely unprofessional! And RUDE!

Second problem-everyone ordered appetizers and when they came out one was missing. We ordered two artichoke appetizers and only one came out. By the time everyone was finished with their appetizers the second artichoke plate still had not come out. We flagged down our waiter to ask him to cancel the order as our entrees had just arrived. He would NOT cancel it and said 'oh I didn't know you wanted it to come out before your entree'. Uh hello? It's called an appetizer not a side dish!.....anyways he would not cancel the order and then magically brought out artichokes five minutes later. 

I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant where a waiter is allowed to openly be rude and tell a customer they are wrong despite such a minor request! My friend was not at any point rude with her request at all and quite polite too.

VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. I wish I had remembered his name, but I didn't pay. if I ever see him again(not on a group date), I will be sure to make a formal complaint with a manager."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I come here almost weekly. The service is always great, the food is usually delicious, and it's a nice restaurant for any occasion, really. The other night my boyfriend and I went around 11pm, and the host left a lot to be desired, she wasn't very friendly at all, but out waitress Michell was phenomenal. Not only did she give us her honest opinion on selections, she kept the refills coming and we never felt like we had to hunt someone down for something. Honestly, I want to start coming and asking for one of her tables, because she made us feel welcome even if it was rather late in the night and she had another huge table she was serving. I'd definitely recommend asking for her as your waitress."}
{"text":"We had visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, Centennial Center Blvd,location, a few months ago where were received the worst service.  We so unhappy with this location at the time that we did not think we would ever go back.  A few days ago we were in the area and decided we would give them another chance.  We sat in the bar area thinking it would be faster service, since the time before was so slow.  This was around 3 pm. We were seated and waited and waited and waited for a server. The bar area was not filled or busy nor was the bar itself. Finally a waiter asked if our waitress had come by to help us.  Of course we said no.  He apologized and took our order.  We order our beverages, my ice tea came pretty fast, however the bar tender did not have the beer we order ready for the waiter to pick up, (There were three people that were behind the bar) He came back apologized again and asked if we would like a water until the beer ready. It was at almost ten minutes from the time the beer was ordered until the waiter brought it to us.  Apologized again.  The waitress finally did come by while we were waiting for our food to arrive to take our order. 
I would like to give the server that took care of us an Ata Boy, Brian, He was the one that noticed we had not been help. He apologized and took our order and served us. Actually he was the only one I saw working and taking care of the patrons that were there,  He was so kind, he even told us the other server apologized.  We have always had great service at the BJ's on West Charleston Blvd.  After having this experience we will not return to location. Thank you Brian again for your help and kindness."}
{"text":"Although there is usually a wait if you go during the peek times and days, it's worth it. 

I usually get their amazing honey crisp chop chicken salad and it is always consistently made, no surprises. That goes with their whole menu. Obviously their pizza is made to perfection, that's a given. So someone at the table has to order a pizza! But please, for the love of god, SAVE ROOM FOR A PIZZOOKIE!!! What's that, you ask? It's a hot giant cookie, still warm in its mini pizza pan, with a heaping scoop of ice cream on top, just waiting to be devoured! You can say you'll only have one bite, but you would be lying. I double-dare you to only have one bite. When a table gets a Pizzookie, it's like watching a pack of starving wolves being thrown a juicy steak. First come, first serve!"}
{"text":"My wife and I met one of her college friends and her friend's husband for drinks.  We arrived around 3:30 / 4:00 in the afternoon and sat at the bar.  The bar staff when we first arrived were good, but the bartenders that took their place were much better.  I believe one of the bartenders' name was Ryan.  He was alot of fun!!  He was personable and friendly, and was cracking jokes with us and the staff throughout the night.  He was very attentive to our needs.  Some of the beers that I tried were Sculpin IPA (Ballast Point Brewing and Spirits from San Diego, CA), Union Jack IPA (Firestone Walker Brewing Company from Paso Robles, CA), and Jeremiah Red from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  All three were cold and very tasty.  The IPA's were what I would call on the lighter side for an IPA.  Not really a strong taste to them. 

We have a BJ's near us in The Woodlands, TX that we've been to before.  But this experience was much fun, and Ryan made it entertaining for us."}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy visiting BJ's but this time was the worst. I ordered the California Chicken Club, which is the same thing I order every time I come but this time the avocado on my sandwich had the color of a cooked mushroom. I understand if an avocado has a little brown, but to mistake it for a mushroom is really bad. Very disappointed in this visit and not sure if I'll come back as the quality has gone done tremendously.  Gave two stars only because the waitress was good."}
{"text":"This place is one of my guilty pleasures!  In my opinion, they have the best deep dish style pizza around.  Even though the menu offers a broad range of dining options (from Mexican to Asian fare -- good for picky eaters or big groups with diverse tastes), I'm always drawn back to the pizza. 

I also like the minestrone soup (a tad on the salty side though) and their wedge salad is really good -- also pretty decadent, drenched in blue cheese and dressing.  They make their own root beer which is amazing!  

For dessert, you HAVE to go with the Pizookie!  They expanded their flavor list so there are even more tempting choices.  If you're dining alone or feeling bad about all the fatty pizza you scarfed down, they have a smaller/personal size Pizookie AND if you can't decide on one flavor, you can do halfsies.  Pretty great!

Definitely recommend...if you're not on a diet  ;)"}
{"text":"This is the spot to go! I go there for family dinners, watching a game or just gathering with friends! they have a great variety of food and the staff are very friendly! the deep dished oven pizza is a must try! and their famous dessert poozkie!!!"}
{"text":"I tried 2 of the new bbq menu items this time around and I was not disappointed.  The Corn Fritters with the bacon aioli (which I posted a picture of) were super delicious and only $2.95, I was sad that I had to share...The Jallejulah fries (also pictured) where good too, not as spicy as I would have liked but it was definitely a unique taste.

I had the grilled Mahi Mahi Mahi tacos (guess what? there's also a picture of these!) off the lunch menu and they were quite good.  The tacos came with chips and a small dish of salsa and guacamole.  Not a big fan of the guacamole, it was too soupy for my taste. My friend had chicken tenders they looked good but I didn't try them.

The lunch and happy hour prices are really good.  I love going for happy hour and having the mini pizzas.  Plus I'm a rewards member, so I get points for eating there."}
{"text":"Love the Buffalo Chicken Pizza! I don't recall ever having anything that I didn't like at this restaurant though!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at BJ's and I was pleasantly surprised. We started with the calamari which was cooked to perfection and had some delicious dipping sauces.  I had the Tavern-Cut Garlic Chicken Pest pizza and my wife had the Double Deluxe burger.  The pizza was a good blend of all ingredients.  My wife's burger was still juicy and delicious even when she ordered it well done. Even the beer was above par. I had the house lager which had some great robust flavors. The kind of beer I would expect to enjoy at an upscale bar. And last, but not least, our server Alicia (sp?) was fabulous.  Very accommodating, friendly and on top of everything. Although it was on the higher end of my price range, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"BJ's is great for happy hour in the bar area. Great prices during this time. They have a few drink specials and food menu items.
order a mini pizza, lettuce wraps, flat bread something with avocado,  and mini sliders. 
it was filling for three people that we had and it was a little disappointing with the lettuce wraps and there was only three pieces of lettuce and to me lettuce is the cheapest thing as it was just head lettuce or ice burg as they are called.
I had a glass of there root beer from tap and a glass of the black cheery from tap as they make there own. 
They had some kind d of santa fe spring rolls and avocado roll also on the menu and some kind of parmesan boneless chicken. 
If you go at four pm it is just the right time as they are not busy, but the service was kind of slow, but if you are there with people great chance to chat and catch up without being rushed, as the service is just the right speed at this time of day before the dinner rush. 
Will need to go back to try the other happy hour specials that I haven't tried yet.
tried the full dinner menu items as well and they have a lot of choices to chose from. menu is quick large, and plenty items to chose from. pizza is alway yummy and there salad are good too.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love eating here, but they missed the mark this time. My food was meh. Bland. It's disappointing, but maybe it was because it was a Friday night. But don't compromise quality!"}
{"text":"ate there tonight! Was happy all food was great! 2 problems dinner took 1 hour and 40 minutes from when I was seated! 2 I ordered a house salad with ranch I ate the whole thing it was yummy....... My wings came next I ate those too very good! As I sat for what seemed forever for the 3 small pazookies we ordered for our extremely well behaved considering it took so long children I went to move dishes out of way because no one bothered to clear my table the ranch cup was stuck to table! I lifted it to reveal what I thought was wax! I thought to myself wow good idea to stop from sliding........ Upon further inspection by removing I began to realize a firmiliar smell it was ........ Mint! Wtf? Why was there gum under my ranch cup? Gross asked for a manager he gave us 3 free kids pazookies! Big deal? Was this to make me feel better? It was gross! Never going back ever and calling SNHD Monday morning"}
{"text":"#100:

It could be the chocolate mint martini followed by the candy cane martini which was then followed by the pomegranate sunset but I had a great time tonight [as I always do]!

I went with the crew originally to another brewery at Westgate but the ASU game made parking non-existent so off to Park West we go!  BJ's was the natural choice for an evening of drinks, food, and good company.  The wait time at BJ's at 7:30pm on a Saturday was said to be 25-30 minutes but we were seated after 10 minutes.  No complaints here!  At such a big establishment, the atmosphere was of course gorgeous.  Let's talk food!  We had ordered:

Crispy Calamari:  Typical fried squid you can get anywhere.  I personally love the garlic aioli.

Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms:  Delicious, giant, and juicy!  Just like I like my men!  ;D  Just kidding... kinda.  Seriously though, I can eat that lemon pesto by the spoonful.  

Two Steak plates [one had lobster too]:  Both steaks were not cooked to medium-rare and the lobster was a bit too salty.  Both steaks were offered to be redone but hey, we're not picky.  We ate that red meat like champs.  And that lobster tail... demolished.  I really liked the mashed potatoes!  The clam chowder accompaniment and the Caesar salad were also yummy --- especially the chowder!

Hawaii Mahi-Mahi:  This was my main dish.  I was completely happy and in love with the juicy mahi-mahi.  The refreshing pineapple fried rice and stir-fry veggies made everything just a touch sweeter.  They had some Sriracha sauce on the side.  Don't be fooled by the fancy description: it's just pure sexy Sriracha.

Cajun Pasta:  It was yummy!  The garlic bread was good. The creamy tomato sauce wasn't too spicy --- something I'm always grateful for.  I think food is meant to be tasted.  I don't need to be licking a chili pepper!  

Grilled Chicken Pasta:  Creamy pasta is ALWAYS a good thing.  We got the grilled chicken instead of the blackened chicken and it was perfectly match.  I would've been happy with just a bowl of that rotelle noodles with the cream sauce.  

Overall it was a lovely evening and our waiter was very charismatic, charming, and accommodating [one of us HAD to watch the Boise St. game.  x_x].  Cheers, BJ's!  Thanks for the great evening!"}
{"text":"Our waitress helped make it a 5. We've always liked the food and friendly service, however Melani took it to the next level! Her smile and perkiness, attention to her customers needs and personality can't be beat. As I stated, the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner...Had wonderful service from Athena....She has waited on us before...Evertime the service is so great....Other waiters should learn from her.....this is why we like to come back....."}
{"text":"We went in at around 6:30 on St Patty's Day, and the wait was an hour and a half for 3 people - okay, it's busy, no big deal, we waited. Exactly an hour and a half later, we were seated. The meal started off fine - the waitress was friendly and took our drink and appetizer order. After that, not much went right.

We had ordered spinach and artichoke dip for the appetizer, and it came out freezing cold. After our waitress finally came back to check in, it was corrected, and we ordered our meals. I ordered an ahi tuna salad without the wasabi or onions. Almost 30 minutes later, our food finally came out, and my salad, of course, was covered in onions and wasabi. It took about 10-15 minutes for our waitress to check in on us again to discover the error, and it was another 15/20 minutes before the corrected salad came out; after my friends were already done with their meals. And the salad was terrible - no avocado, saturated in dressing, and the tuna was low quality. 

We had signed up for the app, so got a free pizookie - ANOTHER 10 minutes after we said we'd be ordering the pizookie to-go, the waitress finally took the order. Then ANOTHER 15 minutes later, the pizookie finally came out.... not to-go, and again, our order had to be corrected.

In the end, only the salad was taken off of the bill and apologies were not offered. I started the night with patience - I get that it's St Patrick's Day - but literally EVERY COURSE was messed up, and the staff was inattentive. That's just unacceptable. I will never be going back, and I suggest others avoid it."}
{"text":"Ok so I think i have about had it with this place. Other bj's are sooo much better but the service at this one sucks!

They have failed miserably like 5 times in a row. The thing is the foods always pretty good and the beer is great. But having to wait 30 minutes for a pitcher of beer or to even see your server is unacceptable. The sweet pig pizza and j. Red beer is great and keep is coming back but maybe not worth it in the end with grimaldis acrossnthe street

.... So i went back again (dont ask) and was the same old story....terrible service and people angry all around us. Manager took forever to get to tables who had issues and was a disaster. I flat out asked the server \" why is the service always so bad here\"' it cant be a server issue if its always bad... It has to be a management issue with payroll or terrible training! She only had 5 tables and was not double sat so i really have no clue other than the service always sucks and the food/beer is always good"}
{"text":"The food here was great and the atmosphere was amazing.  My wife recently visited the Northern location in the West Valley with a friend so for Date Night, she took me here.  I was torn between the Chicken Wings and the Jalepeno Burger, I went with the waiters recommendation and went with the burger. It was excellent.  
     As an appetizer we ordered Chips and Roasted Salsa, which again was excellent.  The only problem was I had to ask to get them after about 20 minutes.  I informed the waiter when I ordered them, I wanted them as an appetizer.  After seeing a couple tables get appetizers that were seated well after my wife and I showed, I mentioned them again.  Maybe they had to make salsa anew.
     The meals came out and whatever my wife ordered, some kind of Parmesan Crusted Chicken was to die for.  When she went to the Northern location she ordered the same thing and she said that it had more sauce with a side of sauce as well, some cheese sauce.  When hers initially came out, one chicken had no sauce and other had very little, so she had to ask for extra sauce.  At the same time I asked for Ketchup for my fries.  My wife got her sauce and about 10 minutes later when I had 4 fries left.  I received my Ketchup.  
     The review here is, the food was quite good, a hiccup here or there I can handle but the waiter, left a lot to be desired.  
     I would have given them a 5 if I had a different waiter."}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan. Good food and drinks. 
Service is great as well."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with our visit here, we were expected so much more. The food was actually pretty good. We got the appetizer sampler combo and there was plenty of food on it. The avocado eggrolls are the best! I was not a fan of the california club flatbread appetizer pizza. I like the texture of the crust, but not a big fan of the toppings. I did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza. But, you may like it because my girlfriend loved it.

The big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly. i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much. Light, full-bodied and flavorful. The red I tried wasn't very good however. My girlfriend's stout was a huge disappointment. It was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had. Not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste. 

I actually had better experiences with the BJs in California more, I don't know why. Each chain is a little different I guess."}
{"text":"Went in an hour before closing for dinner.

Food was amazing, but you had to practically call the waiter from across the restaurant. 
There were only 4 other people here, and the staff was either cleaning up, or, like the manager, shooting the bull with the bartender.

It was nearly impossible to order anything, and when I requested to order dessert, the waiter seemed annoyed that I was requesting more of him. 

Worst BJ's I've ever been to due to the service."}
{"text":"Food and beverage are good... no complaints on that.
Easily accessible and convenient...

BUT made reservations for 7 folks for 5pm giving us time to eat and make our 7pm movie. No Prob, right? We arrived at 4:50 and was told the reservation doesn't guarantee a table and they simply put our name on the wait list... WTF???

Ate at Bonefish Grille instead...wasn't gonna get a table and eat within the 2 hr window... ASSININE!!


So the manager responded to me... offered to discuss the issue if i had time the following week... I didn't need him next week, I needed him the night they denied our reservation!! Too late"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very friendly, energetic bar atmosphere, the menu is about 2\" thick offering pretty much any type of food you'd like. You can definitely get the \"chain style restaurant vibe\" the menu is too large to be all fresh food, I'd imagine a lot of it is frozen. The service was bad, but I won't judge them off that due to the fact they just opened 24 hours ago past my visit. The beer menu is pretty large, offering many local craft beers along with your typical \"commodity brands\". The beer that BJ's brew is decent, I personally expected mediocre beer from them since they are a chain. The menu also includes healthy variants that can be substituted for regular beef & breads. There's nothing you will get from here that you can't find at any other chain restaurant. BJ's reminds me like Yard House, it's classy higher end than an Applebee's. All in all I'd definitely go back just because it's nice to have a bar that offers more craft beers that is nearby where I live."}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite restaurant! Our waiter, Ruben, was one of the best waiters we have ever gotten. He was completely honest with us on the orders and was always super attentive. Now to the food, oh man, it was great! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs the first time and I honestly thought the portion would be small considering it is small in some other places, but you really get enough for what you spend. My boyfriend got the Southern Comfort and now orders it every single time we go. I also tried the chicken alfredo without broccoli and it was delicious! I loved the fact that the chicken was not as dry as some other places. I also tried the boneless buffalo and was not disappointed either. 

The pazooki was the greatest part though; if it's your first time and you have a sweet tooth, you need to try the Pazooki! 

If anything, Tuesdays are $3 Pazookis!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to bjs. I recently came here with my family and I'm not sure if our server was too busy but I had to ask him for a kids menu three times. Ok no big deal. We ordered appetizers. Waited waited, finally our main corse got there. I asked him where the appetizers went. Oh he forgot to ring them in. Uhm really ok. Then I got my balsamic chicken, my favorite. The chicken was horrible. It was rubbery and tasted disgusting. Worst chicken u have ever had. I will never go back here again. So many other restaurants that have better service and better food."}
{"text":"Four of us went here for the cavs play off game Friday night. We were expecting it to be packed but luckily they seated us right away. Mariah was our server and she was so friendly! We took up one of her tables for four hours so of course we tipped more than 20% but she honestly deserved every bit of it. She always made sure our drinks were filled, had more ranch then we needed without us even asking, and her personality is why I chose 5 stars. She was super personable and always had a smile on her face. The food was really good too. Their wings were incredible and one of our friends had the prime rib and ate every bit of it. The mojitos were one of the best I've ever had. Absolutely no complaints. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"WOW! BAD EXPERIENCE AT ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS!

Came in on a Tuesday night, 7:30pm, Table for 2. Im told there's a 15 minute wait.(Open tables everywhere) Kind of unusual for a Tuesday but we assumed they were short staffed and decided to wait. 25 minutes later we were seated. We ordered an appetizer, a side salad and 2 burgers. App took about 15 minutes and was only slightly warm (Stuffed Mushrooms). 

We ate the app and finished, then waited....and waited.....and waited. Server walked by and would smile but nothing. So we waited.....and waited....for a side salad mind you. After 20 - 30 minutes of waiting I approached the server and told her we needed to leave and asked her to please adjust the bill accordingly. So we wait.....and wait.....and wait....then guess what shows up... the side salad at the same time as our entree's. (Same server had both burgers and the salad). 45 MINUTES AFTER WE ORDERED

Told him the situation so he took the food back, left 14$ on the table (we added the price of the mushrooms and our 2 sodas + tax and a lil on top just in case my math was off) and left. 

Over an hour wasted all for some sodas and stuffed mushrooms. I wont be coming back, and this was one of my favorite places to eat. Real shame..."}
{"text":"Excellent menu - servers are super friendly - great for kids!  What more can you ask for... oh yeah, the food is awesome, too!"}
{"text":"My brother taught me a very valuable lesson. When you don't want to take the left overs home with you but you don't want to be rude, ask for a box and then \"forget\" the box on the table. There's a chance they'll run after you; there's a chance you'll escape free of leftovers. Thankfully, I escaped. 

What did I leave behind? Their meatloaf. It wasn't the actual meatloaf that was gross. It was the gross sauce they drowned it in. Seriously, it was nasty. I ate one piece of the loaf and gave up, my stomach grouchy from the determined attempt to eat. 

The veggies were great, as were their mashed potatoes. But the main course, the meat and its loaf, were not. Too bad, for that's what I wanted to like so badly.

What I did like was their nut brown beer. It's the only one I can tell that's worth ordering. Don't bother with their porter. Ick. 

BJ's could be a cool place to watch a game, if you don't get distracted by all the other TV's with different games on. I watched Superbowl highlights, a Suns game and a KU game all at the same time. This might've been overwhelming, if I were normal and didn't suffer from ADHD. (I kid...I think)

Anyway, don't come for the food. Most of it is topped with fried onion rings. Don't believe me? Take a look at the menu. Even the salads are tainted."}
{"text":"Quality customer service. I really enjoyed the kindness and conversation from Justin at the bar and the enlightened salmon bowl was the perfect healthy dinner. Keep up the wonderful work!"}
{"text":"Lousy host ! Check in at 2 pm no menu presented and just send you to the table.. Sat for 5 minutes, the  server lack of acknowledgement, went to a table next to me 3 times no greetings what so ever.. 

I Ordered lunch especial, a cup of soup that  was so so.. Instead of a cup I was given a bowl... Then3 minutes later entree comes..
Really!! It's 4th of July half of the room was empty... Service can be rendered better..

Service at BJ's on South Eastern in Henderson Is far better and well executed.."}
{"text":"Beer is great...food, so so. We ordered cheese sticks and calamari and they brought us one set and another set about 10 minutes later!?!?!  Spaghetti and meatballs is a little spicy but good. The pizza, which they are known for, is mediocre. Both the flat bread and the deep dish seem undercooked.  Service needs lots of work. And be careful in the bar area, something is up with a very slippery floor."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was great!! Very nice place and on top of things. Definitely tops all the BJ's that I've ever been too."}
{"text":"We returned here for dinner with friends after a long absence.  A bowl of New England Clam Chowder was good but rather floury.  And Diane never received the Oyster Crackers she asked for to stir in her chowder.

Chicken Lettuce Wraps with fresh leaves of lettuce, an Asian sauce, and marinated chunks of chicken mixed with pieces of celery and water chestnuts were excellent as always.  My Seared Ahi Salad was also fresh and plentiful.  I would order this dish again.  But it took a long while for me to receive the Soy Sauce I had specially requested.

So, other than a couple of nettlesome service errors, this was an enjoyable dining experience.

XXX-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to BJs for lunch after hiking in the Red Rock canyons. We sat in the bar area and were quickly greeted and had our drink order taken immediately. The service started to go downhill after that. We had a very long wait for our drinks, to the point that we had to flag down the server to see if he had forgotten about them.  He was not polite with his response that he was 'waiting for the bartender to pour them'.  We did finally get our drinks and placed our lunch order. 

The first thing to arrive was our friends chicken tortilla soup. They made a nice production of pouring the broth over the soup at the table, presumably so that the tortillas didn't get soggy, but he had no spoon. We couldn't flag anyone down for a spoon, so my DH finally went and asked someone for a spoon. We still sat there for a long time before a spoon arrived. When we finally saw our waiter again,my Dh asked him to bring our friend a new soup (ok, he may have TOLD him to :-))

I think at this point our waiter realized that our service hadn't been great and he brought over a sample of one of their beers which was nice. The funny thing though was that I also got chicken tortilla soup and when they brought it, after all of this, no spoon! Maybe they have a shortage, idk. We knew to ask immediately this time and they did bring it out pretty quickly. 

Having said all that, we all really enjoyed our food. The chicken tortilla soup was very good, the mac and cheese was excellent, the chopped salad was great and huge, and they recognized that our service was not good and did try to make up for it. They also made a very tasty margarita, so it's worth another visit."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I dined in on 3/6/2018 during dinner time. As usual, the service was great, at first....
Our waiter was Jon P.
The more we got into our meals, a friend sitting at the table saw a long piece of hair sticking out of his pasta. He hesitated to say anything to the waiter, knowing this was out of his control. But, he spoke up and said something anyways. The manager came to our table and apologized. We proceeded to order dessert, when they came out, my friend took two bites of his dessert and ANOTHER shorter hair was inside.
After the first incident our waiter began to dodge our table. So my friend went and approached our waiter after having to track him down. He sent back his dessert.
Another manager came to our table and apologized again.

Once the bill came out, our waiter continued to avoid us, dropping it off, then immediately walking away.
Seeing we were a big group, we needed our bill split.
10 minutes goes by, no waiter. So he finally approached our table, grabs the bill and paces away..
Once he realizes there is no money inside, he returns to our table asking if we need split checks.
We all reply yes & begin explaining who's food / drinks belong on whos bill.
As we are doing so, he begins to make rude remarks towards the entire table.
Telling us it wasn't his hair in the food, confronting US for laughing at our table once he walked away when we brought up the hair.
We didn't realize we were not allowed to have a good time during our dinner, despite what happened with our meals.
He was also asking if anyone else's food has hairs in it that need to be comped. Sarcastic, of course.
My friends are not cheap nor do we fake incidents that do not happen. We can all very much so afford our meals, without comps. We all hold ourselves to the upmost respect.
We understood this waiter was not the chef/ back kitchen staff. He had no control over the hairs in the food. We didn't hold him responsible at all. But after his very rude and unprofessional approach to us, we felt very insulted..
I have never not left a tip, but I certainly did not leave one after that. Our entire table signed our bills, got up, and left. Not a single one of us left a tip for him.
I wrote at the bottom of my bill how excellent our bussers & hosts were, but due to their server, we left no tip.

BJ's used to be one of our favorite restaurants since it opened in centennial parkway, but after our TERRIBLE experience we will not return to this location again, certainly will make sure all of our friends know as well.
HUGE disappointment."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the smoked hickory barbecue sandwich. Nowhere in the menu description was there mention that the base ingredient is a hamburger patty.  The brisket was layered on top of the patty with bacon.  When a sandwich is called smoked brisket, I would not expect it to taste like hamburger."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. .. friendly service I was there few Days ago I wasn't too hungry but my wife was and she doesn't need too much unfortunately I forgot the name of the server she was very patient I'll explain the menu very well even helping me switching to another beer after I order one.
I'll  be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly something has happened to this place since the last time I've been here. The waitress was definitely not visiting our table for offering us additional drinks... Considering you're paying 1495 a burger you think they would give you more than eight Fry's on your plate besides that you think that they wouldn't put meat on a vegetarian burger, although the manager quickly resolve the issue it was still a great disappointment when you have a group of 9 people there for birthday party and 9 out of 9 people were disappointed with their food will not be returning unfortunately..."}
{"text":"So sick of going back to the Henderson, NV location.. Everytime we go service is AWFUL.. Tonight we went at 3:30 thinking service wouldn't be as bad and they seated us in the bar area (hehem with our 18 yr old daughter) and I ordered salmon, my husband ordered, pizza, and my daughter got an appetizer.. I actually walked out because my salmon took until 5:00 for some reason and the waiter was so dumb he said our order was taking longer because of the salmon.. How stupid is he to offend a customer, really?  I wouldn't have cared so much had not ALL of the booths around us filled up and they were all leaving or having dessert when our food finally came and the table in front of us had all steaks!  When he used the salmon excuse I told him it was easier than steak and he ran off like a baby and I wasn't even loud.. So weird.. Not going back to this B.J.'s and always ask myself if these people interviewed for a job being as negligent as they are as waiters.. Oh, to defend this place I could tell his co-workers were thinking, \"Oh God, he sucks.. \""}
{"text":"Party of 2, seated right away (not packed or busy). Server wasn't very helpful while ordering however our order was placed fairly quickly. Crispy fried shrimp and a ribeye dinner. Waited 20 minutes for a side salad and another 10 for dressing. Waited about 45 minutes for our food. The food was extremely hot from sitting under the heat lamps for so long which made the \"crispy fried shrimp\" taste rubbery. Asked for a refill on drinks when the food arrived (45 minute wait for a refill). Sent the shrimp back, took a box to go for the steak. Ended up paying $40 to watch my husband eat his dinner. Server didn't seem to care about the service or customer satisfaction and experience. Will never visit this location again. Waste of money."}

{"text":"It's BJ's!  They are the same everywhere.  Good service and good food.  My kids enjoy BJ's and talk me into it once in awhile.  

I love their Avocado rolls and Lettuce wraps!!  Of course, how can you leave without eating a deliciously warm, melt in your mouth pizookie!!!"}
{"text":"The service stinks.   We had come in with five people. Waited for a table. Busy night with basketball sweet 16.  Front staff hasn't a clue about how to efficiently sit people.  A table for six people sat idle the whole time we were here.  We ended up sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Service: Had the perfect waiter. He knew the menu. Never had repeat orders or special requests. Was quick, got orders right. Our group was big too.

Food: Special on ribs. Had whole rack, two sides (got soup for one without upcharge and clam chowder was best in town, large clams, no sand grit, perfect consistency), salad (got wedge), and pizoutti desert all for $18.95 at lunch. 

Ambiance: No complaints.

Five stars, first ever visit."}
{"text":"We visited today for the first time and the food was very good. The Thai chicken wontons were fabulous. I had the turkey burger which was also very good. Others had salads and sandwiches and everyone was pleased."}
{"text":"I love the clean, cold modern atmosphere and long booths.  There's a spacious, airy feel.  Beers are above average, with at least one seasonal beer and several guest taps.  The new flatbread pizza appetizers are quite good, and although the pizza isn't a traditional Chicago thick crust, it still makes for a good thick crust pizza.  I like the calzones as well, though $13 for the bigger one is really up there in price considering that is the normal size at other places, and they don't charge $13.

However, they are way overpriced.  $4.75 for a 16 oz. pint of beer is a bit steep, pizzas are at least a dollar or two higher than elsewhere, and even with the lunch specials we find that the tab for two people is always $50-60.  This is for casual pizza/brewpub dining, and we're not drinking a lot."}
{"text":"Horrible policy here.  I used the call ahead feature on a busy night and was told that the wait is 25 minutes, and my name was now on the list.  Sounds good, right?  I arrive 25 minutes later to check in and I'm told that I should expect to get a table in about 25-30 minutes.  What?!? This is insane and unlike most other places that have the call ahead feature. 

Minor mention:  the happy hour changed in the last year or so and several items are no longer discounted at all (like Mozz sticks), and the items that are discounted are presented on a separate menu that categorizes them by price (these apps for $7, these for $9, etc.)  This is a growing trend as places no longer want to clearly indicate half off, or a specified amount off, and want to try and redirect your attention away from how much you're actually saving by going to happy hour."}
{"text":"I came here following the recommendation of the sales rep at the Bells outlet mall.  It was a good distance away from the Strip, out in Henderson--possibly a 15 - 20 minute drive.

We sat on the bar for quicker service.  We had the pleasure of having Emily serve us.  Emily was fantastic--very helpful, outgoing, and offering valuable recommendations.  Not to mention she is a cutie! =D

Of course when in Vegas, I am always drinking.  And dinner here was no different.  My buddy chose the 4 beer sampler while I opted for the 8 beer version.  The 8 beer sampler totaled 40oz.  Not bad for a sampler!  And only about $12.xx to boot!  Beers were of your more obscure, microbrewery variety and all sooo good.  Got a diverse range of flavors and colors of beer.

Not knowing what to eat (menu is quite extensive), we chose the thai chicken wonton based on its picture in the menu.  Tapa sized portions which worked out fine since I didn't want to get stuffed off an appetizer.  The wonton texture was crispy and flaky.  The accompanying thai sauce was a bit strong on the fish sauce--use in moderation.  Good consistency of sauce--don't like watery sauce softening the wrappings of my wontons...  It was good, but I wouldn't make a strong recommendation on it.  If you are in the mood for this, then order; otherwise, not a must have.

My buddy ordered the deep dish pizza.  Not sure what was the name of the specialty pizza but he ordered the meaty version.  He liked it, but I'm a pickier eater.  I thought the pizza lacked flavor as if it needed salt which is quite surprising since meat on pizza is usually salty by nature.  Not so with this pizza.  was the meat boiled prior and the saltiness leached off?  idk....  Lots of cheese but nary of tomato sauce.  Need a better balance with sauce and cheese...  

Bartender Emily's favorite dish at BJ's is their jambalaya.  With so many attractive entrees in their picture menu, I had a difficult time selecting my entree.  Warily, I went with Emily's recommendation and got the jambalaya.  Thank you, Emily, for your suggestion!  I rarely eat jambalaya so don't have a frame of reference to compare against, but this passed the taste test.  Unless you have an aversion to cajun spice, I think you will enjoy this dish.

Tried the Pizookie for dessert.  Hot, large & thick cookie topped a la mode with ice cream.  The contrast of the cold ice cream on the freshly baked cookie is a winning combo!

To recap, mixed reviews on their deep dish pizza, but the jambalaya, 8 beer sampler, and pizookie are winners!  Ohh, and Emily is a hottie!  With dozen's of locations throughout the US, BJ's could be a good spot to fall back on for a cheap-to-moderately priced meal.."}
{"text":"Went in for a late dinner with my gf and I cause we both work in the industry so we tried to hurry in, so we got there at 11 15 and they close at twelve .well anyways I ordered the ribeye and was drinking the blonde beer witch was tasty and easy drinking. But the steak was unbelievable amazing and perfectly grilled to temperature!Melanie was our bartender and made terrific ideas to enhance our experience! Thanks  and we will be doing bjs again for a late date night!"}
{"text":"Had the best experience tonight, one of the nicest, friendliest servers I've ever had at any restaurant! Kyle H was amazing! Not once did I ever have to ask for anything, he was on top of it every minute of the visit. And the place was so busy so I wasn't expecting such amazing service! Will request to be seated in his area every time!"}
{"text":"There are quite a few things that are great about BJ's Brewery.  First off, their beer offerings are better than average and very consistent, no matter which BJ's you go to.  They fall short of the beer offerings from such brew houses as Four Peaks and Sonora Brew Pub (then again what beers come close to being as good), but they are solid offerings nonetheless.  I highly recommend the Pale Ale and the Stout.  Secondly, they have a great happy hour.  $1 off beers, $2 off all appetizers, and half off mini pizzas.  The mini pizzas are very good, and they have a wide range of great appetizers, all of which are quite tasty.  And for those of you with a sweet tooth, they have a pizookie that is to die for.  The regular menu items are divers and very good.  I used to go to the Chandler location a couple times a week and have had most items on the menu, all of which left me very satisfied.

The restaurants is large in size, with a nice bar area and large screen TVs you can see from pretty much anywhere you sit.  They are also very family friendly, and can get quite crowded, especially on the weekends.  Despite the place being packed, and our server being the only one in the bar area, service was very good and very friendly.  They also have a take-out option (similar to what Chili's does), and I saw quite a few people while I was here take advantage of this service."}
{"text":"Sheesh, the last time I went to a BJs, I was screwing around in SoCal ages ago and probably couldn't afford a night of beer & pizza @ BJs on a student budget but went anyway...

Fast forward to today--which means my student budget hasn't really expanded but I still end up tryin out BJs again.  Despite the myriad of beers, I knew what I was gettin--the sampler.  The bartender had memorized the details regarding beers offered in their sampler, which was impressive.  My six beers came with a place mat, describing each beer.

Brewhouse blonde, hefeweizen, porter, a red, a stout, brewnette & an Oktoberfest were my selections.  I know the other beers had more official names but the one I liked best was the one I remember the name to--'Brewhouse blonde'.  It was light & a bit sweet.  (I'm not a beer connoisseur & have been a Miller Lite girl since I started drinkin beer). 

Would I recommend you try it?  Sure.  My sentiment on the whole place/experience/atmosphere is exactly as rated 'A-OK'.  Nothing fantabulous, nothing crazy.  Just another chain that is less cheesy."}
{"text":"We discovered BJ's one night when we wanted to go to Dos Caminos, only to find it closed.  However, BJ's was a wonderful surprise and our new go-to when we want good food and to stay close to home.
My favourite beer is the hefewisen (I'm not sure about the spelling).  I mentioned to the waiter that I liked Blue Moon and Shocktop, he suggested that beer, and I'm now hooked.  The pizza, calzones, and burgers are awesome.  My dad even orders a pizza and a burger because they are both so tasty, he takes one home to eat later!
The service has always been prompt and friendly, it's not too loud or crowded, the TVs are plentiful and high enough so everyone has a good view of whatever game is going on, and the prices are reasonable, especially for Summerlin.  Our new favourite hangout :)"}
{"text":"BJ's might not be a Mom and Mom/local establishment, but when you've found yourself at a ubiquitous Shopping Center/Movie Theater and you're hungry...it's more of an oasis than say, Sbarros? But, I digress...

The menu is crazy varied- You want something with an Asian flair, Mexican, or Italian? They've got it all --- Plus nicely crafted brews. Oh, and the notorious pizzookie.

Ask the servers what they would recommend. They're more familiar with menu...and I have yet to be steered wrong direction."}
{"text":"Eh experience. Had some beers which were solid and a good price. Nice interior, clean . Food was not good ,had a bison burger and fries. Burger was way overcooked and nothing special. Fries were ok. I understand it's a chain store restaurant and it pretty much fits the mold of one. I'd go back for beer and maybe try something else to eat. Nothing made me say to myself that I need to come back here though."}
{"text":"I love this place!! BJ's is one of my favorite dining spots. The parmesan chicken is to die for!! Service is always top notch in Centennial, I definitely recommend it. Don't forget to save room for a pizookie!!"}
{"text":"I love BJs, and after this trip, I will not be returning to this location. I called to make a reservation, and the girl said they don't take reservations but will put me on a list so when we get there, we will be one of the next people to be seated, but might have to wait a few minutes- totally fine. The 4 of us get there checked in, waited, and then after 20 minutes, asked again and the hostess said we weren't on the list! We sat and waited for an hour. I was on crutches, which is why I wanted to make a reservation. We ordered appetizers, they came out cold. Our wait after the appetizers was over 45 minutes after that. Then they forgot one of the plates for the meals ordered. It was one thing after another. I felt bad for our waitress who was very sweet, but damn, what an unorganized mess in the front of house and kitchen. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this Chicago style pizza joint. The pizza is deep dish and solid and their beer on tap is all brewed in house or locally. Service is generally solid and price reasonable for what you get. Personally I am a huge fan of the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which is just the right blend of spicy and pizza if there is such a thing. Also their Jerimiah Red ale is pretty solid also."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim for dinner and don't regret our decision whatsoever!  The food was great, the service was every bit as great.  Thank you, Joshua!  There were others who helped make our experience a good one but he was the one who answered our questions and helped us to make the right choices.  I'm stuffed.  We'll do this again for sure!"}
{"text":"I'll have to drop this place to 2 stars.

Unfortunately, the service wasn't as great. Numerous mistakes were made. I mean the food hits the spot no doubt. However, sitting your customers in a table where it hasn't been PROPERLY cleaned is another thing.

We've asked numerous employees for assistance, but our request was passed on from one to another. 

Another issue was upon food delivery, there was no utensils? How are we suppose to eat? Hmm.. also, food order was wrong.

Now, I understand that it gets very hectic and all on some occasions. But this is no way to cater paying customers. 

Everything was slow, barely any water refills? But when it came to giving out the bill it was hella quick? Cmon now.. 

Improvements have to be made. Thank you."}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken Pizza! Root Beer crafted in-house? Berry spritzer? 

I love love love their pizza and usually get the BBQ Chicken pizza (i'm a sucker for bbq)  The location is large and has ample amount of parking being in the Eastern plaza.  Great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"For me, this place is great. Good to find a place that has great food, great atmosphere, and no darn gambling machines at the bar. For those of you that like beer, they have a very large number of beer selections. While I am not into beer, I did notice a crazy drink menu. I can honestly say that this chain might become one of my favorite spots in the LV. 

Pros- pricing, menu, drinks, atmosphere

Cons- service could be faster"}
{"text":"Like someone else reviewed, \"another solid meal at B.J.s\".. we live in Summerlin very close to a variety of neighborhood restaurants and go out several nights a week.BJ's works for us for a quick, substantial meal. Service is always efficient and friendly, lots of items on the menu, quick to exchange items if they aren't to par. Still waiting to get there for the week-end prime rib the staff always raves about'm"}
{"text":"The bartender, Kim, is amazing! Great service, had a full bar and never once did we feel rushed! However they are training their staff is on point. Not to mention the food is amazing."}
{"text":"BJs restaurant and brewery puts a twist in your traditional bars and brewery's. They have specials and discounts on certain days of the week so make sure to ask or do your research. For Tuesday's, they have half off on wines and deep dish mini size pizzas. 

They also have their own crafted beers that can only be found at the restaurant. They have quite a few to choose from so it is sure to find one to your liking. They also have different entrees such as burgers, pastas, and more. They have an enlightened healthy menu for those who are on the healthy side. I strongly recommend trying some of their seasonal crafted beers.

The athmosphere of place is very moderate, not too loud but not too quiet. There are televisions in about every corner for those who are here for sports. They also have an outside seating area which is perfect when the sun starts to set and the weather gets cool.

They also have a dessert menu, try the pizzookie, a fresh baked cookie topped off with ice cream, it's delicious. They have a rewards program where you can earn points and use it on future eats. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We love the casual atmosphere and consistency of this place, but the stars go to our server, Rachel. It is quite difficult to dine out with a severe lily allergy. With that being said, she and the rest of staff took extraordinary measures to protect me from a reaction. They created a dish that was so perfect, I actually cleaned the plate. Thank you so very much, I know where I can eat without suffering afterwards! Xx"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my husband. It was busy because of football, but we were seated right away. The server took 15 minutes to get our drink order. We were annoyed, but I try to cut servers some slack, especially on busy nights. When he finally showed up, he took our full order, which came really fast. He never checked in with us, and my husband had to chase him down for refills. Meanwhile, our waiter is actually sitting down at the table behind us, giving them his Facebook info so they can add him.

This stuff is annoying, but had he pulled it together for the bill, we'd have given three stars. Clearly, that's not what happened. Instead he took 30 minutes to get our bill from us. At the 20 minute mark, my husband walked up to the waiter at a station and tried to hand him a card. Without looking up, he told my husband he needed to sit down and wait. We weren't trying to be pushy, but 20 minutes is a long time to wait for a bill, and we needed to leave. At that point I went up front and asked for the manager, who couldn't have cared less about what her employees were doing. Total waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like BJ's? Their diverse menu offers something for everyone!  If your a pizza lover, their Chicago style pizza is a must!  The crust is thick and flavorful!  My 2 favorite specialty pizzas they offer are The Great White and the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  If you order a large, it's great for sharing with a small group of people.  If you can't decide on which pizza to order, get half of one thing and half of something else!  Yes, they will do that at no extra charge!

Their alcoholic drinks are all very tasty, but for those who aren't big on alcoholic drinks , give the root beer a try!  They make the root beer there and you'll definitely be requesting a refill. 
 
If you're a sweets person like myself, you have to get a pizookie to end your meal!  My personal favorite is the Oreo.  A pizookie is the most delicious, moist, flavorful cookie served warm with vanilla ice cram on top!"}
{"text":"BJ's is your typical chain brewery I think.  It's not quite as good as a 4 Peaks because well, everyone likes a one of a kind over a chain...the good ones any way.  

I feel like one of the downsides is that their menu is like a novel.  I mean my gosh, make a decision here...what kind of food do we want to serve?  I don't want to read through a Cheesecake Factory sized menu when I just want to get a beer and good eats. It's not bad food, it's pretty good - nothing above and beyond but also nothing to write home about.  I have tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta which was just okay.  The second time I went I had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken which was actually pretty delicious. 

I haven't gone too much into the beer menu as I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the list is actually pretty big.  Service was great both times, servers were always very friendly and the place was clean.  

I'm sure I'll be back here at some point, occasionally it's comforting to know exactly what you're getting in to rather than the unknown. :)"}
{"text":"This BJ's is awesome as its huge and modern like a vegas hotel, bar is all lit up like THE HOTEL and garage roll up doors are cool. Service was fabulous and their food pretty good. Tasty mac and cheese, good ceasar salad, calamari was crisp and their orange juice was freshly squeezed and sweet. Their avacado rolls had too much eggroll wrap though so they were chewy and skin uncooked instead of crispy like they make them at cheesecake factory so we didnt bother to finish them."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Good IPAs but the nutty brewnette tops their list. Excellent root beer glazed ribs as well. Give them a shot, especially if you dig beer."}
{"text":"The service was amazing considering that it was so busy. We waited 60 minutes on a Friday night during the dinner rush. It is still a new restaurant so it would be expected that it was so busy. This restaurant does not use the app No Wait but does use their own app. Just search the App Store for BJs. You get $5 off your bill once you download it. The bar staff was great while we waited and the service was quicker than expected. They even talked about their beers and suggested food pairings as they got our drinks. The pizza was amazing along with the calamari. Will post more about other food once I have tried it."}
{"text":"Not a fan of chain restaurants and went here with low expectations.  The beer flight and meals were a bit of kick ass.  Much better than anticipated.  Our server, Tawnya, was also very friendly.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Pizza has always been a specialty here and I've tried a few of the personal size. 
The beer is pretty good too. I wasn't sure this place would be good for a date but it was rather fun. We were seated close to the bar which worked out well. It's rather a family heavy crowd in general. The ginormous menu is Cheesecake Factory size, which I find annoying. 
I had the Italian spicy thin crust pizza and that was very tasty. I love a spicy pie!
The 4 beer sampler I had was good too. My dining partner had a happy hour beer and wasn't offered another before happy hour ends, which a good server should always do! He did get another at happy hour price after asking, so crisis averted!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Great place to take anyone. Family friendly, has a full bar, tv's all over and just about a little bit of everything as far as food. This is one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Went to this location and the hostess, I don't remember her name, but she was really rude and told us different times from when we walked in till we got seated to eat. She was just giving us attitude after attitude and it was annoying. The food itself was good but the time we had to wait was ridiculous. They brought us out one plate at a time so by the time the last person got their food the first persons food was cold. They do how ever have a good selection of beer but when i got my beer tonight it seemed like it was sitting around for a little bit before it got to my table, could have been colder but it wasn't, disappointed in tonight but honestly I probably won't be coming back to this BJ's mainly because of the hostess."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner!  Great food, and even better service!"}
{"text":"Place an order of rib eye dinner & salmon dinner came up to about $50 . The meats where under cooked & I complain to the manager Kevin he gave me the run around then says I can only give you a $25 gift card . Horrible customer service & serves people under cooked nasty food . They don't care !!!"}
{"text":"BJ's is a great place to go when you have no idea what you want.  They have a little bit of everything.  The choices can actually be a bit overwhelming!  Food is good.  Service is good.  It's a nice room and location.  Above average for a chain."}
{"text":"I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"It's BJ's Brewery, a huge chain establishment, but the food is always good and they have a huge variety of items!

The service is consistent- staff is friendly and attentive.


The parking lot is always a lil chaotic- this whole shopping center can be a mess...."}
{"text":"The last few times I went here I was unsatisfied with the extremely lengthy wait time and service, but this time I am pleased to say it seems as if they have excelled positively in this area to make the restaurant much more enjoyable! My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night and they said it would be 40 min. We looked around the self seating bar area and a nice man from the wait staff proactively helped us find a table as well. Another wait staff told us he just cleared off a table in the area that we probably would not have noticed if he did not approach us. This was an upgrade from the last time we had to wait for a table. Luckily we only waited 10 min this time! Service was great, as well as food and drinks. I got a blueberry cider and loved it! Definitely recommend this drink. My Parmesan crusted chicken dinner was also delicious, as well as the chocolate chip pizooki of course. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation and they told me to hold and they hung up on me. Called again and they didn't care that they hung up on me and gave me more attitude. Went in and they decided to give us even more awkward and not appealing attitude. Not coming back. Learn some manners. Looks are nice but that can only take you so far. Learn from the north town bjs. Not the first time I've had bad service here."}
{"text":"This BJ's never seems to disappoint me. Today we were there for lunch and the waiter was so nice! Our food also came out very quickly today. I was surprised!

I got the half pasta and soup or salad lunch combo. I ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti and a bowl of clam chowder. Reason why I got soup was because the last time I had the house salad, I didn't really like it. It didn't have enough dressing, it seemed a little dry. The spaghetti was really not that spicy but had a light kick and a different type of tomato sauce, but it was enjoyable. It was really good price, about $9! My boyfriend got the clam chowder in a bread bowl which was about $8. Their clam chowder is really good! It comes out hot and fresh. He adds a little tobasco for more flavor, and I just like it the way it is.

We had calamari for appetizer and it was delicious as well. It was crispy and a pretty decent size. I've seen it bigger at other places but I'm not complaining. This was about $10.25 I believe. 

As for dessert, ALWAYS the pizookie! Chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream is always the traditional way to go! Sooo yummy and always hits the spot.

Because I'm a BJs card holder, I was able to get $10 off $35 or more, and we had just reached $36. So the deal was soooo good! Imagine if I had 4 people come and everyone ordered off the lunch menu.... What a deal!!

This place is clean and friendly and has pretty good food. I've had their Cajun pasta and shrimp scampi, both very flavorful. I've also had the angel hair Classico which is not as flavorful but good if you don't want a strong flavored pasta. Their pizzas are yummy and shareable size! Over all, BJs is one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Great experiences in two visits. Food is excellent and service exemplary. Highly recommend the Sriracha Chicken Mac 'n Cheese or the Jambalaya. Large portions served hot. Sandwiches and burgers are also good. Deep Dish Ziti rocks too! Place is loud, but what sports bar isn't?"}
{"text":"The menu here is huge but don't let it scare you, everything I have tried has been delicious. Their deep dish pizza and wings are to die for and no one else makes a pizookie quite like them. The selection of beer is nice as well.

I would love to give 5 stars but service here is extremely hit or miss. About 40% of the time you will have a server that hardly remembers you exist, while the other 60% of the time you have the best server ever."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to BJ's yesterday to enjoy their lunch specials. I gave the hostess my BJ's rewards number as we checked in. My card was lost by a waiter on a previous visit.

We were seated in a booth for two. A few minutes later, Nora, our waitress greeted us. She took our drink order and then our food order. I ordered the half sandwich and salad combination with the salad dressing on the side. My husband ordered the same thing except for no tomatoes on his salad.

A few minutes later drinks and salads were brought out. My salad had salad dressing on it and my husbands salad had tomatoes on it. Strike one and two. No big deal, we will eat them rather than risk the rest of our food being spit in.

Thirty minutes went by. No half sandwiches had been delivered. My husband was ready to get up and leave when Nora goes around, sees that we have not been served  our food and runs away before we can get her attention. She comes back a few minutes later with our food.

My fries were cold and the sandwich was soggy on one side and crusty on the other side. It was obvious that our food had sat under the heat lamps for a long time. My husbands food was the exact same way.

Nora, our waitress, was no where to be found, so we asked another server to get the manager.  Nora finally came over and went to get her manager.

William M, one of the managers, came over to apologize for our food being cold and unsatisfactory. He offered us to remake our food at no cost. We did not have time to waste another 30 minutes for our food to be remade. He said he was going to talk to his staff about the quality of food that is served. Nora knew full well that the food she was serving us wasn't the BJ's quality standards that the manager was talking about.

We go back to BJ's because we really like the food. This wasn't the first time our food was served cold or our order was lost or my rewards card was lost. For those reasons, we Will NOT be going back to BJ's. We have given this enough chances to this restraurant. We will take our business else where."}
{"text":"2nd time that I have been here for dinner and once again I am pleased with their service. Many delicious items on the menu. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"stopped in here on a \"lark\". this is an excellent spot for a beer and food. You would expect a superior array of unique brews, and they did not disappoint. I am a craft beer follower. This is as good a spot as I have ever been. We had nutty brunette- excellent1 good color, nose and great taste. 
I am a successful weight watcher, having lost over 100 lbs! My choice was a ground turkey breast burger. It was excellent. Basically a hamburger without the fat. Cooked perfectly, and well presented. My wife had a basic burger, she is a gourmet cook, wand knows the difference between average and excellent. She proclaimed it excellent. What is unique is the pairing suggestions with each brew. We followed that suggestion. It was wonderful. The beer tastes better, and so did the food. They each enhanced the other. We will be back, and take some craft beer folks with us! I highly recommend this place. Go when you can have a nice brew with your meal. They do have a full bar for those that don't prefer beer. They had bourbons and other libations."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying BJ's always has consistently good food and service. WARNING: DO NOT WEAR WHITE PANTS, WHEN YOU DINE HERE, OR AVOID PUTTING THEIR BLACK NAPKINS ON YOUR LAP !  On our recent visit, our meals were ok, but have a couple complaints.  My sister and I both ordered the BJ's burger and our server did get her toppings wrong, but no biggie.  They use a computerized ordering system, and I think he still hadn't mastered it yet.  When our burgers arrived they were on a tiny oval plate, and the burger and fries just barely fit, almost like they ran out of regular plates and decided to use kids meal plates. We asked about it and found out that was what they have started using, but noticed the table next to us had metal trays lined with paper for their burgers, which is what I've always had in the past. Maybe it's just the BJ's burger you get a kids plate, but there was not enough room to even put the ketchup for you fries on the side.  When we were leaving we noticed that our white capris we were wearing had black lint all over them from their black napkins.  If you plan on using black napkins, make sure they're lint free, or use white, which also should be lint free.   Since we don't usually carry a lint roller with us we needed to go back home, to de-lint ourselves before heading out to our next destination.  Yes, it was that bad !"}
{"text":"We ate lunch at BJ's today and it was okay. Lunch gets pretty busy. They have a large menu which I wish they would reduce to put a little more quality in to each dish. I ordered chicken tenders with fries. It was a decent lunch size but the fries were cold. My dinner mate ordered the soba noodle dish which had a nice flavor but was pretty soupy. On a bright note our server was James and he was very efficient and polite. We have eaten here before and the food has been better, they just need more care for each dish."}
{"text":"Consistently good; great BIG menu & draft beers; what can be bad?

This location is in Summerlin, across from the Red Rock Hotel.  When you don't want to mess with the downtown/strip area...this is a good choice for an alternate place to grab some grub with the locals.  

As with all the BJ's, the pizza, brews, salads, and tons of other items, desserts (can you say pizzookie?)...it's all good stuff. Plus, lunch & happy hour, and late hour specials.  My favorite thing on the menu (for years now, and I never tire): the BBQ Chicken Chop...which I feel is the best I've ever had (sorry CPK).  Salads don't travel well, but everything else is served in HUGE capacity and get read for a 'take home' box.

The service is very good at this location.  The only downsides is that it gets awfully busy, and parking is difficult to get in the front of the restaurants (shared with other restaurants), so you often have to park on the backside and walk a bit around a large building."}
{"text":"After being told for over a year that I absolutely had to go to BJ's to eat, I finally made my way there today for lunch. 

The menu is vast and overwhelming - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I don't understand the organization of it - too many categories that seem to have the same type of foods. 

The lunch crowd on this particular day was not overly crowded, which is why I took a star off for speed of service. 

It was a 90 minute lunch, and it should've been about half that. Our server was not the issue, at least from our perspective. He was attentive and seemed to really enjoy his job. I've worked in enough restaurants to know that when one part of your meal comes out hot and the other part cold that it's usually a plating and timing issue in the kitchen. 

I settled on a Nashville hot chicken sandwich with a Cesar salad starter. The salad was your standard side Caesar salad. 

The sandwich was decent, but unremarkable. It also needed an extra side of sauce as it was dry. Temperature was good, but it just wasn't the standout sandwich I had hoped it would be. 

The side of fries were disappointing in both portion size and temperature. 

I will definitely dine here again someday, as I've only heard people rave about it. It's better than an Applebee's etc by far for the same price range. 

Next time I will likely go with one of their signature dishes and not a \"new\" item like today."}
{"text":"I went there today for brunch.  There was a crowd of people in the lobby and all the tables were still empty. I ordered pancakes short stack it came out with three  little pancakes that look more like they were a side order then an actual order. It literally came with a half a teaspoon of butter and about 2 tablespoons of syrup. My first bite of the pancakes the bottom one was burn so I figured I would eat the top 2 and just not complain. My next bike I got a mouth full of onion flavored pancakes obviously no one cleaned the grill it was disgusting. The manager came over and offered to remake them. I said no thank you as my friends were done eating and wanted to leave. She removed it from the bill but still charged me for my iced tea.. This is a very nice looking restaurant with awful food I will never ever eat at BJs again it's disgusting I wouldn't spend my money here. I  have had their pizza in the past... Go to Pizza Hut it's better and much cheaper"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best, softest steaks I've ever had! I didn't have to add any A1 sauce. The poozokie was extremely sweet but delicious. I come here at least once a week while I'm working in town and I've always been treated with the utmost respect."}
{"text":"This place was super awesome ! They got our burger wrong and so nicely fixed it. It was great customer service."}
{"text":"This has got to be our favorite restaurant, bar none. The food is always top notch, we have never ordered something that we did not like here and that is the truth! The choice of micro brews is outstanding and the service is beyond compare. Crystal was our waitress tonight and she is one of the best! She was quick, efficient and extremely personable. She joked with us, made us laugh and was very non intrusive throughout the meal. She truly made the meal even better! You are so lucky to have her as part of your staff!! Thank you Crystal for your incredible personality! You are a jewel!! Good luck with your fantasy football!! We had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze with white cheddar mashed potatoes....perfection!! However, the only downside to our wonderful dining experience was your hostess staff. We entered the restaurant and waited for almost a minute before Tyler even looked up and acknowledged us. Really? You don't even make eye contact with someone who comes in the door 6 feet away from you? I find that totally unacceptable. We were seated near the entrance and I had a perfect view of Bailey and Tyler as they seated people and dealt with those patrons who were leaving. Not once did they say goodbye to departing guests. They were too busy chatting with one another. Being in the customer service industry, I find this behavior and actions completely unacceptable. Those two, Bailey and Tyler, certainly make it easy to decide not to come back. Watch who you place as ambassadors to your fine establishment....."}
{"text":"We are new to town and received a gift card from friends. They easily and quickly sat our large family (and saw lots of large groups). The menu is huge with lots of options suit your mood. You can also select a couple small plates, soups, and salads. We had the avocado egg rolls which were great. The kids menu is great. Lots of healthy choices for all and very vegetarian/vegan friendly options. My husband liked the beer choices and ordered a tasting flight. Overall affordable with generous portions."}
{"text":"Great service and food. We had Jennifer and she was attentive and informative about the menu. Always asking for her from now on."}
{"text":"Food has always been above average here but the manager here (tall, older man) isn't so friendly! Have a seat, here is why:

Being the techies we are we were excited to see that they had a mobile app now where you can pay your check with Apple Pay! The waiter dropped off the ticket but all we had to do was pull up our table number, check out, and was emailed the receipt fairly quickly. 
I then opened the check on the table and noticed a different amount than what I had paid. The waiter simply forgot to add on an extra Coke and did so last minute that it didn't update in the app. I notified the waiter and was thinking all we owed was the extra $3 for the soft drink and would have been fine paying that separately. The waiter went to see what was going on but the manager returned. He started by suggesting possibly doing a second charge on the physical card to see if it actually went through and if I ended up getting charged twice then they'd refund one. I frowned upon that simply because I'm not going to make another large charge on my card just to \"see what happens\". I pulled up the receipt that was emailed to me by BJ's showing everything I paid for, it was just short the $3 drink. 

The manager then sat down next to me at our booth, without asking, to look at my phone. I felt EXTREMELY uncomfortable because there was really no room for him so his arm and leg were brushing right up against mine. It was so unprofessional and a complete invasion of privacy and I shot a horrified look at my boyfriend on the other side. Quickly I showed him the email on my phone hoping he would be satisfied and move away from me, but it was like he had never seen an email like that before...I had to explain that it was sent front BJ's and where it said I used Apple Pay.  I even offered to show him my bank account...something I shouldn't have to do or feel that I should defend myself with but we weren't going to be painted as thieves. At this point he was still rudely hovering over my phone I had to obviously turn my phone away so he wouldn't see me entering in my credentials. He finally got the hint and got up to go check to see if it was showing as paid in the system yet. 
I pulled up my account and sure enough it was showing as being taken out and pending, it was incredibly awkward once again to have to show a view of my account transactions and prove we were not trying to skip out on the check. Sorry but I'm not going to charge my card again when we have all kinds of proof showing we've paid and we weren't trying to screw anyone over. The manager simply said \"well it's not showing as cleared so I'm just going to have to eat the check...\" and as I was about to speak he walked off without another word.

We just sat there in silence for a bit as the manager stared at us from the front desk. 

Sir...you're not \"eating the check\" as you passive aggressively stressed to us. You got paid, the money didn't just go into oblivion from my bank account, the BJ email receipt confirmed it, you were just short $3 for the Coke which we were happy to pay for on a different ticket.

The waiter, a kinder soul, came back a few minutes later and I gave him the quick rundown of what happened because I certainly didn't want him getting the blame for the last minute addition. He went back to check the register and BOOM it was now cleared and he said that we were all good. It just took a little time to get updated apparently but the manager clearly lost his cool early and lacked a sense of boundaries with customers. 

After an already long day and wanting to just sit down and get a good meal somewhere nice it was a real disappointment to then be hassled for something that was no fault of our own. We were the ones that brought up the issue and asked what we could do to remedy it not expecting the manager and how we'd ultimately get treated. I was just happy to be done with something that could have easily been solved...a measly $3!!! It wasn't that hard. 
Will be reaching out to corporate regarding the personal space issue though, an apology from the manager would have been nice at least as we left. 

We've come here for many birthdays and get togethers, however this customer experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and won't be recommending this place again."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants and try to eat and shop locally. However, I was meeting friends who had arranged BJs as our meeting place. 

The food was decent although I can judge only on the artichoke appetizer. What really made this place stand out though is our server Ryan. If ever I go back I would request him. He was charming, funny and helpful with suggestions. Ryan is what made me give four instead of three stars."}
{"text":"Good food. I had the avocado egg rolls and southern comfort chicken sandwich. The egg rolls are decent but could use something besides avocado. Mostly tasted like mushy avocado. The chicken sandwich was good. My wife had the jambalaya and it was decent but something in it tasted a bit off... Maybe too much blackened seasoning on the chicken. Overall good but I didn't try the beer."}
{"text":"Went today for first and last time.  An item was omitted from my order.  When I mentioned this to my waiter, he said nothing, left, no item was delivered, and he came back only to give me the bill.  He acted angry.  The food was fine.  I'll not return.  Dr. Robert H."}
{"text":"Never go here. Service is terrible. Took 3 hrs. Wrong meal. Finally just wanted to leave. Bill was wrong and took 30+ min. Have tried two different restaurants. Same."}
{"text":"They have an amazing turkey burger here. I added cheese to it and it was delicious! Very good service and reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Felicia. Went during the weekday at lunch and was in and out quickly. She was the perfect amount of helpful without being overbearing. I love BJs"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Especially since they added more low carb options and new menu items! The dishes I am recommending so far are the salmon with asparagus and sweet cherry sauce, definitely I am crazy about the honey Sri racha Brussell sprouts, the ahi tuna salad is delicious as well!!! Also I love how they have the BJ rewards program and all the promotions and discounts they offer, which then would justify why I would eat here more than once a week!!! Keep up the good work! A great place where everybody in the family is happy even the kids!"}
{"text":"I have been to BJs numerous times and had great experiences - but I will say if you have a special meal or a football game you really want to watch - DO NOT do so at BJs! I made a reservation with the only request being to watch a playoff football game - so they sat us outside with a table of 10 where there was only 1 TV and no game sound. The only sound was music. We were told the manager said that they couldn't turn the game sound on that night. I was so frustrated that they messed up our plans so badly!"}
{"text":"Service was very good! Thank you, Hannah!! The value, not so much. Very light on the fish in the Mahi-Mahi fish tacos. The flavors were good although the the \"light\" fry was a little greasy. I've had other fare here I liked better. Also, seems to always be a little warm in this restaurant. I realize it's July but, come on, I don't need to be reminded of it while I'm trying to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I loved bjs. It's been a very long time since I've even been to one and the menu has changed alot!. The service was great and the food and drinks were amazing. Just discovered their happy hour, I know where have I been right? I'll Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took my family of 4 last night. We had been here a few times before and it has gone from very good to not so great. Every visit is a little worse. Last night will be our last vist.

     Waitress was unpleasant and food came out luke-warm. Not worth waiting 20 minutes for and then paying 85.00 for 4 people to eat dinner. Pass."}
{"text":"I LOVE BJ'S! (hey, get your mind out of the gutter! :p) I like BJ's because they have great beers on tap (if it's still January, try the Grand Cru!!) The Grand Cru is a special brew they do at the beginning of the new year and they don't re-brew it until next January, so get it while you still can! As far as food is concerned, don't order anything else besides the Bj's favorite pizza. SO GOOD! It has like everything you could ever think to put on a pizza. Finish your meal off with a pizookie and life is GOOOOOOOD."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful server and atmosphere. Will be back when I'm here again from St Louis."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas in a beautiful setting with stellar customer service.  

A margarita on the rocks with no salt is my go-to drink and it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of margaritas at different bars and restaurants all across the Valley and this one was THE BEST, hands down.  

It was expertly mixed, with just the right amount of alcohol and citrus tanginess, served tall, on the rocks and garnished with slices of lemon and lime and most importantly NO salt.  You can ruin a margarita for me by ignoring my 'no salt' request, thankfully our server was paying close attention.

Rumor has it, there was food in front of me too, but it was secondary to that amazing margarita.

So for those nights where I prefer to drink my dinner (don't judge) this is the place.


Margaritas: Not *just* for breakfast anymore."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating here a handful of times and the food has always been good and service has been average. Today though everything was horrible. It wasn't necessarily the servers fault as it appeared she was spread a little thin, but when that busy standing around chit chatting with others didn't help. 
It took sitting there 10 minutes at least before we could place a drink order and by then we had our orders ready to go as well. My husband's salad came quick enough and then 15 mins after ordering my toddler's pizza came. We were informed the plate was hot, so obviously I took to avoid my 2 yr old getting burned. Why put a child's pizza on a hot plate and then continue to bring it out still has me a little baffled, but I guess that's acceptable to them. It's about 20 minutes after placing our orders and we still don't have our drinks (we didn't order anything fancy, just a beer and ice tea) and eventually  I am able to get the servers attention to ask where they are. We actually ended up getting our food before the drinks. As for the food my husband's food had to me immediately returned as his pulled pork sandwich was so cold I thought for a second it must have been pulled from the refrigerator. My chicken Caesar salad was ok, but definitely nothing impressive. I could have saved myself 5 dollars and gotten one down the street at Rachel's. Waiting to pay ended up being a joke as well. My husband and son actually ended up getting up and going outside as I sat there for a good 15 minutes. I must have looked annoyed because the other server in the area actually giggled when she saw my face. It took the manager walking past me almost twice before he offered to take the check and ring it up. From now on my family will be venturing farther from home to find another BJ's location."}
{"text":"Three stars because the beer is amazing.. always try the seasonal beers and they are great... had the wings and delicious... the jambalaya was soooo salty  I asked my friend who had it previously and had she had the same experience..."}
{"text":"Food was cold and took forever, service was great.  For a strip mall restaurant it barely meets very low expectations!"}
{"text":"Beer is ok.

Food...meh.

After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.

The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.

As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort.

So assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also."}
{"text":"Good ambience and atmosphere with quality music,  quality chairs,  as well as great food!  Not very expensive at the same time."}
{"text":"I am in the service industry and my husband is in culinary. We are hard to please when we go out but this BJ nailed it. Joanna,our server, was the best I have ever had. She catered to our children and was always available for us. My husband was impressed not only with the taste of his burger but the presentation was lovely too. Thanks for a great family night out."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed another great meal at BJ's. Rebecca the bar manager is awesome, so attentive and friendly.  Bj's is a great place for a top quality meal served in a friendly welcoming atmosphere.  I'll definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Call ahead is 30 minutes in advance. Called about 30 minutes before our arrival and was sat immediately. Which was nice because they were packed. They have a LARGE MENU which normally makes me nervous. My Wife got the baked zitti and it was great. I got the fish and chips. It was OK but wouldn't get again. Food is good. Nothing spectacular but good for the price. I would recommend and return"}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  I feel as if I tried one of everything.  Shared an appetizer sampler which was nice to get a little bit of each taste.  Decided on a deep dish pizza because they were half off for a mini.  I wished the server would have told us that to begin with.  Dessert was amazing.  I went with the pb smores, and it didn't disappoint.  Nice atmosphere with a huge selection. It's not a place for someone who can't decide."}
{"text":"We have been to BJ's many times and usually look forward to returning, but we went tonight - we even knew what we were ordering before we saw the menu - and it was so disappointing. We had the prime rib dip, usually our favorite dish ($15 each.) This time, the bread tasted old, the meat seemed like the leftover pieces at the end of the night (it was 5 PM) and the gravy was too salty to use. I'm not sure we'll be back. I am so disappointed. The waiter forgot to add our dinner to our BJ's program....which I'm going to try to figure out now."}
{"text":"I have to admit BJ's is probably one of my least favorite chain restaurants, so I'm never too excited to go to any location. I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist. 

We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first, as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware, sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy. 

As far as our pizza goes, it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal, but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away, but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless. 

I won't be back without a coupon, but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of BJ's restaurants. They seem to offer all my favorite things, beer and food, but the place has never really grown on me. 

On this occasion, I shared a half buffalo chicken and half sweet pig pizza. I enjoy the texture of the pan pizza, but they no longer serve them in the pan, which was a disappointment. Maybe they were just a little too heavy for the servers to carry, but man they really helped keep the pizza warm and the presentation was better. Now they serve them on a plate and it just wasn't the same. I didn't really enjoy either pizza flavor either. I've had both before and they were ok, but this time I was completely underwhelmed. The pizza just didn't seem warm and gooey enough to make up for the lack of flavor either. 

I did enjoy my unsweetened tropical iced tea. I'm always happy when places offer other varieties of unsweetened tea. The service was ok as well. Our server was friendly, but she wasn't very quick with the refills, so we sat with empty glasses for a little longer than I would have liked.

Overall, it's not my favorite restaurant chain, but it does in a pinch. I just haven't found the menu item of my dreams here yet."}
{"text":"Solid American restaurant.  Nicer than an Ruby Tuesdays/Fridays type place but did not have the service or selection that a Yard House did.  If I had to choose between the two, I'm going Yard House, however I would not be disappointed to end up back at BJ's again.  Everyone got their food in a timely manner, though it was not busy during lunch.  I hear it gets very busy during dinner."}
{"text":"With the diversity of the perfectly prepared menu, delicious craft beers, and attentive service, you can't really go wrong with this place. Definitely recommend for a date or a large group."}
{"text":"It was dinner time and we decided to go to BJ's. I knew since it was 7:00 there would be a wait. We were told it would be 45min. This was fine with us. We were seated in about 30 min. The layout of the restaurant is open but the noise level was not bad. You can easily carry on a conservation at your table. We were seated by a very energetic hostess. I did not get her name but she made you feel like they were glad to see you and service was going to be great. Our waiter was Gabby. She took our drink orders quickly and brought our drinks. I finished my ice tea before our meal was delivered. It was several minuets till this was noticed and was offered a refill. Everyone ordered and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I had ordered the half soup and salad. Not anything complicated. Wedge salad and clam chowder in a sour bread bowel. Others ordered BBQ chicken chopped salad, Angel Hair Toscana, and a Traditional Calzone.  All the food did not arrive at the same time and we had to ask to get the remainder delivered. My clam chowder was very bland and did not have much taste. There was plenty of clam meat but it was hard to tell it was clam chowder by the taste. Definite don't go for the clam chowder. I asked about the calzone and was told it had almost no filling. Very little cheese and was mostly pizza dough. So don't go for the calzone. The others reported their chicken salad and angle hair pasta was very good. We had to wait again for some time to get refills on drinks. Our waiter was not very attentive. Will I go back? I will probably give them another chance. I do know what I will not order next time. I do like the look and feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Applebees on steroids ladies and gentlemen, Applebees on steroids.

A few of my mates and I came here after going to a Korean BBQ place for dinner. We were famished. Not to say the BBQ was bad, we are just football players that didn't make it to the big league and got the appetite to prove it, but not the wallets. 

There is more food on that menu than there are numbers in Pi. I wouldn't say there is a preferred
item to get on the menu, just get what fits your fancy. Really isn't a speciality place.

You're gonna eat good and I mean good on a budget. Everything is reasonably priced. We left there with our tummies full and some money left over to have a real doozy on the town.

5/5 would do it again. Just, if I were to go, there would be no preamble with Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"So good! This my first time here. Service was awesome. The beers are great. The calamari was good (worst thing I can say). The ribeye with horseradish mash and red wine mushroom sauce was fantastic! Servers name was Carrie. She was absolutely perfect. Quick, on the spot, got the orders right and didn't hover. Great night out with my wife!!!"}
{"text":"Our server, Kevin, was great! Christy, although not our server, was super attentive and friendly! Highly recommend them as waiters"}
{"text":"This place is always busy! Always! I believe they will take a marker in line over the phone for you though which is helpful. 

It's your pretty typical fancier chain restaurant. The food and service is always good, but a little pricey. The portions are always huge though so you will never leave hungry. 

They have a large bar with a lot of TVs, liquor, and beer. The bartenders have always been friendly and offer good service."}
{"text":"I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. It is always my go to when I am indecisive about where to eat. There is a large selection of food on the menu... anything from seafood, steak, to vegetarian items. There is rarely ever a long wait even when it is busy and everything comes out fresh. No matter where I may be traveling in the nation, this restaurant is always reliable with great service and food when I am unsure of where to go. Never had a bad experience here, great service."}
{"text":"Always a good time watching football, having a couple craft beers... Pumpkin Spice Ale and Octoberfest!! A very tasteful mix of weather changing aromas and warm flavors. Happy hour - with mini pizzas and other specials going as we watch the morning games. You can never go wrong with the triple chocolate ghirradelli pizookie!!"}
{"text":"BJ's is fun if you're with a buddy and need a quick bite before a movie over at Harkin's. The beer is made on the premises and is really good, they got a ton of huge tvs, sitting at the bar is a good idea if you're not there with kids, and the baked potatoes rock. Pizza is just so so, salads are good, and burgers are just average."}
{"text":"Very bad experience I tried to use the delivery option on the website but it wouldn't allow me to complete my order. I tried calling and the guy that answered wouldn't take my order over the phone for delivery he said I had to do it online which didn't work so I just ordered carry out. I  picked up the food and when I got home which is only a 10 minute drive, everything was cold and dried. The  pasta and the roll were to hard to bite through. The worst part of my order was the calamari it was so hard and over cooked it was inedible. I didn't get any utensils either. Never coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the atmosphere is great. Relaxing, friendly place for all ages to enjoy high quality food at a reasonable price. We go here on a regular basis and the rewards card has got us more than one free meal. The pub decor reminds me of home in England so it's a fantastic place to unwind, catch up, celebrate and laugh."}
{"text":"Horrible eating experience. Our server didn't care. The place wasn't crowded, but our server acted overworked and it took us ages to get drinks. After we got drinks, it took even longer before she came back to take our orders. We sat with our empty drinks, waiting to order and waiting for refills for an absurd amount of time. Our server didn't resurface until we asked another nearby server for refills - this lady seemed to be able to handle her six tales just fine, but our server couldn't handle two. Finally we got our orders in and she asks if we want refills. Are you kidding me? Of course we do - its just diet soda! Drinks were brought to us while nearby tables were being bussed - as in, dirty plates were put on pause, our glasses fetched, then the bussing resumed. We finally noticed there was a party of some kind with the servers and buss-boys in the other section of the restaurant. We watched as our server sat with friends and ate for a bit while we waited for our food and, again, went without refills. Bussers sat dirty plates on clean tables, next to the clean glasses and whatnot, which was totally inappropriate. When we did get refills, our server never took any glasses away, so our take got really crowded... especially when the food finally came. I very nearly started sitting glasses on the clean table next to us, because hey, thats what the bussers did. Our orders were wrong, but our server never came back to ask how our food was. My sister's burger was not cooked to order, all my sides were incorrect, and we were starving. My sis sent hers back (took another twenty minutes to get it corrected). I didn't bother asking about my sides, because I knew I might never see any food at all if I sent it back to the kitchen. I'm surprised my sister did. We begged another refill off another server and didn't see our server again until she dropped off the check. 
The only reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because our server did take my sister's meal off the check since it had been incorrect. Unfortunately.... I have a feeling she did it not because the meal had been wrong, but because she suddenly realized with her terrible service, we wouldn't be tipping. 

Overall, horrible service. Food was only mediocre, but to be fair to the chefs in the back, we might have been tainted by the bad experience. Wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"The service was not timely and also forgetful.. we would have to be out of beer for 5 to 10 minutes before we got another, and once my date was ready to order, he waited 30 minutes for fried cheese curds which never came because they were never entered. By the time we questioned where they were, it was almost the end of the fourth quarter for the poor Cavs.  The bartender's response was that he was 'behind the bar the whole time' m. I don't know if that's a good excuse for some places of work, but where I work if you were behind the bar you should've known that we were needing service."}
{"text":"Love BJ'S we are regulars and have dined in and picked up multiple times. Food is reasonably priced, Thier membership gives awesome discounts and promotional items. Stay is amazing expecially Tam or Nick they are amazing waiters. They always take great care of us!!! We have also sat at the bar and the bartender was great very attentive, he also made me a special drink based on my pallet. Sad they got rid of the thier greenbeans but they let us substitute.

{"text":"The best steakhouse in centennial hills. If you have family in town or you just want great food, prompt service, and a relaxing atmosphere this is the place to go. You can bring your whole family and friends the larger the group the better. Anything on the slow roasted menu will leave you more than satisfied. Also there a $5 margaritas on Monday."}
{"text":"Lot's of changes at this place.  Pizza seemed totally different and very bready!! The new checkout system takes too long and the staff gets confused."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner today and for some reason it was super busy. I really love this restaurant and have been coming here for a long time. I love the ambiance and the food is great. I love their signature pizookie's and their rootbeer. 

Our waitress was not at all coordinated. She was in over her head I think because it was so busy. It took 15 minutes after we were seated for her to come by and ask what we would like to drink. Then it took another 20 minutes for her to actually come back to give us our drinks. This made me mad since I've never had such poor service at this restaurant before. 

We ordered 2 appetizers which came out literally 5 minutes before we were served out entrees. On top of that our waitress was not really attentive to us and was kind of rude when we asked for sauces and other things. 

Overall, I still love this restaurant, but I believe that if they do become busy the waitress/waiters should not neglect their tables and not be snippy if ketchup or other things are needed."}
