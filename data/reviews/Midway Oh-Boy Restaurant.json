{"text":"This place has been around for years. Everytime I'm back home and have the time, I stop in for an OH-Boy Special! Outstanding \"secret sauce!\""}
{"text":"This place takes you back to simple living. Everyone knows everyone; it's a local hangout it seems. The waitress was very nice and quick to attend to is. We got 2 big boys and the snacker platter. Delicious. The platter is great because you get a little of everything. The burgers are very simple but mighty tasty. They put plenty of sauce on them and lettuce. My only two gripes are: the shredded lettuce was too brown and it would've tasted better with a couple of pickles. Other than that I was very pleased and would stop by again if I'm every passing through."}
{"text":"My husband said his chopped steak with mushroom gravy reminded him of the salisbury steak TV dinner  :(

I was advised to order the special of the day (chicken breasts) and the chicken was decent.  Although the corn was the canned kind, the mashed potatoes served with both meals were okay."}
{"text":"Great food, Great friendly service. They have the best burger in Lorain county. My favorite place to eat lunch. Oh-boys also has a great deal on yelp."}
{"text":"We used to take the boat out on the lake from Hot Waters and OH Boy was a must stop everytime. We have even bought the oh boy sauce for use on our home burgers. Food and service were excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly service. Delicious food in a fun, diner environment, very affordable, good quality food (: we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great old fashion restaurant. Clean place. Food is always consistent and great tasting. Prices are affordable and service is pleasant. Love the Oh Boy burger!!! Yummy."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant as a child!  It brings back so many fond memories.  Juke boxes at every table (not working anymore :(  ... so sad).  Besides that, the food is still the same and seems like the prices are too!  

The main reason to come here is the Oh-Boy sauce!!  Its a special sauce that is on the burgers and served as a dipping sauce with your sides.  They offer a veggie burger as an option so don't worry vegetarians.  The real meat burgers here are supposed to be amazing!  The fried side options are endless (jalapeno poppers, onion rings, cheese puffs, etc).  The desserts all sound delicious but to be honest, I have never had enough room to try one!  The prices are awesome!  Oh and the cherry coke, get it!  Its the soda fountain kind that is flavored with grenadine.  Love it!!

{"text":"Oh Boy? Oh Boy! Yum! Go!  Seriously, folks... This is a burger joint. Do not order soup, salad or anything else, for that matter. Order the Oh Boy and fries. Food that is simple and fresh is best, in my opinion and Oh Boy does it sooo well. Love, love, love an Oh Boy & fries!"}
{"text":"Oh boy... lured into this one by limited choices and 4 stars while passing through Elyria... the waitress could not have been nicer and the prices are a notch above free otherwise the food quality is poor at best.  Three in our party had oh boy burgers which weren't terrible but they were swimming in the sauce (we think mayo & pickle juice)... so much so it oozed out with each bite.  The \"salad\" was shredded lettuce dolloped with this same sauce and a pickle slice.  The chicken tenders were processed and dry.  The fries were the best part.  My guess is Midway has a loyal local following that out of towners just don't get."}
{"text":"First time I ever went and I had to order a second oh boy. This place is great! Friendly staff and awesome old fashion setting."}
{"text":"Midway O boy, has been there for 63 years..Excellent burger joint...the O Boy burger is good but it's the sauce that they put on the burger. DELICIOUS...."}
{"text":"Going to midway Oh-boy was a requirement every time a trip to Midway mall made. The restaurant is \"midway between Lorain and Elyria\". It still has the old style juke boxes that can be accessed from the booths, of course loaded with oldies. The walls are still covered with elm panelling. The interior has not changed since I was old enough to drink my own Chocolate malt by myself. The chocolate malts here are the greatest! And the best thing of all is glancing at the Oh-Boy standing atop the restaurant with a cheeseburger body reminiscent of a Big Boy who took his work home with him. 

The sauce is great on absolutely everything. I tend to pick up a container and take it back to Columbus to make fat-boy creations. The sandwiches are double decker and the fries are of the shoe string variety. The Super Oh-boy is not the largest burger in Ohio, but among the best!"}
{"text":"Great homemade bang for your buck. This place will never disappoint. I come by here a few times a year  usually at closing and always welcomed in with a cheerful attitude. Save room for dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"Old school, not remodeled joint with ultra-quick and super friendly service, very fair prices, and a burger that'll make you want to slap yo mama!  OH-BOY!!!  

Or...Go to the franchised joint down the street with sticky tables, rude servers, and inconsistent quality and do me a favor by not crowding this little gem."}
{"text":"The Oh Boy burger and special sauce is the best!  I moved out of state 17 years ago and have to go to Oh Boy's every time I'm in town.  Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"First time here, this place has been around forever. Great burger, great staff. They should bring an Oh-Boy down to Miami, fl. 

Thanks again Oh-Boy,"}
{"text":"It is a hamburger with mayo with some pickle juice in it. 21$ for two burgers and 2 cokes. Sauerkraut balls were ok.. We didn't even have fries. Girl working in there likes to talk and she was friendly. It was extremely warm in there for a 90 degree day. I live in Texas now and sonic is the same thing"}
{"text":"I have been going to Midway Oh-Boy since I was old enough to eat solid food!  (Also get it at Lorain County Fair and Mill Hollow Cruise In).  This is the best EVER!

Reliable - oh-boys, fries, cheese puffs, shakes - always the best and very good.  No reason to venture off to the dinners, this is a burger place and the best there is.  I personally LOVE the cheddar cheese puffs, but my family loves all the fried mushrooms, etc.

They expanded several years ago to a back room that gives groups more space.  Great service - pleasant and fast.  

I live in Colorado and every trip back to Ohio includes a trip to Midway Oh-Boy (or two!)"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good lunch of chicken paprikas. It was steaming hot, and flavorful. It came with a salad and a roll. I was very full afterwards and my check was about $8. Not a fan of much else here, but the paprikas was worth it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love the Ohboy burger special. The sauce is delicious!!! I could smother anything in the sauce and devour it. I do not know what is in the sauce but it is really good. Everyone must try it. The wait staff is always very friendly and the food here is great. I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"If nothing else, then you gotta' try the creamy potato soup & an \"Oh Boy!\" burger with the house sauce.....

This is a longtime local restaurant known for its' burgers that is easy to find from the I-90 Elyria exits, head south from I-90 toward Midway Mall, turn right at first light - Griswold Road heading west, take another right at second light onto Lake Road, and the restaurant is on your left (west side of street) with parking on side & up front.

It's a throwback casual diner with booths & table seating around back.  It might be a touch more expensive than the fast-food chains, but it's menu selections and family-owned ambiance more than make up for any extra marginal costs.  Plus, its' usually quiet & a great place to meet for conversation over a fabulous bite to eat.  Midway Ih Boy! has plenty of appetizers and light lunch selections.  The creamy potato soup is excellent, rich, & filled with potatoes/vegetables.  The burgers are good, especially the selections made available with the Oh Boy! mayo-type sauce.

Service is always top-notch in keeping you refreshed & meeting your needs.  On my next visit, I would look forward to see what's available for dinner?"}
{"text":"So going in to this place I was pretty excited because chef symon promoted their food. Well how sorry I was for believing that. The oh boy burger should be named the flavorless burger with way too much tartar mayo sauce. Would have rather had a big Mac from McDonald's which isn't saying much other than the oh boy sucked. The hillbilly hotdog was the only thing that made me give me a 1 star. Good chili and coleslaw and beef hot dog. Wife's fish sandwich was a lovely frozen fish patty. The French fries all frozen tasteless wonders. If I wanted frozen foods reheated I would have went to the McDonald's around the corner. Probably would have tasted better for sure."}
{"text":"You had me at chicken paprikash soup! My mom used to come here all the time many many years ago (sorry mom!) back when she was in hs. That was the 1960's. So the time finally came to visit her ol stomping (chomping) grounds. I'll admit, when we first pulled up to the place I had my doubts. I mean, from the outside, it looked like the place hadn't changed a bit. Then I realized that was a good thing. First stop with my cousins once I'm back in town!

Food:
We no longer live in Ohio so with that being said I've never heard of chicken paprikash soup. A combination of two of my favorite things! Amazing! Sauerkraut balls were also delicious! They have pierogies, potato pancakes, fried pickles, Lake Erie perch, and halupki. Seriously? Need I say more? It's probably a good thing I don't live nearby as I'd absolutely gain a good 50 pounds if I lived in close proximity to this place. I've had their burgers which are ok. But honestly I'd recommend getting a few of their sides on the other side of the menu as that seems to be the best representation of their offerings. And why my mom and her friends have returned for the last bazillion years. 

Delivery:
They have delivery for orders over $50. Another reason why it's a good thing I don't live nearby. My family, as much as they love this place, would probably be annoyed after about 5 years of me ordering food from here for every special occasion! 

Service:
Awesome. The employees only added to the great experience."}
{"text":"Good good and really nice wait staff! We had the Oh Boy Special with a side of gravy, and the Sliders with jalapeño cheddar cheese puffs. Finished it off with chocolate shake and chocolate malt!"}
{"text":"I was close to giving them 4 stars, but there are a few glaring issues such as lack of parking. Second issue is their burger patty. The first time I ordered from them I got a patty melt, which would assumingly use the same patty style as their hamburger. To me it looked and tasted like one of those pre-formed frozen patties you buy by the box in the grocery store. I want my burger to have some flavor and heft to it. I also ordered their milkshake ... awesome! The second and last time I ordered I got the veal parmesan with spaghetti dinner. First let me say the veal was absolutely excellent and I still dream about it. But when I got everything home in the styrofoam to-go package and opened it up, it looked like it had been shaken vigorously, just like you shake the dice in the cup in a Yahtzee game (yeah, you know what I mean). The bread was covered in sauce - I HATE soggy bread, it's one of my many pet peeves. Okay, I will now go to a positive comment being that when I've called in a to-go order, I have been told it will be ready in \"10 minutes.\" How do they do that?!! Oh, back to the negative, prices are definitely high for what you get. But in the long run it's a nice alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had a GREAT lunch. My boyfriend and I both got the Oh Boy burgers with fries (he got regular and I got sweet potato with cinnamon sugar). They were the same price but he got double the amount of fries as me, but that's fair for sweet potato fries. We also ordered a side of Oh Boy sauce for dipping and sweetened teas. 

The burgers were awesome! We got them because the website said the Oh Boy sauce won Best Topping - Special Sauce at the National Hamburger Festival, and I see why, absolutely delicious. It's definitely mayo-based but I can't tell what else is mixed in, perhaps condensed milk? It's slightly sweet. 

The Oh Boy bun is soft, and they put one in between the patties as well. Lettuce and sauce on the top portion, cheese on the bottom portion, and I added tomato, delicious. 

All of the waitresses were also very friendly and the bathrooms were clean too. Mini jukeboxes at each booth are cute but there's a sign on them that tells you to use the large jukebox up front. Still a nice touch though. 

Worth making the short detour from the I-90 for lunch. Hope to make my way back someday!"}
{"text":"Warning: This review is not objective. It's packed full of personal bias, seemingly bloated perceptions of grandeur and emotional clouding. 

Most cities have them. Places like Oh Boy that the locals love with their entire being and will defend until their dying breath as one of the greatest places on the planet. This is one of those places. I was born in Elyria, 1974, EMH. Lived there til I was about 10. I grew up with Oh Boy and their burgers. Memories of their restaurant, which has remained largely unchanged since they opened in 1953, are as strongly tied to my soul as the city itself. I used to go to the Lorain County Fair every year when I was a kid and picking up a silver-wrapped Oh Boy burger on the midway was inevitably a part of the experience. Hell, it wouldn't have been the fair without it.

Having moved away years ago, I don't frequent the actual restaurant as much as most but when I do the experience is always a good one. I've ordered the same thing every time I've been there, the Super Oh Boy burger (imagine a Big Mac but good) special platter, chocolate milkshake. The only deviation was made for dessert. The pies are always fantastic. 

I don't mess with perfection when it comes to the burger. I order it \"plain\". This means the only toppings that come on the burger are shredded iceberg lettuce, American cheese and Oh Boy sauce. So what makes it a platter? You get the burger, fries and a \"salad\". I laugh every time I get the salad. It's a bowl of shredded lettuce, a dollop of Oh Boy sauce and a pickle slice. Yeah, it's the burger's toppings in a bowl.

What exactly is Oh Boy sauce? I honestly have no idea and I've never asked. Part of me just wants it to remain a secret. Sometimes knowing what's behind the curtain doesn't help. If I had to describe the flavor I'd say it's a mustardy mayo. More mayo than mustard. The fries, shoestring and perfectly golden crispy. Great for dipping into the shakes. Speaking of shakes, they're all hand-made at Oh Boy from Ohio ice cream and Ohio milk. Smooth, creamy, toothachingly sweet and brilliant.

To the outsider, they're just another small town diner that serves your typically average diner food. Know what? They''re probably right. To me it doesn't get much better. Oh Boy is a slice of America that is slowly dying off and being replaced by corporate-owned chains staffed by snotty-nosed, arrogant brats and completely devoid of personality. Oh Boy is a snapshot of a time that I often wish I could visit. Waitresses that call you \"hon\", formica tables, tableside jukeboxes, a long bar with padded stools hosting the butts of locals. I often complain when restaurants get \"stuck\" but make an exception for Oh Boy. I never want them to change, ever."}
{"text":"Since I was a kid I have loved this place. You can buy the oh-boy sauce to go. It makes everything better. Being a feminist I usually get the oh-girl, which is a single patty. Being single I often get carry out from here which is prepared usually within 5 min of calling. I have also had the Lenten fish fry which was good.  This place is a must try for a good burger. And it is cheap. Def $."}
{"text":"I only have had the Oh Boy platter and I probably always will. These burgers are as good as the In 'N Out burgers in LA, but as most things in Northeast Ohio fail to receive the hype. I stand in lines for In 'N Out burgers when I am in LA or Las Vegas. In Ohio I drive 20 miles for an Oh Boy."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. We both ordered burgers and shared an order of onion rings both were tasty! Our service was great too!"}
{"text":"Just mediocre diner food. I LOVE mom and pop diners, but this place was just not great. Parking was terrible, and nearly non-existent. Food was bland, and a little pricey for what you get. Their 'special Oh-boy sauce', was nothing special. It tasted like ketchup & tartar sauce mixed together. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, which is the only reason I'm giving this place 3 starts."}
{"text":"I have quite a few family members who work here, and let's face it, family's are honest about their job. And what have they had to say? It's a great place! What do I think? It's great, but not somewhere I'd want to go very often.

Pros?
-Friendly service
-Clean open kitchen
-Kid friendly
-Food is above average
-Lots of menu items
-Specials on certain days

Cons/tips?
-A bit greasy
-Some things, like all places, are better than others... just ask your server and they shall help!"}
{"text":"Big dollars and the sandwiches get smaller, but I've had better locally - like the Belly Buster at the Dog Tracks Restaurant in Wellington - they are grilled, not fried.  \"Big Dog\" is at the county fair also - try it.  Oh-Boys does have great shakes."}
{"text":"I've been going to Oh Boy's since I was a kid.  Definitely an atmosphere that ia not forgotten."}
{"text":"The gravy comes on the fries are ADDICTIVE! really good. I put it on my burgers too. I usually ask the gravy on the side so my fries are not all soaked.

i always get the oh-boy special. it comes with the chocolate milkshakes. (perfect, not too sweet. and not too big of cup), coldslaw, fries with gravy, and your burger."}
{"text":"So, I had to check this place out for lunch after reading some of the reviews.  I'm learning a little bit about the collective palette of folks in this area.  Basically, simple, no-frills joints are the favorite...but those of us with more sophisticated tastes may walk away unimpressed. 

I'm not exactly a foodie, and I enjoy a good burger, so I can appreciate the appeal of Oh-Boy.

Had the Super Oh-Boy Special...the burger was very good.  Fries were decent shoestring, and I didn't touch the \"salad\" that comes with the special.

If I lived closer, I'd stop in every once in a while for a quality diner-style burger."}
{"text":"This place had a pretty decent burger it was kind of out of the way when we were on our way to Chicago, but the burgers were good. I did feel like the service was not at all geared for anyone from out of town. I kind of felt like I was in some movie taking place in the backwoods somewhere. The workers were talking about how the neighbors dog had gotten loose again. The pie was really good though."}
{"text":"We love this little restaurant! Great food, great service. I can't wait to go back! The inside is a throwback to the olden days of rock and roll. Very neat place!"}
{"text":"This was great find! Yummy salad! The waitress made my daughter's homemade strawberry lemonade. She gave us tips on menu and also on local area. Cool little spot:)."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The food is always of the same quality, great. The staff is always friendly no matter time it is. Simple food at a great price."}
{"text":"The burgers and milkshakes are great! The Oh Boy sauce is the best! The service is fast and friendly. This is an old fashion diner that is definitely worth checking out.  If in Elyria make sure to stop in."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the burger, pierogies, and chicken paprikash. Reasonable cost and quick service."}
{"text":"It's your basic old school diner atmosphere. Saying that is not a bad thing, it's what it is, so don't expect more or less.   

Note: you can pull in parking lot from the 1st curb cut or the 2nd.  It's directional parking both ways, but is limited.  

The door to walk in is on the right of the building when you're facing it.  Although I was thrown off by the sign on the 1st set of doors talking about them selling so many winning tickets... But then the arrow pointed to the bldg. next door. 

Once in, a sign greeted us announcing the specials and that we seat ourselves.  

Overall cleanliness I give it 4 out of 5.  Nothing grossed me out.  I didn't see dirty floors/tables/or walls.  Everything appeared in tip top shape. 

The servers are attentive and friendly. 

The food: coffee is good.  The soups are homemade and I had the potato. It has bacon in it which I don't care for. It was thick. I had 1 good sized hunk of potato with a few carrots/celery.  Could have used more hunks of potato. Overall taste good tho.  
My accomplice and I each got the oh boy burger. Mine the 1/4 pound and his the 1/2 pound. Overall we liked our burgers.  The special sauce is good, but not too secret as it seems to be mostly mayo.  However, next time, my 135 pound female self will get the larger 1/2 pound burger! It was that good, I wanted more!  I got a side order of fried zucchini w/ranch dipping. It was ok.  I've had better. It was a fried batter vs. a breading type coating. My accomplice liked the zucchini and his fried pickles.  
We split a homemade piece of pie (made local, not by them), French silk, and it was delicious.  

Would recommend and will be back next time I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"It's got to be done right if you come here. This is what we order every time we visit:
Oh boy burger--moist, flavorful, fresh buns, gloriously messy
Fries--shoestring, hot, not greasy
Side of gravy (to dip the fries and burger into). Trust me; you'll thank me later 
Chocolate milkshake--perfection

Dammit Oh Boy, I want you now!

The diner has been around for over 50 years. It's the place my mother in law --a simple farmers daughter from Penfield--used to hang out on Friday & Saturday nights. This is where you got to meet boys because there was also an arcade right next door.

The old table juke boxes are still there although I was disappointed some of the songs were so modern. 

We've had the same blond server the last several years. She's fast, nice, and efficient. A minor observation, and one the restaurant can't help, if you're not white, you so get stared at by all the patrons."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, and nice people there. I had a great experience here. No complaints and I will definitely come back in the future if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. What can I say? Good burgers! I love the Oh Boy Sauce. I think one should put the sauce on everything including fries. I live on the west coast so, I haven't had Oh Boy in over 5 years now. I recently visited Ohio. But didn't get a chance to stop in this trip. I really often miss it. It's much better then fast food or chain restaurant food. For me this place is a freaking local land mark. It was really a treat to visit when I was a kid. 

I remember, the service staff being really warm and friendly. They have that classic Ohio charm that Ohio natives who move out of state often miss. This is the kind of place where the local charm comes out. I swear some of the service staff had been there most of my childhood. I wouldn't be surprised if many of them still work there.

I really wish I knew how they made the sauce. I often have a taste for it, like right now! But come in enjoy some good burgers. I honestly have only ever had their burgers. I have heard they have good fish sandwiches too."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on Sunday, and was greeted as soon as I walked in which was nice. The parking lot was small and the interior was definitely out dated. 
 The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. My drink order was taken right away. I order some of there vegetable soup and a salad. The soup was very good, so good in fact I took a quart of it home. The salad was your standard salad nothing special. 
 If your looking for a friendly staff and great soup, I would definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"We found this diner off of the beaten path on the way to Chicago. I would like to give it 3 1/2 stars, but hey what are you gonna do? I lean more towards 3 than 4.

What this city boy really appreciated about this place was how authentic it was. It was exactly what you would expect from a diner in The Middle of Nowhere, OH. The lady that served us was nice, but not sweet, the average age of the customer before we walked in was about 68, and Glory Days by Bruce Springsteen was on the jukebox. No really, Glory Days was playing on the Jukebox. 

We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer, and as far as fried pickles go they met my expectations. For our main course, the three of us had burgers. I had the Oh Boy, and my two buddies had the Bernie-burgers. Burgers are what they are known for, especially their Oh Boy sauce. 

My friends seemed much happier with their burgers than I was with mine. My burger was above average, typical for a diner. As for the famous Oh Boy sauce, again it was just okay. 

To go with the burgers, we shared an order of sweet potato fries with sugar and cinnamon. I do not recommend these, we were hungry so we finished them. 

All in all, if you're on a road trip, I would recommend Oh Boy over McDonalds. You just might find the extra 5 minute drive worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer. My last Oh Boy experiences were during trips home to Lorain County for the County Fair and International Festival with my family. Even w all the food choices at these summer staples, I went w an Oh Boy burger and fry. Keepin it Classic."}
{"text":"Went based on the review from Todd M.  This place was awesome.  My wife waitressed through High School and College at a greasy spoon restaurant like this in her hometown.  Oh-Boy blew it out of the water. 

The burgers were perfectly cooked, buns perfectly toasted, and the Oh-Boy sauce was fantastic.  I thought it was going to be like a Big-Mac sauce, but it's so much better.

Great place, friendly faces, a LOT of regulars, so that means it must be good.  And CHEAP!"}
{"text":"Small nice diner. Good food- although the burgers weren't the best I've had. Good prices."}
{"text":"Had to try this place. Very disappointed the sauce was lousy and too much dripping out of the bun had to scrape some of this crap off!  Fries were so-so. The 1 star is for the veggie soup. First and last time for this place.  And way over priced"}
{"text":"Any small business that has been around for 58 years in this day and age must be good! Midway Oh Boy is a great burger joint, but they also have wonderful homemade dinner specials and soups. They also have great desserts, milkshakes and proudly serve Mama Joe's Pies. 

Many of the waitresses working at the restaurant have been around for well over 10 years and some have even been there for over two decades. If you want service with a smile then this is your place!

Oh Boy's prices are comparable to similar restaurants in the area. Dinner for two with drinks and desserts will run you about 30 bucks.

Seating is on a first come first serve basis and you must seat yourself (no hostess). Even if you have to wait for a table you won't wait too long because they have a very fast turn-over. They have booths, tables and a great counter with bar stools to sit at. Food comes out pretty quickly, but on a busy weekend evening you may have to wait 15-20 minutes because they also have a large amount of to-go orders they are making as well. 

Daily dinner and soup specials are available. Lake Erie Perch is served on Friday and their to-die-for chicken paprikas soup is served on Thursday. 

I highly recommend giving Midway Oh Boy a try if you are in Lorain County...especially if you are sick of the chain-type sit down restaurants. They have been around since 1953 for a reason!

In addition to their Elyria location Midway Oh Boy has a booth at the Lorain County Fair and a trailer that they take around to all of the local summer and fall festivals.

Check out their website for printable monthly coupons.

BTW...I do work at Midway Oh Boy restaurant Part-time and have for 19 years. That said, this review is totally unbiased and I tried to just provide as many fact based assessments on this review as possible."}
{"text":"It's one of those magical off-the-beaten-path diners that are so hard to find anymore!  If I had a place like this near me, I'd eat there every day.  The open face roast beef and mashed potatoes is perfect.  Everything else I've had has been good.  The staff are happy and helpful.  The place is clean and the food arrives quick.  It's worth the few extra minutes away from the highway to get here."}
{"text":"Great burgers,  awesome pie... friendly service.  Can't go wrong at this place. Try the oh boy."}
{"text":"Been around since 1953.  Great local place.  Kid friendly.  Known for their OHBOY double decker with their special sauce."}
{"text":"I remember this place from 35 years ago. A Lorain institution.(sheff. twp actually) My mother loves the Oh Boy sandwich and I have to drive to get her one weekly. yall cant go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start with the review? I will say that this place is a staple here in Lorain County, and their food is top notch. The Oh-Boy burger is really great, and that special sauce is just great (wish I knew the recipe LoL). I first had the chance to eat their burgers at the Lorain County Fair a few years ago, and when I found out they had a location all year round I was elated by this news.
Now I usually order the Oh-Boy meal. I like to get cheese curds on the side. That reminds me to talk about those. They have some amazing cheese curds, and they can be addicting to be honest. The coleslaw is pretty good as well, and they use their special sauce in their coleslaw. The burgers are pretty great, and they are simple yet interesting. The patty is a standard size juicy patty. The thing that makes the burger interesting is that Oh Boy special sauce (I know I mentioned the sauce a few times before), but this sauce has some interesting flavor to it. It seems to be mayonnaise based, but there is definitely more to it than that, and I can't put my finger on it, but all I know is that it is simply awesome, and versatile as well. I like to dip my fries in them and so forth. This sauce just has that \"all-around\" qualities you don't usually get with other condiments. The cool thing is that you can order the sauce to take home.
All in all; I gotta say that this place is amazing, and an icon here in the county."}
{"text":"I went specifically to try the Oh Boy burger. It was delicious. Heavy mayonnaise based special sauce. If you like Frisch's Big Boy, you should like this burger."}
{"text":"I'm not a native, so I don't have the nostalgia for the place that others seem to have, but I can understand why they like it so much.  The food is pretty good and the service is really, really good and friendly.

The burgers are good-- the meat is above the usual diner grade (no mystery meat!!).  I'm not usually a fan of mayonnaise, but the mayonnaise based oh-boy sauce was pretty tasty.   My daughter went all Belgian on us and dipped her fries in it!  

The fries are the usual bagged variety, but they are fine.  Everything is garnished with lots of chopped iceburg lettuce.  The shakes were really good-- tasty and thick, but not too thick.

They do have Mama Joe's pies. For the uninitiated, these are what diner pies should be like.  They are fresh and filled with high quality fruit (try bumbleberry).  The waitresses will heat your slice up for you and serve it with a huuuuge pile of ice cream.  

This is a great place to take kids-- they have all the foods that kids like!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place since i was little. The service is always good, burgers are awesome and the strawberry shortcake is to die for."}
{"text":"S L O W...IF you can get someone to wait on you...I've gone in more than once and just stood there by the door while all the young people on the floor ignored us...we've walked OUT TWICE!"}

Been here for ages, should tell you something..."}
{"text":"A small, quaint diner with legendary burgers. This place is right around the corner from me and I can eat there anytime I want yet I still have to eat at their Lorain County Fair stand every year!
The Oh-boy is a must, but they also have daily specials like Chicken Paprikash which is delish! Try it for yourself! :-)"}
{"text":"Very personable staff. My kids and wife (who are very picky) liked their meals. Our waitress never let our drinks get empty. Their Oh Boy sauce is very good. Not overbearing. Would recommend this anyone driving through."}
