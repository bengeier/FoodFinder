{"text":"Easily hands-down the best lamb meatball I have ever eaten. Period. I crave the lamb meatball with pistachio pesto sauce more often than I care to admit to, and let me tell you, I don't take my lamb dishes lightly, especially meatballs. I mean this is serious business here! Flavor, consistency, all have to be spot on for the combination to work and deliver delectable bliss to your mouth. If the tiniest something is off, the whole thing gets blown. Bottom line, folks: it's not an easy feat to blow my mind with meatball excellence....especially of the lamb variety.   But not only does this do just that, it far exceeds to the point where I daydream about the damn things and get legitimately excited driving up to Hudson. Coming from a food mecca like Las Vegas, I would say I'm not easily impressed....so I was quite surprised finding such a delicious experience here. Everything is excellent, but do yourself a favor and get a meatball....or 3...."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but if you're used to American style pizza this is definitely not your place. My fiance was upset that he couldn't just get a \"normal\" pizza (you can't create your own). You will be looking at spending $12-15 for a 6 slice pizza. I didn't mind the food but if you have picky eaters you may want to go somewhere else. The desserts looked amazing and I wish I could have tried some!"}
{"text":"Adult pizza parlor. Gourmet pizza that is so very fresh. Interesting and cozy decor. Great for meeting up with friends for a casual night out for sophisticated pizza. Don't forget the homemade Italian dessers"}
{"text":"Great pizza in a simple Neapolitan style, which may not appeal to everyone.  The crust is very thin and chewy with some charred bits; they use a light hand with the cheese and toppings, and everything melds together perfectly. My absolute favorite is the Diavola with a 5-way tie for second (Rapini, Polpettina, Margherita DOP, Bianco and Verde).  There are a couple of safety-valve foods for people who don't like the pizza, but I have no idea what they are as I never get that far down the menu.  An average adult can usually finish all or most of one of a pizza, so don't try and split a single pizza between your group of 4.  Service is quick, casual, and semi-hipster.  The Bambino/American Style has shredded mozzarella, but a picky kid will see the charred edges and freak out.  Get them some bread and maybe pasta with red sauce (or do what I do - just order it knowing they won't eat it and then I have leftovers tomorrow!).  Add a half chopped italian salad or some meatballs and you've got a great meal.  I agree with others that another draft beer option besides Peroni would be a good idea."}
{"text":"The pizza was definitely not worth the $13 I spent on it. It was by no means \"delicious\"   . It was quite sub par. The tomatoes fell off immediately after I lifted up a slice. Some of the tomatoes were not even ripe. I prefer a pizza from the One Red Door, which does not specialize whatsoever in pizza. The waitress didn't even know the menu. She had tried, maybe, one dish. The setting was unusually contradictory. The restaurant focused on marketing itself as an Italian pizzeria. The music that filled the \"Italian pizzeria\" was rock. The decor and interior design that framed the culture of the \"Italian pizzeria\" looked as if John Wayne had previously been shooting a saloon fighting scene. It did not make sense to me. I am dissatisfied. Not worth your time if you enjoy exquisite food and commendable service."}
{"text":"Wow, this is my favorite restaurant. From the wood fired pizza's to the amazing meatballs. I just can't get enough ! The bakery is fabulous , best place in Hudson to pick up a rustic loaf of bread or fresh cookies ."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and had good pizza (for Ohio), and we like the Italian salad, but on a whim, we tried the meatball (ok) with the mushroom gravy- this stuff is so very yummy.   For pizza, do yourself a favor and try the Bianca and Verde pizza.  The cheesy white pizza topped with fresh arugula is fantastic.  Our favorite pizza."}
{"text":"We went early to avoid the crowd as this place seems pretty busy.  Despite being there at 5 the wait staff was slow, but very nice. I was really hoping for a great pizza but ended up with something mediocre. My wife's chicken sandwich had the lemon mayonnaise despite asking for none."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last Sunday.  We ordered the bread board, a salad, and the fungi pizza.  Everything was fantastic.  The food was flavorful, perfectly textured, and unique.  The salad featured local goat cheese and house made croutons.  The bread was amazing, three different varieties all soft with perfectly chewy crusts, served with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and parmesean cheese.  The pizza had really unique flavor.  Several different kinds of mushrooms--I love mushrooms, but I've also eaten a lot of mushroom pizzas where the mushrooms were either dried out or too wet.  These were perfect.  The crust was smokey and whatever sauce they put on it was sweet and earthy.  So so so delicious.  Great atmosphere too.  Really cool building. Only cons:  Their water was really salty (weird, I know) and our server (Jake) was just ok.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pricey for the quality and quantity of food.  We took friends there for lunch, and the selections were pretty boring.  This place doesn't measure up to Hudson's high standards."}
{"text":"I love me a good pizza joint, and 3 Palms did not disappoint! And let me say, for it being a Monday night, the place was packed!  To start our night off, we split an order of the gulf shrimp and the fried artichokes. The shrimp was good; the artichokes were amazing! If you're going to get an appetizer, go with the artichokes--you won't regret it.  We split the pizza with the sliced meatballs--what a fun idea. They were soooo good. The pizzas are six slices. They aren't huge. If you split one with another person you aren't going to feel disgusting afterwards (a huge plus). Our pizza crust was a bit burnt, and I noticed other pizzas coming out of the kitchen were the same way. I'm not sure if that is how they always are, or if it was just how they were tonight.  If you are going to order a drink, try the punch. It's tasty and strong!  We sat at the bar, and service there was slow. I'll let it slide though because the bartender was working his tush off.   The space is pretty nice too, except for the nasty drop ceiling. Drop ceilings are the worst."}
{"text":"Always quality food, great wine, and wonderful ambience. I had a salad with three wonderful shrimp added. The bread appetizer with olive oil and grated cheese is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  We sat at the bar.  I had the artichoke app. and the carbonara pasta.  Everything was delicious.  The service was great as well.  I would for sure come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Best Neopolitan style pizza in the area, chicken sandwich is also great and the deserts are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I went to 3 Palms in Westlake because I love the 3 Palms in Hudson. The service at 3 Palms in Westlake is HORRIBLE. On a Wednesday night they had 1 waitress, 1 hostess and the manager (who served as a bartender) on the floor. Our server was doing the best she could being the only server in the restaurant, but obviously having to handle so many tables she could only check on us every 20 minutes. The hostess was running around taking drink orders and bussing tables so there were customers waiting to be greeted/seated for 10 minutes. The food is good here, but 3 Palms management needs to get it together! It was by far the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant."}
{"text":"We were in town for the Hudson wine festival (skipped the second day in favor of restaurants) and tried this pizzeria. Good cocktail list and only one beer on draught. We tried the fried artichokes which weren't overly breaded but crisp and delicious. We also tried a pizza with spice Salome, San Marzano sauce, buffalo mozzarella, and pickles banana peppers. The homemade banana peppers are sweet, savory, hot, and delicious! Pizza was perfect, not too soggy in the middle. Delicious sauce and fresh cheese - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I sat at the bar tonight. We had the absolute best experience ever. The bartender, (janine)... Was unbelievably wonderful.  She created the best atmosphere and we will be back often because of it.  We got the meatball appetizer, with the sauce she recommended and it was delicious.  The margherita pizza was great also, and we split a tomato caprese salad.  Amazing.  Great atmosphere.  Sit at the bar if you can for a super fun experience!"}
{"text":"This place rocked! Very tasty pizza options and it's worth a slight wait on the weekends. It's a fun get together or date night spot. The food tastes fresh and the service was on point even on a busy Saturday night. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been there several times.  Friendly people and great food!  I love that the pizza fills you up but does not feel like a brick in you stomach.  The salads are very good and love the fresh deserts that they have."}
{"text":"This is not just a pizza spot . The meatballs are great, multiple sauces to choose from. The mushroom was my personal favorite. The entire staff is very engaging. The space is very comfortable and lively. All the pasta and Bread is made in house and it really shows. I would recommend just trying a few starters and or meatballs then ask what the specials are before you decide on an entree . To much to choose from and everything is made with pride , I'm excited for our next trip back to try some more!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and salad. Just like Italy!!! Highly recommend !tomatoes were amazing. Desserts like my husbands Aunt's from Sicily . So good!!!"}
{"text":"First time visit on Saturday. Split a full salad and pizza. Salad was fresh with a great vinaigrette and the sausage on the pizza had just enough spice."}
{"text":"Great pizza, meatballs and salads. A little more pricey than Zeppe's, but wellll worth it.    The atmosphere is great. The wait staff is usually pretty good too.   A definite must when in Hudson."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Authentic...fresh veggies and all. Great service. I stop in whenever I am in the area can't get good  authentic Pizza many other places. If you are in the historical district in Hudson it would be my suggestion that you check them out! The also have amazing  fresh subs and salads. Cocktails are not bad either!"}
{"text":"Our decision is split in this so I gave it a 3. My husband really liked his rotisserie chicken but I wasn't crazy about the pizza. And after all isn't that why you go to a pizza place for the pizza. The desserts are Really good though."}
{"text":"Seems to always be a wait on weekends, but it's worth it. The salads and pizzas are good; however, the only beer on tap is Peroni. Don't forget to grab a fresh cannoli in your way out!"}
{"text":"Food made me feel like a god. Telling everyone about this spot."}
{"text":"So my wife, kids and I went here on a whim because we wanted to get some pizza. Well the service was great and very speedy. We ordered two pizzas the Rapini (it had sausage) and the Frutti Di Mare ( seafood pizza). Well the pizza tasted burnt. It seems like they haven't wiped out/ clean that oven, and I understand wanting to keep the oven seasoned but there is seasoned and burnt. When you have corn meal that's been burning since you have opened you need to wipe it out or it gets all over the pizzas as it did. The pizza was bland with no flavor at all. The pizza had broccolini on is which I love but it was bland and didn't seem like it was washed. Needless to say we were both disappointed. Oh and we got two pizzas and four drinks (two lemonades, a root beer, and water) this came to a whopping $50. We spent $50 on BURNT pizza and couple of drinks, ridiculous. We will not be going back to this place as it was a BIG letdown. The only reason I gave them two stars is because our server was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in the area. It's authentic as it gets. Atmosphere is great and service is as well. Surprisingly it's a good place to take kids. Highly recommend the meat and cheese plate app along with the meatballs. If your skipping pizza, the Italian sandwich and chicken entree are phenomenal (keep in mind most of the menu is pizza). They do have a gluten free pizza which is actually really good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots.  Amazing meatballs.  I have had them all but the lamb is my favorite.  The pizza dough is the best dough I have ever had.  All of the salads are great also.  Staff is very friendly and always attentive."}
{"text":"Very good place. Love the thin crust pizza and the salads. Great place to go for excellent casual meal."}
{"text":"The food here is ok, say 3 stars. But it's really overpriced.  I ordered carry out, two margherita pizzas, one with sausage and mushrooms and one with prosciutto.  These are very thin  12 inch pizzas.  $37! Fried artichoke hearts:   $10 for four halves. The prices are on the menu, so shame on me for not adding everything up."}
{"text":"3 Palms seems to be still catching their footing. I love the food here; appetizers such as the meat balls and fried artichokes are amazing and the pizza is some of the best I've had.   Wine selection is ok, beer selection is poor (but it's an Italian place, what do you expect more than Peroni?)  A bonus is the pastries, bakery, and gellato shop in the front of the place!"}
{"text":"Recently had a very enjoyable al fresco lunch with family including a toddler. Loved everything we had: two pizzas, meatball app, Caesar salads, cocktails, dessert.  Attentive staff, we were seated by the manager. Will return again and often."}
{"text":"My friend and I were out to crocker park for some shopping and decided to get dinner. We had my daughter who is 1 with us. When we arrived it was confusing as to if we seat ourselves or wait, a host eventually came over and seated us, after shitting for 10 minutes we waved him down again and asked if we had a waiter. After ordering drinks we wait again for a while before we ordered food, my friend who is deathly allergic to peanuts, lentils, beans, order a sandwich and asked about these items stating she was allergic. When her food came there was a bowl of lentils as the side. This restaurant also is not very kid friendly in my opinion, there was no type of kids menu and when I asked I was given the option of a pasta bowl that was at the price of 12.50. That is way more than I need to be spending on some pasta for a child. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 palms' salad, the waitress asked adding shrimps or not. Yes, I answered. The salad took more than half hour came out with 3 shrimps inside. The check showed the price from $11 original price jumped to $20. So the shrimp was $3 each!  Nice cash flow! Never come back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was modern farmhouse and pleasant.  We ordered the margarita pizza on the gluten free crust.  It was a little dry and needed salt.  The sauce wasn't enough to wet the pizza and so we asked for a side of sauce.  He charged us for it without telling us.  It also needed flavor.  We also had a pizza with sausage.  This was better but still needed something.  We had 3 sodas, a half salad and 2 small scoops of gelato.  $80!  I'm sorry but this is too much for the quality of food.  Never again."}
{"text":"The crispy artichokes appetizer is one if my all time favorites!   They have a great selection of gluten free items and the gluten free pizza is really tasty.  Be sure to try the gluten free Amaretti cookie...amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my wife. She had to have gluten-free.  We decided to split a gluten free pizza and a large salad.  We got the 3 palms salad, which was good, but not that large.  The pizza was bland, very thin crust (though that's what was expected with a gluten free crust).  It was rather small, and the toppings were scarce. Needless to say, we walked away still hungry and somewhat disappointed, as it was pricey... Oh, and the waiter graciously waived the $4 surcharge for gluten free, which wasn't even listed on the menu.  Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Order to take out on 10/22/16 . Don't do it they serve you burnt pizza. I spent 27 dollars on nasty burnt pizza. They did not clean there oven. It seems they are concentrated in there bar. In the end it's just another drinking place in Crocker."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service.  Saturday night, called restaurant at 9:40pm to order a couple of pizzas to go.  They wouldn't answer, after a few rings it went to voice mail.  Tried again, same result.  One more time, same thing.  Website says they're open until 10:00pm.  Figured they must be too busy to pick up the phone, so I drove the 7 minute commute to the restaurant to order in person.  Arrived about 5 minutes or so before 10:00pm.  Two workers at the counter.  One scooping ice cream, wouldn't look up.  The other making an espresso, also would not acknowledge my presence.  After waiting about 5 minutes, finally was able to get someone's attention and asked to order pizza to go.  \"Sorry, we close at 10:00\".  It's now 10:01pm and it's clear all they care about is getting out of there to enjoy their own Saturday nights.  Customer satisfaction way down the list of priorities.  3 Palms?  No thank you."}
{"text":"Service always great! Fungi  pizza is awesome if u love mushrooms!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about the food here.  Everything I have tried is absolutely delicious.  My favorite pizza is the Rapini...I have them add mushrooms.  I recommend the crispy fried artichokes or one of the meatballs as an appetizer (the traditional with mushroom gravy is beyond amazing).  I will say that the service is often pretty slow, but because the food is so good I am giving it five stars, anyway."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and décor but man is this place expensive!   Especially considering all the better options available on First and Main.  We went during lunch and almost $50 later we were still hungry I agree with the other comments about the pizza - I guess I'm a NY/Chicago style pizza guy. Save your money and try one of the more reasonably priced restaurants in Hudson."}
{"text":"The fried artichoke appetizer is delicious (if a bit overpriced), as are the food fire pizzas. Decent beer and wine selection, and the dessert case is incredible. The outdoor patio adds a nice ambiance and makes for fun people watching."}
{"text":"Came by on a Saturday night.  It was relatively slow for Crocker Park, but I have seen it busier at other times.  We had the margarita pizza and chicken carbonara.  Both dishes were good, not great, but took over 30 minutes to come out, which seemed odd since there was less than a handful of tables.  Our server who was also the bartender was very pleasant and answered all of our questions."}
{"text":"If there is such a thing as healthy pizza, it has it. Not your typical pizza joint and I liked it. Pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"The meatball and marinara were good and worth a try. Pizza was severely average and definitely not worth a second go. Service in Hudson is quite bad. Overall, for the pricey food at this and similar restaurants in Hudson, unfortunately, the service is slow, inattentive, and just BAD!  And then you show you're not happy and it's like no one cares either.  Perhaps the only good place I've been to where this is not the case is the Flip Side. Does anyone know where else to get good food with good service in Hudson area??"}
{"text":"3 Palms is a hidden gem. Their polpetino pizza is the best pizza in Cleveland. My husband and I drive almost weekly from strongsville (60 min round trip) to partake of this treasure. The Napoleon crust is perfection, the marinara is flavored perfectly, and the sliced meatball is better than I've ever had. We like to pre-game the pizza by ordering the chopped Italian salad, which also happens to be one of the best salads I've had in a long time. Not over-dressed, but full of flavor. The bar is comfortable and quaint, and the ambiance of the restaurant is the same. Love this place. Go here. Make sure they never go out of business. Maybe they will grow so much they will open another location in Strongsville!"}
{"text":"First time visiting with the family! I had pizza the night before, so I wanted something different. I had the chicken/avocado sandwich with a side salad. First bite of the sandwich was amazing! The organic rotisserie chicken had such an amazing flavor and they use it in many of their pizzas and other dishes. The only sad thing was that the avocado they used was half brown. I was disappointed because I have to take most off. Hope they check their quality before plating in the future.   Over all good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great alcohol selection. Great pizza selection. Great desserts. Service is always great, and they use the No Wait App, which helps so much since it gets so busy there (it's such a popular place). I went a few weeks ago with some friends for the first time in years, and man, I am so sad I did not go back sooner. I split the meatball with one of the friends, which was perfect for 2 people. Then all 3 of us split a pizza, which was to die for and just the right amount of food. The service was A+ and even though it was busy, it wasn't too loud (how it can be in other places when it is super busy and gets way too loud). Oh, and they have a DYNAMITE playlist of music, so kudos to whoever was in charge of the music on Nov. 4, 2016. The music rocked."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my favorite meals and so I was extremely happy to find 3 Palms had exactly what I needed.   A group of us arrived mid-afternoon on a Saturday and the place was packed. We were not expecting that to happen in the middle of the day, but it did. Lucky for us, we were able to find a few seats at the bar (again). I like sitting at bars since it gives me the opportunity to see drinks and talk with the bartender about recommendations so this was a good visit.   Since the restaurant was so packed it was impressive to see how well the front and back of the house staff worked together. I was impressed. Our server/bartender provided us each a menu and we ordered drinks to start the meal. While looking at the menu they had so many good options to order, but I knew exactly what I wanted and I was so happy to see they had a white pizza! The best thing about 3 Palms is that you can go and each person can order a personal pizza since everyone likes pizza a certain way. By the time we needed to order I also knew that I wanted to start with a small salad; the 3 Palms salad to be exact. Once the orders were in the bartender had some bread delivered to our area and refilled our drinks.   We had a few different people offer us drinks and clear our area so it was nice to have so many hands helping out. I am sure the bartender enjoyed that as well. As soon as I finished my salad the pizza was on its way. When mine was delivered I could smell the garlic and couldn't wait to eat. The best thing about a white pizza is that it is cheesy and filled with garlic this pizza even had some arugula on top which brought out the flavors so nicely.   I knew we all enjoyed our meals because we were all so quiet while eating. I ate almost all of mine, but needed a box for the final 2 slices. I was proud of myself for having self control...I could have eaten it all, but didn't want to miss out on leftover pizza the following morning for breakfast!  Overall, I had a nice meal and good service at the 3 Palms and I would recommend ordering pizza here! They had a wonderful dessert bar, but I opted to skip dessert. Guess I'll have to go back for another meal and I'll save room for something sweet. I hear the baker is fabulous!"}
{"text":"This has a great atmosphere, decor, and a go to place for us. When we eat there though, it is usually too noisy to hear the people you are with so we don't recommend this place if you are really needing conversation. It is perfect if you are out to have fun or just be out. Summer time the patio is perfect for everything, including conversations. They offer a lot. My go to is the fingerlings and veggie ball with pesto and I house made cream cheese with bread. When I ate meat I loved the traditional meatballs and rotisserie chicken meal. I do not like my pizza burnt and that seams to be a hit and miss here."}
{"text":"Best place to eat at Crocker. Laid back, fresh delicious food, and great service.  Also love that it's on the opposite side of Crocker than the other restaurants. It's my new go to.  Have gotten the Avacado Chicken (rotisserie chicken that is) sandwich several times now and love it."}
{"text":"This place exceeded expectations....we ate on the patio which overlooks Hudson's First & Main green space.  Our waitress was very helpful describing the menu, as well as having plenty of patience with us as we were visiting with another couple and at times forgot to look at the menus to figure out what we were going to eat ( shame on us ).  The meatballs, pizza, salads, and gelato were fantastic.  Drink menu also had plenty to choose from.  Great atmosphere both inside and outside, great food and service!!!"}
{"text":"I've taken some time to read the other reviews (which are quite mixed!) and reflecting on our experience now, I can see some of the complaints, but not all.   We went with a party of five on a Saturday and put our name on the list by a little before 6pm. We walked around downtown Hudson for a bit and then got a call our table was ready by 6pm. Pretty quick for a busy evening.  I started with a caesar salad, which was good, but pretty standard in comparison to other places. I got the rapini pizza for my main dish (tomato, garlic, sausage, broccoli rabe, mozzarella, basil) and really enjoyed it. The crust was light and crisp, which I really enjoyed. My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich that came with a great 'ancient grain salad' (aka, farro). We really liked both dishes, but did comment that there wasn't much besides pizza. Which, is fine! But, some more diversity might be nice.  Desserts were delicious -- I died over the lemon square (nice and tart, not too sweet) and Mike had a chocolate torte that was really decadent and wonderful.  I do agree with comments, however, about poor service. Our waitress was pretty good, but we definitely got the sense we were bothering her by the end and she just wanted us gone. Hopefully those are issues that can be resolved moving forward."}
{"text":"Just had one of the funnest dining experience here Kaitlin (I think) was great.  We showed up 10 minutes before close and sometimes you regret that but, she was still warm and welcoming. Never once did we feel rushed or cheated because anyone was wanting to go home.  Thanks 3 Palms, I now know why you have such great review.   PS try the Limoncello...its home in house."}
{"text":"It really pains me to write such a poor review for 3 Palms, but I have to. We had such high expectations for this place since we love Neapolitan pizza and Shawn Monday. But it just wasn't good.   Let's start with the good points. First, the staff was excellent.  They were super friendly and helpful. Our first course was good. We had the traditional meatball with Sunday gravy and it was flavorful and tasty. I loved the ricotta on the side. Also, the chopped salad was quite yummy. It offered a nice mix of fresh ingredients with a dressing that paired perfectly.   Now to the bad. As I said, we love Neapolitan pizza. In fact, we've had it all over the country so we are quite familiar with it. It should have been fabulous if you consider the ingredients used and the oven. The biggest issue was the crust which just wasn't right. The outer edge was dense and tough, not light and airy. The center was crunchy. I can't say I've had pizza with a crunchy center before.  The toppings were a bit better, but not great. The ricotta pizza was lacking ricotta. It was seen on maybe half of the pieces. Then the salami pizza had black, crunchy basil on it. I think that should have been added at the end.   So all in all, not delicious. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night?  We also had about three apologies from the manager regarding the slow service which we really didn't care about. I recommend going to Bar Cento in Ohio City or Tre Belle in Bath if you want authentic, delicious pizza. Sorry 3 Palms...I so wanted to love you."}
{"text":"I recently had a really pleasant afternoon at 3 Palms sitting on the patio and having some drinks. Great service. Excellent wood fired pizzas. I'd be happy to return. The meatballs looked crazy good.  They only have one beer on tap, Peroni. Meh.  I think the menu is a bit overpriced but I bet the lease for that shopping area isn't cheap so what can you do, you know?"}
{"text":"Pizza has greatly improved since first visit.  Chocolate mousse bomb has really grown on me too.  The lamb meatball with mushroom gravy still the best thing there."}
{"text":"They have good thin crust pizzas.  Probably some of the best pizza I have had in this pizza wasteland of Ohio.  The place gets pretty packed but the service has been good for us.  Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food...best pizza in the area by a long shot!  Staff is friendly and accommodating. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I went to 3 Palms about say a month ago and I was very happy with the visit. It is a little but pricey but certainly worth the money. The kitchen was most interesting as it looked quite small and like the one you would have at home giving it a home vibe that made you subtle and comfortable with your surroundings. I was the weird one of the cohort and I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with Broccoli-cini stuff and some potatoes that were heavy on the oil but it worked very well. I also tried the pizza which was one of the best I have had in my short life. I would most definitely tell you to come give it a try and amount the quality yourself to memory. It will likely be memorable. I also got dessert at the front counter. They have multitudes of offerings including this chocolate coco bomb thing which I got for $6 which was a mousse ball like concoction with coffee addition covered in chocolate. They also had lemon wedges pastries, cannoli which another person in the party bought six and they wrapped them all for us and they had turtles and so much more. The pastries ranged from $4 to $8 but all the worth it. The menu is on this site I believe but the pizzas are good sized, not enough to feed 3 hungry folk but certainly two and they are around $11 to start. Give it a try, it has my blessings. Bring grandma from Sicily and she can give it either the nod of delight or the kiss of death."}
{"text":"I'm always craving this pizza! I would probably eat it every day if I could. I have tried other options like pasta and sandwiches, they were decent, but once you have the pizza, the other stuff is just ok. I've had so many of their pizzas and recommend them all. My favorite salad is the panzanella salad, so yummy with multi colored tomatoes, homemade croutons, and goat cheese(I think that was the cheese if I am recalling right). The desserts are good too except the tiramisu didn't have much taste one time.   * I am giving 4 stars only because on some occasions the pizza crust has come out a little too toasty. I understand working in a kitchen is hectic, but that burnt crust taste has made me sad a couple of times. Also some times the croutons in the panzanella salad are a little too big and make eating the salad uncomfortable at times. Other than that, those pizzas are too good to give anything lower than 4 stars"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience!  We had family visiting and everyone had great food & lots of fun. It was busy, but we didn't wait long. Pizza was amazing, fried artichokes were great, and the  prosecco sangria is a new favorite!  The gelato was creamy, and the tiramisu did not disappoint!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Italian sandwich was top notch. Excellent meats, good dressing, wonderful bread. I would come here for the sandwich. The pizza, eh, so so. I live the concept but the pizza didnt live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and choices of quality toppings...salads are fresh and a must try.. Great atmosphere and service and save room for some gelato and will be back soon.!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Pizza is excellent, fun desserts, family friendly and perfect for date night. Can be busy and loud, but overall love it!"}
{"text":"They tried but missed the mark. I wish the owner/chef would take advice from here and CLEAN THE OVEN! I understand how pizza ovens work but this was absurd. Some of my fingers actually turned black from the soot in the oven and almost every bite had a burnt taste to it.  Also the prices are really steep. I know it's Crocker Park and they jack the prices up everywhere but $50 to for 2 smaller, very thin pizzas during lunch isn't worth it.  I gave them 2 stars ONLY because the wait staff was awesome and super attentive.   As far as the taste of the pizza, it was meh. It wasn't anywhere near the quality and taste of Angelo's in Lakewood but wasn't bottom of the barrel like Cici's pizza either. Just okay.   It also wouldn't hurt to add in 1 or 2 options for kids since this is one of the few sit down places in Crocker that is kid friendly. Not counting my family, there were at least 4-5 other tables with children while we were there and I know from 1st hand experience that children don't like to stray away from traditional pizza."}
{"text":"The specials tonight were inspiring... Fresh Kale salad with craisins, buffalo mozzarella, toasted nuts and a light dressing... the entree homemade angel hair with a wonderful beet favor, yeah I know, not a beet fan either, but this was awesome, with the signature roast chicken, goat cheese, Porta bello mushroom, zucchini, and light olive oil. damn it was good.  #Foodiealert, #bestpasta, #allfresh"}
{"text":"this restaurant had the worst service i have ever experienced. I walked in with a friend around 2 or 3 and only one third the tables were used by customers. Nobody greeted us at the door so after a minute or two of standing there i had to find someone, he told me just to sit down wherever i wanted so we did. We sat there for over 20 minutes and a waiter didn't come to our table, even thought the table next to ours had people in it and their waiter saw what was going on, he didn't do anything, finally, after more than 20 minutes my friend asked the other parties waiter who our waiter was and he told us he would find out. At least 5 minutes later a girl came over and took our order, she was nice, the food took a long time to get there (we only ordered one pizza to share, two waters).   The food was good though."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed.  My friends had raved about this place for months and it didn't live up to their hype.  I felt the pizza was very under cooked.  Being a thin crust pizza cooked in handmade Italian brick oven- I was expecting crispier crust.   The ingredients on the pizza tasted good and were fresh though!  All in all, I've had better pizza."}
{"text":"Yikes, I was hoping months before it opened that this would be the pizza that saved my Italian craving as I grew up with an old country Italian grandma who owned 3 pizzarias. Twice I've been and now it's for sure, sorry guys you've failed epic time... Service wow it needs work, there's about the same amount of you then customers...where are you guys? Why aren't you on top of your minimum wage tips... If that's what you've gotta work for. Oil oil oil, my fungi pizza took a bath in oil and they brought them both to me. I got acne a day later hahaha! So not funny at the time a wtf moment, any whosher they ran out of pepperoni... Kid had to drive to acme to pick some up lol, ....I'd go back for the arugula salad and deserts dats about it. Cute rustic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love trying out new restaurants in Crocker Park and this one is a total hit!  The first thing I noticed when walking in was the open floor plan. You are able to see cooks preparing pizza in the giant wood-burning pizza oven which I think is really cool. I went in the wintertime, but it looks like they also had a nice patio which will be fun in the warmer months!  The second thing I noticed was how busy they were on a Tuesday night. To me, this is always a good sign. The restaurant was almost completely full at 7 pm! Despite the busy-ness, my service was fantastic - the bartender/server assigned to my table was attentive, sweet, and willing to explain all of the menu options to us!   I ended up opting for the Negroni cocktail to start, which was delicious! It was a nice, balanced cocktail that wasn't too sweet. We also ordered a cheese plate for our table and it was delicious. The plate contained: almonds, fig jam, fresh green apples, goat cheese, a creamy Gorgonzola (that I actually liked despite usually hating it!), fresh buffalo mozzarella, and a hard cheese that I am currently forgetting the name of! Yum!   For our entrees we opted for the Funghi pizza and I got a glass of Chardonnay to go along with it. The Funghi had a delicious carmelized onion base and was topped from crust to crust with TONS of mushrooms. The smoked mozzarella also brought the whole thing together. I highly recommend the pizza!  All in all, I will definitely be returning. The amazing staff, delicious food, and casual atmosphere is really nice. I hope to return in warmer months to check out their patio. I also heard the chef at this location frequently designs special menus for holidays and does multiple course meals paired with different Italian wines!"}
{"text":"We went there not knowing what to expect. The pizza we had was ok, nothing spectacular and a bit over priced for what you get. It was a lack luster experiance. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The overall appeariance is clean and inviting, a nice place to just chill. It's just the product itself that didn't match the higher price tag. A friend took her daughter to another of their locations and had a similar experiance. It was good but not really worth the higher price. It has the air of a yuppie, \"went there just to say I did\" feel from back in the day. Again the space itself and staff were great just the higher price for just ok food is what is keeping me from going back."}
{"text":"This place is a rustic family-style restaurant.  Great fresh pizzas and tasty appetizers.  The meatballs are succulent.  The desserts are heavenly with the perfect amount of sweetness.  The wines on the menu are tasty as well.  The wait staff are really nice and personable.  They provide attention and aren't eager to push out the door even when you're still there past closing time.  This is a great place to bring your family, a date, and co-workers.  I'll definitely be back to try the pasta and gelato.  Good things are happening here.  Make sure to come and give it a try...you'll be thankful for listening to my advice."}
{"text":"3 Palms has had 3 chances with me and I'm giving it a 2 star experience.    I really love the atmosphere here - it's such a cool looking venue with a great story behind the name.  I also really wanted to love it as my boyfriend and I love to eat out and especially to support local businesses, but I please read my comments below to understand my rating.    The first trip we made there was in December 2012.  We sat at the bar and our waiter (the bartender) acted as though we were a pain to wait on.  He wasn't very helpful, but as a past server I'm personally more lienent than normal on the staff.  My first comment to him was that I am severly allergic to nuts.  We ordered the meat and cheese boards for an appetizer and a pizza to split for our dinner.  The boards arrived with bread filled with nuts (walnuts I do believe).  Thankfully my boyfriend noticed and the waiter was unapologetic at the issue.  He seemed annoyed when I ask for some plain bread to enjoy instead with our cheese.  He later proceeded to fight with another young server who waiting on us at the bar and made her cry.  Needless to say the experience was overall unenjoyable.    Our second trip was on a Friday night.  After consulting the webpage I found it stated that their hours were open until 11pm.  Upon walking in the restaurant at 9:45, we were met by the manager who explained that while he \"could seat us if we wanted, they were actually closing in 15 minutes\".  We apologized and I did mention that they needed to update their information as 11pm was the online listed closing time.  He showed us that the \"closing time\" hadn't been added yet on their outside window.  He mentioned they were working on being changed to listed as 10pm.  He apologized profusely and offered us dessert on him the next night.  We thought it a kind offer though the whole experience felt a little off.    Tonight was my third and final time to give the restaurant a chance, unless they are able to make some changes in the future.  The facebook page noted that tonight's hours were that they were open until 10pm.  My boyfriend and I walked in at around 8pm.  Our server was polite and service was good.  We ate our half salads and pizzas and felt a bit rushed at the end.  My guess was that she was ending her shift and just trying to get out of there.  At 9:20, she approached our table and let us know that the manager wanted to let everyone know that though the restaurant officially closed at 9pm..  I asked her then why the facebook page would let us know that they were open until 10pm when their actual hours were 9pm.  She informed us they were in the process of updating their hours  Here we go again I thought!!!    To me, there is no easier way to convey to your customers your actual hours of business than through social media.  I guess it's my fault that I expected them to have updated hours listed when this isn't their first rodeo.  I'm really sad to see this and I'm tired of feeling yanked around in my experience when I am looking for a nice meal!  All this is why I've chosen to give 3 Palms 2 stars until they can hopefully get their act together.    Thanks for reading!!"}
{"text":"This visit was a bummer.  My husband loves pizza, so we eat plenty of it.  This will not be on the go-to pizza place list.  We got the Italian Chopped Salad, the bread plate, and a pizza.  The salad and bread were good.  (We didn't know we were getting a mushroom bread and a cranberry bread which came as a surprise, but they were very tasty.)  The pizza was a huge disappointment.  It tasted burnt.  Is this how neopolitan pizza is supposed to taste?  There was very little flavor.  The service was inconsistent.  Oh, and the pizza was overpriced....$16 for a bland pizza."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and each time the service was terrible. They seem to always be out of the beer you want as well. My kids do not like the pizza at all and neither does my husband and he has tried several. I do like the meatballs but the salads are also pretty bland."}
{"text":"Fantastic. City-quality food in the suburbs. Pizzas are just so yummy (the basil on the Margherita gets all crispy on top and is just so good!!). The panzanella is full of gorgeous grape tomatoes and a beautiful goat cheese. The roast organic chicken is perfect for anyone who can't eat pizza. Really delicious.   Service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Pizza - A,  Salads - A, Service - A, NOISE level, so you can talk to your friends - F Great place to eat - but don't plan to have a heart-to-heart with anyone.  I have 20/20 hearing, but this place resonates with happy, noisy patrons.  Impossible to hear those at your own table - unless it is not crowded.  BUT, the Pesto Meatballs are NOT to be missed, as well as any of the pizzas.  DELISH!! (and I understand that their bakery is TOPS, although I did not partake.)"}
{"text":"While out driving with friends we stopped in at 3 Palms Pizzeria and Bakery and Boy oh Boy! What a Great surprised was in store for us. As you enter your greeted with a smiling hostess as it should be where ever you go and taken directly to our table offered a drink of our choice and given a menu to glance over. In the distance behind the counter you can view the folks making Italian breads, along with cup cakes, oat meal cookies ( always my favorite ) and oh lala, gelato.. but not your run of the mill gelato but gelato that brings your taste buds back to life, gelato that reminds you of that trip your dreamed about while cruising the canals in Venice Italy..  Yep, that gelato.. They offer you blue berry, cherry, chocolate and 16 other flavors..  Now we each ordered our very own pizza after surveying all the various pizza's that they had to offer I decided on the Polpettina, with sliced meatballs, San Marzono tomato's, fresh Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese, and basil and I asked for some garlic to be sprinkled on it as well. Now these pizza's were not just tossed into the oven and bot-a-bing 7 minutes later you have a oven cooked burned to a crisp pizza, but at 3Palms they have an Italian wood burning oven that makes their pizza`s taste fantastic.. Momma Mia! would be the Best way to describe their pizza's and this restaurant and their service.  After sitting around wondering where to venture out to next I asked for a cup of coffee that I could smell brewing from the next table over. This has to be the Best cup of Joe that I have tasted in years..   Bonjour!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem has the best meatballs I've ever had in my entire Life! I've walked by tons of times but never stopped in. I'm so glad I did! The owner was fantastic and our waitress bird was great. The gelato was amazing! They make all the pasta fresh in house and it was amazing. Great restaurant! Ten out of ten, would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm going to give 3 Palms a 4 Star review because they deserve it. The pizza is slammin' and let's be honest, the ingredients are fresh and delicious. The meatball, while not piping hot, was one of the best I've had in quite some time. I actually did not check the rating here before I came and to be honest, it deserves to be a bit higher. Beer tap selection is very weak, with only 3 taps, but the local Sibling Revelry Sublime is a great summertime treat. The Diavola Pizza was great but I could've done without the meat and went with traditional Margherita. If you like to dip, ask for a side of the extra pizza sauce- you won't regret how good that sauce is.  If you are in Crocker Park and you are looking for a great pizza place with fresh ingredients, this is a great spot. Cheers!"}
{"text":"good change of pace in Hudson b/c we need more options.  meals will not fill you up but meals are very tasty.  I love it during lunch in the summer when the doors are open or you eat outside."}
{"text":"I know I shouldn't rate this place upon one favorite food but OMG BLUEBERRY LAVENDER GELATO!!!  So VERY DELICIOUS. The other gelato flavors are decent, but this is a great example of what gelato should taste like.   Their pizzas are deliciously Italian as well - thin crust and freshly baked.  GELATO!"}
{"text":"While walking through Crocker we couldn't decide where to go for my eight year olds birthday! We decided on 3 palms, by what kid doesn't like pizza! Oh man were we not disappointed.  We were immediately greeted by a friendly face, service was fast and polite, and the food was excellent (including the gelato!)! We are so happy we chose to support this awesome establishment!"}
{"text":"We ended up ordering two pizzas; a margarita pizza and a Blanca y verde pizza! One with red sauce the other with white sauce, and it was a good choice. The crust and dough was cooked to perfection. My favorite was the Blanca y Verde pizza. It had a lot of spinach, but when you got the chunk of cheese it was perfect! We definitely ended the meal at the bakery corner... the cookie is an easy pass, the lemon bar was really good. The chocolate brownie was more of a bittersweet chocolate, so I found I liked it the day after much better. Lastly the hazelnut mouse tart was ok, but the crust was different than expected (not bad, just different). The service was quick, and the emplacement filled up fast. Loved the feel of the place! Great ambience."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  The Funghi pizza was amazing, the baby kale salad was great and the local gelato was wonderful (highly suggest the dark chocolate sorbet with anise which is dairy free).  But the true 5 stars go to Byrd.  She was AMAZING.  Never missed a beat and her personality shined effortlessly with no sight of overbearance.  A smooth server with mad hospitality skills.  5 stars the whole way!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin, this restaurant is one of my favorites in Hudson. They have a nice, comfortable patio along with an rustic, yet romantic dining room.   I frequent this place probably once a month with my boyfriend. We love the crispy fried artichoke appetizer (it is absolutely delicious)! I cannot go here without getting the Panzanella Salad (it is a bread salad, as a panzanella salad should be, so do not expect it to have lettuce). We like to split the Diavola pizza with the house pickled banana peppers.   The service is always wonderful, the kitchen is always a little slow so would not recommend if you are in a hurry. The food is definitely worth the wait though!  We went here last night and ate on the patio and our waitress was wonderful and accommodating.   They also have a dessert section at the front of the restaurant with fresh cookies, cakes and gelato. Yes, I have tried a few of all of them and yes, they are all delicious.   Lastly, if you are a martini drinker you know that some places do it better than others. Let me tell you, 3 Palms knows how to make a martini. Last night was a work night so I didn't get one but when I'm here on Saturdays their dirty martini with blue-cheese olives is one of the best out there so props to the bartenders!   This is the restaurant I most recommend to my customers at work when they're looking for a nice place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary."}
{"text":"They have some mean pizzas. Definitely try the chicken turkey meatballs pizza. Worth the money. And the cheese platter is also delicious. Also I find the place value for money. I would love to try there bakery section. It looked delicious."}
{"text":"The pizza was just okay.  It wasn't bad but nothing super special either. I was expecting much more as their sister restaurants are amazing.  I would go back for an average lunch or dinner if it wasn't so pricey.  Overpriced for what we got.  What saved our experience was our server, she was friendly and funny."}
{"text":"We loved three palms the last time we visited which was a few months ago. On this visit, we sat on the patio which was very nice and there was live music in the park across the street. The ambience was excellent. However, the food was disappointing. We had the lamb mint meatballs which was tasty but it came out cold. We had a pizza which again came out on the colder side as well. Perhaps it was because we were sitting on the patio, but I don't think that is an excuse to serve food that is not hot. The service was good. One note though. We were notified by text message when our table was ready after coming into the restaurant to put our names down and when we arrived to the restaurant, we were made to wait again and were told that because we did not make it to the restaurant within 10 minutes of the text message, that we would be bumped . It would be appropriate and frankly professional if they had told us that when we put our names down in the first place."}
{"text":"As always... amazing. Chopped salad is a must. Pizza came out hot and delicious; my husband got the special pizza of the month and couldn't stop raving about it. Our server was superb and helpful. This is our favorite pizza place. The 45 minute wait was worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food, love the atmosphere , owner came out and mingled with his customers, priced on point, see you soon !"}
{"text":"Can't believe I'm only giving this place a Two Star rating but I am. I get that they've only been open a week but with at least one other restaurant you'd think they'd have this down pat. That's a negative. The drinks were good. The salad and bread plate were very good but the pizza was sub par. The sauce seemed like nothing more than crushed, unseasoned tomatoes at best. I am usually very generous with my reviews but I cannot be this time. Sorry 3 Palms but don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Recently visited the place for a casual dinning !! I really enjoyed the rustic setting , excellent food and wines and a great service !! A special thanks to Trisha who made the evening a very enjoyable one for me and my guest !! Will definately recommend this place for the amazing selections of gourmet pizzas !! Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Just got Slapped Silly by 3 firm Palms! Meatball appetizer, shoulda known I was gonna regret it when it was singular. Was hoping for a monster ball but was below average size, tho the pesto sauce was pretty good & chunky. Plus ball was kinda dry (as expected w/ poultry). Ricotta was mild n creamy. Overall $8 was about 2 Palms too much!!  Caprese salad was tasty enough- liked the 2 varieties of tomatoes. Just not sufficiently garnished. Stingy with the mozzarella, glaze & basil.  Portion was more of a half-size tho, but price was not at $12.  Margarita pie was dry, very miserly w/ the cheese, & basil was even a lil crispy. Sorta typical but again I felt like a Palm was in my pocket taking $13 for a medium skinny pizza.  Wanted to try the Gelato but I was all Palmed out.  Place was trendy upscale and service was superb.  Just don't bring your appetite with you."}
{"text":"Traditional meatball plate wii the mushroom sauce--to die for! Had the pizza with goat cheese, prosciutto and added mushrooms. What an amazing crisp and chewy crust. So good. Prices were about average for wood fired pizza this good."}
{"text":"2nd visit in about 2 weeks because we couldn't stay away. This time we had a meatball appetizer in addition to the artichoke app. Fantastic again. Same pizzas for us as last time. Brought our daughter this time. She's partial to eating nothing but chicken tenders and 'regular' pizza but she had an American style pizza & shared the meatball. I asked her how it was. \"Oh! Really good!\" Exceptional praise from her.  Mostly, I had to write another review because of our server. This time we had Scott. These are possibly the nicest and best servers we've had anywhere, EVER! I'm not sure why other restaurants can't find people like this. If the food wasn't already the best around, we'd go just to hang out with the servers."}
{"text":"Truth: I haven't eaten here and I won't ever eat here.  I watched the manager shred a waiter at another establishment (not related to his own restaurant in any way) for something that the server could not control, and if he treats other servers like that, well, it's obvious he would treat his own staff that way. The kicker: as I'm seated next to the manager and he's ripping the server a new one, he looks over at my table, introduces himself, hands out his business card, and says to come eat there. He was so incredibly rude and made such a scene over the time it takes the kitchen to make breakfast, yet expects me to come eat at his place? Haha nice try, you'll never get a dollar from me."}
{"text":"It was our first time and we will definitely be back!!! The Puttanesca pizza was great and the beers were cold. The owner was a down to earth guy and very knowledgeable. If you want authentic Neapolitan pizza please try 3 Palms Pizza at Crocker Park a try!!!"}
{"text":"Love 3 palms!  Always great pizza and the salads are closer to a 4/5 star dining experience. Decadent desserts and a friendly and accommodating staff. Always busy on the weekends so plan accordingly. Carry out is always great."}
{"text":"We were in Crocker Park for shopping and decided to try this place. The vibe and atmosphere was very relaxing. We had the meatball appetizer, it was very good! Pizza was great, exactly like wood fired should be. We'll definitely stop again the next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great as was the service. I didn't care for the meatballs, too much bread filling lacked flavor, and the texture was mushy vs tender."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's so nice to have a fresh, non-chain food option in Crocker Park.  I've been here several times and tried most of the menu at this point. The salads are all amazing!  The meatballs are really good too and who doesn't love wood-fire pizza?  I've had their gelato, cannoli and a few other desserts - all were fresh and very reasonably priced.  The service has always been great and they have a nice patio. I noticed they have a happy hour at the bar but I haven't tried that yet. . . . . I will soon!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite pizza spot to go to when in town. The food is unparalleled and has super original flavors. Great spot to go to with family or just go hang out with friends. Great wine list too!Not too pricey and easy to get to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must go to if in the area! Quaint town square, warmly rustic feel in the dining area and some of best pizza we've had! Didn't get to the desserts but those appeared heavenly! Appetizers will be had when we visit next. Try this place! It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"3 Palms serves \"gourmet\" pizza. This is not Philly or NY style pizza here. We ordered the Frutti Di Mare pizza (mussels, shrimp, calamari) and the Margherita pizza (tomato, mozzarella, basil). They were both okay. Lots of seafood on the Frutti Di Mare, so that was good, and the Margaherita had very fresh ingredients, but both pizzas were somehow lacking for us. Not sure if it was the sauce (which was average) or the crust (which was average), but we left feeling like it was \"just okay\".   The decor was really nice, it appeared clean, and our server was attentive.   I can see how someone who likes \"gourmet\" pizza might like this place. But I guess my husband and I are just old school, and like traditional Philly/NY style pizza (with the thin crispy edge crust but still \"foldable\", the spicy oregano sauce and the mountains of gooey cheese falling everywhere and burning your fingers and tongue). Aaaaaahhhhh ...... That's the good stuff.    Anyway, I guess this place is too \"California\" for us. We'll stick to Farinacci's around the corner. They've got some good East Coast style pizza there!  :)"}
{"text":"Five star food. The meatballs are flavorful and light. The pizza crust consistently great. Delicious sauce and toppings. Great salad selection. Overall, very high quality meals every time! Friendly staff and a well organized greeting experience.   Service consistency is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. We felt a bit forgotten on 2/3 recent visits with servers disappearing for long periods of time. The most recent visit we asked for any food to be brought out whenever ready (to help with kids) but the request didn't help with timing in the end. It's a busy place and I'm sure they are doing their best, but it can make for a little more frustrating experience than it is worth."}
{"text":"3 Palms has such a rustic and charming atmosphere that will keep you coming back. I would recommend going for lunch with a business partner or friend to split a pizza and get an individual salad. I found one pizza to be too filling for lunch and too much to finish in one sitting, but the pizza was leftover heaven when I had it again for dinner that same day!"}
{"text":"I love Three Palms for its fresh ingredients, tasty menu and casual but classy atmosphere. We've been to the restaurant at least 5 or 6 times and have always had a great experience.   Some of my favorite menu items are the caprese salad, the lamb meatball appetizer with pesto, and of course, the any of wood fired pizzas. I'd also recommend getting dessert. There is a pastry chef there who I've seen prepare her menu from scratch as if it was made at home.   Lastly, 3 Palms has great ambiance. The interior has Pinterest-inspired decor and the patio includes a brick fireplace - it's probably the best one in town."}
{"text":"Four easy bullet points.  -NOT good for kids - no kids menu, no kid food -EXPENSIVE & AVERAGE burnt flatbread pizza -great service  -pretty chill atmosphere   We were looking for a nice kid-friendly sit down place in Crocker Park on a Sunday afternoon and didn't find it here. It's okay, Crocker Park isn't a kiddie place, I understand, but like, it's not hard to be a restaurant that is okay for kids. Buy some chicken nuggets, make a tiny kid sized pizza, pick up some cheap crayons and print off some paper kid menus, I don't know. Maybe it is more difficult than I think? Anyway, that's not my only problem with 3 Palms, and I'd still give them 2 stars if it was just my bf and I lunching there.   The atmosphere is really nice with a wooden-stoney type of feel. There's a chandelier in the middle, big windows with a lot of light - it's just nice. Our waitress was really great and attentive also! Water was never below half, she answered all of questions about the menu, and was just generally a pleasant person.   We didn't order any appetizers- just pizza. It was honestly $15 for an average size specialty pizza that my bf and I ate in one sitting, and like $12 for a normal cheese/pepperoni pizza. It was like a really thin flatbread pizza that was just average in taste. It was kinda burnt on the bottom. It's not anything to write home about and I wasn't impressed at all. It was overpriced, I honestly would've just been happier going to Domino's, gotten more and better pizza for a fraction of the cost and really regretted not doing that.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and spent like $30 for two thin unsatisfying pizzas. :("}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had. Crust was flimsy, flavorless, saturated  and soggy. Gross."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Ordered a half Caesar and added shrimp. Salad was fresh, but underdressed and disappointed they used finely shredded Parmesan cheese. Made it weird. And no croutons. Shrimp was really delicious, buy you get two for $9. My meal was $20 before tip, and I left hungry and disappointed. Service was fine, but the wait staff seemed busy and rushed."}
{"text":"3 Palms Pizzeria & Bakery  Check out more reviews @Cleveland Bites on Facebook!  Tonight me and my wife went on an excursion to 3 Palms Pizzeria & Bakery in Hudson Square. I've seen this place many times while eating at One Red Door or Flip Side, but honestly when I go out Pizza is never high on my list. I don't see it as a date type place, but more of a pick up and go home for some Netflix binging. Also I hate ordering a single pizza at a restaurant because I only have one option to try. I like to order food to share and try multiple things. I reserve pizza out for large groups and that's it, but tonight I was craving Pizza! I looked into this place and was thoroughly  happy to find it served small size pizzas. Not quite personal not quite medium sized. We showed up at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night and wouldn't you know it an hour wait for 2. At least they have the system to send you a text when you're on deck and there's plenty of fun shops to check out in Hudson.  It's got a nice vibe to it. A large open area for dining with a very minimal rustic feel. The music and ambient noise keeps to a decent level so you don't have to quite shout to hold a conversation. Another thing my wife noticed was the varied ages of the tables. People with kids, older people, teenagers with friends, and 20 something hipster foodies like ourselves ;). We waited quite a while for our waitress to show up and had our entire order made up by the time she got there. It wasn't an obnoxious amount of time, but enough to make a note of. They have a good bar selection, but also have a number of non-alcoholic options as well including a personal favorite, Kombucha, we ordered a mango cayenne version. The drinks came out speedily and the Kombucha was nice and chilled. For an app they had a large selection of charcuteries, but it seemed the big push was the meatballs. They let you choose a meatball paired with a source of your choice and served it with ciabatta bread and ricotta which is all made in house. We decided on rating the appetizer by ordering a traditional meatball with the classic sauce. The meatball was the size of a baseball and it was pretty good. It didn't blow me away, but I was glad they executed this Italian standard very well. All the elements on the plate were great and stood on their own, but the star was the sauce. The trick to knowing good Italian sauce is if you can eat it with a fork and no spoons were needed here. Very satisfied with the appetizer. Now on to the pizza, which is of course the star of the menu. I will warn however that other than salads and pizza the rest of the menu options are VERY limited. A few sandwiches and 2 entrees. I guess they just want us to stick to the pizza? Less stress of the kitchen too. Food came out quick, but I'm glad they didn't try and shove pizza on the table while we were eating our app. I hate that! Pizza came out still bubbling from the oven and my first bite was HOT! I ordered the 'Diavola : tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, spicy salami, and chili oil' I always go for a spicier option. My wife got the 'Funghi : a sweeter sauce, wild mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. The pizzas are a good size. Too big to eat all by yourself, but not big enough IMHO to share. The price range on the pies is actually rather decent so I say each person get a pie and share around! The pizza is cooked in a wood fire oven and come out thin and crispy, but pliable enough to fold and not break. I going to use a little rubric to rank this pizza: Sauce - loved the tangy tomato sauce on my pie. My wife's sweeter sauce for the mushroom pie complimented well too! Toppings - fresh and varied. I liked the many options available here. Cheese - didn't wow me, but it had nice stretch and taste to it. Crust - thin and crispy just the way I like it. The further out you go the crispier it gets. Also the pizza bones (outer crusts) were totally edible which is a highlight for me. Pizza was fantastic! We also got dessert which they have a huge bakery and large gelato selection to choose from, but what Italian place shouldn't be judged by its Tiramisu? My wife and I split a slice and each got plenty of bites out of it. I have to admit, good not great. It was perfectly fine, but I like my dessert to knock my socks off for real! I want it to blow my mind and not just be fine. I might get some gelato next time and see how that goes.  All in all I think it's safe to say I found a pizza place to enter my rotation for a night on the town! Just be warned, it's not a pick up and go home kind of place. I mean I'm not saying that's not available I didn't ask, but you'll be missing out on the experience. Also do not go here expecting a typical pizza. It's not a 'pizza' place it's a Neapolitan pie restaurant. Bill for 2 with waters, Kombucha, appetizer, 2 pizzas, and dessert was around $50.   Atmosphere - *** Price - *** Quality - ***** Taste - **** Service - ***"}
{"text":"I had been here right when it opened a few years ago and was disappointed how mediocre the pizzas were for being baked \"brick oven\". However, I went the other night and was pleased that they have tremendously improved! We ordered the Margherita D.O.P with mushrooms added, and the Mushroom pizza, and both were delicious. The mushroom pizza had a very smokey flavor that was a bit much after a slice however.   The atmosphere alone is a reason to make this a dinner spot at least once, they can open the wall windows to allow everyone to enjoy the warm weather, and the over all decor is beautiful. People can sit at the bar and watch sports, or you can enjoy a dinner with a large group in the dining area, regardless a great spot to try out at least once :)"}
{"text":"Here with family...the pizzas are great...especially the crust.  If you like thin crispy this is the place.  Service was just okay, but pizza warrants 5 stars.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food, bakery, and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"We stopped by recommendation of a friend and found this gem to be delicious! We started with the meatball appetizer (traditional marinara) and the bread. Generous portions for 3 of us but we didn't leave a crumb! We got 2 pizzas and both were delicious. If your looking for saucy, cheesy pizza, this may not be for you...but if you are looking for something more authentic than definitely give it a try.  And, we had great service to boot while we enjoyed sitting in the patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today for the first time. The decor is rustic chic. Very nice. They have a nice selection of gelato, baked goods and fresh breads. Service was great  our waitress catered to our needs. We ordered 3 different meatballs for our starters, veggie, lamb and traditional. They were cooked perfectly and the sauces were a perfect match. The ceaser salad came with fresh white anchovies which are awesome and is a nice change from the normal canned ones you get every where else. I ordered the Bianco pizza it was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I have is that it did not have any flavor. We also got the beans and greens and they were good. Over all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Used to love this restaurant.  Last couple of visits disappointing.  Caprese salad was average.  The chicken avocado sandwich was missing the avocado.  Waitress was nice but never came by to refill water.  Skimpy toppings on the pizza.  Was much better a couple years ago.  Wonder if under new management."}
{"text":"Came in with a large group from work.  We ordered several appetizers; meatballs, fried artichoke, roasted peppers, antipasto and shrimp scampi.  All were quite good with the meatballs being the best, moist, tender and served with a chunky, flavorful sauce.   We also split several pizzas. I had the Margherita DOC which was very good. The mozzarella was light and full of flavor. It has just the right amount of sauce and a good char. I also managed to grab a slice of the arrabbiata which had a spicy and delicious hot salami topping.  Only negative was the service was a bit slow and the place is very loud.  All in all it was a very good meal."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the low ratings for this place. We walked into a beautiful room with a fabulous smell hanging in the air. It was an empty room, but we were eating a VERY late lunch. The staff was equally inviting. The problem was the food.   The Caesar Salad looked great and to their credit, anchovies were included, but the top was dusted with what tasted liked canned Parmesan cheese. After one bite of the pizza, my wife and I both looked at each other with a puzzled expression. \"What is that taste?\" Both of us were capturing a bitter/chemical flavor in the crust. Why the crust? We both tasted each element of the pie, one piece at a time. Because we ordered the Rapini, we both thought the bitter Broccoli Rabe was the culprit. We were wrong. The problem was different. Sausage? No. Mozzarella? No. Crust? Bingo!  But what could be the problem with the crust?  Unless the wood fired oven was fuel generated and imbedding a chemical scent to the dough, that did not make sense and we were assured wood was used. We're still confused.   This was an unfortunate experience. The server was very accommodating and apologetic. We wonder if the reason for low Yelp numbers is due to this inexplicable bitterness."}
{"text":"Nice space with a good ambiance. Not too noisy.  They have no draft beer - which they really should - but a decent bottled selection. Chilled glasses, which is always nice.  The meatball appetizers seem to be a feature here and with good reason. We had the turkey/chicken meatball with mushroom gravy. The gravy was excellent and the meatball moist and well seasoned.   3 Palms salad is just OK. Probably needs another ingredient. As is, it's a little unfulfilling. I might go for a different salad on the next visit, such as the chopped Italian.  Margherita and Formaggio Di Capra pizzas above average. Good crust, well cooked. I liked both of them.  Our server was great - polite, not intrusive but there when we needed her.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"I love this place. The location is great with a Classy dining room and friendly prompt service. I have yet to order something off of the menu I disliked. Definitely worth a stop out there for dinner and drinks.  We can't wait for our next date night"}
{"text":"I have passed by this restaurant many times on the way through First and Main so I finally stopped for lunch... I'm SO glad I did!  The inside of the restaurant is GORGEOUS!  The open pizza kitchen with exposed brick, the polished concrete bar, the concrete floors, natural materials abound, rustic lighting and storage was classy and comfortable.  The staff was accommodating and friendly.  I was impressed...  The wine list is full of interesting choices - many of which I have never had.  There is a bakery inside the restaurant that bakes fresh bread daily - the available selections are written on a chalkboard inside the front door.   I had the Arugula Salad which was huge and tasty with fresh grated Italian cheese.  The salad was served with lemon wedges in lieu of dressing... I loved it!  The pizzas are thin crusted with fresh ingedients.  Sauces feature San Marzano Tomatoes.  I ordered the Bianca and Verde pizza with extra cheese... it was as pretty as it was delicious!  Overall it was a great experience - I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a weeknight date and I think we have found one of our new favorite places. The atmosphere was casual and rustic. The food was delicious. We ordered the crispy artichokes as an appetizer and were not disappointed! I'm still thinking about those artichokes the next day.   We also ordered 2 pizzas, the margherita and the fungi. We both cleaned our plates and sadly had no leftovers. After all of that pizza we didn't have room for dessert but we will be back with our kids in the future to pick out treats from the huge selection of bakery sweets and gelato."}
{"text":"I enjoy 3 Palms. They have a decent selection, fresh toppings, yummy salad, etc.and I like the rustic, modern, open feel of the restaurant. I wouldn't say it is absolutely amazing-must frequent type place but their pizza is nice for a lighter/ more fresh option than your typical pizza joint and they do offer gluten free crust. However, I feel like I am eating all crust and they sometimes skimp on the toppings and a lot of the times it is like eating charcoal from the burned edges."}
{"text":"I should have known to order a pizza at a pizza joint instead of a salad ! I got the 3 palms salad with shrimp and while it was ok my in laws for the margherita pizza ! It was delicious. There crust is amazing.   The atmosphere is cool as well with wooden picnic tables and windows that open up to the outside ! Definitely would go back to try another pizza !   When you go to a place that has a a wood burning pizza oven just make sure you ordered the pizza and not a salad.   You also may want to save room for dessert ! We were stuffed and couldn't for it in !!!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the limoncello iced tea and the panzanella salad. Great service and the perfect location. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice service, horrible beer prices. Paid $8 for a bottle of Southern Tier 2XMAS. Not a tall, not a pint, just a little 12oz bottle. Absolute. Rip. Off. You can walk up to Kepners and get a tall Christmas Ale draft (22oz) for the same price.   Stick to pizza and perhaps wine until they decide to stop beer price-gouging."}
{"text":"Service is always good. Atmosphere is good. Pizza is OK. Bakery is better than most. But you have to try theirs: The Meatball Plates appetizer.  Specifically Grass Fed Lamb meatballs wild Mushroom Gravy(wild mushrooms, parmesan cheese and cream). Even my picky about lamb and meatballs wife said they are good. I usually don't even want anything else."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Love the atmosphere.  Love the food.  Great modern design.  Wonderful dining room.  Only negative is the entry.  Patrons waiting for a table are stuck with patrons for the counter take out bakery.  It's gets crowded and congested.  We visited on a recent Sunday, and we didn't wait at all.  Their menu consists mainly of Neapolitan pizzas, but offers sandwiches, and even a weekend brunch until 2pm.  Our server didn't seem to know the menu too well.  I'd hope that they do employee tastings as everything is new to us, and we'd really like some great suggestions.  I made an idiot choice with the Polpettina ($14) pizza.  It had sliced meatballs that were fantastic, but the rest of the pie's flavor lacked.  The best was my wife's selection of the Confettura Di Fiche ($12) pizza--Fig and balsamic vinegar jam--that's key.  That gave the pizza the perfect sweet taste, mixed with a perfect crust.  It was a great pizza for fancy pizza.  Started off with the Baked Bread Plate ($4).  It was good, but they really skimped on the balsamic vinegar.  They just spotted it on the plate, and failed to give you a dipping dish.  Next time I'll ask for the balsamic vinegar on the side.  We really liked that you could get breads and desserts to go.  Their cookies were huge, packed with chocolate chips and just fantastic.  Hope they improve and keep up the great work.  Loved that they had a team of bus service.  You weren't left with dirty plates on the table because if another server saw them on your table, they just grabbed them.  Just a shame their customers can't park a car to save their life.  Get a window seat and you'll see what I mean.  Locally, the only other place I've seen with pizzas like this was Bar Cento downtown on W25th. Sadly, I found those to be too greasy, here 3 Palms delivered the perfect Neopolitan pie."}
{"text":"Great thin crust oven fired pizza at affordable prices. It's a very casual atmosphere and plenty of street parking all around.  The cocktail menu is shared with One Red Door and Flip Side. It's decently executed for a place that focuses on the food rather than the drinks.  Most creatively, it's the only place I know brave enough to put a ghetto Manhattan on the menu but you can also go the Peroni route if cocktails aren't your thing."}
{"text":"Super awesome brick oven fired pizzas excellent atmosphere + A level service - The only drawback is their limited menu love their pasta wish they did more. Otherwise great night out ^^^^^  This only applies to the hudson location, I've been to the new Westlake location several times and it no where near as good. Their service is semi rude^^^ Food is not even close to the hudson spot. Stay away."}
{"text":"Visited 3 Palms in Hudson for lunch recently and had a great experience. The pizza has a very, very thin crust and all of the toppings were fresh tasting and the pizza was delivered HOT to the table. We chose the Puttanesca pizza that comes with tomato sauce, evoo, fresh mozzarella, anchovies, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. We also got half salads that were also fresh and delicious. Also of note was the service which was fast, friendly, and professional. I drink a lot of water and the server kept up, never letting my glass get empty. The interior is modern yet welcoming. One important note is that the restaurant is very lively (noisy), so if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing place, you might want to consider other places.  They also have excellent baked goods made in house. Stop by 3 Palms, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"The pizza seems to be more \"authentic\" Italian style, rather than big-store style. I find it delicious, but a couple of my family members don't like that the slices \"flop\" rather than stay rigid. Despite that, it's a nice place with a good atmosphere. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Trendy but not tasty. My pizza is usually soggy. Always disappointed. Service is okay."}
{"text":"Very slow service despite the restaurant being nearly empty. Ordered two pizzas on the advice from the waiter; the Margherita D.O.P. (which is more expensive than the traditional Margherita as it substitutes buffalo mozzarella for regular mozzarella) and the Polpettina. Neither pizza was particularly special, which translates to price exceeding value.   There are better options a few steps away!"}
{"text":"Okay,  it takes QUITE a bit to really impress me when it comes to pizza. Not because I'm an aficionado or because I've spent half my life in Italy/NY/Chicago from where apparently all pizza-G-ds hail. It takes quite a bit to really impress me with pizza because....well, it's fucking pizza. Come on. Not that exciting.  Clearly, something has been missing from my world. Now, I'm not saying that my mind was blown by the pizza. Or even that I'd make a trip to Hudson SPECIFICALLY for this pizza, but it was really damn good. I've said it a million times in my reviews: If you're going to do simple food, you better be certain that every ingredient and preparation is spot on.  3 Palms succeeded where other simple food places have failed (I'm looking at you, Pandora's Cupcakes and Melt). The arugula salad was crisp, clean, and not decorated with a bunch of bullshit ingredients so they could charge twice the price with half the class. It was perfect. Not a single discolored, ripped, or mottled piece. The pizza, the Bianca and Verde,  was splendid. The same crisp arugula, creamy ricotta, a flavorful but not overpowering garlic sauce, and since we added chicken, mounds of delightfully moist rotisserie chicken.   The food was fantastic. But. That's not why they earned 5 stars. They earned 5 stars because solid food was backed up by an unbelievable wait-staff and one of the best Manhattans I've had in a VERY long time. Basil Hayden is officially my new favorite bourbon.  The waiters (all of ours were male) were phenomenal, attentive, but not intrusive. Glasses were refilled, food came out at an appropriate pace, and samples of all of their gelato flavors were unexpectedly and happily delivered to us. The manager chatted with us like we were the main event of the night. And after an incredibly long day, the kindness and attentiveness that they gave us, was unbelievably refreshing and welcome.   And. To the gorgeous, red-bearded chef who hugged me even though I was clearly out of my mind and not entirely sober....thank you. The pizza was good; the hug was even better."}
{"text":"This was my first trip there because I am not from the area but I must say I wish I lived closer. I had a good meal at a fair price and great service. Pizza there is awesome and I did not mind the wait because there was a wonderful area of shops to walk around as we waited.  The hostess did a great job letting us know how long it would be and they even take your phone number to text you when your table is ready. I will go back next time I'm in town for sure."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim one night for a casual, but celebratory, dinner, and had our five-year-old. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu despite having just opened. The pizza, appetizer but shareable size, was SO GOOD!  Also pretty fun that they had a gelato bar.   Definitely can't wait to go back soon. We lack \"local\" dine-in pizza spots, so this was a big hit."}
{"text":"We started with the Meatball appetizer: traditional with marinara. Then we each ordered our own pizza. The Rapini which was very delicious and unique taste and  coming from a Chicago pizza snob. Not at all like my hometown but definitely coming back.  Our teenage son ordered the American Style Pizza and almost finished it!  My husband had the Bianco and Verde Pizza and enjoyed it as well. Owner even stopped at our table to ensure our satisfaction. Great service.  Definite return."}
{"text":"This place does not stand a chance.  The pizza is way to expensive for the size you get.  Plus I paid 8 bucks for a craft draft beer.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced; mediocre food.  Wasn't impressed by the pizza at all.  Salad was ridiculously overpriced. Cool atmosphere; not interested in going back.  Wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars, but there were just too many little things that prevented me from doing so.  It starts as soon as you try to enter the restaurant.  I say \"try\" because the entrance is not clearly marked.  Perhaps a small sign saying \"Benevenuti/Welcome\" should be posted on the entrance as we weren't the only ones trying to figure out how to enter the restaurant.  The inside is nicely decorated and the staff was very friendly.  We started with drinks (they have a very nice selection of wines and cocktails).  Then we had the hot pepper appetizer.  They came out of the pizza oven nice as charred...but no sauce or anything else on the plate.  Likewise, they didnt take the seeds out of the peppers.  They tasted good, but for the price, it just wasn't a finished dish.  The pizza was excellent with a thin, crispy, crust.  The pizza is made in the traditional way (which I prefer) and they have an interesting selection of pizzas to try.    Our waitress told us that all the desserts are made fresh in-house.  So we tried the cannoli.  Well, it may have been homemade, but it was filled ahead of time and so the shell was soggy.  Sigh....if only my Nonna were still alive, her homemade cannoli were incredible.  For the price, I just cannot recommend this place.  I would like to, since the service was good and the kitchen has a lot of potential.  If they would pay more attention to the details, they could easily get a 3 or 4 star review."}
{"text":"Best pizza in northeast Ohio! Along with great appetizers, and desserts. Would recommend to anyone traveling to this area! So good!"}
{"text":"So 3 Palms is a wood fired pizzeria and bakery.  Very cool decor, casual atmosphere.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our waitress Trisha was perfect, knowledgeable of the menu, friendly and on it but not overbearing.    All pizzas are 12 inches so we ordered 1 for the kids (the American which is just cheese and not 'fancy') and one for us.  We had the  Polpettina, which was sliced sausage, basil, and mozzarella slices.  To die for.    You have to check out the desserts: cannoli, gelato, tiramisu, cupcakes, brownies, cookies and so much more.  I had an excellent cup of coffee with tiramisu.  You can take this all to go.  The unisex bathrooms were clean and well stocked.  Overall a very positive experience.  My only complaint is that the floors are a little slick."}
{"text":"Their style pizza, is very good, just not sold on their pasta specials !The lobster ravioli was awesome, if they have it, get, you won't be disappointed, I assure you ! The other pasta special always seem Bland and way under seasoned, I pass on most of the normal special's. Someone is not following direction's !   When I asked to speak to the Manager, of course, He was very busy, yeah, sure! So am I and I am a good customer ! Not sure He received my email either, or maybe He was busy again. If you have the same problem, try DeAnglio's on Rt. 91, great veal special's !"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a beer and quick bit.  Wish the they had more on draft.  They only had 3 at the time we were there.  It was supper slow, but we got our food quick.  We got the bread plate because who doesn't love bread!! We also order 2 salads.  They're were both really good and fresh.  Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Was our 1st visit and already talking about going back. We had a reservation for six for 7:00 got there early at 6:30. We were led to our table and then greeted by the owner,Bobby. We saw him most of the night walking around making sure things were going smoothly. It was a busy night. We ordered two meatball apps and the antipasto plate the guys raved about the meatballs and the fire roasted peppers. Then we had our salads a Caprese, Caesar and 3 palms all tasted very fresh. I would recommend the 3 palms. Then we had 3 pizzas a fungi, puttanesca and a meat very tasty. Nice wine selection. Service was excellent I think we had three different people brining our food and checking on us. We also loved the rustic decor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a relaxing dinner with family and friends. Service was great from the bartender. We had the margarita pizza, nothing bad but nothing great. Would def come again. Beer list could use some work. Not much on tap."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Obviously the food is outstanding! The employees are friendly and seem like they are actually happy to serve you! My favorite dish is the Margherita DOP pizza with the Jumbo Shrimp appetizer - I promise you cannot go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten pizza at Antico Pizza Napoletan in Atlanta, GA, that took home the International \"Top in Class\" Award for the United States from worldwide, two-day festival, the Festa Della Pizza in Salerno, Italy; was named one of 12 New Pizza Classics by Food & Wine Magazine; and lauded Best Italian Style Pizza by Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  3 Palms is almost as good.  They serve a traditional Neapolitan pizza that is 12\" in diameter, sliced into 6 pieces.  I ordered a Polpettina pizza which has sliced meatballs, San Marzano tomato, fresh mozzarella parmesan cheese, basil, and evoo.  The tangy and sweet tomato sauce and cheese form a hot, soupy, molten area in the center of the pizza like any true neapolitan pizza.  The crust was light and fluffy with a subtle browning.  The slight char added a new layer of deliciousness and texture to the pizza.  I loved the rustic and energizing environment.  The manager was gracious enough to credit our bill for the price of one of the bottled drinks that made my stomach turn.  Apparently, the fermented drink is an acquired taste."}
{"text":"We've never been disappointed here. We've never had to wait long to be seated. Food was excellent. We love to get their pizzas and salads. Everything is always fresh. Friendly staff. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My wife and I came with our 2 kids. The service was prompt and excellent. The problem was the food, an unfortunate issue for a food-serving restaurant. We shared a full Caesar salad which was COVERED in canned Parmesan cheese. The same Parmesan that is in those typical packets you get when you order dominos. And the quantity of it made our salad taste dry and very \"un-fresh\". The pizza we shared (large GF pepperoni) was incredible dry. It didn't taste fresh at all or moist whatsoever. Very unimpressed. I wouldn't go back, but I'm glad I went because it now takes the mystique away from the very inviting exterior of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a Florida native and am in Ohio visiting. This place is so cute and rustic! On top of that the food is great and so is the service. Our server Rachel was awesome and super attentive! The 3 palms salad is delicious as well as their diavola pizza. I'm a huge fan of tiramisu and they didn't disappoint! I'm also not the biggest fan of cannolis but they hands down have the best cannolis I have ever tried. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I love that all the pizzas are available gluten-free. They slightly miss the mark, but generally I wouldn't complain :) our table ordered the funghi, rapini, diavoli and Classico. Overall the good was really good, and the se"}
{"text":"Appetizer of Chicken/ turkey meatball with mushroom gravy = yum to the exponent of infinity. Probably a meal just by itself."}
{"text":"The customer service was great. I live downtown but was at Crocker Park to return items to a shop. We ordered 1 each of their meatball appetizers, which are $8 each. Basically, it's 1 meatball and you choose from 1 of 3 sauces. 1 out of 3 was a winner - the lamb meatball with pesto sauce. The other 2 not good. The second one was the mixed meatball with chicken/turkey - so nasty tasting and dry, although the Sunday sauce is very good. The traditional veal/beef/pork Italian meatball, meh, we've had better in many places. It had no flavor and dry like it was made hours before. They skimp on the sauce which is bad as all 3 meatballs craved flavor.  We also tried a small chopped salad- again, for the price was not worth it. It's essentially lettuce with a piece or two of cheese and the other toppings same 1 or 2 slivers proportion.  We did not try the pizza although it did look good when we came in. All in, if you're in Crocker Park and in the mood for Italian or don't want to wait at the many other restaurants to eat, stop in. It's very over priced and likely you'll end up disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here. Wasn't sure about the menu, but the waitress was very egar to explain what they had. Menu is basic, I just wanted more of a meat lovers pizza. She helped me out and even made a suggestion when they didn't have bacon. Pizza was awesome! One of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Pizza was very old.  It's as close to New York pizza  the wait is long so make sure you plan ahead  the appetizers are very good  I would tell you to try the meatball you won't be disappointed   Service was a bit slow but they are moving a ton of pizzas  if they would let you call ahead with your pizza order with your reservation it would help them turn tables and get your food faster  enjoy your pizza and salads"}
{"text":"We stopped for an early dinner.  The place was packed and loud mostly because of a pair of local couples letting their kids run screaming laps of their table.  Ah, Hudson...  We ordered a glass of wine recommended by our server that was a pretty good Medoc, and ordered a lamb meatball wit pesto, a veggie meatball with marinara, a half Italian chopped salad and a half caprese salad.  Both salads were plenty large and tasty.  The lamb meatball was very good, but the veggie was pretty much charred to a crisp on the top.  Service was ok, but don't think we're in any hurry to return"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out due to all the great reviews, but unfortunately I wasn't satisfied. I had a hard time reading the menu in the dark lighting and didn't like the pizza I ordered"}
{"text":"Best pizza!  Diabola is my favorite pizza.  This is brick oven fired Pizza with fresh ingredients.  Service is always very good.  Located near Starbucks.  Worth the walk down.  One of my favorite places to eat in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"The best pizza with just enough toppings, thin, wood fired, and Neapolitan style.  Great selection of salads! Homemade, delicious meatballs! Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"A friend and I picked this restaurant knowing nothing about the area. What a pleasant surprise! We shared a salad and pizza, and both were delicious. We sat on the patio, but the inside has a great atmosphere as well. Too bad we were just visiting Hudson!"}
{"text":"I love going to 3 Palms for lunch and ordering a half salad and splitting pizza.  The panzanella and chopped salads are both awesome!    The reason I'm only giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that everyone once in a while the pizza is a little too soggy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas in the Northeast Ohio area.  Whenever my sales person from Columbus takes me out to lunch, they always want to go here because they love the pizza too.  I wish there was more of a selection to the menu.  The Chopped Italian Salad is to die for.  The salad dressing on that is awesome.  I've never had a problem with waiting for the food.  The bartenders and servers are right on it."}
{"text":"The smells of freshly baked breads from the parking garage grabbed our attention. The interior was nicely decorated and the staff was kind. The prices were average for the area and the beer list was impressive for the size. We stopped in for a light lunch and beverage. I ordered a half salad, it was huge and hit the spot. My friend ordered the meat ball, which was delicious! I will be stopping here again when I am in that area to try some of the other menu items, perhaps a pizza or veggie meat ball?"}
{"text":"Love 3 Palms. We've been going to the Hudson location for years and this new location had even better service. Our food came out at very prompt and appropriate times, and our server was courteous and friendly. My favorites are the meatball with Sunday gravy ($8-8.50), the panzanella salad ($5.50/half, $8.50/full, probably my most favorite item on the menu), and pretty much every pizza ($11-16.50). The prices are fair, so I'm not sure what the complaints are about."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Parking can kind of be a pain, but it is so worth it.  The wood fired pizzas are cooked to perfection.  We shared a meatball appetizer and turkey and chicken meatball with San Marzano Tomato Marinara sauce.  For a meal, I had the Margherita pizza.  The meatball and pizza were delicious and I had plenty of leftover pizza to take home.  Before you leave make sure to check out the pastries and gelato!"}
{"text":"So I've been to the 3 Palms in Hudson and by comparison this one fails big time!  As new residents to Crocker Park we were excited to learn that 3 Palms was opening right near us.  We are huge neopolitan pizza fans and used to have it quite often when we lived in Chicago.   The first time we got take out- it was amazing.  Second time we dined in and it was still very good.  Then it went downhill from there.  We always order the same thing (margherita pizza, polpettina pizza, and a turkey/chicken meatball).  The 2nd to last time we ordered takeout, the margherita pizza was pretty much just plain pizza dough (very little sauce...and no cheese??) and the turkey or chicken in the meatball wasn't even fully ground up.  We gave them one last chance since we had such a positive and tasty experience in Hudson and even though our order for free since the last order was so messed up...it still was kinda just burnt, and meh.  Needless to say we haven't gone back and probably won't anytime soon."}
{"text":"I dined at the Crocker Park location with a friend recently and have not been back. To be fair, we did not have a pizza here so I can only speak to the food and service that I experienced which was \"just ok\" hence the 3 star rating.  My friend and I ordered the kale salad and the lamb meatball. The lamb meatball with pesto was excellent. The kale salad was not. It was meant to be served with pine nuts and apparently the kitchen ran out and threw some sunflower seeds on the salad instead. I wish I would have been made aware of that before I ordered because the pine nuts would have been a better pairing.   For an afternoon where there was really no one in the restaurant, I expected a higher level of service than we received.   While I did not have a bad experience here-I also would not return in a hurry especially when Crocker Park offers so many dining options."}
{"text":"I could live off of hot pepper apps with tomato sauce and luxardo manhattans.  Pizzas are a bit pricey, but well made and worth the occasional splurge.  Never disappointing, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"So much promise. All I can say is, the service, ambience and gelato were good. The flavor of the Margherita pizza was either really subtle, or just non-existent. And I'm not a big fan of anchovies, so my bros pizza was good up until the anchovy. Oh well, you can't win them all."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to come here to minute my friend suggested it. It's not your typical Crocker Park restaurant, but rather something you'd find in a charming hipster town. The restaurant itself doesn't have much of a traditional Italian vibe, but rather a hip and rustic/chic vibe. Don't let that fool you though. The pizza tasted like it came straight out of the oven in Napoli, Italy. Trust me, I've been there.   This isn't the thick crusted, greasy, cheesy type of pizza you'd find at Pizza Hut or even your nearest sports bar. It's authentic, flatter than most, and isn't smothered in as much cheese, or sauce as an Americanized pizza most people are used to, but I encourage you to try it!  I've been craving pizza like this since I came home from Italy and I finally found it. I couldn't be happier!  It's the real deal and I cannot wait to go back and eat the Margherita pizza again. Absolutely mouth watering!"}
{"text":"For casual dining this place is good. Salad and pizza is good not great! The Plain Dealer raves about this place..... not sure why they thought it was so delicious."}
{"text":"I've tried their rotisserie chicken dinner, the meatball pizza, and the mushroom pizza, and I have been very impressed by the freshness of ingredients and the quality of the meal. I recently had a baby, so I've only enjoyed their food at home (actually, let's be honest, I've sort of mastered the art of inhaling food in the car while parked in front of a restaurant). However, the vibe inside seems relaxed and it would be fun to have our meal while seated at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great, pizza, salads and beer. I always buy a bag of home made cookies on my way out. Their bakery products are excellent.   I typically get the sliced meatball pizza and a pantenalla (sp) salad with lettuce. They always have several IPAs to sample as well. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday with my wife for pickup.  We had called in our order at 7:30 for a diavola pizza and were told that it would be 30 minutes.  We arrived around 45 minutes later to find our pizza ready for us.  3 Palms is also a bakery and whenever I walked into the restaurant I was greeted by a couple of display cases.  Since my wife loves cannolis and the cannolis looked good here I also ordered one of those.  The server who was helping me out asked if I wanted the one with or without chocolate chips.  Since their filling didn't include chocolate chips either I went sans chocolate chips so that I could have some too.  When all was said and done I spent maybe 3 minutes in the restaurant so I didn't notice anything else about it except for the giant pizza oven in the open kitchen.  My wife and I ended up proceeding across the street and into the green space to eat our pizza. The diavola pizza consisted of a San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, spicy salami, chili oil, basil and evoo and looked fantastic whenever I opened the box.  My first bite of the pizza was nice and spicy as I got the full force of the spicy salami and chili oil which I loved.  As I ate more of it I got a lot of bites with basil which was hiding under the other toppings and provided some nice flavor.  The San Mariano tomato sauce provided a nice pop of acidity to the dish and the only item that I felt got a little lost was the cheese.  This pizza also had a nice thin crust which was floppy in the middle and firm on the ends with a great taste and some chewiness to it.  The cannoli here was also really great as it had a crispy shell with a smooth and creamy filling that had hints of cinnamon in it.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  I really enjoyed the pizza and only wish that I lived closer to try more different kinds."}
{"text":"I must say that this place is great. We had a couple different pizzas  which were delish and  do not miss the chopped Italian salad. everything so good right down to the gelato. Don't miss this quaint place in Hudson."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Pizzas are expensive and don't fill you up.  We were hungry when we left!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. Our server Tricia, the food and gelato were all amazing. Thanks for being open on a Sunday and a pleasant place to enjoy the Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave a review because the lady at the dessert shop is extremely rude and was not paying attention to our requests. This is the third time I have visited the place and she has been rude to me and my family members for no reason at all. I had the same experience with the hostesses. Otherwise the waiters at the table are usually nice and attentive.   I have been regular to this place and have enjoyed the Pizzeria but the quality of the pizza has been consistently declining and am not sure if the management is taking a note at all. The restaurant is slowly becoming a poorly managed place.  The management should take a note before the place  loses its charm (nice pizzas and friendly environment) and starts to lose its customer base."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place five stars. I really would. The pizza was amazing, the fried artichokes were heavenly, and the mocha bomb was fabulous (oh and The Godfather about knocked my socks off).... But there is a disconnect between the quality of the food and the quality of the experience.   First, the service is slow. My friend and I sat at the bar and it took way too long for the anyone to offer to get us anything to drink. Like 10 minutes of sitting too long. I don't know if they were short staffed tonight, but one bartender appeared to be taking care of drinks for everyone. Not good!   Second, the food flavors themselves were amazing (and I highly recommend the banana peppers) but my pizza came out nearly totally cool. It was barely warm. And the cherry tomatoes were still cold at points! I realize I ordered items that need care when cooking and the low temperature meant I could eat it faster, but I still expect my pizza to be warm... My friend's nearly burned his mouth! So why wasn't mine even warm?   Finally, the prices don't always match the quality and quantity. Close, but not quite. The fried artichokes were awesome, but not $11 for 4 awesome. Good one time buy, but not with my money again. At least the pizza is priced decently?   So half star for the service, half star for the cool pizza, and quarter star for the pricing.... 3.75 stars. Like I said, the food was fabulous, but it couldn't make up for some parts of the experience. It won't prevent me from coming back to try a few other pizzas and items from the bakery, but it'll keep this from becoming a go-to dinner place."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love this place! It's a great addition to Crocker Park by offering a restaurant that offers fresh ingredients, rustic decor that doesn't feel like a chain. I ordered their gluten free pizza with homemade ricotta and thought it was delicious. Service was great when I was there and my coworkers haven't had any issues either."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and had lunch at this local gem. Inside was nice and casual. Loved all the menu options from salads to pizzas. I had one of the few sandwiches listed -- chicken avocado sandwich. It wasn't what I expected, it was more!  The chicken was very tender and shredded so it was easy to take a bite and not have it fall apart on you. The avocado was ripe and paired well.  The sandwich was huge in size. I really enjoyed this meal.  On the way out I noticed the dessert counter, so bad I was full.  There were so many delicious treats on display. Maybe next time when I'm in the area I can come back."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here on a rainy Saturday looking for something new and tasty. 3 Palms is in Hudson's First and Main shopping district. It's a sharp looking spot with great light and a good layout.   The wait staff was far from great. Our waitress was clearly disinterested and looked like she was thinking about anything but serving our meal. She was not very attentive, and provided little insight.   Ah, well. On to the food.   We started with the cheese appetizer. 3 cheeses - all quite nice - toasts, almonds and fig jam. Perfect pairing with a nice presentation. We decided on two pizzas: the first had a good red sauce with sliced meatballs and fresh mozzarella. Everything went together perfectly on a light and delicious crust. The second had an oil and garlic sauce with prosciutto, goat cheese and basil. By far my favorite!  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I was torn between a 3.5 or 4 mostly because of the poor service. It's sad to say that a server can make or break your experience. In this case the location and environment are great as well as the the decor. The food is pretty good too. In order to enjoy your pizza at a maximum level, eat it while it's hot (in other words, right away). I would've possibly enjoyed my experience more if our server would have been more attentive to our needs. She never came by to check in with us to see how we were doing. I wouldn't necessarily be in a rush to return but it's a nice spot to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love 3 Palms, my wife and I have come here for several years, and come quite frequently.  Pizza and salads are good, great place (I only wish they took reservations or had call-ahead).  But the main point of this review is the pastry chef.  I don't know who they are, but I love them.  Their pastries are consistently outstanding and I think they are by far the best bakery in the area, even compared to bakeries.  I have never had anything that wasn't outstanding.  The Italian Cream cake is consistently wonderful.  And the other day I had this thing called something like \"Apple and Apricot Seashell\" - it had a dough almost like a phyllo, glazed with sugar so it had a crunchy-sweet crust, and filled with a mostly apricot compote.  OMG, it was so good.  And the desserts are consistently only a couple of bucks, an absolute bargain.  Even if you don't like pizza, come here for dessert."}
{"text":"Love the food even tho WAY overpriced, it is in keeping with the prices of surrounding establishments. So no complaints there. Problem with this place is that they are not organized. Not at all. This is my 5th visit, so I can safely say this is not a one off. They are consistently not aware of what is going on. It's annoying, especially when they are not busy but you are. Get the service to match the food."}
{"text":"I looked at a list of places to eat and I was like, If this place is as good as it sounds, it'll be pretty good. Then when I looked at it I was like, If this place is as good as it looks, then it'll be pretty amazing. Then I went there and as I walked in the door, I was like, If the food is as good as the place looks, then this will be phenomenal. When I ate the food I was like, This is better than it looked.   The place is rustic, charming, high class and casual, all in one. Great aesthetics. It's hard to eat food when one is looking around but it's even harder to look around when they place such AMAZING food before you.   First off, we ordered SaluTé kombucha (which didn't have a price but turned out to be $6.) Blue Ginger and Mango Cayenne. The guy that makes the SaluTé kombucha was even there, hanging out and waiting tables. (Maybe he's the owner of the restaurant too...?) Anyway, it was well paired with our pies. With a thin crust, lightly charred in places, they were just like all pizza should be. We tried the Formaggio Di Capra and the Frutti Di Mare. Formaggio: local goat cheese, prosciotto di parma, fresh cherry tomatoes (added at the end), basil, evoo, slivered garlic. Frutti: shrimp, braised calamari, mussels, San Marzono tomatoes, slivered garlic, fresh mozzarella & parmesan cheese, basil, evoo. Simply stunning. Both of 'em. There is no way anyone would think that the Formaggio was anything less than amazing. And seafoodies and even most non-seafoodies would think the same of the Frutti.   It's not so cheap, $14 average for a personal pizza, but it's as good as you're gonna find. Or better, yeah probably quite a bit better."}
{"text":"The food here, the 2 times that I have been is good.  however, both times I have experienced very poor service due to them being understaffed.  I was last there  a couple Thursdays ago around 6-7pm.  The place was completely packed.  Unfortunately, it looked like there were only 3 waitresses for the entire place, so the bartender who was taking care of the entire bar (also packed) was having to wait tables, and bring all the drinks to the tables instead of the waitresses doing this.  By the time our pizza finally came (20 minutes after having to ask where is was, since we had been there an hour), it was completely cold, so we sent it back to get warmed up.  All the food tastes great, the bartender was very apologetic and completely frazzled. I felt bad for them.  they need better management to figure out better wait staff to customer ratio for their high volume times.  Hope they figure it out.  I'll try back in a few months"}
{"text":"5/27/18 Like the atmosphere, but always leave a bit disappointed. Ohio Mule and Long Island iced tea were both good. Did not like the tomatoes in my Caesar. Not much on menu beyond their flatbread pizzas, which I find to be dry and lacking taste. The D. O. P.  Margarita pizza was boring and only had 3 leaves of basil. The Formaggio Di Capra had a decent taste with goat cheese and prosciutto, but it was loaded with tomatoes."}
{"text":"Perhaps sometime in the future we will be back but it won't be for a long time and until they have their restaurant figured out I would definitely not be back.   My parents wanted to take me and my hubs out for a celebration of our one year wedding anniversary (yay!) and since we live by Crocker and have been to every restaurant there so much, we picked this place. The interior was my favorite part of our visit to 3 palms. It's cozy and rustic chic. Kind of how I envision my future Home looking.   Anyways, my parents ordered a meatball to share as an app. They were disappointed by the size and quality. Me and husband ordered salads. I'm not sure what he had but I had the 3 palms salad. It was my favorite part of my meal by far.   We split 2 pizzas for 4 people. The pizzas came out when I was 3 bites into my salad so the timing was so awkward. We ordered the Diavola and the Funghi with Italian sausage added onto that one. The pizzas were bland and overall just eh. Can't believe I'm saying that about a pizza. I had a wine, mom had a Bellini. Our total was $85 bucks at essentially a pizza parlor. We felt robbed!!! Needless to say we went to Graeters for dessert and none of us plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A must visit every time we're in town! Weather permitting we love sitting outside on their patio by the fireplace but in winter months the ambience inside is very cozy and inviting. Love the open beams and rustic yet modern feel of the decor. You can dine at the bar, at one of their high tops or at their bench style tables if you have a larger group. Service is quick and their wait staff is great. Food- their meatballs are amazing and they offer several different varieties including a non-meat based option. Once you select the type of meatball you then select one of their variety of sauces- FYI not on the menu but you can combine 2 sauces! Pizzas and salads are delicious too! Be sure to take a peak at their baked goods and desserts as you walk in! Overall you can't go wrong as everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was excellent, staff was friendly and quick. The food though was mediocre...my friend and I split a Margherita pizza and a 3 palms salad. The salad was good and had creamy goat cheese, pine nuts and a little bit of cranberries. The pizza was the disappointment. With the pizza oven front and center to the kitchen and the delicious smell as soon as you stepped in, we had high hopes, but the pizza we received was for lack of a better word, soggy. It was limp and watery due to an excess of tomato sauce and olive oil. I never thought I'd say this but there was also too much cheese, the grilled crust just couldn't hold up to the toppings and was a mushy soggy mess."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant marginal at best. No happy hour. Our bill was 80.00 for 2 pizzas. Salad and appetizer. I was so disappointed we gave many better pizza restaurants in Cleveland.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Like sitting down at home---a good meatball with sauce and freshly baked bread. A caprese salad with house made ricotta and balsamic vinegar.  A good pizza and dessert made for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Although Hudson has several pizza places I now believe that they only have one that I can honestly recommend. This place was excellent. I was brought up just outside of New Haven, Connecticut which is well known for its pizza. I left that area over 30 years ago and I have consumed a lot of pizza from various establishments. But when I finally tried the pizza at 3 Palms I felt like I was back home. The crust was amazing and the toppings were fresh and delicious. Service was outstanding. Already making plans to return."}
{"text":"I think if I liked thin crust pizza more I would give 3 Palms five stars....sometimes I just feel like I'm eating a cracker with melty gourmet toppings. That being said- we ordered the rapini and formaggio di capra-both pizzas had a nice thin crispy crust, and fresh toppings. I liked the rapini more because it was more saucy (which I like) and had house made pork sausage. We started our meal with the crispy artichokes, which I REALLY enjoyed. They were fried, but barely battered so the artichoke was the star instead of heavy fried stuff. Plus, it had capers. I love me some capers!  It had a chic wood decor inside, which fit since its a wood fired pizza joint. Very nice patio and fire pit outside. Looks out to the green of Hudson square."}
{"text":"Everything here is freshly made and worth it! And the two big draws : pizza and dessert. Appetizers consisted of 'Beans and Greens' (Cannellini beans cooked with braised escarole, prosciutto, & parmesan) and the roasted hot peppers. Word of warning : they are on the spicy side. I enjoyed it but my table mates didn't. For dinner we got the Rapini pizza (San Marzano tomatoes, slivered garlic, house made pork sausage, broccoli rabe, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, all drizzled with olive oil) and some meatballs. The meatballs are the size of a baseball, and you can choose your protein (meat, chicken, lamb, or veggie) and sauce (marinara, gravy, or Pistachio Pesto). All were amazing! Dessert was outstanding. I had the red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing, and I'm going to be dreaming about it! My only complaint about the evening is that it was a little loud and conversation could be challenging at times. It simply comes from the fact that there's a lot of energy here, so it's not a bad thing. Just an observation."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 Palms twice - once was 3 star, tried it again and 5 star experience, so I met in the middle on the review.  Ambiance - 5 stars - adorable old style decor, not super comfortable, but very warm.  Staff: 5 stars - both visits, very friendly, mostly younger staff who are sweet and innocent.  Food: first time we each ordered pizzas - mushroom and ?? - neither were very good.  Second time, went with signature recommendations - white pizza and meatball pizza - these were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We were greeted by the owners as soon as we walked in! We felt welcome right off the bat... we had  great service and the food was very good!  Many choices including homemade pasta's. Loved the super sized meatballs with your choice of sauces. Creative pizza choices or create your own. The place has a neat urban vibe and cool indoor outdoor bar area. A win for Crocker Park , we needed a pizza place that is much more than that! Such a refreshing change from the usual chain places.."}
{"text":"Great trendy menu with fresh ingredients. The wait staff are the best even for a pretentious place like Hudson"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this ... ok so my husband & I ordered to go over the phone and the man seemed a bit rude but I moved past that  . We each ordered the chicken and turkey meatball and OH MY GOSH!!! It was a joke seriously it became a joke - we could not even cut it without a steak knife  SERIOUSLY A MEATBALL? !!!Then we each got a sandwich him chicken and avocado and I got a roasted 7 vegetable sandwich nothing special at all definitely NOT 7 vegetables.  There was onion,mushrooms, I think eggplant and avocado not 7. WON'T  make the mistake of going there again it's not worth the $$$!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this restaurant and while I would typically give it the benefit of the doubt on a bad dining experience, finding a live worm in the salad is inexcusable. It was in my husband's salad and I was just saying there was a hair in my coffee when he said he had topped me. The worm was only a centimeter long, but was wriggling around like crazy on the plate. We were both disgusted. The manager did come by and apologize and comp the salad, but the damage was done. With proper washing techniques, no restaurant should have live worms in their salads. We stayed for a gluten free Margherita pizza. We paid extra to have the fresh buffalo mozzarella. When it came it had barely any cheese. We decided to just pay and leave. My husband begrudgingly ate a few slices since the dinner we effectively didn't eat cost us $24. While we didn't like the pizza and normally would go back for a second shot, the live worm killed it and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! I took my three year old and still had an excellent meal! We shared a regular pizza and it was cooked to perfection. I've had pizza around the world and my favorite is right here. It was done just right with delicious ingredients and perfect texture. After our pizza, we each tried a cookie from their bakery, and oh. my. word. So delicious!  The staff was great and the server was very accommodating to our needs, even the needs of my three year old (eg, please give her a kids cup and fill her lemonade with half water) Our meal was not rushed and we felt very welcome.  This would make a perfect date night, dinner with well-behaved kids, or a fun lunch with your girlfriends or co-workers. We are so grateful to have food this good so close to home!  What's not to love? Pizza and a bakery all at a beautiful location. Beautiful decor, delicious  gourmet pizza, and just a great atmosphere for anything from date night to a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and salad!  Had the chopped salad and Bianca pizza with Sausage, pepperoni, spinach and mushrooms. Seth was the perfect waiter to serve. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"3 palms is really unique in my mind. It is a true upscale Pizzeria. Pizza is it's thing. Flatbread/thin crust. Very good. They have an indoor and outdoor eating area. The indoor area has a lot of odd high top tables. Not just for two people either. Like they seat like 6 people at a high top, weird. They do have other things of course. Italian sandwiches. Entree's etc... but Pizza is there thing. I have tried their pasta. Eh. Its kind of Mushy like it was either over cooked or sitting in water for too long. Eh. They do have a lot of Italian Pastries and Gelato. One night I wanted to go there with my family and they were no longer seating as they had a wine tasting and dinner thing which was presold. Strange. I understand it. But at the same time I felt kind of turned away because I wanted to spend my money there. And I was turned away. Maybe next time they could reserve half the space for that. Not the whole space. All in all I think the place is good. I actually think its owned by Italian's. No idea though. The owner was there a few times. The only negative I found is the hosts. Don't know what happened to their brains. It is not in their head. Brain's optional for host I guess? They look attractive but when they say leave the drama at the door I do not think they mean brains as well."}
{"text":"The food is good because there are many unique pizzas. I love the salads. They are delicious but healthy. If you can get a seat outside it is a nice atmosphere with all of the happenings on First and Main Street. The atmosphere inside is loud and casual which attracts people with young kids. They do not take reservations or even put your name on a list if you call ahead which is unfortunate. I had a large group so I went down  and hour early to put our name in. They had a table ready for me but wouldl not let anyone sit at it until at least half of the party was there. It was very awkward as there is no room in the lobby to wait and we had gifts so we were constantly bumping into people. It did not make sense since they were not letting anyone sit at the table anyhow.  When you do get a table however the food is good and shopping at First and Maine is always fun!"}
{"text":"My family love this place. We have had all of the pizzas and they are all delicious. We love the meatball appetizers as well as the salads. It's perfect to bring for vegetarians like my wife who loves the beans and greens. My kids love the build-your-own."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Each pizza is 14 dollars, one size, about the size of a medium pizza at a chain pizza place.  Pizza stone oven cooked.  Unique recipes, Excellent pizza!  Great flavors!  Has become one of my favorite pizza places in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Been there several times, most recently last night. Consistently good pizza - last night I had the Bianco and Verde - and decent service.  Good bottled-beer selection, too, but only one option for draft (Peroni)."}
{"text":"Straight up --one of my favorite pizzas in the country-- My top 3 are  Pacci's in Silver Springs Maryland Ciao in Boston Massachusetts  And 3 Palms in Hudson Ohio  The Margherita pizza is phenomenal (I prefer the non buffalo mozzarella here) it's a little more firm during the cooking process--still melty and warm but I feel it tastes better in the end--the buffalo melts more and seems to get too thin for me.  If you're a fan of prosciutto add it to your pizza.  It is cooked and it is sooooo good!  Like pepperoni but less bad for you!  To drink I ordered a blood orange san pellegrino which really compliments everything nicely.  It acts as a great pallet cleanser in between bites and is light and refreshing.    I also had the panzanella salad which is beyond amazing!   I'm usually not a salad person but dang--this isn't a typical salad.  It's technically a bread salad and it comes with goat cheese and wildly different colored tomatoes--it L just looks and tastes amazing!    With all 3 of these things your head will explode at the amazingness of it all!  It is a perfect meal and I don't say that often!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Best meal I have had in this area of Ohio!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the pizza, just some Italian bread with some mushroom gravy to dip it in. It was excellent. The pizzas looked great. They basically make all of their food in house. Quality cooking. Nice ambiance. Pricey. Great service. Overall it is worth the cost. I would definitely go back. The serve staff was very cute!"}
{"text":"I will go there again and again! The food is excellent and priced well. The desserts are sinful and the service is great. I also appreciated how child friendly they were."}
{"text":"The good news? You will feel like you are in high-end eatery, enjoying great Cuisine. It's a little less formal and I appreciated that. The pasta is delicious. This is real authentic Italian food, seasoned perfectly and I sense that the Owners and the Chef really care about the food and the manner in which it is served. A little caution, the bill may be a little higher than you expected, as some things, like bread, are extra. You may have to wait in line, hoping for a table. The Friday night wait is quite long. The food is well worth it. I did not have room for dessert, but it looked superb!."}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth the money. Cute, quaint location. Excellent pizza, and friendly staff. Relaxing and enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio and got to people watch a bit.   Server was nice.  Happy hour prices at the bar.  Ordered the fried artichoke, which was good, but not the best I've ever had. It came with a good lemon dipping sauce. I could have used more of that.   Margherita and Funghi pizzas were good. Thin crispy crust with a slight char."}
{"text":"Not many five star places around but this is one. Pizzas are unlike any other place and the meatballs (especially the lamb and mushroom!) are appetizers that can be a meal. Drink prices are a little high, so pace yourself. The place is busy most nights so be prepared to wait; still the location at Hudson's 'First & Main' offers ample close shopping to kill the time."}
{"text":"Great food everything on the menu is very well made and tastefully seasoned. Anyone can find a good meal here. My only issue is they have a poor choice of hours and the staff is rude if you come in at 8:30 pm or later on week nights."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We are getting married in the area in September (from DC), so we needed a spot for a fun rehearsal dinner---and we found it at 3 Palms! This place is awesome. We swung by this weekend to pick some pizzas for our guests. First impression of this place was great, sort of an industrial look and smells like actual heaven.   We tried the Diavola and the Polpettina. Both were excellent. I personally enjoyed the Diavola a tad more bc I like a little spice with my pizza and this guy brings it! The salami was wonderful and the spice is just right for me. The Polpettina was absolutely delicious as well. Just the right meat to cheese ratio that you would want on a pizza like this. 3 Palms really kills it in the crust and cheese departments. Wood fire pizza done perfectly!  I feel like, once you have mastered that, it is difficult to make a bad pizza. I would imagine each pizza on the menu to be pretty delightful because of this.   Also, great patio and a wonderful location in Hudson!   Service was great and we cannot wait to have some fun here this September!  Previously rated this place a 4, but my fiance had a cow and I've given it a 5! This place deserves the 5 star love!"}
{"text":"I like my pizza on the thin side, crispy, and topped with the freshest ingredients possible. It shouldn't come as a surprise that I really liked 3 Palms' pizza, as it was the thin/crispy brick oven style and not the gooey, overloaded Chicago style that others seem to dig a bit more.   My boyfriend and I shared the Diavola which had chili sauce, spicy salami, fresh parmesan, and san marzano tomatoes. It was well-cooked with just a slight softness under the crunchy crust. We devoured the pizza (~6 slices) pretty quickly, mostly because we were starving, but the great taste helped too.  I've been here before and also ordered their gelato (YUM). Definitely one of the few places that I've seen with desserts that are worth getting post-meal.   The only odd thing about this place is the entrance. It's misleading and they had to keep telling everyone as they were leaving to go to the left instead of right in front where you'd think the main door should be. I think this was poor attention when it came to whoever built the design of the entryway.   Otherwise, 3 Palms gets a thumbs up from me, especially with a lack of independent pizza places in the Akron area. Akron needs more of these asap!"}
{"text":"3 Plams has become a standard option in our house since the review I've written nearly three years ago.   Our kids are 3 & 5 and the three year old can certainly still be very noisy.  We've found the atmosphere there very accommodating to kids.  The noise level always drowns him out do it is not disturbing to others.   Pizzas are always excellent; although not quite as good as Biga in Kirtland.  But since I can't always drive an hour to get a good Neapolitan style pizza, 3 Palms is a damn close second and around the corner from my house.   Lately we've been calling in orders for pickup. It's worked out great and highly recommend.    I see that they do as I suggested in my original review, open all the doors on nice days to create an open air dining experience.  Very European; I love it.   As always, highly recommended in the area."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Great service and the pizza is super authentic to Italy.  I loved the pizza with the bourbon dates!  Great for the family and good for a casual date.   Only complaint?  The music is super weird. Like 1990 easy listening. It's like a James Taylor making out with Phil Collins kind of thing. It's obnoxious and hurts the atmosphere.    But the service pizza and gelato more than overcome.  Hard to beat."}
{"text":"If you've not tried this place, you must! Food is consistently presented & always so very tasty. The Beans & Greens appetizer and the Bianco & Verde pizza are my faves. Their ricotta is so noticeably flavorful. The meatball appetizer is fun with numerous choices to make in meatball styles & sauces. There's a terrific & naughtily tempting dessert case as you enter. Gets you coming or going so be prepared! The desserts are terrific. Haven't had one ever disappoint. Have even popped in to get some to have for special evenings at home with friends. Their bell shaped stone oven makes one fabulous pizza so both my husband and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. My second time going and I love the environment every time I go. I've gotten the pasta, which is the only pasta on the menu. Carbonara I think it's called. Also the Funghi pizza. I had a small salad with Champagne vinaigrette  dressing. This place is kind of fancy."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I personally don't believe it's worth the money.  The slow service didn't help.  The bakery looks pretty good, though."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!!  Delicious pizza, homemade desserts!  We also tried the Beans & Greens, which was heavenly.  We sat at the bar...wish our server was more personable.  I asked to see a dessert menu and they said I had to go to the dessert case and look for myself.  Not exactly a convenient thing to do, since there were about 20 people standing in front of it waiting for a table.  Please get a dessert menu!  Your desserts are homemade and delicious!!!!  Beautiful restaurant too!  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Sat there for over an hour. After 10 mins from ordering one of our food items came out and over the course of the next hour eventually the rest of our food came out, piece by piece. Didn't end up eating any of it because we wanted to eat as a family. And the last thing to come out was the pepperoni pizza for my son, over an hour later, and it was burnt. Might try back in a couple months to see if they've gotten it figured out as they did just open."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious not-your-ordinary pizza and salads from fresh ingredients!  It's a local favorite for lunch or dinner!  Friendly service, beautiful presentation, too!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. These pizzas are made from fresh ingredients and are just too notch.  I had the spicy salami pizza with the red pepper oil on the side. The spice was not overwhelming hot without the oil on the pizza. The crust is very thin so if you enjoy thin crust pizza, this place is for you.  Their oven was made in Italy and their traditions bring all fresh ingredients to the table. Certainly stop by this place and give it a try. It's a cute little place in an adorable village setting."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their pizza is great, good for the whole fam! Just wish you could make reservations!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a bite to eat after my sons basketball game in Hudson. We actually opened up the Yelp app and found 3 Palms Pizzeria and decided to give it a try. I am not sure if it was divine intervention or what, but we were extremely hungry as it was 2:15pm and the kids hadn't had eaten yet but they had 1 table open in the entire restaurant.....and it was for 6.  We sat down and ordered drinks which came a minute or two later. The two youngest split the Bianco and Verde pizza that looked absolutely delicious (wood fired) with arugula on top w/ parmesan cheese. The other two kids had sandwiches that looked extremely appetizing; one was the Chicken avocado  the other was the 3 Palms Italian- I \"had to\" try both sandwiches and they were delicious. My wife had the 3 Palms salad and I had the Chopped Italian Salad.  I'm not going to lie...I pulled a \"dad move\" and looked at all the tables on our way in and our way out....Everything looked so appealing..... I have highly recommended 3 Palms Pizzeria to both my family and friends."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place!! It's in the amazing downtown Hudson area. Service is always great! Such a great and unique selection of pizza! It's really busy sometimes so plan on putting your name in and checking out downtown Hudson!"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to write this but after calling the restaurant the following day and suggesting that the GM contact me, and no word from him yet - here we go:  I have been in the food/restaurant business all of my adult life.  I have worked in pretty much all aspects of the restaurant business.  I should know better than to go to dinner on Mother's Day, but we did.    Allow me to preface this horrible review by saying that EVERY single server/person we had contact with were wonderful.  But they were SOOOOO understaffed, and struggled to keep up with what appeared to be just two servers for the entire restaurant.  At one point, someone with financial interest, came in with her two young children to help clear tables; clearly illegal.    The food is ok - expensive for the size of the servings.  I looked around the room as numerous tables were visibly irritated at their lack of attention.    I don't get why, on Mother's Day, the dining room wasn't adequately covered, or the kitchen.  Really bad business decision."}
{"text":"Overall the limited time I was here the hostess sat us at a table that I guess was being used for a party. Some guy that works here asks us if we are able to move to another table after we already ordered. The server didn't know the price of the special or the beer prices. Kinda disappointed since this is in Hudson"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place tonight.  We figured the service couldn't be as bad as described by other reviews, but it can - and on a Mon night.  Place was not busy either.  Food was ok.  My pizza was way too salty.  My husband's was better but not awesome.  We were there tonight for the first $5 pizza they advertised then corrected by -$5 off.  When bill came, we had to ask for the discount.  I was hoping to like this place as the outdoor tables and outdoor seating at the bar would be nice.  I really don't see this place making it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome, fun, outside us very nice. The food is fancy, the salads all look great, the pizza was fantastic, fresh. The beer menu is small but good enough. The service was bad when I visited, took a while to get a drink but had a good time."}
{"text":"The only good thing here was our main server. Very friendly and attentive. That's where the good ended.  The pizza was bland and the portion was small, and it was WAY overpriced for quality and size. I ordered an arugula salad that was wilted, slimy, and yellow. It wasn't even a small portion of the leaves, it was the entire salad. They brought out a new one with beautiful, fresh leaves, so they obviously knew what a non-rotted salad should look like. Alas, it was underdressed/dry, and bland.   The last straw was when I ordered a sandwich to bring home to my husband. The menu said it came with an ancient grain salad. Got it home and it was a mixed green salad. Not the end of the world, but totally unprofessional to pull that kind of bait-and-switch without even mentioning it.   Trying to pass off your rotted arugula and swapping out a side without notice to the customer seems unethical, and leads me to wonder what else goes on in the kitchen, and business in general.  FYI- My dinner companion and I both left hungry."}
{"text":"Sometimes a little long to get food, always busy, but ALWAYS really worth it!  Great food-  my wife loves the panacotta salad, and I love the authentic Italian style pizza.   Very thin, but the ovens make such unbelievable crust.  I love the diavolo... but also the all mushroom one as well.   So great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at the Hyatt visiting family.  We decided on 3 Palms after looking at the menu.  We were there early, around 5:30 on a Sunday.  It was busy, but we were able to be seated right away.  We tried the artichoke appetizer and thought it was excellent. One of the best artichoke dishes we have ever had.  Trust me we really like artichokes and have had them cooked every way possible.  We shared the chopped salad and while it really wasn't a chopped salad it was fresh and delicious.  Our pizza was well cooked and very flavorful. The staff seemed pulled in too many directions but was attentive and efficient.  I will happily return."}
{"text":"If this review was about food only, it would be at least 4 stars.   Let's start with the good. The pizza, and anything else we've tried in 3 stops here, has always been really quite good. I've tried 3 different pizzas, and really liked all of them.  My fear is that the owner of this establishment doesn't understand that food alone will not create a success for this restaurant. The service, every time I've been in, has been atrocious.   The first and second time there, the restaurant was pretty much empty, and our server (the same guy) would disappear out of sight for 20-30 minutes at a time . The second time there, we actually had to ask a completely different person to serve us because our server was nowhere to be found.  The last time there, we had a party of 8. This time, we thoroughly enjoyed our server, who was attentive and helpful. However, we placed our order and waited an hour and 20 minutes before our server came over to tell us that the kitchen had lost our entire order.   We asked for the owner, who came over, shrugged his shoulders, and said, \"Well, what are you gonna do?\"  We finally got our food, which was delicious, but I think the only time we will ever even consider returning would be for a take out order. The service is horrendous.   And last, as we were leaving, the owner asked us not to put anything about our experience on social media. Sorry to disappoint, which is more than I can say for his service."}
{"text":"Great service, very attentive staff , knowledgeable about menu items and the best part was the food ( pizza margherita)"}
{"text":"The food was great. I recommend the sliced meatball pizza. The waitress was really helpful when my kids were ordering. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Prompt service, and great food. Both red and white sangria were delicious and worth the price. 3 palms salad is perfect. Tasty, well portioned and perfectly dressed. Spicy salami pizza was delicious. Well timed for coursing. I love the atmosphere of this restaurant and it's nice to have a new pizza option"}
{"text":"On a business trip and wanted pizza for dinner.  After a Yelp search, 3 Palms Pizzeria looked promising.  It is located on the west side of the town square.  While we found parking easily, there is such a concentration of shops & restaurants that could see available parking running out very easily.  We got a table quickly, must have made it before the dinner rush, as most of the tables filled up while we were eating.  Saw a lot of reviewing raving about the meatballs, of which 3 Palms has four, so I ordered the meatball pizza with pepperoni as an extra topping with a microbrew.     The pizza hit the spot, nice and thin with a brick oven's carmelisation on the crust, yum!  3 Palms also had a in-store bakery, so I got a lemon square and some house-made limoncello for dessert- a great way to end dinner.  Total with tip was about $41, average for a meal with two drinks.  Will definitely keep 3 Palms in mind whenever business brings me back to this area.  Repeat and recommend!"}
{"text":"This cute little pizzeria is somewhere everyone must try when visiting the town of Hudson. The staff is energetic and friendly- quick on their feet. The place feels very homey, with wooden floors and walls. The food is fantastic, and cheap! I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, but it was really good. Ask for their special red blend wine! Our bill actually would have only been $15 for the pizza and sodas, but I racked it up to $90 because the wine was so good."}
{"text":"3 Palms is one of those restaurants I would never go out of my way to go to, but I'm still satisfied with. The pizza is very comparable to other wood fire oven pizzas that are in vogue right now, although I do think the prices overall are a tad bit on the high side. For example, we were charged $6 for a bottle of plain San Pellegrino. The interior is upscale, but not fancy. It definitely has an intimate, cozy feel which is heightened by the general lack of space. We ended up sitting at the bar because there was a long wait for a table and the service was great. We had two bartenders taking care of us, which is usually a disaster, but they actually did a great job checking in without being overbearing.  Foodwise I have to mention that the traditional meatball with traditional marinara sauce was to die for; I don't even really like meatballs that much but this was delicious. Again, a little pricey at $8 for a single meatball, but my boyfriend and I split it as an appetizer and weren't disappointed. We also split one of their pizzas. Depending on your appetite, some people might order their own pizza, but we were fine with splitting one and left very full. The menu is almost identical to every other wood fire oven pizza place I've been to, in both variety and price. The flavor of the pie was really good though. I didn't feel that they skimped at all on the toppings, and there was a good proportion of meat, toppings and cheese. They had plenty of dessert options such as a gelato cooler up front as well as some bakery items but we were too fall to take advantage of these on this trip.  Overall I enjoyed it here much more than I expected I would and would definitely return, but only if I was in the general area. Again, because there are so many similar restaurants to this around Cleveland, it's hard for me to justify going out of my way to come here, but I don't think you'd be disappointed if you did."}
{"text":"3 Palms is an interesting restaurant for me. On one hand, I like the concept but on the other hand, food and prices weren't the best.  First, the concept is pretty cool. The decor is nice and cozy, with different elements that gave the restaurant a premium feel. I like the idea of a nice big wood oven and making great food with fresh ingredients. Having a nice open air area for dining while still protected from the elements is a neat feature. Service is friendly, dining room is fairly spacious, and plating is done nicely.  Here are my thoughts on the dishes i ordered:  - Daily fresh baked bread plate: Probably should get some free bread with the meal, but at least this was generously sized. The bread is quite chewy and is served at room temperature, however it is very meaty. There is a ton of Parmesan cheese on top of the bread, however this flavor is somewhat muted -- though it provides some heartiness to the dish. The extra virgin olive oil had a pleasant and bright flavor, but I wish it had a fuller body. The other flavors of the dish completely overpowered the balsamic vinegar but it did add a nice small touch of sweetness and some color to the dish.  - Chicken avocado sandwich: Very fresh, with high quality ingredients. The chicken was very tender and the avocado added a nice earthiness to the dish although it wasn't super creamy. The ciabatta bread was excellent and shone as the star of this dish.  - Fruitti di mare pizza: The basil stood out in this dish, adding a great compliment to the sweetness of the sauce. The tomatoes in this dish had a great texture and juicy bite to them. The seafood was presented plainly, not too salty or seasoned and cooked tender. The dough had a pleasant chewiness.  Funghi pizza: The mushrooms were juicy, dough was tasty with a nice wood flavor, onions added a nice sweetness to the dish. Simple but delicious.  Baked garganelli: Small portion, but this was cooked perfectly al dente. The pasta sauce was nice and sweet and went perfectly with the mix of meat and cheese. The pork flavor really stood out in this dish.   Overall, it was a bit pricey for what I got, but I did like the use of more rustic cooking and overall making efforts to provide a more unique dining experience. I understand their attempts to infuse subtle flavors and introduce a variety of textures and different elements into the dishes -- and maintaining a distinct theme to make each dish unique. I also applaud the use of fresh, high quality ingredients -- though for the price paid I would've liked a few more basil leaves on my pizza or avocado in my sandwich."}
