{"text":"I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by this place.  I've recently been exploring a more vegan lifestyle and I was looking for sweets that I could indulge in while keeping with my new goals.  The doughnuts here are healthy and tasty.  I'm a fan and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Had the BLT&T on awelicious bread for lunch. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place exists!!!   What a relief to be able to eat at a safe restaurant and not have to worry about getting glutened.  The bagels are amazing and so is the hearty breakfast bowl.  I will be back to try everything else on the menu.  :)  Thanks for being there, GFC!!!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Phoenix and my daughter requires gluten free food.  Not knowing anything about what might be good or not good, we found Gluten Free Creations on Yelp and so glad we did.  We each had a gluten free sandwich which was so good.  Definitely not the icky bread that gluten free normally is.  The lady had just made some Rice Krispie squares and was happy to have my granddaughter sample them for her.  Everyone in Gluten Free Creations was so nice and helpful and I'll absolutely be returning there on my next trip to PHoenix!"}
{"text":"Went here again last week. I bought the gluten-free dairy free soy free egg free chocolate chip cookies - delicious!! And the cinnamon sugar donuts? Maybe one of the best things I've ever eaten. Really addicting! I love this place."}
{"text":"I just ordered some items online and received them today, so I tried them out for the first time.   Their donuts are AMAZING!!!   I can't believe they are gluten free, they taste exactly like regular donuts except possibly better.  My teenage son is also weaning off gluten and he had to admit how good these were.    I will definitely order them again!"}
{"text":"Passing through Phoenix when the bright idea struck to look up gluten free food for husband. ..boy oh boy ..me oh my!!! Ok so some people choose to be gluten free. . They tend to like things like bird seed bread and flax-edamame-kelp oatmeal ..organic of course!  Lol..ok not really. .i like all that too. But for my husband he looks for gf food closest to what he used to eat. . Nothing fruffy.. so when I read gluten free biscuits and gravy out loud to him. . He calmly asked where?  I put directions into gps and he suddenly drove as though I was in labor with our first child to this place. .i knew those words were serious and potentially life changing. . But it happened so fast. . One second gluten free  biscuits and gravy were just a dream and moments later they were his reality. His verdict was that it was really good for gf. He also had a gf everything bagel breakfast sandwich.. then tiramasu cheesecake.. all delicious! !! Has a cinnamon roll in here too.. still full.  They were super polite, they ship food. . Have vegan and gf foods.. worth the extra trip!!!"}
{"text":"I went out of my way to visit this bakery during rush hour on my way from San Diego to visit family in Phoenix.  I was extremely disappointed in the selection of cupcakes available and even more so by the cool reception and service from the staff.  He did not strike me as particularly knowledgeable about the products and really just seemed to be biding his time until he got his paycheck.  I bought a variety of cupcakes - the carrot cupcake was great; the others were forgettable.  I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  Whenever we are in Arizona we eat at the bakery.  My daughters have celiac and we are so happy to have discovered Gluten Free Creations. Some other reviews have mentioned the menu being too simple but I am so happy to find a place my daughters can walk into and order an everyday sandwich they just can't get anywhere else, plus the bread size is actually a normal size unlike store brands like Udi's. We love the awelicious bread, buttermilk buscuit, winkies, maple scones and their seasoned bread crumbs!  Since we live out of state we order everything on line which comes delivered on dry ice.  I can't wait for their holiday items to come on line.  Their pumpkin muffins and scones are amazing!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 7/3/17  Just bought 3 Restaurant Sized Awelicious loaves of bread and the first one I start has a gaping hole that spans 4-5 slices of the bread (pic below). What am I supposed to do with this?! I pay around $11 a loaf for this!! Please, work on the texture. It did NOT used to be this bad!!!  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  3 years ago, I was diagnosed with a severe wheat allergy and eating gluten-free is the easiest way to avoid wheat.  Gluten Free Creations gave me a big piece of my life back.  The Awelicious bread and rolls allow me to live what feels like a normal food life at home.  Nothing takes the place of 'real' bread, but GFC came close enough that I was in tears the first time I tried both the bread and roll.  I have been a faithful customer for the last 2.5 years and I probably spend $50 a month there at least.  Bread, rolls, cake, pizza crust, cinnamon rolls, pecan pies, stuffing mix, gravy mix, pie crust mix - I buy it all.  And up until several months ago, I sang their praises to everyone who would listen.  I LOVE this place.  BUT...and it pains me to say this...something has been going on there recently.  Their quality control has been pretty awful.  There was always the chance of getting a big hole in the middle of a loaf of bread -- but it was occasional.  Now every loaf I've bought in the last 3-4 months is full of big holes (will try to upload pics).  It makes spreading anything on toast or even making a grilled cheese sandwich awful -- jelly, butter, melted cheese leaking out of the holes all over the place, etc.    This last visit, there was one bag of Awelicious rolls I was willing to buy and they were unusually flat, but the rest were about 3/4 in high -- they looked like pucks, not rolls.  They literally took up HALF of the package they used to almost fill.  I couldn't bring myself to pay for that -- even through I drove 30 min to get to the store.  Both loaves of Awelicious Restaurant-sized bread were weirdly flat -- one so flat and small that I couldn't bring myself to pay for it, either.  I bought the slightly taller restaurant-sized loaf and a 'regular'-sized loaf instead. That's the restaurant-sized loaf I bought shown in the pictures -- NOT restaurant sized by any stretch of the imagination. And full of holes.  Understand, I've been buying this stuff for years -- I KNOW this product.  They also changed the roll packaging a bit ago to this much thinner plastic and the rolls get freezer-burned much faster now.  Sigh.  Why?  None of what they make here is cheap -- but I have been more than willing to happily pay because the product is (was?) good and it makes a huge difference in quality of life for me.  But I feel lately like I'm not getting their best.  I just want the old Gluten Free Creations back."}
{"text":"The first time I ate an Awelicious hamburger bun from GFC, I actually cried.  It was the first 'real' hamburger I'd been able to have since going gluten-free due to a diagnosed wheat allergy.  The roll was soft, it smelled like bread, it 'crushed' down like a 'real' bun, and it was the perfect proportion of bread to fixins -- every other GF bun I'd tried was this huge mass of dry bread.  I had the same reaction to the awelicious bread -- it smells like bread, it's soft, it's 'real'.  It toasts and grills up great and makes terrific grilled cheese and sandwiches.  But it's actually good and soft enough to eat plain.  This bakery gave me a big piece of my life back.   Favorites are:  Anything awelicious -- bread, hamburger buns, dinner rolls.  The hot dog buns are also terrific.  The cinnamon buns, coffee cake, and cupcakes are divine. I love the banana bread, though honestly it doesn't taste like banana bread to me, but more like a spice bread/cake.  I do love the pizza crust, but wish they'd add one with absolutely NO herbs at all.  Even the Simple crust has herbs in it that alter the taste of the pizza.  A totally plain pizza crust would be fantastic.    I buy their regular flour and cookie flour to cook with.  And the flours are ENRICHED!!!  I've eaten several of their small chocolate cakes and have liked them all.  I'm totally ordering a custom cake for my birthday -- can't wait!!!  :)    They always have samples to try when you go in, which is great.  I go to the 32nd Street location, and they make great sandwiches for lunch.  Can't remember the name of my favorite -- it has turkey, cranberries, and cream cheese and is terrific.    Gluten-Free Creations dramatically improved the quality of my life.  I'm going home to PA this summer for several weeks and will be having GFC ship bread, rolls, cinnamon buns, etc. for my trip.  I can't live without them.  :)"}
{"text":"We ordered my son's birthday cake from here and some cupcakes.  My son has allergies to dairy, wheat, egg, soy, nuts & tree nuts.  Lisa was very helpful in helping me figure out which cake would be best for my son and very accommodating with my requested cake design.  The cake looked great and it tasted really good and most especially, my son loved it!  Even our guests who usually don't care for gluten free, vegan foods liked it!  I am so happy to know that my son will be able to enjoy cakes and cupcakes that are not only safe for him, but also very tastey!"}
{"text":"Lots of options for people for people with food allergies. Everything is gluten free, and they clearly list any other potential allergens on the labels. They also have quite a few vegan options. This location serves coffee, although I haven't yet tried it"}
{"text":"Just went in to take a look and was surprised by the selection. Prices are good and bought a carrot cake cupcake to taste and it was DELICIOUS! I will be back since my son has an allergy to Soy."}
{"text":"I so appreciate having a place to go that I don't have to worry about cross-contamination and getting sick from gluten. They have a tonnn of items in the freezer, but the freshly baked goods looked a bit small for the price, I didn't try any of them however. I had the waffle and my boyfriend had the breakfast bowl and I ended up eating most of his. The staff wasn't very attentive and the atmosphere wasn't great, but I will be back for breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"Ever since I found about about this bakery, I always try to stop there when in town. I especially appreciate that a lot of their items are made without eggs because I'm intolerant of them as well.   They have, without question, the best gluten free, egg free cinnamon raisin bagels I have ever tasted. I also enjoyed their baguettes and the strawberry champagne cupcakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"I do love the food and I've been in there many times but the service is horrible. Three times they have messed up my sandwich order and it was a standard sandwich. I didn't recreate the menu or make it hard for them. The last time I ordered the pumpkin chili and the sign stated that it came with corn bread. I get home and open my order, no corn bread. So, for $8 I got a small container of chili. Almost every time I go in there it is empty, on a few occasions there might be a couple of people. How did they mess up my order four times? It's not like there is some hectic scene in there and they are scrambling around. Instead of being annoyed with my wrong order or lack of an item, I will not be back."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE breads!!!  My favorite is the herb bread.  I sure hope they really are gluten free! :)"}
{"text":"Gluten-free cinnamon rolls were delicious,  their general selection is larger than compared to other stores. I love having that variety. Will be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and retro.  They had some really interesting flavors as well like gluten free  cupcakes and the red velvet cake is amazing  I'd recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"Went in for some gluten free bread and haven't tried it yet. Dennis had me try a sample of their cupcakes and I loved their carrot cake! They have many items on their menu which is nice because of various allergies some people have, which they cater to. Dennis was super kind and I can tell they care about their customers."}
{"text":"Omg blueberry muffin moist delicious best ever took two seconds to eat and needed it to be bigger. Also the chocolate espresso bar was beyond words. Took our taste buds to a whole new level. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"For gf people this is a dream come true! They have awesome food at the café and baked goods to take home. I've only been in phoenix 2 days and I've already been here twice. Definitely going to be back..this place is awesome! I had the Ruben and it was delicious. My non-gf boyfriend had the chicken finger sandwich and loved it as well. They also have samples out to try. Today they had muffins, cake and bread and all were legit.. Just like the real thing! If you're gf and in Phoenix you have to try!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place this weekend .Their sandwich bread is delicious,so are their muffins...everything I had tried was nothing like any other GF baking I have had.Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I come from California where there is gluten free everything on every corner. But this place is different because the owners wife HAS celiacs. I also have celiacs along with all the their top eight food allergens (plus more) and it's really hard to eat out and find a place so dedicated to having allergen free friendly foods.  The service is always amazing, the food always delicious and knowing I won't get sick from what I'm eating due to my allergies is always a plus! They have such a wide variety of foods, that I love to keep stocked in my freezer every week!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Met the owner while we were in. Super nice lady! Will definitely be returning often to buy our gluten free bread and cinnamon rolls and peanut butter cookies !"}
{"text":"Wow I am so thankful I found this place while in town for two days. Walking distance from my hotel. They have everything and it's all gluten free. I've honestly never found a place like this and I'm from Los Angeles! Thank you for creating great unique gluten free food and dairy free options that taste WONDERFUL and are priced at a great price. Thank you thank you! I had the egg sandwich on an everything bagel. SO good! With daiya cheese which is my favorite and soy and dairy free. Wow so good!"}
{"text":"Not so sure what the fuss was about but I was asked to go pick up something here and really got BLAH service from the young man who really could not answer my questions. I did not eat the stuff but the person I picked it up for was disappointed that it was frozen - not fresh and dry."}
{"text":"I'm glad places like this exist! I can finally eat pancakes and donuts without getting sick! Also it's nice to eat goodies without having the feeling that with getting gluten out, you also got everything tasty out! One of my favorite places. If you are on a gluten free diet, you should really go here!"}
{"text":"I can't eat gluten but seriously wanted a donut so I went to check this place out and fell in love, everything is delicious and gf. Lots of vegan options too. I don't know how they do it but seriously can't even tell products don't have gluten. Highly recommend cupcakes, carrot cake, brownies, bread, and donuts."}
{"text":"To those of us recent and longtime sufferers of either wheat allergy or celiac disease this place is a godsend. Their breads, bagels and donuts are way beyond anything I've been able to get at either whole foods or sprouts.   As other reviewers have noted they have several sandwiches they can make for you and every one I've had is good. By far my favorite is the philly cheese steak.  Additionally the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the decor of the bakery is bright and cheery. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Love this bakery!! Very knowledgeable about 8 major food sensitivities, not just gluten but dairy-free, vegan, nut free, etc. everything is labeled impeccably and everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"The bread here is to die for!!!! The best gluten free I have ever tasted. I highly suggest the Tuna Salad sandwich. I will definitely be back and I can't wait to try more of their delicious treats!"}
{"text":"Folks here are extremely nice, helpful, and sensitive to dietary needs. My wife just recently found out she has celiac and gluten free is quite the adjustment to our life. The lady was very helpful with information."}
{"text":"What a treat to find this gluten free oasis in the valley of the sun. I highly recommend this joint for any time meal. Wheat is the enemy! Stay Healthy Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to live so close to this bakery! I can't have gluten or animal products so to be able to have so many options of baked goods here makes me so happy! My favorite items so far are the vegan blueberry muffins- absolutely amazing, vegan apple pie, and the sweet vanilla vegan donuts- taste almost like a churro!   I can't wait to order one of their cakes for events down the road they looks so good! Check out their goodies!"}
{"text":"False advertising!  Three days before Thanksgiving, I tried to order an item they list online -- a full sized sugar-free (gluten-free) apple pie.  They said they are out so I requested they make one for me to pick up in two days.    They said they are not going to make any more before the holiday.  I reminded them that it is listed on their site, but they refused.  Instead they offered a few tiny individual pies, each at 2/3 the price of the full-size.  That is hardly sufficient for the desert for five people I promised my son I would bring.  Two of whom are gluten-free and two of whom are diabetic.  This store needs to learn to stand behind its online presentation.  And to learn how to talk to customers.  I live three blocks from their store on 32nd Street north of Shea Blvd. and will not go back."}
{"text":"I have only been gluten free for 11 years, so it's difficult for me to find places I enjoy eating.  When I found this place I was skeptical at first.  But now years later, I'm so glad I found this place!   The food is great, this service is great, and I can stock up on all of my groceries at the same time.  I also have other food allergies that they are happy to help with.   My favorites:  cookies, bagels, herb bread, cupcakes, brownies, and my list goes on."}
{"text":"Update on draft from below &  this is all from our visit last summer. We went back for 2nd visit. Owner was there & really sweet. Tried a cupcake- really good but the bagels are almost too good to be true.   1st visit:  Sandwich was tasty but I would have needed 3 of them to feel full which wasn't happening @ $8 for sandwich & a bag of chips whose expiration date was 2 days ago. They should label their vegan options more clearly. I am excited to try the bagels I bought, would have tried the new cupcakes but not a big frosting fan - too sweet, & the red velvet was red from food coloring, not beet juice & I don't do artificial colors. Looking forward to the bagels but just not as health-conscious as the Los Angeles vegan/gluten-free."}
{"text":"Yum-mazing! Multiple savored and sweets! Sampled the chocolate donut holes, which tasted like a dense brownie,  as well as a light brownie. ..both went into my bag. Lisa helped me navigate the my way around my other food allergies and hooked me up with bread samples...also took home herb and white bread. Goods are frozen so you can keep them fresh til your ready to oartake. They also have several baking mixes. The bagels looked good as well, but my bag was full! They do ship."}
{"text":"Best gluten free biscuits and gravy, blueberry pancakes, cinnamon rolls, and doughnuts! Celiac heaven for our family! Super friendly and helpful staff. This is our \"happy place\" and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  The bread is the best. This is our new favorite spot for lunch.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about allergies. go figure. finally.  thank you"}
{"text":"Came by here on my birthday and had so much fun eating cup cakes and donuts and pie! Great prices and delicious food! Gluten free as well as vegan, soy free, etc. Love this place and you can stay to eat if you'd like."}
{"text":"The very best gluten free bread.  It is airy thin and remarkable.   Amazing grilled or toasted.  Also good is the chicken tenders and all the sandwiches.  Love this place."}
{"text":"After moving to AZ and leaving our beloved gluten free bakery behind in CA, we were elated to find GFC!! Their Awelicious bread is so good! Even my super picky father-in-law could not tell it was gluten free. The cinnamon rolls are to die for!! Biscuits and gravy mix are on point. We served the vegan cherry pie, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, vegan apple pie, and dinner rolls at Thanksgiving and none of our family members knew they were GF. When we told them, they were in shock at how delicious everything was. This place is a true gem!!"}
{"text":"I'm on a gluten and casein free diet and this is one of several gluten free bakeries I can go to enjoy gluten and dairy free treats. Unfortunately this is last on that list of my favorite places. The old owner is not very friendly and doesn't talk much. The cupcakes are kinda dry, which is kind of disappointing. Their donuts are good though, as I love cake donuts. Go to jewels for better cupcakes and friendlier and knowledgeable service"}
{"text":"Planned our Arizona vacation around this place, and truly, we were not disappointed.  We have eaten there every day.  My 8 year old daughter has Celiac disease and it is very challenging finding places where we can go out to eat.  It was so fun for her to have so many options!  Everything was delicious, but she really liked the breakfast sandwich on a jalapeno cheese bagel.  We stocked up on plenty more items to take back to CA with us.  We will continue to order on line but, it would be great if they would consider opening a store in Orange County."}
{"text":"Don't own a gluten free shop if your not gluten free yourself. Old guy could not answer any questions about gluten free products and any possible symptoms. The whole place is one giant freezer. Let us buy the stuff fresh and we can freeze it on our own. Uninviting atmosphere in rundown strip mall."}
{"text":"I think I have a love/not-so-love relationship with them.  My sons allergies and intolerance make it a GREAT find!  We greatly appreciate all the precise and highlighted labeling.  I am vegan so it makes choices for me great!  The not-so-love is that is it seems expensive (but all gluten-free pretty much is), I wish their hours were longer and it was not possible to make special orders for a wedding.  It was disappointing because I wanted their items for my son and family members.   So, we really like the food and choices but the cost, hours and orders are a bit of a negative."}
{"text":"Great place! We are from outta town and were on the search for something gluten free! This place is great! We got sprinkle-donuts which was a huge hit for my 6 year old. We got some to eat there and some to take home along with a cinnamon roll things (can't wait to try!) the owners are great. You can tell they know what they are doing. And on the plus size they ship!  thanks guys for helping us out today!"}
{"text":"Thank God for this place !!! It's so hard to find Gluten, Soy, Diary free desserts.  We tried the brownies and cinnamon bagels and they are so amazing.  I am on happy camper today !!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I are visiting from Florida and her youngest daughter has celiac disease so finding GF cafe to try caused us to do a happy dance! They had nice options for lunch so we tried the burger and the rueben sandwich.  The  rueben was outstanding!  I wish I had ordered it instead of the burger.  I ordered the burger on the same bread as a sandwich to try to make it more like a patty melt.  Unfortunately, the sandwich was brought out cold with the cheese  unmelted.  I sent it back and asked for it to be pressed which they were more than happy to do.  This solved the issues with it being cold.  The burger itself was flavorless but the delicious house slaw I got as a side helped.  I'm guessing the  hamburger patties are frozen but if not, a lot more seasoning is needed.  Everyone has loved the cupcakes particularly the strawberry and champagne flavored ones.  Overall, it was a nice surprise to find this cafe as they don't have any offerings like this where we live.  Very good customer service.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Absolutely love it! I have food allergies so finding foods that I can eat can be challenging and frustrating. The selection they have is wonderful. From the gluten-free, diary-free and egg-free bagels, the chocolate chip cookies, the pumpkin chocolate chip cookies to my husband's favorite - the jalapeno bagels. It all tastes terrific. I highly recommend this place especially if you have food allergies. I'm so happy we discovered this place. We'll be going back again!"}
{"text":"Gluten. Free. Heaven. They have just about any bakery item you can think of- bagels, bread, donuts, cupcakes, pie, cake, muffins, scones... and its ALLLLL gluten free. A lot of the stuff they offer is dairy free as well. The staff was super nice and super helpful. Ended up walking out with huge bag of over 10 items!"}
{"text":"yeah.  skip it.  microwave breakfast food.  gross.     maybe the other stuff in the freezers is ok but given their lack of storefront and business, i'm not willing to try."}
{"text":"After reading a number of health articles and PBS programs that explained how so many common ailments can be eliminated by excluding gluten from one's diet, I've been trying to cut down on consumption of gluten -containing foods -- not an easy task since it's in so many common food items. This bakery is a great place to get prepared foods and baking ingredients that are gluten free, and they sell great stuff! The kitchen also serves gluten-free dishes for a quick snack or substantial lunch. The foods here are not as inexpensive as regular foods in ordinary stores; this is understandable since flours and other ingredients made from sweet rice, white rice, potatoes, and other gluten-free foods are not as readily available or as inexpensive as conventional bakery ingredients."}
{"text":"The quality here has almost made me stop missing gluten. Haven't yet had anything that didn't impress me.  And their pecan pie. Sweet mother of God; that pecan pie."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Had an absolutely amazing lunch our first visit. Bean burger & BLT were delicious and very satisfying. Grilled cheese deluxe was creamy and tastey, though perhaps a bit skimpy on the bacon.  Went back for breakfast following day. Waffle is very tastey, but way too crispy. I like waffles just crisp on outside, light golden brown and chewy on inside. This was hard, over-crispy and hard to eat. I noticed a customer eating an over-crisped waffle the day before too. My fault for not asking for \"lightly cooked\".  Egg scramble with sausage, vegan cheese on a biscuit was ok. Could have used some sautéed pepper & onion. Would have loved Daiya cheddar cheese too instead of what tasted like mozzarella. The chef was very kind and thoughtful to remember I had a dairy intolerance and put the scramble gravy on the side. The waffle had a side of real butter though. Glad I chose not to eat that.  Overall, this is a new favorite eatery. Very impressive selection of chilled goods. GF Doughnut was amazing! Samples of their herbed bread, amazing! Lovely little dining area. Starbucks coffee. To-go meals. Birthday cakes in freezer plus custom cake services.  Love this hidden gem. Reasonably priced and high quality from staff to food. Will go again every visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"i went here for a friend's birthday brunch! it was located behind the denny's and in the same center as peter piper pizza. google maps takes you across the street just FYI :)   everyone loved the monte carlo sandwich. it was a hit!   our server was super friendly. they had a huge assortment of GF options and also listed other potential allergens in their food on the menu (egg, soy, etc)   in addition to their menu, they had a bakery to take home some goodies as well as pre packed mixes to make the bread and I assume other GF baked goods yourself. they also sell their GF flour.  apparently, if you have a gluten allergy...according my friend this is the best and most delicious option she's been able to find!"}
{"text":"Gluten free lovers dream.  So much to choose from!  They also had several items you could taste test. They had ready made goodies as well as mixes.   Can't wait to make the gluten free brownies.  My only complaint was the lack of parking at this location."}
{"text":"We stopped in today at GFC for the first time and were greatly surprised at the selection they offer (the only reason for 2 stars). I have to eat gluten free and was excited at all the options...they truly have anything you could imagine. But be prepared that everything here is frozen AND there are also no prices posted! We were certainly surprised when we paid $25 for a 6\" cake. But we really wanted to try it as it is something that I have missed. The cake lacked any flavor whatsoever...it was a simple \"yellow\" cake with white frosting. There was no vanilla, no sugar flavor, just bland and grainy. Absolutely disgusting and a waste of $25.  The service was lacking as we had to wait 5 minutes for the employee at the front to finish her \"private\" conversation with a customer and then she didn't even acknowledge us. She was all over the place and seemed unable to focus. When the next customers came in she greeted them and tried to carry on a conversation with them while we were still paying. Very unprofessional.   Overall, we will not be back. There is another gluten free bakery down the street that is much better...and has fresh options!"}
{"text":"If you have someone in your life that has celiac or any type of wheat or gluten allergy this is the place.  Their bagels, waffles and herb bread are works of art made with love.   i don't know how they do it... and I don't really care... I just LOVE that they DO!  The waffles are my favorite and my girlfriend that has severe celiac is obsessed with the bagels.  She told me this is all she wants for her birthday forever!   The noodles that look like egg noodles are a little mushy when cooked so I won't be getting those again, but I was going to fill up on bagels and waffles anyway."}
{"text":"Wow what a selection of gluten free. Haven't seen anything like this back in the North East. We got breakfast here. I got the biscuits and gravy which was delicious. My wife got a breakfast sandwich on a gluten free bagel. Good but she didn't like the turkey bacon, either did I. Overall good place, especially for those with food allergies. Tons of dessert choices. We got a cupcake to go. Looks like dessert is their specialty."}
{"text":"Beyond friendly staff & beyond tasty GF options. I've eaten here twice now for lunch and taken to-go bakery items home on several occasions......never a disappointment! My favorite sandwich is the Rachel, which I enjoyed on 7/22/14 and believe is on the menu all the time. My favorite sweet treat is the strawberry champagne cupcake.....this is by far the greatest marriage of indulgence and lightness all at once. Some other favorites have been the frosted brownies and the sliced whole grain bread....best when toasted then topped with coconut oil and avocado :)"}
{"text":"100% gluten free without question. I love that I don't have to ask.  We've been there for the hot food and the frozen foods as well as ordered a cake.   Always a good experience and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm into gluten free stuff. my kid has diagnosed with gluten issues and i come here for the pastry especially the lemon raspberry pound cake they are very good here. when i came in, they explained everything to me about how they make the cakes very good the cake was good with tea bc it was dry the inside is very cute LOVE it here"}
{"text":"Tasty GF and vegan options in a quaint little cafe/store filled with friendly, knowledgeable people. One of our favorite stops!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review about this place for a while.  About a year ago I found out that I was allergic to gluten (join the club right?) and had a hard time finding food that was GF and still tasted good.  This place is the best I have had.   The best thing on their menu is the strawberry champagne cupcakes.  They are so moist and soft.  Pretty much the opposite of most Gluten Free foods.  I recently tried their quiche and it was so amazing.  You really cannot tell that the food here is GF.  The price is about right (GF is expensive no matter where you go so the prices here are very fair I think) But, the real reason I wrote this review finally....is because of Dennis.  I see him every time I am there and he always is patient and answers all of my questions.  10 stars for great GF foods, and excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"I was searching for gluten free bakery for my fiance. What an amazing place! I bought him some treats and he loved it. They have wide selection from breads to cookies. The owner was very pleasant and helpful. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Good product- if you buy it, it will be frozen most likely. Also, no ordering from the menu unless it's Thursday-Saturday."}
{"text":"Best gluten free bakery in the valley. My son who has multiple food allergies can eat a good portion of what they make in store..... we LOVE the donuts!!!! And the carrot cake is just simply Devine......my only gripe is that I wish they would use natural plant based coloring and sprinkles.... red #40 is nobodies friend."}
{"text":"Bread, cookies, cupcakes and sandwiches, oh mylanta!  If you have celiac, you miss certain things.  I love that you can get things to go for your freezer, and some of them are dairy free or vegan (darn cross sensitivities!)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Had the gluten free burger and it was great.  All the kids loved their meals.  Glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"Had the turkey reuben today. It's small, but good. You can't tell the bread is gluten free. I also bought a dozen frozen chocolate chip cookies and a piece of avalanche cake with a $25 groupon.  I've been here a few times and the same employee helped me. He's super nice and knows a lot about their products. He always asks about food allergies before he makes my food. There were more employees--maybe the owners--milling around and they were really nice too.   It's not what you'd think of as a bakery since a lot of their stuff is frozen. They always have samples, which is a bonus! Chocolate chip cookies are one of my specialties, so I'm a tough critic, but theirs are almost addicting (they say customer favorite on the label). The snickerdoodles are great too. I've tried a lot of their cupcake flavors and didn't care for them too much. They're small and the cake is a little dry, but still tasty--especially for gluten free. This place is a gem! Want to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Food looks good... Unfortunately, I never got to try anything.  Walked into the store this morning, March 30th, and wasn't helped at all. Felt like the woman in the store was ignoring me. I've never been in there before this time... Not too thrilled with the service this woman just present me with. Walked up to the register and she busied herself with stuff around the register instead of acknowledging me. And never once came to my table. Left after several minutes (with an empty belly)."}
{"text":"Finally! Delicious food I can eat! I have been going here for several months. They have a large selection of so many delicious goods. I have tried so many other places that have gluten free baked goods, all of which have been disgusting. Everything they offer is so yumtastic and doesn't even taste like it's gluten free. I have tried just about everything in this store and have not been disappointed. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. They always greet me with a smile and have samples at the counter daily. I just wish that their hours were more flexible, but they definitely have the best gluten free food you will ever find so check it out!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! I don't have a problem eating gluten, just decided to try this place because it was close to work. The food is so good!! Had the deluxe grilled cheese and cinnamon roll -- loved every bite. Will be back, recommend this place for everyone, even those who typically eat gluten."}
{"text":"*The kitchen hours are: Tues-Fri: 10am-4pm and Sat: 10am-2pm.  I was really excited to try their food as my boyfriend was in dire need of a sandwich and they also have vegan options. However, we were given a business card by someone at their Thomas Road location which had the wrong hours on it and we were told their kitchen had closed at 4pm and not 5pm as the old business cards state. Oh well.  I snagged the last sample of the \"Simply Ginger Donut\"  which was absolutely delicious! The women were very helpful in pointing out the gluten free, vegan options. I purchased: chocolate cupcakes with vanilla icing and sprinkles, personal size pizza dough (2 to a package), herb baguettes (2 to a package), and the Simply Ginger Donut. I have had better cupcakes but the ginger donut is quite good. They also make a bundt cake out of the same stuff they use to make the ginger donut. I purchased the herb baguettes because they had gotten such rave reviews from other Yelpers. I also read that they make a fabulous cake so the boyfriend will be getting a vegan and gluten free cake from here in the near future. Will report back then!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but great stuff.   French Dip was great, and the Snickerdoodles are AMAZING.   People behind the counter are super-helpful, asking you if you have questions on anything.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Its unfortunate that the customer service here SUCKS! The gluten free food is delish but every time my husband goes there to get me something, he is treated like crap. Keeping my ordering there to a limit. Would rather just deal with them online then in person."}
{"text":"They made my 8 year-old son's gluten-free, Captain America birthday cake, and it was both beautiful and delicious!  Everyone (including non-GF guests) raved about it."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ. Did a google search for gluten free bakery. Went to the address off of E Thomas and the people there said this is their main bakery and the store front is off of Mc Dowell. I live in Glendale so that's a 35min drive!   We get there and it's a huge freezer with a few chairs and tables. No one greeted us or told us anything about them. Everything's is frozen and not fresh like other bakeries I've been to not in AZ. The old guy behind the register didn't even make eye contact with me and didn't say a word. Very uninviting atmosphere.    I didn't order anything there because I didn't even know that they serve food there too! I bought donuts and cupcakes and the price was ridiculous! Where I'm from Haven On Earth Bakery in Reno,NV $20 could get me twice as much than what I got there! The donuts were horrible never again and the cupcakes were very moist and sticky.   I would like to go back and try something different and order food because I had no idea and it would have been nice if we were greeted and told a lil more about them but no.    I'm hesitant about going back just because no one in the store talks to you and I tried to have a conversation but nothing. The donuts are horrible they should try a new recipe but I can't really judge them based off two items I got but customer service needs work and if they want people coming back and wanting to come back they should try to build a relationship with their customers! I would enjoy going back if they were nice and inviting, also provide fresh bakery items instead of frozen ones."}
{"text":"After noticing the bakery one day I decided to stop in and give a few things a try. When I walked in the owner was stocking the freezer with fresh bagels which is what I originally came in for. He helped me explain how everything was set up. I picked out my bagels I wanted to try and while also showing me the menu he pointed out they had about 5 or 6 samples of items. I tried them all and they were all amazing. The pineapple upside down cupcakes were so yummy and so was the spiced cake. The spiced cake was the moistest and flavorful cake I've had in a long time. Soooo, add that to my order! LOL It wasn't a very big cake (4x4) but you can get bigger. I cut it in small bite size pieces at home so I didn't eat it all in one sitting. Everyone who tried it really liked it and couldn't believe it was gluten free! I can't wait to go back and try more yummy goods!"}
{"text":"Just after the first of the year my other half found our she has a ton of food allergies. Beef, dairy, gluten, egg whites being some of the big ones. She loves sweets and with all those allergies it is very tough to find any desserts to fit the criteria. GFC handled it nicely as I got her some gluten/dairy/egg free chocolate cupcakes for her birthday and she loved them. Thanks for the great cupcakes fitting the stringent requirements GFC!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, GF or not!  I love the Monte Cristo or the Rasp. Vinaigrette Grilled Chicken Flatbread!  They have great breakfast choices, try the Ooey Gooey Goodness and thank me later!  Not to mention they have freezers with take home items like pizzas, bread and more!  Regardless if you have gluten issues, if you like good grub then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Can we talk about how delicious EVERYTHING is here?! From their everything bagel breakfast sandwiches (bagel, egg, bacon, & cheese) to their cupcakes (try the carrot cake!), this bakery will definitely satisfy your gf cravings!  Oh! And I did I mention it's super easy to find and the staff is awesome? Love it! I would've post a picture of my meal, but I devoured it!"}
{"text":"Gluten free products so good, you'll be afraid you're eating gluten! This place is a little piece of heaven on earth! Delicious, flavorful, moist, multidimensional gluten free products. I've been gluten intolerant for almost 6 years - eating out creates a lot of anxiety at this point. It's so refreshing a whole restaurant would be gluten free!! Today I ordered their cinnamon roll - it's more delicious than how I remember a gluten Cinnabon. I've had their cookies & cupcakes before too from friends bringing their products to events."}
{"text":"With three months of Gluten-Free life under our belts, we have found that most GF substitutes are hardly palatable.  GF Bakery has some great creations.  The Red Velvet Cake is awesome (and not dry).  The breads are so much better than the varieties found in with the big-box grocers."}
{"text":"We love this place!!!! I have a child with Celiac. Our favorite is the Awelicious Bread. I have visited 2 locations and this is the closest to me. They have a small breakfast and lunch menu which we have enjoyed. Last time I was there though they did not have a soda fountain. So if you want a drink they have canned soda or bottled water in a small fridge. They also have coffee of course. Their prices are a little high, however, they also cater to other allergies such as egg and dairy so it's worth it I think.  The customer service is always great and on my first visit, they gave me a few different samples of bread so I could choose what I wanted. They always have other samples available and my kids love to visit because of it! It is so comforting to know this place exists."}
{"text":"Love this place! GFC also caters to egg and dairy allergy sufferers. There are many options for baked goods for everyone. We are die-hard fans of the Awelicious Bread.   As a café, it's quaint with some tables and chairs, and toys, yes, toys, off to the side. Everytime I have been there, there is always a newspaper or two. I've had the cheeseburger, hotdog, beet salad, kale salad, and BLTT. All are really good. It's very comforting to have some place to take my Celiac kid to. We rarely eat out, if at all.   From the bakery, I have tried many different things, but my son greatly prefers their Whoopie Pies. I keep some in the freezer at all times and take them out whenever we have to go to a birthday party for example. We also have really enjoyed their pizza crusts, cupcakes and birthday cakes."}
{"text":"VERY good cup of coffee! Pour over was simple and top notch and I'm a coffee snob from downtown Phx."}
{"text":"They have my all-time favorite bagel. I eat gluten sadly, but their bagel is still the best, even superior to gluten packed bagels. Its not too big, not too airy and missing substance, just right. They are so polite and always express their gratitude for my business."}
{"text":"I came in this morning to try and order a pastry for breakfast, and a man named Bruce was running the front of house. He checked in and we told him we were looking around and that we'd be ready in a minute. He proceeded to take a phone call, which is understandable. But when we were ready to order we waited by the cash register while he remained on the phone, totally ignored us, and turned his back to us and started making himself a cup of coffee!!!! This was such an awful experience which is so disappointing since I love their products so much. I'll never be back, this service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Had a Reuben but could have had ANYTHING on the menu - that is such a treat when typically one has to make a special request and wonder about a reaction. The wall of frozen items will tempt you to take treats home too. Worth a trip across the valley!"}
{"text":"Visiting here to purchase goodies for a GF friend, I feel so blessed I'm not GF!!!  Pricing is outrageous ($10 for 4 cupcakes and $10 for 4 muffins: not even average sized; and, $7 for 6 cookies)!  It's no wonder they had to close one of their stores.  After paying what I would have paid to feed myself and my other 3 family members for a few days (home cooking).  I left hopeful my friend would LOVE the treats...fast forward two hours.  She felt extremely loved that I purchased her these goodies; but, extremely disappointed in taste.  She's been GF for almost 8 years now and these treats left a bad taste in her mouth (literally).  So sad for people to be taken advantage of for being GF."}
{"text":"I was watching this segment from an old \"20/20\" type show, and they had interviewed one of the owners of Babycakes bakery in NYC.  The lady was talking about how people will come in to their bakery and start to cry...either because it's been so long since they've had certain food items, or they can finally give their kids a little bit of normalcy by allowing them to eat a cookie or cupcake.  I guess that segment came to mind when I walked into this place.  It's been so long since I've had a hamburger with a bun.  Or a hot dog with a bun.  Or a sandwich not wrapped in lettuce.  I really thought I was going to cry.      No doubt, it's a little pricey.  But what GF baked foods aren't?  Difference here is that their breads are incredible.  Absolutely the best.  Whereas frozen breads from the grocery store are (to me anyway) gross, the flavor and texture of their breads is so good, even the non-GF eaters in my family enjoyed trying a few bites!  This place is amazing.  If only they'd consider opening another location in northern AZ!!"}
{"text":"Accidentally found this place when my brother in law came down to visit after diagnosed with Celiac disease. Great gluten free bakery!!  Owners very helpful and great resources. They were able to sample their products and take some home!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional bakery. The baked products are delicious as well as the sandwiches that are made with only the finest and freshest ingredients. The bakery offers pre made delectable pastries and breads, pizzas and dough to make your own. They always have a wide variety in which to choose. The other location in Scottsdale bakes cakes for special occasions. I highly recommend trying them. They offer gluten free and vegan too."}
{"text":"BEST GLUTEN FREE FOOD AND PRODUCTS ANYWHERE.  My daughter has been all over the country eating gluten free and this place has the best bakery and food items of anywhere she has been.  I tried them as well and they are outstanding.  Like someone said..THANK GOD FOR THIS PLACE.  It is fabulous for those that must be gluten free."}
{"text":"The baked goods were good, reasonably priced. Staff was kind and very helpful. My wife and I had lunch (2 sandwiches and 2 cookies) for $20 and we got a stamp card for further discounts with return business.  It was tough for us was that the cookies we purchased were 6 days old and tasted like the plastic bag they were in. Also the setting wasn't all that appealing. I would go back if I had to get GF bread (or something else GF) but probably wouldn't go out of my way to go."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while visiting Arizona for spring training. I tried their ooey-gooey cinnamon roll which was delicious. My aunt tried the breakfast bowl, I tried it and would have definitely gotten it myself if the cinnamon roll wasn't so filling. They also have a great array of packaged breads and sweets. I brought home a package of their cheddar jalepeno bagels and poppyseed almond scones. Both were full of flavor and traveled well on my flight home."}
{"text":"Very very friendly to my tummy! And really amazing people that staff and frequent the establishment.  Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to get a yummy sweet. The strawberry champagne cupcake was still a bit frozen but OMG was it delicious. So flavorful and yummy. My husband had a blueberry muffin that honestly tasted like a dream. So fluffy and melt in your mouth. He also got a chocolate rice krispy treat that was really good."}
{"text":"Thank you for making baked products that taste so good I forget they don't have gluten! Then I found out I have dairy and yeast sensitivities- more difficult to avoid than gluten these days. I visited this place and to my joyful surprise found plenty of products that fit my needs AND they are all exceptional tasting- like better than a normal cake! My favorite is the Triple Chocolate Marble Bundt Cake- so moist and delicious icing plus mini chocolate chips throughout. Their cakes, bread, rolls, and cookie dough all are on point and I look forward to tasting more of their variety. This store is a lifesaver. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I recently had a large baby shower and placed an order for 4 dozen gluten-free Vegan cupcakes,plus muffins, cofffee cake and awelicious bread for a brunch shower!  The cupcakes were decorated to match the invitation, absolutely darling!  AND DELICIOUS!  We kept the entire shower gluten free to accomodate the mom-to-be and myself, the hostess!  And everyone was in AWE that they were eating gluten free!  I think you possibly may have gained a few new customers/converts to GF as a result!  Thank you for making healthy, delicious baked goods!"}
{"text":"I haven't even tasted the cake and cupcakes I just bought, but after searching for two days for anything gluten and dairy free, I am so happy this place even exists!! My baby can have a cake on his birthday!!! 5 stars in my book"}
{"text":"I love gluten free creations! The Awelicious bread is by far the best gluten free bread you will ever eat! I also appreciate that my boys can get beautiful cakes that look amazing and decorative even with their food allergies. Bonus: they taste better than regular cakes!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and the staff is helpful and friendly. My husband is not gluten free but loves everything here. I always have to get a bag of the peanut butter cookies before I leave!  So nice to have such good gluten free options!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have a nice, quiet breakfast or lunch. I'm crazy about the vegan burger (I sub an everything bagel) with vegan cheese and mayo. All their vegan goodies are delicious  The staff is always so friendly and attentive. Love that they are so close to home!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The chocolate ganache cake, lemon poppy seed muffin, and chocolate cupcake were just samplers of the yumminess!!! My mom and SIL and I found this place and I can't wait to go in again to eat more gluten free yumminess((: I have Celiacs disease and am currently pregnant so this was probably my dream place to find something sweet. I really want to try their breakfast cafe but they have separate hours for that (most likely the cook is off during specific hours. I am ecstatic!!"}
{"text":"Awesome #glutenfree #dairyfree yummy food! Try the Awelicious Bread, rolls, amazing cupcakes, pies, main dishes and holiday stuffing etc. also a great lunch place! I wish they would open near me in Downtown Mesa but when I can make the time it is worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"Super amazing for gluten free delights!! I am so happy we are here! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Lots of variety for gluten free,  from bread,biscuits, cupcakes, and pies, plus more. Great taste and texture and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The first time I went there they were closing. They told me to come on in and served me anyway. They were extremely pleasant and explained their foods to me. I am celiac and was VERY pleased with the service and the bagels. I am a regular customer now and know their operating times by heart."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate there.  What a wonderful experience. We ordered three things to see how it went - A Reuben, a fish sandwich on  a roll and biscuits with sausage gravy.  They were all perfect - I couldn't believe it.  I will definitely be making this place a regular for lunches and groceries.  Also, we bought to go bagels, a carrot cake, chocolate doughnuts, and Italian bread.  If Ii can I'll update with the results.  Wow - just wow"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The food is delicious, the options are outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. We visited regularly when on vacation and now that we've moved here, we go even more often. We enjoy taking our family here when they visit. Dietary concerns are a big issue for me, so having gluten-free options is priceless!"}
{"text":"Awesome people, even better food. Went for breakfast with the wifee and had the Biscuits and Gravy, which I can't remember the last time I had. So grateful we found this place. I was going to take a pic but when the Biscuits and Gravy came out I couldn't wait.  Highly recommend trying"}
{"text":"Charming place off 32nd St. near Shea.  Very nice people and reasonable prices. Lots of organic treats plus The entire store is gluten-free."}
{"text":"I'm not gluten intolerant or living gluten free or anything of the sort. I'm just one of those people who finished eating a giant meal of noodles a couple doors down at the Thai place and wanted to see how much more I could eat, so I wandered in to GFC with my coworker.   The ladies were so so sweet. All smiles and had no issue explaining and recommending different things they loved. Also, there were samples of different brownies next to the front door. These pushed us over the edge - I would never know they were gluten free. VERY good.  So we ended up walking out with a little lemon cream cheese bundt cake under the ruse of giving it to our boss. It was drier than anticipated, but was absolute perfection with tea. Would definitely buy all the cakes and brownies."}
{"text":"The VERY BEST simple breakfast + lunch. The gluten free selection is incredible. You can order from their website as well, or purchase at their location. Everything bagels are phenomenal, you would not be able to tell the difference."}
{"text":"I recently visited Gluten Free Creations while in Phoenix. We ate breakfast there twice and bought $50 in bagels and bread to take home in our suitcase. I love their bagels! I have tried the \"everything\", cinnamon raisin and Jalapeño cheese. The texture is incredible. I am going to be sad when my stock runs out! I have been gluten free for eight years and have tried many bread products over the years. These are the best.  My husband and I had the breakfast bagel both times we ate there. It is delicious. I will definitely visit them anytime I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was a happenstance! We were across the street and looked up to see a gluten free bakery. We have been turned off by gluten free bakeries before, but this place was something different. The staff there was awesome! Super nice and let us try whatever we wanted. We bought a rye loaf of bread, which actually tasted like bread! We would go back in a heartbeat. Even though we only tried their rye and white bread, definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I can't believe I actually could eat chocolate cake on my birthday!! I had the gluten free, dairy free chocolate cake and it was so good! I ate half the cake... in 2 days so don't judge.   It had a deep chocolate flavor with a hint of cinnamon which was different, but not bad. The ingredients didn't list cinnamon but I could definitely taste a hint of it. The frosting wasn't that airy whipped stuff that I despise. It was real, thick, chocolate frosting. The texture of the cake was perfectly moist. Normally, gluten free cake is dry or has a strange flavor from the flour. Not this one! You won't miss the dairy or gluten.   I highly recommend this bakery. I can't wait to go back and try everything else they have!"}
{"text":"One of the best gluten free bakeries I have been to! Caters to gluten , egg and dairy allergies!! The owner was so nice and accommodating !! Will be back soon !"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and never got around to reviewing them until now. This place is AWESOMENESS!!!! Not only am I gluten intolerant but I am vegan and this place has something for everyone. My mom even loves there bread and she has no gluten allergy.  Just finished eating an everything bagel and OH MY GOD!! Thank you GFC for making gluten free and vegan bread taste so delicious. I'll be getting Thanksgiving dessert from here and I can't wait."}
{"text":"I went to Sprouts and picked up the GF bread.  It was like a brick.........tough, hard and very unappealing.  I have heard from other friends how horrible the bread selection in their area is.....I was so bummed.  I love bread.  Love it, love it, love it.  Only further up on the list is my love of Pizza and Pasta (more on that in the next post!)  So last Saturday, I got the Hubs to take me around on errands.   Before our lunch at Indulge Burger, we journeyed into Gluten Free Creations Bakery and Cafe.  It's located at 76th Street and McDowell and it's well worth the journey.  Upon entering the Cafe we were greeted and asked if we needed help finding anything.  I was pretty sure we could find what I was looking for so I declined help.  We were able to check out the frozen items and I picked out a loaf of Herb bread and a loaf of Cheddar Cheese bread.  I then saw chocolate chip cookies and pounced on them.  There are no prices listed for these items and you honestly don't want to know them!  Okay, I'll tell you.  $12.99 for a dozen cookies and $8.99 for each loaf of bread.  My total came to over $30 with tax, etc.  Pricey, oh, yeah.  worth it.  You betcha!  So we make it to the counter, fully intending to pay and leave, and the cashier asks if we want to try some samples.  Um, yeah!  We tried the snickerdoodles (which I should have turned the chocolate chip cookies back in for they were so good!)  I'll get them next time......  Oh, then we tried the \"Insane Chocolate Donuts4U\".........6 donuts for $9.99 and they are SOOOOOOOOO worth it. My husband was ready to kill for a whole one and he can eat regular donuts!  I would say that's a score for GFC!  Now, we also tried the Cinnamon Coffee Cake which I didn't care for (due to an aftertaste) but The Hubs enjoyed it........again!  I have to give 5 out of 5 stars to this discovery!  I will be back again and again!  Oh, and you should be happy to frequent many of the fine restaurants (like Pugsy's) who serve their bread....it's good!  Oh, so good!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been on this gluten free,  dairy free journey since she was diagnosed 6 years ago and this is by far the best bakery we have found.  If you are ever in the Phoenix, AZ area you must check them out.  Best news, they ship most of their products, so when we go back home we can still treat ourselves to some delicious donuts, banana bread, herb loaves and carrot cake bread.  YuM!"}
{"text":"Damn Jessica F for getting the FTR on this!   I made my first trip out to this new GFC location this weekend and was really excited to see an expanded retail area and the addition of sandwiches. If you have ever been to the other location on Thomas, you will be very happy with the increased selections and moving room!  As usual, all of the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, and very very knowledgeable about their products.   I got some vegan gf donuts that taste a lot like gingerbread in addition to the herb baguette rolls, vegan banana cupcakes, vegan chocolate chip cookies, and hot dog buns. Everything has been great so far and I love that everything goes in the freezer.  I am also really excited that they bake vegan gf cakes in multiple sizes! This is great since I am normally left out of the cake club during birthdays!  All around a great place that caters to those of us with special diets! Thanks GFC!  :0)"}
{"text":"Love love love. I got the chocolate cupcake which was absolutely amazing - couldnt even tell the difference. And I got the vanilla donut with sprinkles. Still haven't found a doughnut that's gluten free that tastes like the real thing but it was super tasty! Can't wait to go back and try more amazing gluten free creations!"}
{"text":"Yum! I absolutely love this place. The boyfriend and I are obsessed with the cinnamon rolls and cinnamon donuts. They serve turkey bacon (one of the best I've had) that is thick and flavorful. Pretty much everything that I've tried has exceeded my expectations for a gluten free meal/treat.   Another awesome part about this place is that you can buy all the gluten free flours premixed and ready to bake with. The gluten free flour mixtures are hard enough to get right on your own. They do it for you and it's cheaper then any grocery store.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after reading all the reviews and it being close to my hotel.   It is clean inside and the staff is very friendly. She informed me of all the food they have.   I ordered the turkey blt with the house slaw.   The sandwich was good! Even the gluten free bread was delicious. Thin and crispy.   What I didn't like was the small portion size. I was still hungry after eating here.  Also the slaw was disgusting. Inedible. I threw it away.   Was it worth the price? No.  Would I eat here again? No.  would I recommend this place? Only if you have a gluten allergy and your not that hungry."}
{"text":"I'm glad to say I could try this treat recently. My S.O. is very anti-Gluten and it is angering at times. But this place was great. I can't say it's exactly my style but still a great place. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love that they list whether or not their items contain common allergens/sensitivities and I especially appreciate that they highlight the not-so-common sensitivities in the ingredients list. I'm just visiting but I would definitely come back next time... Or maybe before I leave :)"}
{"text":"Located in a busy plaza next to a busy bar and workout space, this place seemed pretty popular even with a Denny's in the same parking lot. What I liked is the quaint, café feel and samples of gluten free pastry's.  There was a case along the side of premade items for purchase as well.  I liked the breakfast options.  I went with the breakfast sandwich on an English muffin.  I wish I had the option of an over easy egg but they used a premade egg which kinda stinks but was still tasty.   We also got potato chips which I thought was odd. Would have preferred half a banana or some grapes (just throwing it out there!)  I didn't get any of their pastry's but judging by their samples you would not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A cute storefront with limited indoor and outdoor seating, we came for the baked goods. Cakes, pies, breads the choices are endless. We came out with cake, brownie and pancake mixes, gravy mix, bagels, sage and sausage stuffing, cookie dough... We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"After traveling through the desert on foot with my pet donkey (pumpkin) we landed at Gluten Free Creations.  YES!!!!! Finally a Gluten free place that has bread that taste normal! (Sorry GF peeps). The cinnamon roll, cheese sandwich, applesauce, everything we had was amazing. When you first walk in they have samples which is smart because now my wife wants to buy everything! Service was fresh, fast, and...fresh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good service, many treats :) maybe a little more \"unfrozen\" food would be better since not everyone has a freezer in hotel :)"}
{"text":"A great place to buy baked goods, including a wonderful assortment of bagels and breads, for those with food allergies. Sandwiches on menu could be improved a little. Everything I have purchased to use at home has been delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is gluten free heaven! Bread, cakes and pies OH MY! But not just the baked goodies, the sandwiches which are made to order are wonderful. I recently stopped in and had the Reuben and couldn't have been more satisfied. The customer service is also top notch. The awelicious bread is my favorite. The ganache- oh my word- exquisite! Can't say enough nice things about this place. I'd give it six stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place. I have been GF for about a year (not by choice). I was so glad to find them.  Best GF bagels I have tasted, Cheddar Jalapeno specifically. Recently I got to try some of their Maple Bacon Donuts, in all their mapley-bacony goodness!! Sandwiches are tasty. Awelicious bread is really delicious as are their awelicious buns. I love their cupcakes too! NUM! Everything I have tried is wonderful. Service is always very good. Several local eateries use their GF foods, like US Egg and Spinato's for example. More eateries are listed on their website. Did I mention that I love this place?"}
{"text":"One of my kids has a gluten allergy so we are always thankful when we can find anything that Carter's to our needs.  Although they are abit pricey we've come to expect this do to the recent \"fad\" where everyone and their mother with an upset stomach claims to be allergic.  We ate multiple products of there and no reaction at all. So grateful to you guys for helping us"}
{"text":"I don't have celiac, but I have been put on a gluten free diet for medical reasons. As such, I've had to be creative with my diet and this place satisfies me on those days when all I want is to feel like I can eat like I used to!!! I got one of their cakes for my stepdad for his birthday and he didn't even notice the difference!!!!  There are always yummy samples out to try new items. My favorites are the cupcakes, jalapeño bagels and the awelicious bread. What a great place with great options!"}
{"text":"First off, stop browsing elsewhere, and go to GFC right now and order one of every single item off the menu. I don't care if you're gluten free, celiac, gluten friendly, dog friendly, you get the picture.... this place is awesome. We discovered \"GFC\" (Gluten Free Creations) immediately after flying into Phoenix. Having celiac disease makes eating out hard, and celiac makes eating while traveling near impossible - but thank god for GFC, PROBLEM SOLVE!   We ordered the biscuits and gravy, pumpkin spice and cream cheese muffins and they were HEAVENLY. Our wedding was the next day in Sedona, so we took a little chocolate ganache cake with us to go.  If you like chocolate- it was seriously to die for, it was so damn good. The staff is friendly and personable, making you feel like family, and guess what? We're going back before we fly home."}
{"text":"We didn't end up eating inside but there carrot cake was amazing perfect birthday treat!! The donut I was in form was the bomb by 9 year old nephew next time I'll have to go a little earlier to try the chocolate donuts! Definitely plan to make the my go to desert shop !"}
{"text":"I dont even need to be gluten free (my daughter does) but everything I've tasted there has been fabulous!!  The bagels are a must have staple in our freezer (daughter uses them for breakfast, sandwiches, etc), the ice cream sandwiches are soooo good, the pizza crusts are amazing - they are some ones that Barros uses (I love those!).  We've even had a few slices of pie at the store and a few different kind of cupcakes - all A++.  I recently used their Enriched Baking Flour in a tiered chocolate cake recipe I have - it came out fabulous!!  I subbed cup for cup and you would never, ever know it was gf."}
{"text":"We had pancakes and an egg sandwich. Both were very good! Staff was friendly! Another excellent gluten free find!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of GFC bakery! They cater to so many diet styles. I avoid dairy and gluten in my regular diet and can find most any baked good I want here that complies!   I mostly buy from their Food with Intention line. I LOVE the flax loaf, I slice it up and freeze it - lasts me a few weeks. Minimal ingredients, low carb and plenty of fiber. It toasts really well. I am also a huge fan of their coconut mesquite cookies, they are the perfect size to cure my sweet tooth and they are delicious!   This bakery also created my wedding cupcakes for me! I had a traditional cake for my guests but I wanted to enjoy something that night as well without getting a stomach ache. They were so kind in helping me design them to match my wedding and my diet wishes.   My hubby usually gets my birthday treats from here! I have been meaning to stop in and grab breakfast, I really want to try their grain free pancakes! Everything I have had from here has been great and the service is always so pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Lunch is great, and the pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are awesome!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! My husband and I got the sprinkled doughnuts and they are to die for. The employees are beyond sweet as well. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found this place.  I have hated every gluten free bread I've bought to date, so it has been FOREVER since I've have a sandwich.  I decided to take a risk on ordering one here, and I am so glad I did! One of the employees suggested that I try the Eggplant Italiano since I wanted something vegan and gluten free.  It was a yummy, messy (in a good way), hefty serving of roasted veggies, tomato sauce, and vegan cheese oozing with goodness on a hearty herb bread that was similar in size and consistency to a French roll.  It came with some Pop Chips that were really salty, which made me really happy but others might feel they were too salty.    For the baked goods, I read in another review that most are best eaten frozen or really cold, and I found that to be pretty true.  They are also expensive compared to regular baked goods.  I'm so thankful to have found tasty GF/vegan goodies that I don't really care about the temperature.  Considering the price of GF ingredients at grocery and health food stores, I understand the prices here.  About the ambiance, it is very basic, which I liked.  It reminded me of all the little hole-in-the-wall pizzerias and hot dog places I used to eat at when I was younger and didn't care what I ate.  I wish they stayed open later!   I will definitely be going back, probably tomorrow already!"}
{"text":"4 words scored this place a 5 Star for me BROWN SUGAR COOKIE CAKE. Absolutely sooo good! I bought it frozen and thawed it for about 30 minutes. Was perfect! Also tried the carrot cake which was delicious. It was nice that they had a a lot of vegan options on top of everything being gluten free. Not everything was vegan but had a good selection. We will be back for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Amazing... a gluten-free bakery that's not 25miles from my house! I was so stoked when Ii heard GFC was opening a second location in the East Valley (notice it wasn't in the West Valley? That's because the west-side of Phoenix sucks and is gross), even more excited when I found out it's also a sandwich place. They serve an entire menu of amazing sandwiches and now they even serve breakfast and brunch! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Well.. I was diagnosed with celiac disease when i was in the fifth garde ( that was 7 years ago and now i am in high school.  Being gluten free hasn't always been easy because i miss all my favorite food. But I was surfing on the web for some gluten free food and i came across this place. Everything looked so good on the website. I bought 2 loafs of Awelicious bread, 2 packages of plain bagels and 2 things of donuts ( Cinnamon and Sugar Donuts4U and Superb Sprinkles Dounts4U). I live in Dallas Texas, so i had to buy 30 dollars worth of food to get it shipped to my house. Honestly It was worth it. I ate the sprinkled donuts in about 1.5 days but i have to say that the Awelicious bread was the best gluten free bread i have ever had. I know that Texas has its fair share of gluten free but it seems like Arizona's gluten free selection taste better and there is more of a selection of restaurants and bakeries there.. BTW i hate when people complain about the prices for gluten free... it more expensive for a reason, but at the same time its healthier than eating all the processed food. And if you have another food allergy like me ( i can't have nuts) i would call ahead and they can accommodate  you."}
{"text":"Holy guac a MOLE!!! This has to be the best gluten free bakery/restaurant I've ever been to.  The service is absolutely amazing . The food is amazing. From the burgers to the carrot cake... to the scones...  to the breakfast bowl. Gosh it's amazing. I wish I could come here everyday. But I don't even live here :(  If you are contemplating checking this place out, it definitely will not disappoint. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"scrumptious and the service is great! there are always new things to try and it is always guaranteed to be good. the turkey reuben is amazeball."}
{"text":"I ordered the biscuits and gravy and an iced latte. The gravy was savory and the biscuits fresh and fluffy. The latte was perfectly flavored, not too sugary with the shot of flavor. We'll be coming here more often. Staff is incredibly friendly. I will be telling friends about this gold mine!"}
{"text":"I recently had to change to a Gluten Free, egg free diet, and GFC was recommended to me. I bought their bread and it was delicious. I also got a turkey sandwich there which was enough for two meals, and was delicious! I thought I got great value for the price, and enjoyed my meal. Also, once I indicated when ordering my sandwich that I needed to be egg free, the person who took my order automatically noted that she would change the bread to their white bread which has no eggs in it instead of the usual bread they use for the sandwich. They were VERY helpful."}
{"text":"I came in around 3p during the week. I really wanted a cupcake but found theirs looked rather small and lacking. I decided to go with a donut and their version of a Twinkie.   The donut was not a donut. It was cake in the shape of a donut. No, not a cake donut.... Cake!! This has become some what of a pet peeve of mine with being gluten free. Every time I have found gluten free donuts they are not at all like the donuts you would find at Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts. Honestly, it's as annoying as when I ask if something is gluten free and the response is yes - it's organic or yes it's vegan. Thanks!!! Because that's EXACTLY the same thing!!!!! Smh.  The Twinkie was fairly dried out and the filling was a weird sweetness that was too sweet to be icing.   I took a couple bites of each and decided they were not worth the calories. Honestly, my money would have been better spent on the 4 pk of cupcakes at Trader Joe's. However, I am a sucker for supporting local.   Bottom Line - huge disappointment. The search for a gluten free bakery in PHX continues."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I love that I can eat vegan & gluten free at the same place. Their cupcakes are moist and flavorful. They're not overly sweet like you find with a lot of gluten free baked goods. They're delicious. I've had their vegan black bean burger and it's great too! They have so many options to fit any diet restriction. The ladies who work here are always kind and provide great customer service. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"What a great find. Everything I tried is delicious. This easily beats GF pastries/bread from WF, TJ or Sprouts. Super nice staff and I am happy to support a local business."}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok. At least the things I had were ok. I got the awelicious bread, a chocolate donut and 2 woopie pies. For almost $20 for all that, maybe my expectations were a little high. The bread was great! But it wasn't any better than the Canyon Bakehouse bread. The chocolate donut was good, but it wasn't a donut. It was just a cake in the shape of a donut. And the whoopie pies were eh. The frosting was kind of hard and bland. Gluten free foods can be a pain to make so I totally commend the shop for creating a completely GF bakery! But I had higher expectations. Because I'm in Tempe, not Scottsdale, I probably won't go again."}
{"text":"I love Gluten Free Creations!  They have plenty of great options and I always stock up on everything bagels from there.  They just started making these amazing pizza crusts which my partner and I started using to have pizza nights at home.  Both my partner and I are vegan and GFC has plenty of vegan options there.  They clearly list all ingredients on all products and even highlight potential allergens so that it is easy to read.  We've been shopping here for a few years and they are making more and more vegan options, which is really great for me!  Staff is super awesome and friendly."}
