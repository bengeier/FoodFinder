{"text":"Very very good!
Arrive early- can be a wait for a table, but it's worth it.
Food and service were great. Food portions are NOT huge by any measure- so you might like to share.
My only reason for four stars not five is I think the common tables are weird- like being at a ski chalet where you can share with many people.
Also I enjoyed everyone else's food at my table-except mine. Had something with prawns, clams etc. Very very salty."}
{"text":"Well we finally got in........and it was worth the wait! Who's kidding who? Borgo is the best new eatery in town and likely the best Italian hot spot west of TO.
Great decor, great service......see you soon"}
{"text":"Three of us decided to try Borgo last Thursday, and I must say, the fact that they don't take reservations is pretty awesome. We showed up early at 5:30pm and the place was half full, by 7pm, it was in full swing, with no vacant tables.
The decor of the restaurant is great; high vaulted ceiling at the front, and lower ceiling at the back. This gives it a hustle bustle feel in one area if you feel more social, or more intimate if you have a group you want to talk to, towards the back. They have a large bar you can sit at and eat as well. The demographic here was cool. Young people in large groups, older couples, ladies in their late thirties and forties for a 'girls night'. It really is a place for everyone.
Now onto the food. I saw the menu, and at first I thought it looked a bit small, but it wasn't. The three of us ordered about 7 plates, and we were stuffed. The idea is that this is like Italian tapas, where you have plates with smaller portions, but get many to share. Our waitress was very helpful in helping us decide on food combos. Here is what we had;

-Eggplan frittata with fennel yogurt dip; crunchy, and the dip made it tart, a great light starter
-The cheese and meat plate; we randomly chose cheeses and meats we weren't familiar with, and all were amazing, though the cheese portions were pretty tiny.
-Ciabatta with olive oil; Amazing! The olive oil has a sweeter flavor and aftertaste I had not tried before
-Flank steak; perfect, and not too heavy, came with small potatoes that we devoured instantly
-Pork canneloni with cheese fondue sauce; creamy texture to the pork inside, and the cheese sauce was not heavy, nor did it smother the pasta
-We had the dessert plate, which was 4 of their most popular types. My favorite was the lemon aquares. At $16 the portions were really tiny, but everything was amazing. I guess it's quality over quantity ( I need to constantly remind myself of this)!

Their espressos were only $2!! My friend got a version of an 'Italian martini' that had bourbon for $8, which is a standard price for the drink. He enjoyed it, and though I hate bourbon, it had a light fresh taste to it.

All in all, the bill came to $95 for all three of us included tax, and 2 alcoholic, and coffee type beverages. i think this is very fair.

This place is great because you can try as much, or as little as you like, so it can be as cheap or as expensive as you like. In true Italian fashion, they encourage you to stay and don;t give you the evil eye for chatting after dinner. We were there for 2 hours between all our meals.

Service was amazing, the staff checked in on a few times, including the manager twice, which was nice. And I will definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"went back to Borgo for a friend's bday. It was a Friday evening, and I guess there is an option to choose a set meal. It started with a selection of apps, then 2 pasta dishes, then the mains and finally dessert. I cant even remember all the dishes, they were showing up all over the place. I will say the hilights were the Italian servers..just added to the all over ambiance of the place, and so professional. The pasta with the porcini mushroom and truffle oil was so rich, and delicious, I had to have seconds. The risotto balls, which everyone talks about, lived up to their reputation..I'd be happy with that and a salad as a meal. They were crispy and flavourful, with a touch of sauce, so they didnt get all gummy while eating them. Mmmmmm...risotto balls."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this short and to the point.  The food here is great, hands down.  Try something different.  On a weekend morning imagine yourself in Naples.  Think about a cappuccino and a pastry with a paper and some Latin music in the background.  Now think that you can have this in Calgary in November; the very antithesis of Naples.  Now act on your imagination.  Go!"}
{"text":"I've been there only for breakfast so far and I really like it.  Really love the atmosphere and what they did with this place. I can't wait to try lunch or dinner.  Breakfast was good although I must say someone please teach the barista how to move a little faster at the espresso machine!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Went there for lunch, and was glad to have arrived early -- it filled up rapidly. The wait staff were incredibly professional, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere can be best described as \"upscale family-style\". Calgary's come such a long way from the chain restaurants and half-hearted attempts at trying to compete with other, tonier cities' restaurants. We've arrived! And with more restaurants like Borgo -- who do everything right -- the bar is raised."}
{"text":"An uptown Italian restaurant with a focus on shareable dishes, and a great reputation.  4.5 stars though... really? People must be eating at a lot of bad Italian places if this is so far off the norm.  I'd give them 3.5 stars based on quality to price ratio.  That is to say, the quality is good, but the price more than commensurately so...so if you have lots of cash burning a hole in your pocket, I recommend it.  

Here you will find an array of appetizers, a few pastas, and meat/starch/salad combos, but also daily specials such as (the night we were there) chicken leg and barley risotto. I can't complain on the quality of the food, the meat was good and the greens popping with fresh citrus, and my wife was a fan of the barley risotto. BUT there is a portion problem: while the mains are billed as \"shareable\", and come in (stylish) serving dishes, are you really supposed to share one chicken leg?  Is a chicken leg so expensive that you couldn't throw in another one at ~$20/plate?  This is the kind of place where most people will have more than one course and/or drinks with dinner (I must note that I thoroughly enjoyed my cocktail), so giving a little more value on the main would be appreciated. 

As I said, this is the kind of place you can come with trendy friends and have multiple courses and/or drinks (it is very easy to spend $50-60/person). The service is very professional, and the large room and patio of hard surfaces such as tiles and wood beams are broken up to just so to have a lively (loud) atmosphere without feeling like you're in a cafeteria.  The service and room combo therefore make Borgo also amenable to romantic yet unsleepy dinner dates. Despite this, there are enough non-Americanized Italian restaurants in Calgary now that you don't automatically get 4 stars just for being different.  If you're looking for a lively atmosphere and classy service, come here.  If you're looking for somewhere cozy, or a place to go regularly for affordable portions, this isn't the best match."}
{"text":"I noticed Borgo a week ago when I was shopping on 17th ave and checked out the website when I got home. The dinner menu had me at fried risotto ball, and I knew I had to get myself to this restaurant asap. 

Had plans this weekend to go for dinner with two girl friends, so I suggested Borgo and they were game. Normally I am not a fan of restaurants that do not take reservations, but we showed up at 6:30 pm and were seated right away. The restaurant was busy, but not packed. LOVE the design of the restaurant. I wanted to smuggle all of the lights home in my purse. 

The food is served family style, with the proteins, pastas and sides all ordered individually. Price range is between moderate and spendy, $11 to $60 per person, depending on how much food and drink you order. We ordered the risotto balls (arancino), eggplant fritta, gnocchi, trout, and focaccia. Everything was delicious. Very rich, but I guess that's to be expected considering what we ordered... The service was also very good. It felt like the restaurant had been open for years. 

(PS Yelp, I love that a price range is named spendy)"}
{"text":"Poor value for dollar here.  Our beet salad was very salty (the manager comp'd us the salad because it was so bad) and the sirloin left something to be desired.  We also had the veal meatball, which is served with just a bed of mashed potatoes yet cost $20.  But the worst part all was how poorly the managers treated the staff - we were appalled!  We likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I attempted to go with friends last night, and will not be going back. Waited over an hour for a table (after being told by an employee at 4:30 that day we'd wait a maximum of 15-20 minutes), and still didn't get seated, as they chose to seat some big shot Calgarians including city councellors and tv personalities ahead of us common folk. NOT impressed with that. I won't be giving them a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Another huge success for Chef Giuseppe di Gennaro, and another 5 star review from me!

I absolutely love this place. It's authentically Italian, and you can choose to order as little or as much as you want. We even had a server who was Italian. Either that, or she was able to pronounce everything with an excellent accent. I think my Italian date approved. :)

The nice thing about Borgo is that the food quality is on par with Capo, but cheaper and more casual. Thank goodness! We ordered two servings of bruschetta, a charcuterie board, two orders of ciabatta and lamb. And the best part? It only came to $50 with tax and tip! Win!"}
{"text":"I went to Borgo 2 weeks ago, but I'm not sure why do many above average reviews. First off the service was A plus. The things I didn't like was the Gnoccchi ( had way better ) I was surprised they charge you for bread ( most Italian restaurants do not do that ), in addition they also charge for parm cheese ( rip off ) The service was good, but this restaurant was too expensive for the quality and quantity of the food."}
{"text":"Going to keep this initial review short and sweet but Borgo (by Giuseppe di Gennaro) is a keeper. When it seems like every other new restaurant is some sort of microbrewery/craft beer joint, Borgo brings a refreshing style  where friends and family can indulge in quality food with an authentic Italian flavour.

My first \"date\" with Borgo was on a lazy Saturday afternoon consisting of a glass of wine, a couple of cicheti (appetizers), and topped off with a Illy espresso macchiato. The first \"date\" went so well, I had to go back for more.

Second \"date\" was dinner with a close friend and we were quite satisfied with the meal. There was a little bit of a wait as they don't take reservations but that's really the point of a trattoria where one just walk in. Service was prompt, efficient, and relaxed.

Overall, I highly recommend Borgo and the staff there can bet that they'll be seeing much more of me in the future!

Joe"}
{"text":"I was Borgo's biggest fan - lovely food, good atmosphere - and tonight took a friend out to Borgo for great food and catching up. She had never been and I insisted we had to go here. Unfortunately, my experience with the service was so disappointing - almost surreal - that I can't justify going again.

It started well, our waiter was attentive. My friend ordered her meal but asked for no potatoes due to food issues. No problem said the waiter. However, when the meals arrived she had a side dish of potatoes. The gentleman who served our dishes was kinda like whatever and didn't get our waiter when we requested. We waved someone over - the owner? elderly gentleman with a white moustache- and we explained the request for no potatoes.

His reply? \"what do you mean? you have other dishes here? what do you want me to do about it?\" And we asked if it could be substituted (as our waiter had said could be done)  and he was like, \"with what?\" And we said, anything - any veggie or whatever was available that night or even nothing would've been fine- his reply? \"I don't understand you have plenty of other food\" \"we don't have anything else.\"

He seemed upset over the request but I couldn't understand why. I said if substituting wasn't an option then the waiter should have told us. However, the waiter indicated it was no problem when we ordered.

I think we were more in shock that he was telling her that essentially she had more than enough other food at the table to eat so why should the restaurant have to fix this. Furthermore, hard to believe there were no other veggies in the kitchen.

We saw him talk to our waiter and another person (not our waiter) eventually brought out a dish of broccoli - which was great and delicious.

We only saw our waiter once more in the 2 3/4 hours total we were at the restaurant. The older gentleman served us for the rest of the night and he was polite.

Unfortunately, our experience was already impacted with the earlier problem and the evening couldn't make a comeback.

Unfortunately I will not be visiting Borgo again - the food is delicious as usual and I will miss your risotto balls but I just can't justify spending money here after this experience tonight."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was very good, but the quantity for the price was horrible. The 'share tables' were maybe 20\" wide and 10' long. So there really was no sharing. To do so would mean things getting knocked over, which they did. No problem... they immediately replace the spilled drinks (at full price).

One thing to note is that a 'share' serving is a serving with nothing but what's on the menu, for the price of a similar meal as a comparable restaurant. For example, we ordered the Gnocchi which was a ridiculously small portion. It was so small, I counted a total of 37 TINY pieces, so small that they didn't even cover the serving plate. The cost $18 or about 50 cents per tiny piece. For reference, a typical table spoon would hold 7-10 pieces. The $10 order of bread (2 pieces) ended up being one burnt piece and one ok piece that if put together would be a 5\" square.

What was worse was the push to up-sell. When we were offered bottle water, our server jumped on the hostess and yelled \"No, they are buying Sparkling\". In other words... he had us paying $6 for water that she was offering for free. He was visibly angry with her and she never returned to our table. Half of or table didn't want sparkling water, but that didn't matter.

Beyond that, while the server was pleasant, he was visibly cold and it was clear that he would have been happier if he wasn't serving us.

I could go on, but you get the point...

I cannot believe that anybody that gave this a great review isn't associated with the restaurant or its owners, or still has a firm grasp on reality. We paid our bill (many hundreds, but under $1000), walked down the street, and almost half our our party ordered another meal at another restaurant.

I have written maybe a dozen reviews in the last decade so it is an extreme situation that will have me make the effort. I am writing this because I truly don't think this is an unusual visit. If you are pretentious maybe you'll like this place. If you want good value there are MANY other places to go within walking distance.

To try to be balanced and fair, if you visit this place order a drink and look at the orders that are coming out. See for yourself if it is what you want. The quality was good and nobody had any problems with the food, but nothing stood out as anything above 'good'.

And, as a recommendation to the restaurant -- Take your long, skinny tables and widen then by double so that sharing is practical. The huge gap between tables is wasted space. Also, offer 'no-sharing' options for people that want something particular or just don't want to share. Teach your staff to be more friendly. The customers are not an inconvenience that must be simply tolerated. And finally, offer more value. Average people should not pay in excess of $40/person for food alone and walk out hungry.

Finally, I suspect there is either a sense of racism or elitism at this place. There were visible minorities in our group who arrived ahead of us and when I asked for them the host sneered \"oh.. you're with THOSE people. I put them in the back\""}
{"text":"My date and I were originally going to go to Teatro but decided to head here.  The decor was relaxed and the wait staff was very friendly.  We were surprised that the place was packed on a Monday night at 8 pm.

I would recommend their $45 tasting menu.  From a price/value perspective, it can't be beat!

I will be returning here in a few months, once I get another craving for good quality Italian."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a fantastic restaurant!  Atmosphere is lively, food is absolutely delicious, service is top notch and we will definitely be back!  

It was a busy place but we were able to get a table for 3 without a reservation.  Very good first impression of the menu and wine list.  The risotto balls are amazing as others have reviewed; and the insalata caprese they had on special that night was super - amazing flavours!  THANK YOU for actually using buffalo mozzarella!!!  YUMMY!!!

For the main dish we had the gnocchi with tomato sauce and the Orecchio d'Elefante!  WOW!!!!  The flavours literally took me back to Italy!  The gnocchi was so delicious and balanced well with the light tomato sauce; but the orecchio d'elefante was out of this world!  The veal was tender, wonderfully seasoned and cooked just right; i just love adding lemon to this dish; seems to make the flavours more distinctive.  The salad on the side is amazing as well (try putting the arugula and tomatoes on top of the veal...so yummy!).  The potatoes were a winner as well!

Service was also great.  Our server was very knowledgable, attentive and funny;  she made us feel very welcome.  It was also great to see the team work and professionalism amongst the staff there.  That says a lot for the management and owners!

So, congrats BORGO on a fabulous trattoria!  Here's to your continuing success and here's to us finding a new jewel in the city!  Cin Cin!"}
{"text":"Bland Food, Poor Service, Creepy Waiter!

Went there for brunch this Sunday with my wife and daughter. Trusted the reviews on Yelp. Thanks a lot yelpers. j/k. :)

We all were terribly underwhelmed.

The food was bland. Our waiter had a weird creepy vibe. Forgot to bring half the drinks we ordered. 

The waiter wanted to know where we were from originally. I said \"Mexico\", he says, \"Oh, I'll never go there I don't want to get my head chopped off\".

Lovely.

At one point my wife asked, is it just me or is our waiter creepy? Yes he is creepy.

Everyone else was very nice. 

But the food left us impressed.

We ordered the fruit salad with Greek yogurt for our young daughter. When we noticed she wasn't eating it, we tried it, and it tasted pretty bad.

The melons were rubbery and tasted sour. The bottom of the bowl was full of clear liquid and the yogurt floated on top of that. 

It looked and tasted pretty bad.

We weren't charged for it but the manager seemed annoyed that we complained. 

And when the manager says \"We aren't going to charge you for the drinks we forgot to bring\"... is there another way they can say that, that doesn't sound, you know,  condescending.

You aren't going to charge me for drinks that we ordered when we first arrived and you never brought.... Gee thanks!

Needless to say, we can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Borgo is a dining place on 17th that has a surprising casual atmosphere. Enter the restaurant and you find a more traditional dining room vibe at the front. Walk just a bit further and you are greeted by the white brick/tile decor. It kind of reminds me of a kitchen.  

For drinks we had the spritz and Pinot Nero. Spritz ($8) was sweet and refreshing. Pinot Nero ($9) was very balanced. 

For starters we had the Beef Carpaccio ($8) and Breschetta ($2/piece). The Carpaccio was interesting. It had Grana cheese and the crystalline texture of the cheese made the carp crunchy, nice surprise. The app had a sweetness to it, possibly from the bread crumbs sprinkled on it. It was different from any carp mix I have had before. The Breschetta was excellent. My date commented on the fact that the tomatoes and a little dollop of mozzarella pack so much flavour. Best part of the meal!

For the main course we shared a Fettucine Porcini mushroom cream ($18) and the Lambchops ($15). Both dishes were very good. Not the best lambchops I've ever had, but it was good. It finished with Lemon Sorbet and though I ordered one scoop ($2) the waiter gave me 3 ($5). I was a little miffed by this, but decided not to make a big deal of it. However, it was kind of annoying.

{"text":"A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!
Any positive reviews of this place are a complete farce! Pardon my angry rant, but here it goes. Where should I begin? For starters the service was rude and slow. The food was terrible . The veal was over cooked, the risotto balls were under cooked. Everything was salty, greasy and way to rich!! How could a qualified chef send that stuff out the door?
    The prices in this place are ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS !there is NO reason for a place like this,to have those kind of prices. The portion sizes?? Sharing dishes they call them? NOT EVEN CLOSE!! At these prices a platter for four should not barely serve two! When four (rather petite)gals leave hungry , im sorry, but something is not right .
  I HAVE TWO SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS PLACE:
1. The rather awkward little fella with the greasy hair, who kept coming to our table (whom we were later told is part owner and chef???,Giuseppe de Gennaro )should probably spend more time in the kitchen and less time in the dining room irritating the customers and clearly also the staff!!
2.  Along with those prices they should have a caption of the portion sizes. So,,customers can see them and turn around and walk out the door instead of staying (like we did) and later leaving feeling RIPPED OFF!
  This place deserves ZERO stars but I will generously give it one because the decor is beautiful .  Having previously been  in the food industry for twenty years I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE !!"}
{"text":"Very good Restaurant. Excellent Service, delicious food and outstanding ambiance. Totally recommendable!!"}
{"text":"Food coma!

Six of us had a two and a half hour dinner.

There were so many good dishes....

The risotto balls were decadent.
The meatballs were first rate.
The pasta was excellent.
The trout was outstanding.

You get the idea.

The servers were pros.  They were knowledgable, efficient and kept it moving without being intrusive.   

I would highly recommend Borgo."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is consistently excellent, and the service is attentive without being overdone. I would suggest sitting on the patio and ordering appies to share."}

{"text":"Another 5-star addition to the Calgary food scene. What an amazing place!

My boyfriend and I recently went to Borgo one fine Saturday evening. When we got there, there was no lineup, but sure enough, there were no empty tables. We were offered bar seats, which we accepted. Borgo is a bustling bistro-style restaurant. Super high ceilings, lots of light streaming in. Very very cool atmosphere. 

While perusing the menu, we kind of went hog-wild and ordered almost everything. In fact, our server, a nice Greek man even went so far as to say \"maybe you should just have 2 appetizers instead of three...\" We decided to listen to him and not stuff our faces. Upon our request, he also recommended a bottle of wine for us, which we must say, was perfect. A hint of smoke, and very easy sipping - it was exactly what I had in mind. 

All the waiters seemed to be European, and VERY well-trained, which added a touch of cool. 

So, for appetizers we had the risotto balls and the sauteed wild mushrooms. AMAZING. The mushroom appetizer was earthy, flavourful, creamy and had the most aromatic sauce. I wiped my bowl clean. The risotto balls were also great. What a fantastic start to the meal. My tastebuds had already started celebrating.

For the main course, we had the 'Veal Dish for Two'. It was HUGE. The MASSIVE plate consisted of a thin but large piece of veal steak, a heaping portion of fries, and a heaping portion of salad. The fries were good, and the salad was phenomenal. It was a simple salad with lettuce, tomatoes, etc, but the dressing was delicious. Perhaps a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a secret blend of herbs. In fact, I joked that if I could discover how to make this salad dressing on my own, that's all I would eat everyday. While I was indulging in the salad, my boyfriend grabbed the lemon and squeezed it all over the steak before I could say \"NO I HATE LEMON ON MY MEAT!\" I sat miserably looking at my steak, but decided to eat it anyway, and it wasn't half bad. But in a mere moment, another member of the staff (we assumed the manager) came up to ask whether the lemon is a real problem. We assured them that no, the veal was still tasty. Five minutes later our Greek waiter also came over to explain that the veal was served with lemon because it was the summer. I was very pleased with how attentive they were with my observations, even though I had not even mentioned it to them!

Our lovely Greek server came by and marvelled at how we cleaned the plate. He looked very surprised at us being able to stomach this much food. And then we decided to ask for the dessert menu. Our waiter seemed even more surprised but more than happy to get it for us. We glanced at the menu... so many delicious choices.. and knew what we wanted right away. \"Let me guess.. you want the sampler tray, am I right?\" He had caught on to our indomitable stomach capacities. We laughed, but yes, that is exactly what we wanted. 

The dessert came, and it was a sight to behold. 4 gorgeous mini-desserts on a beautiful platter. We dug in, and all my senses collectively set off the grand finale fireworks. This was the PERFECT ending to a PHENOMENAL meal. 

Borgo was perfection. We had an overwhelmingly great time and left extremely pleased customers. On the way back home we laughed about how we bet our endearing Greek waiter's only regret was misjudging our appetites and not letting us order the 3rd appetizer!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about Borgo. The service is pleasant enough. The decor is lovely. I've been here twice, and was with lovely company both times.

But I can't eat here. I can drink here and munch away on a bread basket, but I can't have a sit down breakfast; brunch; lunch or dinner. When I asked if they could just make one of the menu items without cheese, the server argued with me the way my Texan diehard-carnivore-meat-until-I-die-with-a-steak-knife-in-my-cold-dead-hands Grandma argues with me about how a certain item is \"integral\" to it being breakfast. Seriously? You can't just... make it without cheese? Without the buffalo mozzarella, it's \"no longer breakfast?\"

You have that entire giant open kitchen, that I can see from where I'm sitting, and no one in there is creative enough to think outside of the menu guidelines? And I'm not asking you to hand-grind some chickpeas and steep some burdock root in a cheese cloth. I just wanted it sans mozzarella, and apparently, in Borgo this is an outrageous and inconceivable request. 

So, yeah, as much as I want to like it because of the fun times I've had here; showing up hungry was a bad idea. Having to argue with a server about being vegan; like it was something I can just decide not to be right there in order to ~*preserve the integrity of CHEESY BREAKFAST*~ in front of my friends that were enjoying themselves, made me feel awkward and uncomfortable and a little sad."}
{"text":"Borgo Trattoria is a great addition to the Calgary food scene. Great job..
The wild sautee mushrooms are a must.."}
{"text":"A trendy location with a new take on an old idea... That is the first thought that hit me as I walked through the door. Truthfully, I was cautiously optimist about the new establishment, and that was entirely needless! The short version is: the staff is great, the food is excellent, and the ambiance is reasonable. Go there, at least once.

As for the long version? Read on!

The restaurant has a lovely open feel as soon as you walk through the doors, it feels massive without being overbearing. Seated right at the front near the cafe style doors/windows is the place to be, you can watch the people walking on the street if you enjoy people watching or if you want a little less ambiance. Our server greeted us very promptly, introduced himself and was extremely friendly; be sure to see if Gaston is working when you go in, you will not be disappointed!

The food? Well, the food was delicious... mostly, I would almost order more appetizers than entrees next time though, I found the portions to be a little more NY and little less Calgary, and for some reason, that appealed to me (perhaps because I do not like when I get served enough to feed two of me). Gaston was quick to suggest alternatives that might be more suited, or expanded explanations when I was unsure exactly what I wanted to order. As for what was not perfect? The lamb chops, there was just, something about them that was not exactly right, perhaps it was that they were not as moist as I had hoped? I am not sure what it was, they were close, but not perfect,

Other than that? It is certainly worth a visit, and it is guaranteed to be a great experience."}
{"text":"The patio was an urban oasis, it was sheltered by trees on the streets, and the adjacent park served to blocked out heavy on-coming 17th Ave traffic. Best brunch in the city! The Purgatorio was lovely - 2 baked eggs with tomato sauce, pancetta and grilled, buttery focaccia. The eggs were soft and yolky, sitting in a pool of zesty tomato sauce. The salad was super simple, but refreshing with its citrusy dressing and heavy dusting of cheese. The Strapazzati was also a winner- eggs scrambled with threads of zucchini. The eggs were soft and light, the taste was amazing. Can't wait to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, it's always awesome when a joint lives up to its hype. Borgo delivered and it delivered hard. My only mistake was fasting from alcohol, otherwise my dinner would have been paired with a big bottle of red, and it would have been game over. 

Visited with a few friends, and a couple of us went with the special fixed price meal. Outstanding apps, pasta and main. The venue also has a nice aura - I like how it's not exactly on 17th, but tucked in on 16th. Other than the snow storm outside, I forgot that I was in Calgary. 

The service was also excellent, as the waiter was knowledgeable, without seeming pretentious. The staff were smiling and in a good mood, which in my opinion is important for a joint like this. 

Ultimately, this is a place I would go again and recommend to anyone else visiting the city. As good as it gets... for Calgary."}
{"text":"Awesome food start to finish.  Had their tasting menu.  Each course was fantastic.  First course was a 4 piece tasting that had shrimp, Arancini, a crostini, and a small tomato with mozzarella and balsamic.  Second course was pasta.  Great full flavor and a little bit of kick.  Next course was Trout and green beans, and meatballs on polenta. Dinner finish with a wildberry pannacotta.  About the only thing I wish they would do is take reservations at any time of the night.  Service is first rate with no lack of staff."}
{"text":"Well at least the food was good. The service was terrible. I use to eat here regularly and often brought people for dinner. Last time was a negative experience, very slow service (our drinks were empty and no offer for another, we were long since done our meal and our dirty plates sat on out table forever). The last straw was after our bill of $70 arrived. We paid with a $100 and the server asked if we wanted change. Now I dine out frequently and had worked in the restaurant industry myself-just bring back the change and let the guests decide what to leave on the table. Well we asked for $10 back (so leaving $20 on a tab if $70). It took an infinite amount of time to return AND it was all in coins-I'm not talking loonies and toonies either, just small change. This was late in a Saturday...so how could they not possible have sufficient change? Very embarrassing and disappointing."}
{"text":"W-List. This is the first restaurant to provide the impetus for a new category. Gone is the A-List (highly recommended) or B-List (ok/good). Enter, the W-List or Weird List. Apparently, highly rated, the Borgo is. From beginning to end, this restaurant enters the twilight zone. From the front line greeter that was difficult to comprehend, to the server who was either overworked (hurried), under appreciated, apathetic, poorly trained or some other set of reasons and circumstances, to the eclectic group of patrons, to the strange collection of piped in music, to the fashion show via projection gizmo on the big wall, this place is just full of strange vibes. Unless, of course, one consumes larger quantities of spirits, then none of this matters, until the next day when you wonder if it was all for real or just a dream. Oh, the food. Pretty good. Interesting. Nicely presented. In the end, it appears lots of people know about this place and return. Believe it or not. Here's a secret. If you want service that is second to none, a great atmosphere, the most amazing food on the planet - right here in Calgary  - keep walking and head over to The Farm. Borgo, sorry, great food but just plain weird. No way on this green Earth that Borgo catapults to a 4 or 5. One would have to be in some technologically induced state with a movie running in one's head to make this a contender for a top notch dining experience. This is, as always, For Real."}
{"text":"Monday afternoon in autumn... the leaves are falling and clinging to my shoes as I walked through that park at the corner of 17th and 8th... 

Borgo Trattoria sits like a forgotten birthday present tucked behind the trees of fall.

Lovely and bright, the tile and open interior is so very inviting.

We chose a booth; which are so soft in comfort and nice table spacing... elbows allowed.

The place mat seemed to be the selections at hand, throwing me off a bit...and so, as my lunch partner and I perused the \"menu\" I realized that it's quite different than what I am used to... to me, immediately, it seemed that it was meant to be ordered in tandem.

So... wow... away we went... 

Fennel and radish with a beautifully flavoured olive oil jar.
Ciabatta bread and balsalmic with oil
Two giant prawns with a grilled hunk of lemon and a sprig of rosemarry
Two Risotto balls,
sauted calamari in olive and tomato,
A cheese platter
A cold cut platter

Every item, was fresh and tidy. Presented in such artistry, and really besides being beautiful to eat, really was a wonderful thing to experience. Everything was served on olive wood cutting boards and rustic ceramics... with a tinge of glass and oil.

between the two of us, we difted bits of meat and cheese (5 of each...hmmm, I wonder if I remember...) on to our plates...

Fontina
Asiago
Gorgonzola
Soft Brie like cheese... made me think of Port Salut
completely forgot the other... excellent

Mortadella
Prosciutto
Speck
Calabrese w/pepper corns
and a soft salami... can't remember... 

Anyway... the point here is that the place is marvelous... it's perfect for a date, for friends hangin out... very hands on... and well; EXCELLENT. $69.00 for the two of us.

Never having been to Europe, I can only imagine that some northern Italian border town has a place just like this, and really, really... so worth the trip."}

I like fine dining Italian restos!"}
{"text":"Went here on a double date last night with friends. Wait on a Saturday night around 7pm was approximately 1 hour. Apparently they do not take reservations passed 6:30pm. We ordered and array of small plates, pasta, two main dishes, and drinks.
Risotto balls were delicious! Sautéed mushrooms were rich, creamy, and hearty. Calabrese was good; nice added touch with the chili oil. Loved the olive oil and balsamic dip - balsamic was sweet and thick, focaccia was fresh and warm. Carpaccio was nothing to rave about - I feel like other places can do this better.  The fresh mozarella was good - great taste and texture with a generous amount of basil. Overall, small plates could have used less crostini's ...there was an overload of bread for all the small plates we ordered.
Pasta dishes: gnocchi was good - soft texture, great taste. Tagliatelle - not as good, have had it better at other places, some peas were still frozen and the pasta was a touch too al dente. 
Mains: we ordered the sirloin and trout. The sirloin was a small portion but tasted good. Truffle fries tasted good but were not fresh, tasted like they were under a heat lamp for a little too long. Trout was delicious! Great texture that melts on your mouth and green beans were well seasoned an crunchy.
I would definitely go back and try other items on their menu. Place is clean, service is good, just the wait can be long so make resos!"}
{"text":"With the closing of Capo, I am glad to see Giuseppe opened another restaurant with the same quality of food. The family style is a great way to try several dishes and a pick a favourite. A few stands outs were the pasta with porcini mushrooms, the Gnocchi, saltimbocca and the braised pork shoulder. The braised pork shoulder is ridiculously tender and flavourful. For those who have eaten at Capo, the gnocchi is the same recipe, minus the rich lobster sauce (too bad). We had the share board of cold cuts and cheeses to start, you can mix 3 and 3, but he had the full 5 and 5. The meats were great, but unless you are a big fan of Italian cheeses,  a few would suffice. The service was very attentive and pleasant and the portions are of good size to match the lower prices. A true Trattoria in YYC. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Borgo... finally we meet for a meal! You've been on my list forever and ever, okay, well forever since you opened anyway. A Friday lunch turned out to be the magical moment of our first meeting.

I loved that my fave server from days gone by at District was our server yesterday. I doubt very highly he'd remember this girl, but you'll recognize him by his most amazingly white teeth and lovely smile with an equally lovely mannerism to match. He was super attentive, knowledgeably... Borgo, you're lucky to have him on your side :).

We popped in for a late lunch (the lunch menu isn't available after 2pm), and snuck in our order crostini (Vine-ripened tomatoes, whipped buffalo mozzarella, balsamic reduction) to start followed by an order of gnocchi (Ricotta dumplings, basil, tomato passata, fior di latte) and chicken (Roasted 6oz breast, sage, lemon, speck prosciutto, sautéed broccoli). Oh, and what's a Friday afternoon with cocktails and wine? 

They also had this cool little lunch box special thing on that you could try three things on the menu for a fixed price (I want to say it was $18? But don't quote me on that... there's been much wine and beer since yesterday at lunch at today, my memory's a little fuzzy on that one).

I love the interior at Borgo. It's nice and open and modern with super tall ceilings, great seating in the front and down the sides of the room, it felt clean and lovely, it wasn't too noisy, and I bet when the weather is warm enough sitting at the front with those windows wide open is going to be a choice spot.

Borgo's also open at 830 Tuesday-Friday for morning coffee (served until 1130... right before they kick off their lunch menu). It makes me want to get all prettied up one morning, grab a book and go sip some delicious Italian coffee something and take a mini-vacation for an hour or two!"}
{"text":"Now, I have only been here for brunch on the weekend and love it. I am truly addicted to Strapazzati, scrambled zucchini with smoked chicken. The pastries are also amazing and prepared fresh daily. Service is great and always friendly. I am going back on Saturday for Brunch again. I have heard amazing things about the dinner menu, will be trying that soon."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of Italian food in Calgary and Borgo Trattoria is one of the many excellent eats. 

However it's not a true trattoria (an Italian restaurant serving simple food) based on the menu prices and offerings."}
{"text":"I don't really speak that much Italian, but I'm pretty sure Borgo is Italian for \"happy stomach\".  Language lessons aside, a happy stomach = happy Heather.  And, let's face it, the Calgary dining scene is filled with too many mediocre players so it's refreshing when a restaurant gets it.

The hostess at the front appears less than competent at managing a line-up and actually getting the right people seated.  Luckily, her manager seemed aware of this and swooped in frequently to actually manage things and move people to tables.

Our server was a pro.  He did an excellent job, was very attentive, but I don't love the obvious sell or the assumption that (as the woman) I wasn't equally a part of the decision making process (or paying for that matter). 

Food - I'm a huge fan of sharing and here's what we shared.

Risotto balls - fantastic, rich, and decadent.
Crostini with smoked chicken, apples, and pecan/maple jam - every element on this dish was perfectly executed and they all balance each other so well.
Sauteed mushrooms - earthy, just do it.
Beer tartare - highly recommended by our server, but my least fave appy
Meatballs w/ polenta - we shared a main and this was only ok.  I didn't love the texture of the polenta, and I prefer the meatballs at Una, but the tomato sauce was amazing and lead me to believe that they have a bunch of Italian grandma's in the back toiling away at the stove.

Wine list  is excellent.

Don't waste your money on mediocre food or service people.  Hit up Borgo and make your own stomach happy."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!!... Beautiful place and incredible food!!.. I went there with a group of friends and we ordered 6 appetizers to share!!.. All of them were incredible delicious!!... As a main course I had the veal and it was AWESOME!!.... In addition, the service was great!!.. The waitress was very friendly, and The manager went personally to our table, and recommended us a great wine!! and for the quality of food and the excellent service, I think the prices were very reasonable. This is a place that doesn't deserve less than 5 stars!!.. I recommend it 100%!!!"}
{"text":"Everything in this place is beyond delicious! We tried a few appetizers, couple of pastas and dessert and there was nothing that I wouldn't eat again. The service is fantastic, the food is amazing, the only thing is that they are not open that late and you should get reservations to make sure you get a spot!"}
{"text":"I'm biased as I LOVE Italian food. Seriously, who doesn't love a saucy carb? 

I have now been to Borgo twice and I was quite happy on both occasions. Last week I went with a couple best friends as we needed a night out to talk about wine, food, work, babies and boyfriends. You know-\"random gossip fodder stuff\".  After putting our name on a waitlist for one hour (ouch) we then ran next door to cricketsville The Met for a bottle of wine.  

Fast forward one hour...

We' re seated ate one of the communal tables and I remember how much I like the open, loud, social atmosphere of this place. 100% not pretentious which is refreshing. Of course we are now starved and dying for more wine-so we deal with ordering wine QUICKLY. We also then decide to order the chefs special where they basically take the guess work out of ordering (we were to hungry to agree on food) by bring three courses of their suggestions. Bring it on. 

The appy course was their risotto balls,a shrimp thing and a crostini thing. I like how doing it this way they bring four of everything so there is no cat fighting. Well done on the attention to detail Borgo. The risotto balls were so delicious and creamy inside-damn it, now I wish they brought eight of everything. 

Step two: 99lbs of penne pasta on a massive plate (cue a mixture of face drops and excitement). Seriously, enough pasta to feed 8 people a meal. But remember, we're drunk (another bottle has been ordered) and were hungry. The pasta was amazing..a tasty Bolognese sauce, peas, plentiful al dente penne.. A wonderful second course.

Onto the finale: four servings of salmon cooked deliciously, fresh crispy green beans covered in something buttery and yummy, and the most amazing meatballs served in a bowl of polenta (outta control!!). Not gonna lie-by this point were quite full and pleasantly plumped! Overall, a really awesome way to go when in a group and more interested in great chatting and not thinking about what to order. They did this tasting very well!

Service was really great, we were never rushed knowing how busy the place is, and the food (and wine choices) are pretty fantastic. I highly recommend. The price point is also quite \"market friendly\" for the great service and quality.

...I need to go back for just the risotto balls-many of them."}
