{"text":"This is the best place on the strip for fresh made Mexican food. I recommend when you come to Vegas that you eat here."}
{"text":"One of, if not, the best tacos in Vegas. Flavor is amazing and the sauces/salsas/ toppings are so good, fresh, and flavorful. It is a food truck at the end of the street by the stratosphere. The parking is easy but it's kinda ghetto at night. Also there is no seating and it's not super cheap for tacos, but great quality and they give you a lot of meat. They take cards as well which is nice for a food truck. Highly recommended for a quick spot!"}
{"text":"nasty place 10$ for a torta it had a hair  in it the bread was old and hard horrible nasty food im never going back there !"}
{"text":"ayyyyyyeeeeeee, this place is actually pretty bomb! came here around 12am and it was popping but the line moves fairly quick. 
I love that you can go to the side cart and grab as much toppings and salsas as you'd like with their lil baggies and containers. 
they could make a spicier salsa cause that shit is nowhere near spicy, but overall the pastor was delicious and I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This food truck got my attention with the sign \"Best Al Pastor Tacos in America.\" If you know me, you know I'm a sucker for Al Pastor Tacos, so I just had to stop and try at least one. After finishing it, I would not agree with their claim, but the tacos still weren't half bad. Here's the run down:

1) As others have said here, the service is not all that good. The guy in the truck cooking and preparing the food seemed to be working his tail off, but the lady running the cash register acted like she really didn't want to be there. Every order took forever: it almost seemed like she was moving super slow on purpose. When my order came up and the cook rang the bell, she didn't even so much as blink, but kept doing what looked like checking hand written orders with a paper that came out of the credit card machine. Two more orders came up, but she just kept doing whatever she was doing. Finally, after a long time, we all got our food, but I'm really not sure why she couldn't have taken the 10 seconds to move the plates from the truck window to the order table. 

2) The meat and pineapple was yummy (yes, the al pastor tacos come with PINEAPPLE!), but the tortillas were pretty dry and didn't taste super fresh. This might have partially been because they sat for so long once the cook finished, but I think they were just not made that day or even the day before. Big props, however, on all the condiments. If you can't find a condiment you like here, it probably doesn't exist.

3) Prices are good: only $2.50 per taco.

Overall, a good cheap option on the strip, but don't go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"They say in business it's about location, location, location. Well, this is not the case with Taqueria El Buen Pator; however, it is about tacos tacos tacos- which is more important for a taqueria. 

Amazing al pastor tacos. Fresh, soft tortillas, warm, tender meat, fresh toppings, spicy salsas and horchata are all available here. Tacos at their finest!"}
{"text":"The food is very expensive and not that great. Let me tell you, not the best Al pastor by far.

I won't be back, ever!"}
{"text":"Well the location is not nice. 
The food is good enough, but not a deal!
Over half the time the Credit mechine is not working. After I braved the traffice, crack heads and ... to get there. not a safe place to have bring cash. end having to go some place else.

I am done with this place"}
{"text":"Finally stopped at this place as I see it often as I drive by.  They claim to be the best al pastor tacos!  They were not bad, but need I say they were not as good as a place we all know in Vegas rules. Not to take props away from this place. Again, good for a street taco. However,tortillas were not hand made and the al pastor was missing some seasoning.  Also they were served plane which I guess could be a plus but rather have a good seasoned al pastor and and made tortillas all fixed up for me  especially for 2.50 a taco!"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best Mexican food I've ever had, and I am a well seasoned consumer off all types of ethnic food. You absolutely must go here; it is cheap, quick, and the best thing you'll eat all day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The FOOD ARE DELICIOUS!  definitely worth paying! #weneedmexicans fuck Donald trump!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole batman! This place was fantastic.  Drawback is no place to sit but don't let that be a deterrent to check out this authentic Mexican food truck.  We had the gringa and the multia and both were great.  They have a variety of sauces you can dress up any food that you order with!  So glad that we decided to check it out."}
{"text":"The carne asada is top notch. For a food truck the prices are not cheap. We were overcharged $3. Big portions."}
{"text":"Best tacos I ever had! The carne asada was sooo juicy and flavorful! As well as the chicken! Amazing! I'll definitely be v back!"}
{"text":"I travel all over the U. S. and in every state and city I try Mexican food. Some are good some are bad. This food truck In Sahara and Vegas Blvd is defenelty good. I order a carne asada Burrito and it was out of this world. The hot green sauce spectacular. I don't think it was over price for what you get which is a pretty big burrito. I'll recommend any day!"}
{"text":"As a first time Mexican food eater (I know shocking right) I approve on this food LOL
I believe I ate Fajita Burrito and it is actually good!

One thing that I don't approve of is I've seen them leave the freezer of sauces open sometimes, I know this because I drive by here everyday! I'll give them the benefit of the doubt maybe it is the customers that leaves them open (damn customers LOL).
It gets busy in the afternoon all the way until 7 to 8pm. 

They keep their area clean and neat so I like that a lot knowing that the food truck is located at the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Sahara a LOT of bums and crack wh*res! 

But other than that I liked the food and I will try it again maybe tonight ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here and never had a problem until last night. A sign that stated 2 for 1 pastor tacos sat in front of the registar pretty good sized sign. My boyfriend ordered 3 pastor tacos, so I asked what was your total he said 8 something at that point I knew he was over charged. I got the attention of the lady at the registar and brought it to her attention and asked her would she prefer to do a refund or just give us another taco. She stated she needed to ask the other lady who put the sign out when we drove up. She spoke with the woman and the woman said \"oh when you order you have to tell us\" At that point I have to get out of character at what point do I have to tell you how to do your damn job with the sign you placed out I shouldn't have went there in the first place they have a fucking B Grade (BBBB Grade). I could understand if there was a language barrier but my boyfriend is Cuban and speaks perfect Spanish and spoke with the woman in such language so to say there just some no good scammers who don't honor there signs they put out. I'll just go that extra mile to my friends on Bonanza and Las Vegas Blvd and there tacos are .50 cheaper."}
{"text":"Naa worst than the one on bonaza 25 % more $$
And they cannot keep the condiment bar clean  or free of peaple eating on to of the condiments
Tacos was good but just warm ...
Of course is you are drinking you will not care.."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe or do justice to how amazing the Pastor is at the taco truck. It was so good we made a special second trip while on our vacation. Best street tacos I've had in my life !!!"}
