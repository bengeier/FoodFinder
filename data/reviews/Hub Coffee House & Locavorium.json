{"text":"Drink a good cup of coffee alfresco? Yes please. Breezy, airy and non-douchy service. Thank you Hubbers. 

Coffee is Dark Horse Roasted, meaning local and fresh. Milk and cream is organic. All of the food looked awesome and this place was damn cute. One hundred high fives."}
{"text":"The espresso is great. The drip coffee contained ground coffee dregs. The staff on the other hand, didn't change it to a fresh batch because \"it wasn't empty yet\".
Despite all that, the drip coffee was actually pretty decent, if you like non-acidic coffee."}
{"text":"I simply love this place! A true hidden gem of the city with fantastic coffee and fresh food ! Baked goods are my personal favorite throughout the city of Toronto. A perfect place to grab coffee/lunch/study/read etc. I gave The Hub a 5 star rating for a reason, not because it's easy to click or seem like a nice gesture but because of the consistency of coffee and food product and the fantastic service that they continue to put out. I cannot get tired of this place. Definitely my favorite cafe in the city!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood coffee shop. The staff are super friendly and kept chatting with regulars who came in while I was there. My iced coffee and gluten-free chocolate chip cookie were yummy and totally reasonably priced. The seating is adorable (old wooden bench! comfy couch!) and there's a ton of patio seating, which is great because it is a fairly small place. I love that it's tucked in on side streets, just off from the major roads."}
{"text":"There aren't many places in Toronto that bake things fresh every day or use local, organic ingredients.  This is one of my favourite spots in the city, hands down.  Try the buckwheat chocolate chip cookie.  Then you'll be coming back for more and more.

High fives to creative mind behind the business.  Love Hub!"}
{"text":"I was staying in the area and decided to pop in for my morning caffeine fix. I grabbed a two shot latte which was quite smooth and tasty. No fancy latte art which was fine by me. I'm more concerned about what my drink tastes like not what it looks like! I didn't try any of the food but it looked  pretty fresh and seemed reasonably priced. Friendly service and a nice set up. Will stop by again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"absolutely adorable! (I gotta put this at the beginning of my review for those who just skim the first couple sentences of a review).  

It's a very cozy cafe, tucked away in a side street. It has patio sitting, too bad it's not warm enough yet, I can imagine how peaceful it is to read a book, and sip some coffee.  You can be outdoor, enjoying the sun yet not feeling being in a city.

Taste of coffee - amazing! it's a lot better than those coffee chain coffee. 
Snacks - they got gluten free health cookies and vegan cookies; they have a few type of sandwiches too, vegan suitable too! They are pre-made, but they do put it in a sandwich grill for you, so it's actually really good, with some melted cheese."}
{"text":"It was really surprising to me when they chose to open this cafe in the middle of a residential area and that it's still in business. In fact, it's an extremely popular cafe in the area and it's usually packed. 

This cafe has quite an extensive list of drinks, along with other foods (such as sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, sweet treats, muffins, etc.) It's a packed cafe with such a small location. They have an outdoor patio, which is really nice for the warmer weather and helps expand the place, since it's already so tight inside. 

Used to be fantastic when they first opened - the quality of the food was really good and their drinks were made with tons of attention. I guess it's because of the fast blooming customers and having to hire new workers, the quality and service all have gone down. Everything is rushed or not done well. The B.O.Bs used to be my addiction for my weekend mornings, but slowly, it just started to fall apart really easily and they're not making it the way they used to, thus losing that unique taste of the little breakfast sandwich.

Not a cafe that I go out of my way to have anymore. Quite sad to see such a good local cafe spiral down in their quality so fast."}
{"text":"I'll agree with Sam on a ridiculous large void for decent coffee in this area but 5 star??.  Coffee was good, but still... nothing jumped out at me as spectacular by the reactions of those I was enjoying coffee with or those that ate the mini-egg bun.  Unless you lived in this coffee-less void would you run to this place?  A nice spot for a good coffee (btw pump your own from a large thermos unless it's espresso).  I can't say I'll tell all my friends about this spot."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic neighbourhood gem! The space is a little small but that adds to its charm. Americanos are always done right and their breakfast sandwiches (though a little on the small side) are a delicious pick me up. LOVE the surprise of the hoisin sauce! If you live in the area, visit Hub and give them some of your business!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!  A coffee shop opens up in the Ossington-Dupont area!

This place is great for a good cup of deliciously hand roasted, fair-trade coffee.  This is exactly what the neighborhood was missing.

And what's a good coffee shop, without a delcious breakfast sandwich?  They have this thing, called a B.O.B (Breakfast On a Bun).  It's a fried egg with cheese and I think tomato.  It usually comes with bacon, but I don't get it with the bacon.  Last, but not least, it is topped with delicious HOISIN SAUCE.  Now, I don't know if it's just because I heart hoisin, but man...it adds something special to the B.O.B.  Last time I went, the girl behind the counter said that she was going to try to make her own Hoisin.  I haven't been back since, but I'm sure it's delicious.

GO HERE."}
{"text":"The Hub is an independent coffee joint serving the neighborhood of Shaw between Bloor and Dupont. I discovered it one day when I changed up my bike route to school. The cafe is one of the more cozy spot I've discovered to sip coffee at. It doesn't try to be the \"in\" place, simply a comfortable spot to order a decent cup of coffee and perhaps a freshly baked good. Decor is composed mostly of dark wood tables with matching chairs on an equally dark wood floor, a French provincial couch and decorative platters on the wall. 

I haven't tried their espresso but the regular brew coffee is quite good. They French-press as oppose to drip brewing which is a plus in my book. Their baked goods are made on premise. The muffins are large, tasty and inexpensive. Haven't tried the BOB sandwich, at $4.50 I find myself leaning towards spending the extra couple bucks to get a full breakfast somewhere else. 

Worth noting that the Hub has an outdoor patio perfect for summer lounging as well as free Wi-Fi for those wielding laptops. 

If you live, work or otherwise happen to be in the area I suggest dropping by."}
{"text":"A big thank you to my Toronto \"other half\" Ms. Evelyn W, for introducing me to this rad little coffee shop located just a stones throw away from Ossington and Dupont. I love it as much as you do now!!!

Of course I appreciate any place with powerful free WiFi, strong coffee with little to no after taste, and who freshly bakes all their baked goods (with the exception of their breads which they bring in from an outside source). 

I didn't get a chance to try out their highly reviewed sandwiches but the Americano (my staple coffee drink) was strong, large, a double shot of espresso to my heart and cheap! It was under $3 for a large Americano (AHEM - Sbux please take note. Thank you). 

Also they totally understand that people want to come here to do work so they offer several power bars for people to plug their laptops into. BONUS POINTS!

Excited to return again in the future and try some more menu items and local faves!"}
{"text":"I am sitting at the hub right now and here is what is happening:

Neighbourhood people of all ages walking in and greeting each other and the nice ladies behind the counter.  Two friends bumped into each other, one with a newborn baby, and they are cooing over the baby and catching up.  Parents with small kids drinking hot chocolate and eating apple slices.  Friends in deep conversation over their lattes.

This place is hopping - but with a seriously warm community feel.  Doesn't strike me as hipster at all.  Just lovely.

And the breakfast on a bun is indeed delicious.  Healing, wholesome yumminess.

I'm so happy.  Oh - and one of the owners just ran a cup of coffee across the street to a neighbour.  Does it get nicer than that?"}
{"text":"I love the Hub!  Its such a neighbourhood place - kinda like Cheers, where everybody knows your name.

The sandwiches are cheesy, meaty and saucy delicious.
They typically offer the same varieties each day - Turkey, Ham, Grilled Cheese, and Summer Sausage.  Each of them is heated up in a sandwich press and served piping hot and tasty.
Their drinks are fantastic as well - iced lattes in particular are my fav.
Don't let their \"healthy cookie\" fool you either - its got chocolate in it, and is perhaps even better than their regular chocolate chip cookie.

Go there. Eat there."}
{"text":"This spot seems overrated to me. Maybe it's because there aren't many homegrown coffee shops in the immediate area? The coffee is fine. I am not impressed with the sandwiches however. 

For example, I ordered a small veggie sandwich from the counter (not for nothing at $6.50) and it wasn't fresh. You would think that grilling it may save the poor thing, but it actually hurt it to the point of being somewhat inedible. Oh man, soggy bread from tomatoes that had been sitting in there for a while ***shudder***. Unfortunately, this grilled premade sandwich is a total miss.

No disrespect to the owners and staff, I see how busy you are and this is a matter of supply and demand. You guys are popular, are generally praised by the yelp masses and so why step up your game? For bratty nattys like me?? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Locavorium...?  Yes, it is as amazing as it sounds!  

This place does it up right with all the main ingredients for the perfect neighborhood cafe: delicious beverages, healthy food options, friendly service, and a beautiful open space with lots of natural light.  The decor is cozy and eclectic, complete with a church pew, where indoor and outdoor seating is an option.
  
Thumbs up to free wifi and an array of outlets!"}
{"text":"Tiny homey coffee house on a residential street with a serene atmosphere.  Along with complimentary wi-fi, a perfect place to bring a laptop or a novel.  There are only about 10 seats in house so be forewarned if you arrive to find no seats as this seems to be quite a popular neighbourhood cafe - it's always filled with people.  Their coffee is brewed fresh, with gluten-free baked goods as their biggest selling point.  I had both their oatmeal and chocolate-chip cookies on two separate occasions and found them mealy and dry compared to other gluten-free goods I have had.  Their coffee was fresh but despite having ordered both regular coffee and their signature latte, it was lacking an oomph which I was looking for especially in the specialty drinks department. 

I would return with a favourite book for a quiet tranquil afternoon for the regular coffee, minus the baked goods."}
{"text":"So they've just opened another location at Dovercourt and Hallam- right down the street from me which is fantastic. Love their BOBs, the coffee is good and they've done a lot with the new space, making it cozy and hip. 

I hope this new location starts to see more business soon, as it's the only place around with a decent cup of coffee. The only negative is the guy at the counter always seems a bit grumpy. It's a little off-putting, but whatever- great café regardless."}
{"text":"I always walk my dog past this cafe since it's very close by the house, it always seems to be packed and I always see people sitting outside the cafe. My bf and I were both hungry and I decided to pick up something close by. It opens at 7 so I went to go pick something up, i wanted something like a BLT sandwich and the guy made me a BLT. You can ask for it grilled up or just like that. I think this is a great place to stop by in the morning if you wanna grab a coffee and a to go sandwich later for lunch. 
I also noticed that when another man walked in the server knew what the man wanted already then later said \" I'll add it to the tab\" I think it's great that the store trust their customers, great for customers that are on the go for work early In the morning. 

I would visit this store again but not everyday."}
{"text":"Cheddar peach scones and BOBs (breakfast on a bun). Must come before 11am!

Great espresso, free wifi, an array of seating with a couch, some chairs, and an outdoor patio, and delicious baked goods (including vegan brownies and glutten-free cookies) and other sandwiches and salads. 

Another plus is the location which is semi-suburban on a quiet side street but close to dupont and ossington, buses and TTC. Gets very crowded very early on a weekend...good luck!"}
{"text":"I love their grilled sandwiches, the 'brie/avocado/tomato on olive bread'  being my favourite.  The perfect homey place to get your coffee. No scenesters/hipsters there. Very lay back, almost baba-cool atmosphere...  This place is just perfect. Please don't tell anyone ;))

Update (February 29, 2012): Try their new Red Espresso Latte: To die for."}
{"text":"When this place first opened up I thought it was an odd choice for location -- right on Shaw Street (which is one way) and surrounded by houses rather than fellow businesses. But then I found myself thanking Hub Coffee House for setting up shop as their presence came in extremely handy a few months ago.

I was doing a freelance job in my neighbourhood (Hub is just down the street) and had to get up at 8:00am for this on-site contract. I am not a morning person whatsoever and was running too late to throw on a pot of coffee or have a decent breakfast. Thankfully I walked right past Hub and grabbed some essentials to get through the day. I even came back around lunch time for a second dose!

The place is quite tiny and situated on the bottom floor of a corner house. The upstairs tenants had been renovating their apartment a few years ago when Hub was a dodgy convenience store that few people seemed to frequent. They have a nice little seating area which is usually always occupied. In the summer they had some outdoor chairs, but the place could really benefit immensely with a proper patio.

Coffee was decent. Got a nice panini sandwich as well that came with a packet of chips too. I seem to remember the price of the smallish sandwich being one or two dollars more than I had hoped though. It's definitely nice having a café option so close to my apartment and I hope to take advantage of this place a little more in the warmer months ahead."}
{"text":"Amazing place to feel like a community. The coffees great, they offer almond milk and gluten free cookies (THE BUCKWHEAT DOUBLE CHOCOLATE COOKIES ARE TO DIE FOR), the staff  could be a little more inviting but in the end who wants that!

Bring your lap top on over and get coffee. they change the table positions almost' every week so they are obviously in the process of greatness. Don't go on a weekend morning if you want to sit down, totally packed. oh! and get a paninied sandwich, it'll make your week!"}
{"text":"They really do make me smell. I can't shake it. After the grilled panini, in the heat, I had two coffees, a caesar salad, a slice of pizza, a beer, a coca cola, some meatballs, and I still smelled the panini. I didn't change clothes, and I did hard labour that day. I still smelled like panini. Granted, I didn't have my trusty Listerine on my person, but when you order a sandwich you really don't think about having a bottle of Listerine on you do you? 

Also, it's $8 for said sandwich. That's a steep bill. Apparently everything is local. That's good news, but when you compare that $8 sandwich versus Vinny's veal around the block and Amore Foods around the other block... it doesn't stack up. 

Now... having said all of this, I love this place. And I've been coming here for the past few months in the warmer months and I love the patio. I couldn't find a quaint neighborhood place like this in San Francisco. The fact it's on a side street surrounded by residential is an example of why I love Toronto, and I reference this place. The patio is perfect. There are outlets hidden by the trees. There's plenty of seating. There iced coffee is better than the warm coffee. I wouldn't go out of my way for the coffee but I would for the patio. But watch out for that panini waft coat in the cold months inside or whenever you eat it."}
{"text":"Had a cocoa and a toasted sandwich. Very good. Nice quaint neighborhood. I heard they are working on getting a patio made."}
{"text":"A-OK! More like 3.5 star. I've stopped in a couple times for coffee-to-go. Coffee is very good.

On Sunday I sampled one of their sambos (called \"BOB\") which was a tiny english muffin with an egg, strip of bacon and some really tasty hoisin sauce). It was delicious but at $4 not really a bargain, I could easily eat 3. 

I like that this place is in the middle of nowhere, in a real residential neighbourhood. Convenient if you live or pass nearby, but not really worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Oh guyyyys \"Locovorium\"? For realllllll? 

BUT bright, airy, great patio, quiet residential street, good sandwiches, *cucumber water*, nice coffee, good cookies, etc. Very nice staff, reminiscent of your 'cool counsellors' from that camp where everyone knew all the words to \"Venice is Sinking\". 

I like it better than Saving Gigi or The Common (fairly proximate) because largely, the clientele seem to be 30-40sthg work-at-homers in the neighbourhood, instead of vaguely bitchy 16-32 y/o homeworkers-at-coffeeshops. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid of my own generation. 

CONCLUSION: Bean sprouts eternal...?"}
{"text":"Still a fan based on subsequent visits, but not feeling the 5 anymore.  Had a sandwich there which was OK to good but not very good, which would be needed to sustain the 5 rating.  I liked how they served the sandwich with a small dish of raw almonds and another small dish of razor thin apple slices - to cleanse the palate between bites I suppose."}
{"text":"What a charming little place!  Trendy and cool  :)

My funloving button-down gingham shirt donning companion and I went out for a stroll, on a sunny day.  Birds were chirping, the sky was nearly smurf blue.  All the chips were in place for a good experience at Hub Coffee House & Locavorium.  

They have a small sign within the store, that states that all of their breads are vegan, and that their cheese, eggs, and meats, are local!
There's water with lemon slices ready for you to drink, if you're not in the mood for a matcha latte or coffee.

HIP servers.  I told my companion that the tall dark version woman with very short bangs and tats, was an alternate version of me.
Sincerely Good in attitude.

I had a scone and shared a Breakfast-on-a-Bun.  I sipped some Americano.  The B-on-a-B was $4.00, $4.20 in total w/ taxes.  My instant verbal reaction, after one moment was... \"Mmm...Heaven in a Bite!\"

If you're vegetarian, just tell them -- they'll replace bacon with veggies!

Mmm... parmesan bits embedded in warm fried egg, soft  fresh local farmers' bread, mayo?, hoisin* sauce, lettuce, visible pepper.  What a delight.  Choice of either Mennonite bacon or more local farmer's veggies to boot.  *I just called and checked - their hoisin sauce does not have any shell/fish products in it, like others do.

If you're coming from Scarborough or Aurora, give this place a pass.
If you live pretty nearby or are going to the Korea town area anyway, and the weather's awesome, head this way for a Breakfast-on-a-Bun eating EXPERIENCE.

customer demographics: cool hipsters (check out their fashion while there!), 25-43...

Going in groups of 1-5 = better than going in large groups..."}
{"text":"OK. I love this place, but I am docking them one star.

Why? Because they make you the stinky kid in class. The grilling of their paninis really sticks with you. Like, for hours and hours. \"You smell like food.\" Has been said to me on two different occasions by two different people after spending the day working here. Gross. 

I look forward to sitting on their patio and enjoying my fave sandwiches soon. This should alleviate the stinky factor. Bring on the sunshine, Hogtown."}
