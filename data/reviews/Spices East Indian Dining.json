{"text":"The first time I ordered from Spices, I was very pleased. The Lamb Roganjosh had a thick, flavorful sauce and the lamb was well cooked. The garlic naan was a huge portion and so was the coconut rice. I just ordered takeout again tonight, and I can't believe how poor quality has become in only 2 months. I ordered the Lamb Roganjosh again, and it was soooo oily. Like a layer of oil. I drained most of it, but after taking a few bites, the oil coated my mouth. It was disgusting. The garlic naan was 2 very tiny pieces. Really the only good thing was the onion bhaji. Such a shame, as it was delicious the first time."}
{"text":"I've only been in Calgary for a couple months and tried my local Indian place twice only to be disappointed both times. The extra 10 min drive to spices was well worth it. I'm an ex-chef and my girlfriend is Sikh, we were both impressed by the quality and flavour of our dinner! The chilli chicken, shahi paneer, and veg. Pakoras were excellent! We are from the lower mainland and eat a lot of Indian, this place was great! It's a little pricy and the portions aren't great but the flavour made up for it. We will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Good portions. Lots of big chunks of chicken in the butter chicken. Garlic naan was good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food ! The staff were great and explained each of the dishes to me.I ended up getting the butter chicken and the spinach and cheese dish . Both were super yummy and the portions were quite large. The food didn't take very long but was made fresh which is awesome . Thanks for the great food I will for sure be back !"}
{"text":"We order Indian food at least once a month and (though we've tried a ton of Indian places around the SW) Spices is pretty much our go to. Their vegetarian dishes are awesome, especially vegetable jalfrezie (amazing) and eggplant bartha. Shahi paneer is pretty good too. As for non-veg dishes, the chicken is always decent but I definitely recommend against the lamb. I've never had such tough, over-cooked lamb in a curry. So stay away from the lamb, and get some yummy veggie dishes!

Also, potions are HUGE. As a family of four we got three pieces of naan and had more than half left over."}
{"text":"Ordered simple butter chicken and rice. Terrible flavour and very little chicken in the butter chicken sauce. It's very hard to mess up basmati rice but theirs was oily and had a strange taste. Worst Indian I have had."}
