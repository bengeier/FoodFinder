{"text":"Think of the worst pizza place you've ever been to. This place is 100x times worse. Delissio over this garbage any day."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great chicken parm. Definitely the best option by Fort York. It would be a great idea to offer garlic bread and not just the knots."}
{"text":"Great pizza place! Its loaded with chicken and all the good toppings! Manager is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this local place out vs ordering pizza from a big chain. It was not that great. I had trouble placing my order on their website which delayed the order. And the pizza itself tasted like cardboard. I won't be ordering from them again unfortunately."}
{"text":"the service left alot to be desired. definitely a convenient location but I think i would rather walk further for a better pizza."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from this place several times, and have always been pleased. The food comes quickly, it's hot, fresh and, unlike many other pizzerias: this place delivers  Stromboli.  If you've never had a Stromboli, you're missing out. It's a big, tasty, freshly-baked, rolled, cross between a calzone and a sandwich that's stuffed with tasty goodness.  I hadn't had one in years until I discovered Fort York Pizzeria and wasn't disappointed.  There are a lot of places in the area that deliver pizza or Italian sandwiches, but not Stromboli, so that gives this place an edge."}
{"text":"Let me start with a short story: I had eaten the pizza from here before and been very impressed. It was fresh, slightly doughy but not overly so, toppings were good and cheese was evenly distributed and overall good quality. I said I would order again.  So, tonight I had friends over at my place, one from out of town who wanted a local Toronto business to eat from so I suggested we order here. When I called I asked if they had any two medium or two large specials with three toppings and they they advised me to order one called the \"Football Special\". It was $26.99 for two larges. Since I had specified I wanted three toppings, I assumed these came with the special. Nonetheless I asked to clarify and the guy on the phone kept repeating the special so I figured that's what it was. The pizzas arrived in about 50 min. Not too long, but considering how close they were and that the driver said they weren't busy that night, not too quick either. But that wasn't the issue. The issue was that the pizzas came out to a whooping $53!! The driver had left by the time I looked at the receipt and my friend's girlfriend had put it on her credit card and was the one who had signed for it so it was too late, but $53??! On top of that, we'd asked for double bacon and there was definitely NOT double bacon on it, and the receipt said we'd asked for goat cheese on one pie, which we hadn't.   Won't EVER be ordering again. They ripped us off. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"I like to give business to locals independent businesses but would definitely pass on this one.   The crust tasted like cardboard and the toppings were very sparse.  $19 for a med which was more like a small was overpriced for an average pizza, another reason to avoid it. Very disappointed!  Back to Pizzaville"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Got a medium Works pizza and garlic knots, order was ready in less than 20 minutes.  Good food, close to home. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Totally convenient pizza via delivery if you are staying in the area.  We walked in to pick up a menu.  Staff was kind.  We ordered and the delivery arrived accurately without incident.  Of note-- the margarita pizza has a healthy and enjoyable dose of garlic.  #foodtourism"}
{"text":"It was close and convenient but it reminded me of cheap, homemade pizza. Especially the canned (or at least not fresh) mushrooms. It's nice to have the option but you can do better at home or to order from elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love that the fort York area is filling in with great shops and restaurants like this place.  It's a little slice of Italy right there amidst your condoland.   I stumbled by and am thrilled that I popped in.  Thin slices ready to go.  Then I noticed a beautiful, gleaming shiny new espresso machine.  New age as if it could crank out shots ...  delish long espresso.   Give it a whirl."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had.  Tried the buffalo chicken.  Not much flavour and I could have counted the pieces of chicken on one hand.  Frozen pizza tastes better."}
{"text":"I just ordered a ham and cheese pizza and vegan lasagna. Pizza Hut as better pizza without a doubt."}
