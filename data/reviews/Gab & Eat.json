{"text":"Breakfast was real good. Toast was great. 3 of us all liked our food. Plus got sandwiches to go. Lots of food for a  reasonable price. May have to wait to be seated. Great small diner. Will return again."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious breakfast!
I know it's strange to say, but they make the best toast. I typically do not eat my toast at breakfast, but here, it's my favorite part. I either get the ham and half waffle or ham, Italian toast and 1 egg scrambled. The wait staff is very casual and friendly.
Just be prepared to go for the food, not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The other reveiews are accurate and what you see is what you get.

The place has been there forever and for good reason. The portions were huge and food delicious. Service was great with frequent drink refills.

We had breakfast and it would be worth another visit.

I recomend the mixed grill (half) and the protion was so big I could not finish.

It is cash only but who cares, stop by an ATM on the way.

3 full breakfasts including drinks was  20 bucks, what a deal."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half)."}
{"text":"What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. 
Fantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00."}
{"text":"Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive."}
{"text":"Just left grab n eat, the food was awesome and the service was great.  Tiny place with a friendly atmosphere.  The homemade italian toast is wonderful.  I suggest the mix grill with a side of sausage, which is homemade."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and a great \"diner\" atmosphere.  It's the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friends."}
{"text":"The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.

HUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.

I've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.

Cramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go to Gab and eat all of the time, and would always take out of towners here.  That last time we went we did something we've never done before and that was walk out!  My omelet was not cooked and it was runny, I asked for cheddar cheese and got american, my husband ordered a medium rare hamburger and got a burnt paper thin patty.  When we told the waitress she sent the cook over and he gave us attitude and was a total jerk.  He wanted to put my omelet in the microwave.  If I wanted a microwave omelet I would have gone to burger king."}
{"text":"Great homemade food. Great prices and great staff and atmosphere. Been around for 35 years. It's cash only though."}
{"text":"If you're looking for no frills but a great breakfast this is the place. I got the mixed grill half portion and was very full. Make sure you have extra calories for the day because they are not afraid to use butter. Loved the breakfast and would go back. Not much room for sitting down but worth the wait."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint of all time. Awesome coffee, pancakes, waffles, sausage...you name it. The service is what you'd expect it to be. :) love love love this place. You will more then likely have to wait for a seat on a weekend. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"THE best breakfast place BY FAR. I never even liked breakfast food until trying their eggs and French toast."}
{"text":"Very cute, little dive place (with an emphasis on little). Breakfast meals are my favorite. So, I thought everything on the menu looked delicious. I ended up ordering a breakfast bagel sandwich. I couldn't have made it any better myself. My mom ordered the half portion of the mixed grill which was a medley of sweet and spicy sausage, egg, home fries, and peppers. I also ordered a half portion of French fries, and they were absolutely perfect. These are my definition of the best kind of French fries. They're fresh cut, with the skins still on them.

We were in and out within 30 minutes with our stomachs full and happy. They only take cash though. So make sure you have some green in your wallet before you stop by."}
{"text":"Wow! Read the great reviews and I was not let down. Huge portions. The mixed grill was THE best breakfast I've ever had. If you go to Pittsburgh it is a must eat. Service was superb. Friendly staff. Led zeppelin on the walls. .....what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon

The coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.

Totally recommended. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.

Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy."}
{"text":"Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.

What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.

Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in."}
{"text":"Best little hole in the wall for breakfast!!! You get your money's worth and a good conversation!! I suggest the mixed grill with Mancini's raisin toast!!!"}
{"text":"Great diner. Some of the best breakfast sausage I've ever had. My wife didn't like how her omelet was prepared (it appeared they just took scrambled eggs and folded the omelet ingredients in the middle) but everything else was great including my son's pancake."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch around! Everything fresh cooked and hot off the grill. Good service and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't go... I'm not quite sure how this place hasn't been shut down by the health department. Definately not clean. They are holding and scooping raw ground meat next to lettuce and tomatoes and pieces if raw meat were falling into the fresh veggies. The owner (I believe) had a hissy fit at some point and ripped up tickets from a server and threw them because the server didn't fill them out properly. They don't deserve your money."}
{"text":"Best I can say is that it's ok. Very small and compact. I went with my one and a half year old daughter and the booths are so crammed in that there is no room for high chairs (pretty sure they don't even have high chairs). They did have booster seats, but it was not ideal.

Food was ok. Nothing special. I had sausage and cheese omlette and got a pancake for my daughter. Again, just ok.

It was hot in there and I don't think they have AC. There was a fan in front, but that did little for us who where sitting in the back.

This place is cash only. I didn't see anything on my way in stating that, but I could have missed it. It doesn't say Cash Only anywhere inside or on the menu either. There is an ATM, but it has a $2 charge to use. Can't believe a place in 2016 doesn't take cards.

Probably won't ever go back since there are similar breakfast places closer to where I live that are more kid friendly, have better food and AC and accept more than just cash."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and I get the chance, and have NEVER been disappointed!

The perfect blend of non-chain-tightly-packed ambiance,friendly older waitresses who have been there since I started going, cheap for what you get prices, and food with taste and amounts that \"Aunt Bee\" would be proud of.

Never had anything that wasn't hot,freshly made before my eyes,and down home \"gooooooooooood\"' as Andy might say.

As my wife and I agree,this \"joint\", has been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfasts have been measured against!

One visit...and you will be a believer, and most times I've been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself."}
{"text":"Their Italian bread (and therefore French Toast) is thick, crusty, and delicious! I'm not a fan of the green peppers (perhaps marinated) and onions (undercooked) in the home fries if you add them. Great value for low cost and I recommend trying it. My boyfriend loves this place but I prefer Bob's Diner, Eggs R Us, and Bak'n."}
{"text":"Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. 

Here are the highlights:

-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.
-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)
-Cash only
-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack
-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.
-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo"}
{"text":"We found this place here, on yelp. We read some reviews and decided we needed to try it out. What a great dive diner! Great prices, healthy portions, and plenty of parking. Service was great and the food was yummy and filling. Specifically my Italian bread toast. That shit was delicious. Get it.
Friendly disclaimer: when I say dive, I mean dive. So don't go in expecting anything other than that haha. But it's charming in its own right. I'd definitely go again! We are actually going to stop on our way back home to SC to get a burger."}
{"text":"Simple. You will always have a happy belly.
It's a bit tight in the building but who cares with the deliciousness. The place is always packed so that says it all."}
{"text":"I would give this a solid one star. Let me tell you about my experience...
I walk in to a nasty glare by one of the waitresses before seating myself at a table covered in advertisements and a woman throwing menus at us before walking away.
The waitress was a sweet old woman.
She was nice, but hard of hearing and unattentive.
Here's what I ordered:
Two egg whites scrambled, links, Italian toast, and a half order of home fries.
Here's what I got:
Two scrambled whole eggs, Italian toast, and home fries.
I addressed the missing links with the waitress and she asked me if I still wanted them. I was starved by this point and said yes. I heard her to go the chef and ask for them, to which the woman behind the grill screamed, \"For what? Do you have the slip? Where is it? Where does it say links?\" in a considerably nasty tone.
The eggs were mediocre, the home fries were unevenly cooked (mostly uncooked potato chunks, some practically ash), the links were so tasteless I stopped eating them as soon as I recognized I was full, but the toast was lovely.
The prices are ok, but I'd prefer a college student's hungover cooking to coming back here.

Update:
30 minutes after leaving I got a vicious headache.
500 milligrams of acetaminophen later, my headache has gotten worse, new unpleasant symptoms have come along, and I may have contracted food poisoning.

Update 2:
I have food poisoning. 100% definitely food poisoning. I haven't eaten anything but pretzel rods and nutrition bars before breakfast here since 1pm the day before. I obviously haven't eaten since. There's actually no other place I could have contracted it."}
{"text":"If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning, come here. This greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.

They serve waffles in halves, which is great. The eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.

If you're hungry, get \"The Mixed Grill\"... Gab and Eat's brand of the \"kitchen sink\" breakfast that all Midwest places are about."}
{"text":"One of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open for breakfast and lunch. The local atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment.  

Mixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  They will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. 

Their burgers are up there with the best in Pittsburgh. 

A hidden gem. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around.  Warning: nothing is low-fat here, but it's full of fat and butter and delicious.  Only way to go.  Your plates, silverware and cup may not match any body's else's at your table, and the walls may haven't been washed this year yet, but who cares.  Great food, you get it quick, and if there is a wait it's never more than 10 minutes or so on the weekend for breakfast.  I would love to try lunch here, I can only imagine a grilled cheese on that grill with their awesome sourdough bread.  Don't mind looking at the Led Zeppelin stuff on the walls while I'm waiting either."}
{"text":"We came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured we'd give it another shot since it's pretty close to our home. It's still just OK. We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change. There are a lot of good diners in the area, so I doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"A fine breakfast joint. You gotta love the small diners. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  

When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have only been here twice, only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work. However, when I am in the area, this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and breakfast. Its almost like going back in time to where the old style local diners or Isaly's to get made to order diner style food. Love the eggs made perfectly to order and a variety of lunch offering at extremely affordable prices. I only wish Gab & Eat would move to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very nice greasy spoon diner for when you're in the mood for large French Toast, pancakes, omelets.
Gets a little busy and is cash only, fyi.
Worth the trip for Americana."}
{"text":"Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good."}
{"text":"Great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel. 

Reminds me of the one my parents used to own in Mi. 

Have fun finding a table on the weekend :)"}
{"text":"I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. 

This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.

We want to return sometime for \"turkey day.\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!

Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Really just OK. It was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter, she gave us a dirty look like we weren't welcome there. Eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order. The server was nice enough, but wasn't very quick with the coffee refills - I finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes. Food was ok, but not amazing. We got the mixed grill and a pancake, and both were solid but not outstanding. 
Not a bad place to go, but we probably won't go out of our way to go here again, either."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and decent prices! We went on a weekend morning, so it was pretty busy. The wait wasn't too bad, but once we were seated it did take awhile for our orders to be taken, and quite some time as well for the food to be brought out. Also did not receive our coffees and dessert. Again, it seems like a pleasant enough place and being a super swamped waitress is never a fun time. I'll have to try to stop by sometime at a non-peak time to try everything out!"}
{"text":"BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.

It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana."}
{"text":"Local breakfast place. All the standard morning staples deliciously prepared. Gets crowded & there's a wait after about 7:30 most days. Good enough for Michael Jordan!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Best ham and cheese inlet I've ever had! Their burgers are also delicious. Nice flat-top crust on the burger. I only wish they were open for dinner too!"}
{"text":"Yum - freaking - me!

As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:

- Don't eat early in the week 
- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave


 I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.

My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.

Food - 

The Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     

Portion -

This should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.

Service - 

My waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.

Price - 

The cost ranges $5 - 10.


I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite breakfast spots. If you're looking for a greasy spoon, this is the place to go. 

There is generally always a wait, but believe me when I say it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall. I didn't think it would be as good as the reviews but it did not disappoint. The homemade sausage is probably the best I've ever had. The John Boy sandwich needed nothing else added to it. If you're ever close by it's worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best place for breakfast....but today...I decided to get lunch. {Only because it was lunch time...but they do serve breakfast at this time, too.}. I got the turkey club on wholewheat...OMG...it was delish.  Too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made French Fries.  If you are really hungry and don't count calories...make a stop here."}
{"text":"My friend and i stopped in yesterday for breakfast. We originally came to Carnegie to eat at another new breakfast spot, but they had an hour wait and we had some retail therapy to handle stat. Gab & Eat crossed my mind since i had bookmarked it on yelp.. over 2 years ago. 

There was a tiny wait here.. about 2 couples in front of us. Finally 2 seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.

Surprisingly we both ordered the same thing.. mixed grill. Mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon. 

It was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes. Giant club sandwiches, super thick pancakes, eggs eggs and more eggs.. it was a fun time. 

The restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food. 

My only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese. I thought it was going to be shredded cheddar, but they put 3 slices of american on it. Eh i'll know better next time."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast stop with that home sweet home small town vibe. Food is tasty and at a reasonably inexpensive price. One of my fave bfast places anywhere in Pgh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is as Legit diner breakfast as you can get. Everything on the menu is top notch. I would highly recommend trying both the Sweet and the Hot homemade sausage. 

I haven't been here for lunch yet, but I've heard really good things about their burgers and sandwiches. The service is prompt, kind, and to the point. Gab & Eat has replaced my local breakfast joint, Eggs R Us, and I would put it up against any other diner in the Burgh. 

If you are a, most important meal of the day, warrior, then you have to check this place out. You won't be disappointed... 

Unless you like designer lattes and egg white frittatas... Then Gab & Eat might not be your jam..."}
{"text":"A lot of food for a great price. Been eating here for years. They only take cash so make sure you stop by the ATM on your way there!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I ate breakfast here. Honestly , I'm not sure why? I really like this Gab & Eat.
The food here is really good (try the hot sausage), the wait staff is wonderful and the price is better than Denny's.
Even the coffee is really good. I can't believe I forgot about you guy's for so long. I'm sorry about that & I will be coming back.
PS. NO loud and obnoxious music.. maybe a few loud customers , but that's not the restaurants fault.
nobody uses their indoor voices anymore. 5 Stars Guy's !"}
{"text":"Wonderful omelets, coffee, and staff! The prices are great and the food is prepared quickly! Veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite!"}
{"text":"OK, what is with all of these \"CASH ONLY\" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. 

Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!

My first impression is \"Eh.\"  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  

\"2 eggs and toast $x.xx\"
\"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\"
\"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\"

I'd rather go to a Denny's and order the \"create your own Grand Slam!\""}
{"text":"On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.
We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.
Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.
The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.
After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. 
His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.
The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?
Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.
My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.
It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.
Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.
While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had."}
{"text":"This is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates."}
{"text":"stopped for breakfast here while passing through on the way back to Columbus. well worth the 3 minute one way detour from the usual interstate exit fare. had the breakfast sandwich on Italian and home fries. good portions and excellent service. 
only negative - bathrooms !"}
{"text":"They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town feeling. Mix match coffee mugs, smiling waitresses, open front diner kitchen feel. Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It's a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what's to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and \"Hey Rayed\" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well. I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty fantastic! Always a great place to travel to, always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday late morning around 11am. 
Full mixed grill was huge -- they don't actually mix it just throw it all on a plate. 
Waited quite a while for the food."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast stop. Prices are very reasonable, service was great and the food was great! I had an omelette with their amazing italian bread and i couldn't finish it all. Not a lot of tables, so you may have to wait or sit at the counter but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Driving from airport to hotel in North Huntington and wanted a breakfast place other than the usual cracker barrels. This was awesome. Loved the mixed grill and husband had the delicious pancakes.  May have to come back early to try hamburgers on our way back to Texas"}
{"text":"I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy or gourmet about this place. But it is the most fun, most authentic dining experience you'll have in Pittsburgh. From the mix matched dishes and mugs to the thick accents, everyone here is a friend. Unless you're wearing a Ravens or Patriots jersey. In which case you'll still be welcomed. They will just talk about you behind your back."}
{"text":"Good local spot to grab breakfast. Good prices for the amount of food you get. You can sit at the booths or at the counter"}
{"text":"We were getting some work completed at Flynn's tire center. We needed breakfast and stopped at this place. We never heard of it.

The food was very good and quick. Advice is that they do not accept credit cards. They do have an ATM inside.

I recommend this place. Great food, service and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have \"dippy\" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a \"dippy\" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Gab & Eat...two things I am very proficient at.

Having been told how great Gab & Eat was by my better half we went and checked it out this weekend. It's in a little strip mall next to a Barber Shop in Carnegie. Barber Shop's and a greasy spoon. Say no more!

The restaurant is long and narrow inside and there is a bar which you can sit at and watch the cooks produce their goods, and goods they are. We had to wait a few minutes for a seat to open and we sat ourselves promptly. Our server took our order for beverages while we checked out the menu. I had coffee as did she. Their coffee is a bit on the weak side, so if you're expecting a pick me up, look elsewhere. It's diner coffee.

I chose to have two eggs over medium, home fries, sausage patties(one of each, hot and sweet) and Italian toast. The toast was easily 1-1/2\" thick. Evidently the sausage is made specifically for Gab & Eat from what I gather. It's good. In fact it's probably some of the best breakfast sausage I'd ever ate in a restaurant. The seasoning was perfect. My eggs were a hair underdone for over medium, but they were still very good. The home-fries were both soft and crispy at the same time. They were fantastic. 

I also ordered two pancakes. Being as I'd never been I figured I'd better try them, you know, for science sake. They were good. Nice and fluffy, good flavor and not burnt. Definitely should've just ordered one.

She had the 1/2 Mixed Grill add mushrooms and half of a Belgian waffle. She loved it. The Belgian waffle remained crispy even after applying the necessary maple syrup. 

Gab & Eat is everything that I like. It's been there for a long time. It's a very local place. It has a history. It's not a fly by night diner or an experimental breakfast joint. What they make stands the test of time and it's just plain good."}
{"text":"OMG. Awesome food. Love it all. The breakfast is the best. Homemade soups are yummy. I just wish they would serve some of the food that they offer with their catering."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just don't need a fancy shmancy over-priced frilly frittata-ed brunch to get the job done. Sometimes you just want a greasy spoon diner that knows how to fry up some good breakfast.

I love this place. The booths are falling apart, the waitresses aren't overly nice, and it's chaotic. But I can design my perfect breakfast because they serve half waffles and single French toasts! I hate having to choose between sweet and savory breakfast and, at Gab & Eat, you don't have to. Everything I've eaten here has been very good. 
Waffles = gooood. 
Sausage Patties= gooood. 
Mixed grill = gooooood. 
Pepper, onion, sausage, cheese, and potato omelet = so so so good. 

You really can't go wrong here. It's a great place for cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious."}
{"text":"Good Luck getting a seat, that's all I have to say. The Gab and Eat is famous and infamous. Diner food is what's up and I like it. When I was a roofing mechanic, we'd meet there before work. Although I'm not sure I would recommend it if you're working were there's no bathrooms. hehe"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this spot! Everyone builds so much hype on it. I didn't know what to expect so on entering you seat your self and I was greeted. On the right side there's pictures of friends and family's dining and I thought that was cool. The left side had cool trivia questions so it's fun to quiz each other at the table. 

For the food I ordered two eggs poached and they where cooked wonderfully. I got the homemade sausage one spicy and one regular to try both and I was impressed with how much flavor they had. Not to much spice and very balanced I put maple syrup on them and it was so mouth watering. I got Italian toast for the bread and was not impressed very thick slices and the crust was super hard but the center was soft. As for the French toast it didn't taste like it was cooked all the way and had Aton of butter on it and just like the toast the crust was super hard. 

Overall I'll definitely come back to try it one more time but I'm not as impressed as I was hoping for. The staff here is wonderful and made sure she checked in a few times. One big thing that I liked was the tables are pre set and the waiter makes sure to put down 2/3 napkins so there already available as needed."}
{"text":"Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!"}
{"text":"Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, good price. You might have to stand outside in line though, so I don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. Very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. They have great deserts and such also. Bring your cash though as they dont' take cards."}
{"text":"Note #1: Gab & Eat is strictly CASH ONLY! An ATM can be found inside the CVS next door. 

Note: #2: If you come by, you will likely have a wait in front of you as the small joint is very busy, particularly on a weekend morning. Be patient. 

I almost ordered the \"mixed grill\". 

That was until we spoke with a local gentleman during our wait who swore by their various burgers. 

Afterwards, I caught a glimpse of that pulchritudinous, fat-marbled minced beef being pulled out of a deep, stainless steel pan in unsparing clumps with a top-heavy, thick-handled, coruscating disher only to be smashed upon an inexorably torrid, tabular, metallic surface. 

Mine was ordered with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, mayonnaise, an adorningly wilted square of American cheese, and a fried egg. 

Word of a good burger will always deflect my plans. 

My only grouse with the burger is that it was a tad overdone, but it appears that G&E cooks them \"French Style\" like Steak N Shake does since I wasn't asked how I wanted it prepared. In spite of that, it was a pretty admirable burger, the best part of it being the flaky crust of what must have been a fresh-baked bun. 

As I side, I ignored the seductive crackling noise the bubbling, churning fat made and decided on their potato salad, which made for an easy field goal. \"Just how mom used to make\" is SUCH a cliche, but I can honestly tell you all that as a potato salad cognoscente whose very alive mother makes what in his opinion is the best tuber salad ever, THIS very much approached Mum's own. It was warm (made to order?), fluffy, sublimely seasoned, had that blend of softness/crunch/savory/sweet I always look for, and was just effortlessly edible.  Gimme a bucket of it, and a glazed donut...to go! 

For dessert, Kay and I shared a cut of their Cherry Walnut pie, the only confection they had left for the day. One could merely deduce from first glance alone that the most affectionate archetypical grandmother made it...from scratch with its brown, sugar-encrusted dough and pasty, tart filling. Upon digging in though, I found that it was almost as toothsome as it looked. Not that anything was terribly wrong with it, mind you. It was very good, in fact, but there was just something missing that I cannot finger at the moment. 

Some people might complain about the Polaroid-strewn, graffiti-laden walls, narrow structure, and olden decor, but damn it, that's one reason why people, myself included, are in love with diners; they're familiar, comforting, intimate, offer the basics we all crave, and if they've been around as long as the trees have, then you know they must be doing something right, and G&E does a whole bevy of things right. 

P.S. I still like The Dor-Stop more, but G&E is worthy. I will come back for that mixed grill monstrosity and will vanquish it. 

P.P.S. As we waited, we saw a massive, bald man with a Bat-insignia of shaved hair right above his neck sitting with his back turned to us. When he stood up and walked towards us to exit the establishment with a young companion, he looked even more imposing with his long fur coat, ebony/ivory beard, and gold chain. As soon as we sat down in the booth the two men had just vacated, our lovely elderly server said to us, \"You know, that fella is a wrestler!\"

Being that I know a bit about pro wrestling, I asked what his name was since he did look familiar.

It turns out that we had a brush with Tony Marino, a local grappler who at one time performed in the ring as \"Battman\" and tag-teamed with the legendary Bruno Sammartino!

Yikes!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  

Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Local atmosphere and home cooked food makes this place the best! Everything is great from the mismatched mugs to the big portion sizes. Downside is that it is cash only, but that does not keep people away. There is usually a line to get in, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and super food. Modest environment with excellent food. Worth the wait.. dont miss this one. 
Best breakfast and lunch food in the Pgh South Hills hands down."}
{"text":"This local joint has a full menu, but we went on a Friday around 1pm for a late brunch. It's a seat-yourself super casual and friendly place. 

I got a mushroom & cheese omelet with Italian bread. It was not what I was expecting at all - basically an egg taco filled with what looked like a mountain of canned mushrooms. It was actually pretty hilarious! The toast was so so so good though: grilled and buttery!

Also - even the half portion of the mixed grille was HUUUGE! And if you decide to get onion be prepared for what appeared to be an entire spiralized cooked onion thrown in the middle. 

Good prices, big portions, I wouldn't get the omelet again but I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. People are nice and friendly.  Excellent food great pancakes Only stopped going after finding a roach in my potatoes   It's a shame the place was one of my favorites.  Bit can't go back after that experience"}
{"text":"A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I stopped in here due to a change in luncheon plans. Upon arrival the wait to be seated was horrific! Someone pointed to an empty counter stool so I sat there. I perused the menu fairly quick and decided to order half portions. I hadn't had a waffle in ages and I love home fries.

Since they both came in half portions I went with those. My waitress made sure I always had a fresh cup of hot tea since I was sitting near the entrance. It seemed like a long production line to wait for your order but it did not disappoint. When I got my half orders I was overwhelmed at the size!

The waffle was thick and fluffy and the home fries which bore a resemblance to hash browns were hot and greasy. Ketchup is on the counter as well as syrup. Yes they use real butter here since I could observe one of the chefs using a giant slab of it in preparation of orders.

I definitely plan to revisit this place when I have more time to try different things. My advice would be to prepare to take home a doggy bag since they give huge portions even if they are half size. The best part is that prices here are very reasonable and you can get a lot of food for what you order.

Gab and Eat is located in a small strip mall just on the cusp of the entrance to Carnegie. It is easy to miss if you are looking for a particular building."}
{"text":"My wife ordered three poached well eggs and raisin toast, and I got a ham and cheese (provolone) omelet with Italian toast (Breadworks). The toast was more than an inch thick and was honestly more like four slices. My wife couldn't even finish hers. It was a meal in itself. The omelet was weird - by far the most amount of ham I have ever seen in a breakfast, AT LEAST half a pound. But instead of being included in the omelet, it was just thrown on the plate, with a circular egg patty and cheese thrown on top. It was good, just not what you would expect for an omelet. Regardless, with the huge serving of toast, it was the most food we have ever gotten, all for only $15. The \"lazy\" omelet construction - and lack of a side of fruit - brought it down to four stars. But the price and flavor of the food, to go with the huge quantities, means we will probably go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast stops in Pittsburgh! Can't beat the hometown feel of this place. Always had great service."}
{"text":"This place is divey but cute. The food is obviously not five-star, but it's a great place if you want to get a good, hearty breakfast. We went there for lunch and got burgers...oddly enough the server said that they don't sell French Fries on Sundays.....? So we had to settle for home fries. I thought it was a little weird at first, but damn, those home fries were good! I didn't even care after that. The coffee is great too!
It's a unique little place. It's basically one long strip of a kitchen, then booths set up right beside it! They also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order. The coffee cups didn't match - they were all Christmas mugs lol - they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker, and they have little trivia boards on the wall just for fun. It's definitely a place of it's own kind. The prices are very reasonable, and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"First time at Gab & Eat and we are ranking this at the top of our diner experiences. 

On par with Summit and Nancy's (see reviews)

This is an excellent choice and compares like this:

Wait staff are excellent, friendly and very efficient and on par with Nancy's and Mama G's and far better than Summit

Better than Summit for coffee, toast and sausage 

Better than Nancy's for coffee and sausage

Not as good as Nancy's for home fries but only because we like slices not cubed - Gab & Eat are still excellent

We also prefer thin, crepe style pancakes so Nancy's are more to our preference but the pancakes here are still very good. 

We would definitely recommend eating here to anyone who wants an outstanding breakfast and a friendly atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon!

Arrived early, around 7:15 am on a weekday. Had no trouble finding a seat. Just as we were sitting down, a waitress asked if we wanted coffee. Of course, and how lovely!

We had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn't want too much, as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge. The waitress was super nice and answered all of our questions. We ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill, and it was PLENTY!

Great diner quality, but I think I'll try the same dish without the cheese next time-it was an American cheese, and I don't think the grill needed it. 

Coffee was always hot, and service was so quick! This place is a hot spot!

Cash only - be prepared."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast or lunch.  They are supposed to have the greatest home fries ever for breakfast but I didn't order them this time. All of the servers are excellent - very friendly and helpful. I have also been told they have great burgers, so that's what I'll try when I go back. It's cash only, so bring some folding money."}
