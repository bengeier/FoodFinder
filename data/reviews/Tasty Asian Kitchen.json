{"text":"I have literally tried everything they serve. I'm there for lunch almost everyday. My favorite is the Kung Pao Chicken, the spice kicks butt. Oh so good."}
{"text":"It's just ok... Huge portions tho... I hate to say it but panda express has more flavor.."}
{"text":"Was running some errands and decided to get takeout from this place for dinner. The restaurant itself is pretty clean and open. The lady that took my order was very friendly and helpful. She offered me a glass of water which is always nice. I asked what she recommended for a chicken stir fry dish and she said the chicken and vegetables was good. So I ordered that (with additional spice) and duck fried rice. The stir fry was OK, really nothing special. I prefer anything from Panda Express or Pei Wei over it.. But...the duck fried rice was amazing! I'm sure the other fried rice options are amazing as well. I will try another one of their dishes along with an order of their delicious fried rice to make a final verdict."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile. Great food and OK prices better during lunch check than dinner of course. However saying that the dinner portions are huge. Love this place"}
{"text":"Eh. This place has changed a lot over the years. The apparent new management is the reason why I can only give this place 2 stars. They simply aren't the place they used to be back in 2009. I hope they improve, I'd be willing to give it another chance but this isn't my first choice Chinese place as the food quality has gone down."}
{"text":"To start out, there is no military discount ordered my items over 20 dollars and showed my military ID, I was told no military discount my food was to expensive.......not sure if I'll be coming back here"}
{"text":"So I was on my way home from work and I didn't feel like cooking and was craving Asian food. I was happy to see this place on my way so I decided to stop and check it out.   As I walked in I was hit with the smell of stale cigarettes which really made me want to turn around and walk out but I was only ordering to go and it may have been another customer that walked in before me so I headed up to the register area to check out the menu and place my order. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were many options of different Asian cuisine. I'm a sucker for Thai fried rice so I decided to order that and crab angels (crab puffs).   Again I was just ordering take out so when I got home and opened my fried rice I couldn't believe how much was in the container. There was enough for 4 meals!! The crab angels were just ok I have had better.   I would really like to give this place more stars simply for the amazing Thai Fried Rice I got, but it was missing the pineapple that I was craving and that it said it had on the menu.  I will go back and try this place again and possibly change my review to a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"Okay, I think many are being somewhat harsh in their review, but it's a free country and we know what they say about opinions.  Firstly I've been all over this globe, eaten in many different countries and cuisine.  The best Chinese I've ever eaten was in England but I have to say this restaurant does a fine job and every dish I've ordered was flavorful, fresh and as their name advertises \"Tasty.\"  Often the food you eat differs due to regional differences in cooking technique, spicing and family tradition.  The quality of the beef, shrimp, chicken and vegetables are top notch.  Appetizers are just as good and appear made on site.  The wait staff go out of their way to ensure you're happy with keeping your drinks topped up and any additional needs you may have.  In my own experience, they recognize me as having eaten here multiple times,  always welcome us with a warm smile, heck they even pause to learn a little about their customer.  With so many mediocre Chinese joint's and buffet's out there, the family style dinning here may seem expensive to those used to grazing on the endless buffet and may lead to feeling like it's expensive... You often get what you pay for.  So they may not please everyone, but I'd give this place a try, especially at lunch if you're looking for value!!!"}
{"text":"I got a menu at my front door an asked my self why not try something new besides panda express, i went inside it was pretty quiet, i ordered a few things for me an my family. I think it was the mongolian beef, shrimp fried rice and some other dishes. The food was AMAZING, much better than panda express or any rich garden an chop chop that leaves there food sitting in the heater all day. Tasty cooks all of there food fresh and it tastes alot better than food that are left on display. Overall this place was  -fast service -friendly service -great food"}
{"text":"I go to this place all the time. Their food is delicious. I always order Salted Fish Fried Rice, Honey Walnut Chicken, and Salt and Pepper Pork Chop."}
{"text":"This food at this place is completely horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"We always always get the salt and pepper chicken wings, house ho fun (dry), walnut shrimp, yang chow fried rice and happy family add tofu. My sibs and i have been coming here about 8 years. I have never been disappointed with the service or the food. Unlike most chain or arizona-ized asian food they do not over salt nor oversweeten. That's why every time i come to the west side if the valley i will stop here."}
{"text":"We love this place! They are super nice people! I feel like I am eating at a family member's when we go here. Give military discount too. The food is good! Matter of fact I am craving it now that I am thinking about it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because of their outdated decor/lack of decor. But still my go-to Chinese place."}
{"text":"We just moved from Wisconsin to Arizona we were looking for \"spot\" for Chinese food. The restaurant is only a block away from our house so we gave it a try.... SOOO GOOD. My husband doesn't like rice with bean sprouts in them and luckily this place is bean spout free (rice wise). My shrimp fried was great ! So happy we found great Chinese Food in the Valley."}
{"text":"Great customer service, clean environment and delicious food. Everything I have tried on the menu has been a hit"}
{"text":"Ended up at Litchfield Park after a business meeting.  Hungry so I pulled into the Basha's parking lot because I saw Tasty Asian Kitchen.  Chinese food?  Yeah I can do that-- I love good chinese food. The operative word is good.  Ordered lunch special of Egg Foo Young that came with egg fried rice, egg roll and soup.  The soup came out in a small bowl that could have accompanied a toddler's tea set.  There were 5 tablespoons of soup in the bowl--literally.  I said to myself:  What do you want, it's a lunch special?  Be nice.   The egg foo young was interesting.  I looked at it a few times until I could see where the egg foo young was.  The egg foo young consisted of two hockey pucks made with egg obviously. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Pork slices were on top of it with a brown sauce.  Ugh!  Then the egg fried rice.  Did someone say egg?  No egg--just a mound of sticky brown rice clearly created by adding soy sauce to overcooked clumped white rice.  Wow, what culinary prowess.  I can't tell you how bad the rice was.  None of it was eaten. The egg roll was fine.  Probably purchased frozen so all they had to do was fry it.  No wonder it was good.   Hubby had chicken with broccoli and it was mediocre at best.  The same egg fried rice in one, brown mound of clump.  None of it was eaten. I felt it was my duty to tell them that the rice was terrible.  They have to try to fix it right??  Silence would have made me an accomplice to the worst egg fried rice I have ever, ever, ever had.   If there were a minus star system, I would have rating them a minus one.  As it is, they get a one star for keeping their doors open and trying to contribute to our failing economy."}
{"text":"Great little Asian restaurant.  Excellent food, friendly service, reasonable prices.  We 've lived close by for seven years and only just now discovered this place.  I wish we'd tried it sooner!"}
{"text":"Come here each month for a quick meeting over dinner.  Of the 5x I've been here, the service has always been friendly, the food has always been good, the tea has always been hot, and the prices have always been fair.  I like this place & will keep coming back knowing the consistency will remain the same. I usually order the orange chicken or sesame chicken with brown rice or low mein.  The hot green tea is my drink of choice, but the iced tea is fair too."}
{"text":"Very tasty and portions were large enough that we took enough leftovers home for lunch the next day for 3 people.  We have found very few non-chain restaurants even worth eating at in this area, so the 3 star rating  is well-earned.  Hard to give it four stars since I would still consider it in the \"cheap Chinese food\" category and other aspects of the restaurant experience kind of lacking.  We had the lettuce wrap appetizer (was good and almost spoiled the rest of my dinner eating it), Generals Tsao's chicken, kung pao chicken, and chicken chow mein (crunchy not noodle).   We would get any of them again anytime in the mood for casual Chinese food that we could count on for being enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've been to Tasty Asian Kitchen several times and have never been disappointed.  The staff is friendly and provides great service.   The food is very good and always consistent in flavor and presentation.  Love the ability to order items on line."}
{"text":"So we ordered the pu pu platter the only one in the place and we waited 45 mins just for soup. And then the men's room was pouring out water and we were asked to move. Ok food not priced well and it tasted like old oil."}
{"text":"I stopped after work to place a to go order. I ordered fried rice, California rolls, and noodles that were recommended. I appreciated the plentiful serving sizes and friendly service as I waited. The food was okay. I hoped for more, but did not enjoy my meal. The California rolls were dry and lacked flavor. Maybe it was a bad day for them."}
{"text":"Being in the area I decided to have lunch here. It has been a while since we or I have been here.   I am not sure if the same folks operate this place I did not recognise anyone. Yet they were friendly and quick to serve. I do not remember the TV in the corner. It might have always been here but never noticed it. I did today. there was a soap opera on, bad choice if you ask me as soap operas are nothing but moaning and groaning with a fair amount of fighting. Today some woman was screaming about losing her child. Not a happy subject for me. But even if they were showing something I would want to watch, I would not want to watch because I do not like TVs in restaurants. Soft music please......   I ordered pork egg foo yung. I do not know why since I never order pork. To me this version was very odd. I have always remembered sprouts being a part of this dish, one reason I like it. This was more like a turkey stuffing pattie, the consistency of it not the taste with pieces of pork on top and covered in a brown sauce. The actual taste was fine, but I just could not take the consistency so I left most of it. I still think the food here is just fine over all."}
{"text":"Just as the stars suggest, I've experienced better. Not the worst I've had, but far from the best."}
{"text":"They don't honor their Restaurant.com gift certificates and treated me like I was a thief trying to steal from them for coming in with one.  I think it's downright unethical to put coupons out there to bring new customers in to your restaurant only to refuse to honor the coupon or try to change the terms of it once they get you in the door.  I won't ever go back.  Here's what happened:  I bought a $5 off certificate from Restaurant.com with some credits my husband had been given from his employer.  The website and printed certificate both stated that you had to make a minimum purchase of $10 in order to use the $5 gift certificate.  So I drove (out of my way) to try this place with my coupon.  I waited to be seated.  I waited for my server to come by to take my order.  I presented my coupon and the young waitress held up one finger and said \"Just a moment,\" so I waited some more.  She went and got an older lady, maybe the owner or manager?  This woman informed me in a rather stern, almost scolding voice that I would have to come back with friends if I wanted to use my $5 certificate.  My father is in the restaurant business so I understand that they don't make much money if everyone structures their order to order exactly $10 of food, so I pointed out that I would be ordering a $9 entree, plus a drink and maybe dessert.  \"We don't have any dessert,\" she barked at me, accusingly, as if I had been lying to her.  How the heck was I supposed to know they don't have any desserts?  The conversation continued, with me trying to point out that I was happy to comply fully with the terms of the certificate, that I had paid for this coupon (she actually made a disgusted face and asked me \"Why you pay for that?\") until finally I asked straight out \"So, are you telling me that you absolutely will not honor this coupon under the terms I bought it under, and which are printed right on it?\"  Her answer?  \"You go now\" pointing to the door!    Unbelievable!  Read Jared W.'s 3/6/2013 review and you tell me if these are ethical people who want to succeed by taking good care of their customers or if they will do anything to make a buck.  Sorry, but every time I see the name of their business, I think someone should change the \"T\" in \"Tasty\" to an \"N\" for \"Nasty.\""}
{"text":"Love the Spicy Egplant with Garlic Sauce.  I would like it to be spicier though.  The duck is also very yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place already- I've been here about four times now.  We just had dinner there this evening. We got there a little after 8pm and the place was empty. We've always had the waiter other people have mentioned (I am forgetting his name, but he's a really sweet and attentive man), except once. Tonight, he was our waiter again.   He was quick to assist me when I asked ot make a non-spicy dish (Family Tofu) spicy. Then, when it all came out, he had brought some spices in oil in case it wasn't spicy enough for my liking. He kept glasses full and offered more rice to go when we needed to-go boxes.   Each time we've been there, they've had just a handful of people or just us and people getting take-out. I'm always scared that business is really slow for them. They are the nicest people and the restaurant is clean and they had Elton John playing on low on the TV. I'm guessing this was a compromise for the person who said they prefer soft music instead of a blaring TV.  If you end up in the West Valley at Dysart and Camelback with a craving for Asian food, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese family restaurant. Amazing service and reasonable prices. Nice quiet environment. I highly recommend trying the orange chicken and pork fried rice. I also love beef lomein. I have yet to find a better spot anywhere in the valley. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. The double pan friend noodles are delicious. My favorite dish there is the beef hi fun, dry. those two dishes remind me of my childhood meals made by my mother. The ladies working there are super courteous and they give a military discount. The quality to price contrast is also really good. I want to say the lunch specials are under 7 dollars and the portions are ample."}
{"text":"I love this place. Although, I always order to go but it never fails whatever I order its 15 minutes until pick up. I've eaten inside once and it is VERY clean. My son loves to go inside to see the fish on display Ib the tank. The portions that they provide is very big always room for left overs. The staff is super friendly and although I am a regular they really take the time to get to know their customers.  I usually get the chicken fried rice and orange chicken which is AWESOME! I love their egg drop soup. They also have yummie egg rolls. Coupons on their pamphlets as well as a great 10% military discount."}
{"text":"They used to have buy one get one 1/2 off coupons, which was the only reason we ever ate there but when they stopped accepting them we stopped ordering. I would never pay full price for this mediocre at best food. I don't believe the chicken is white meat, after ordering the Mongolian chicken and finding several chewy pieces. If you order breaded/friend chicken meals, they are usually more breading than chicken. They egg rolls are mushy and the crab puffs are so so. The egg drop soup is terrible and smells like wet dog, I wouldn't even taste it! It's average at best."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Very friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere.  The service was quick and crisp, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Dang this place was hard to find on Yelp. My friends and I came here on a break from studying after all agreeing on chinese. Tasty Asian worked out pretty well. We had walked out of some place called Chop Chop that was a blatant Panda Express rip-off, and this was the next place that we could find.  I had the honey walnut shrimp which turned out to be way more fried than the waitress led me to believe (nice sale, lady!) The hot and sour soup was pretty good, and my buddy's kung-pow chicken/shrimp/beef was spicy enough to clear the sinuses. nice.   Overall the atmosphere was a little dingy, and most of the people that were coming in were getting their food for take-out. It is very close to the rental house though, and they do deliver, so for the next round of classes I'm sure we'll be using them for our late night benders.. er, i mean study sessions.  Oh, they're not just chinese.. their menu says that they're Asian: Chinese/Japanese/Thai ..  I'll try their curry next round."}
{"text":"Food is great you get what you pay for. but the servers are very rude. Didn't even let me finish talking and would walk away. Or not bring what we asked. Would still recommend to try this place I will be coming again hopefully the servers are nicer next  time."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for some great take-out...Tasty Kitchen is the best I've had!  Tonight I went with General Tso's Chicken, Pork Fried rice and some Hot & Sour soup. The soup was piping hot and super flavorful.  Lots of vegetables and just the right taste.  Not the \"usual\" bland stuff. Pork Fried rice was great and General Tso's Chicken had the biggest chunks of chicken I've ever had in this dish. It had just the perfect combination of crunchy bite and heat from the sauce. Exactly how it's supposed to be. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of Arizona's best Chinese joint! The best shrimp fried rice I've ever had and I'm from the east coast! One thing they are missing is (Mambo sauce) it's a DC thing that they need to start making here in the west coast. I believe this place is family owned and the first time we ate here was an interesting one. A bunch of kids running the place which was cool I guess... just weird :P The service was still great and the food was delicious!   I recommend the shrimp fried rice, crab puffs, salt and pepper chicken wings (yes the wings!) and orange chicken! The only Chinese joint we go to and the price is very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Salt and Pepper Chicken was absolutely delicious! Our service was most excellent. Everyone was very kind. My daughter loved there. We also did take out once... The food was hot and just as delicious. 4 stars just because the entrees were better priced. But overall a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"I find that the food here is somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes it's amazing and I want to come back the very next day (and sometimes I do!) but other times I swear that I'll never go back (although I always do - mainly because of a wonderful man who works there and who makes every guest feel like his favorite!). The last time I ordered General Tso's chicken on a Sunday afternoon and it tasted like the chicken had been lying around for about a month. It was so hard I had to cut it with a knife and had a stomach ache for the rest of the day.   Atmosphere leaves quite a bit to be desired, so I generally order take-out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! They give u A LOT of food really cheap. And it's actually good Chinese food. Very hard to find really good Chinese food. And....they offer 10% discount for military...#winning!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck! I used to love eating here about 7 years ago; we we're stationed overseas,  and are here for the holidays, so was excited to get a bite.  Oh, how it has changed. My egg rolls were mushy and greasy on the inside, the sushi looked like it was thawed out and slapped on the plate, and my orange chicken was so icky sweet. And to top it off, there was a hair in my rice, omg! I am so disappointed that a really good restaurant has changed so much. The best deal here, was really the ice water with lemon.  At least the waitress took it off. O'well. I'll keep my memories."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite Chinese restaurants! I've been coming here for well over 3 years. Service is great and food is top notch. Very friendly family business. Great lunch deals for sure. I will continue coming here."}
{"text":"the destiny that brought us to the place was that my hubby n i finally gave up on our hunt for KFC, which he loves dearly.  so, we decided to go for chinese.  we hit the restaurant chop, chop first and sorry we had to walk out on them bcause nothing they had looked good.  we headed over to this place across the street and was glad we entered.  we were glad to see that they do have the real utensils to serve us.  the waiter was nice.  we actually walked in an hour early before they open.  the waiter was cool to let us in because we were starving.  we had gyozas n california rolls, which were good, but then these r the items u can't screw up.  my husband n i decided to try the walnut chicken, boy, it needed more work to make it super good.  the flavor was good, but it was the texture that we didn't like.  it was kind of soggy.  what they should have done was give the chicken a dip in the fryer then bread it n refry it.  that way the chicken doesn't come out soggy.   anyhoo, we ate up as much as we could handle the dish.  the dish is the alternative dish for walnut shrimp.  if u could eat shellfish, i would recommend this one.  otherwise try telling them to do what i suggest on the chicken.  our experience was cool.  the waiter was really putting the effort to provide good service, although it was kind difficult to understand him."}
{"text":"Being Asian, I am a little more critical when rating Asian food.  For me I ordered the beef chop sued which was pretty weak although a generous portion.  The egg rolls are out of a box, as the vegetables inside we're mushy.  I usually will give a restaurant a second chance and will definitely order something different. Until then was just ok at best."}
{"text":"WARNING: THEY RECENTLY CHANGED MANAGEMENT AND THE FOOD IS NOT GOOD ANYMORE. We've gone to this place since they opened years ago and ALWAYS had a great meal. We loved that they had a bit of Thai and Japanese food too. All that changed sometime in the last month or so. We ordered dinner for 6 the other day of all our favorite entrees plus wonton soup and crab puffs. I knew something was odd since I didn't see the usual owner I would typically chat with. My fears were confirmed when we opened the container of crab puffs and they were folded in half like ravioli and seemed to be made of something other than wonton skins and were not even crispy. It was downhill from there. Every single entree was sub par. Even the wonton soup was horrible. The broth was tasteless and the wontons tasted really bad. I actually spit one out. I called today to confirm my new ownership guess and alas I was correct. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Chicken fried rice is good! Portion sizes are huge! One order of chicken/pork (etc) is plenty to split between 2 people."}
{"text":"Awesome orange chicken!! Huge servings!!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE go to restaurant for beef chow fun and salt and pepper chicken wings. I order different things now and then, but once you find something so delicious that you crave for constantly, you never change it. Never.  There's four things that this restaurant is consistent in. There's a lot of other ASIAN restaurants that I've been to that aren't consistent with tasty's in particular, so you know that this place is the ultimate catch.  1. They refill your beverage. Every so often one of the waitresses comes around and refills your cup. When I go to other Asian restaurants (to be specific) this never happens. Of course you never want to complain because the goal is to come back and eat some more magical bits and pieces of glorious food.  2. They're fast. It's one thing to be fast in the food service industry. But to be fast AND still have your food be jammed packed with flavor, it's a whole other ball game. The service doesn't disappoint. Neither will the food. That is my Yelp promise.  3. They have a huge picture book of the items on their menu. Just request it at your table if you're unfamiliar with how the food looks like. A waitress did it on her own time because a lot of customers would come in and ask what an item on the menu looks and tastes like. Visuals help everybody. So thank the waitresses for the extra mile they take for their customers. (P.S.: this might be a new thing. I've been going to this restaurant for a year now. I've just took a peak at it two weeks ago.)  4. They are CLEAN!!!!! Down to the BATHROOM!!!!!! Their \"don't throw your hand paper towels in the toilet\" sign starts with a please, ends with a thank you, and they finished it off with a smiley face!!! LOL!! If that isn't the nicest most polite way an employee reminds their customers where their disposals DON'T belong, I don't know what is.  There's nothing more to say..... except, maybe try everything on the menu that starts or ends with duck.......... and shrimp.......... and chicken........ and beef...... trust me, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"There are 3 Chinese restaurants within the area of Dysart & Camelback. Tasty Asian is the only one that is a regular sit-down place, located in the Bashas Shopping Center.  They have very reasonable lunch specials that include your typical entree with rice, egg roll, and soup for around $5 bucks.  Dinners are a bit more expensive and can add up quickly. They always have coupons circulating out there (Buy One, 2nd entree is 50% off). They offer a 10% Military discount. I'm not in the military, but I always think it's so nice when businesses offer this.  I really love their pork fried rice, even though it is greasy, it is so good that I could make a pig of myself and eat the whole thing, even way after being full.  They are always friendly, the place is really clean, and the food has always been really good for the many years I have eaten here."}
{"text":"This place was awful. Took my two children there and when we walked in around 7, it was empty and freezing cold. We each ordered an entree, but one came out completely wrong. So, 20 minutes later, it arrives again and none of the food is remarkable. Some of it is just plain bad. Tasteless, and the dinners are pricey. This is a shame as it is the only Asian sit down place in the neighborhood. Save yourself the bother and drive a little to Beijing at Litchfield and Indian School. Much better in very category!"}
{"text":"Food 4.5 stars Service 1 star  When I'm sick, I crave their house/combo wonton soup.  When I'm not sick, I crave their house/combo wonton soup.  It is probably one of the most delicious soups I've ever eaten, containing decent sized shrimp (probably 26-30's), chicken, beef, pork and an array of delicious veggies (baby corn, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas, cabbage) in a nicely seasoned broth with homemade dumplings.  Over the years, we've enjoyed several dishes from there, usually getting take out.  Our favorites included the beef with broccoli, kung pao shrimp and Tasty's lo mein.  After our experience on Christmas Day, we will never return.  After doing some volunteer work in the morning, we returned home and had some antipasti with my parents for a late lunch.  Later that night, around 7, we decided we were hungry, and given the holiday, figured Tasty's would be open.  We called in our order, mentioned that we had a coupon, the gentleman who took the order said \"OK, bring coupon with you\".  OK, that's their standard policy that we're used to, having been repeat customers for several years.  When my husband arrived to pick up our order, he gave the coupon to the gentleman at the register.  Another woman came up and barked \"No coupon on holiday\".   Nothing on the coupon stated it would not be valid on a holiday, and the one man told us over the phone we could use the coupon.  My husband very politely paid the full bill, not wanting to argue on Christmas Day over $5.  He returned home, related the story to me and we decided that Tasty Asian Kitchen should enjoy that extra $5 from us because we do not plan on returning there again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the area. Egg drop soup is wonderful!!!  Service is very friendly and I prefer this restaurants dishes over similar places. No complaints."}

Yes what you want? Uh id like to place an order for delivery. Where you live. I reply  at the vineyard apts aprox 3/4 mile away. Oh you close whyy you no drive? Because i dont have a car atm.

I have worked/work at food places that deliver food and no way would they ever try to rob you of $26 minimum  per delivery. Damn  i just wanted some chinese food"}
{"text":"Yeah, not very good.  Check out AJK Chinese Cuisine instead for Thai and Chinese food located on Dysart and Rancho Santa Fe Blvd."}
{"text":"Not great... My husband and I went on a Sunday night. The service wasn't great (aside from the two young boys who were very polite and attentive). I ordered the tempura entree which was supposed to come with a salad but didn't. I had to ask for one after the dinner already arrived. The rice was dry and the egg rolls were kinda like spring rolls. Overall I wasn't impressed by the food or experience."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. The menu is large and the food is great. Portions are big. Be careful though, because the woman who runs the place doesn't speak English very well and you might be up-sold without even realizing it. Just don't nod and agree with anything unless you understand it."}
