{"text":"Way over priced and dinner took 3 hours, mostly since our waiter only checked on us every 30 minutes or so.  Good concept for appetizer or dessert, but doesn't work for the main course.  A plate of raw chicken, beef, lobster tail, pork and shrimp shows up at the table and you get to cook your own dinner!  The chances of me over cooking lobster and under cooking pork and chicked are pretty good.  The cheesecake and espresso were excellent.  If you really want the best of the melting pot have dinner somewhere else and go there for dessert."}
{"text":"This is our Favorite restaurant. I just brought my daughter with her friends. Thank you for providing us with a great birthday party."}
{"text":"I had the absolute stress. The sunshine Sangaria is awesome!!!!! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer: I think the Melting Pot is stupid.  If I'm going to pay upwards of $90 for a meal, I'd much rather have a professional chef grill my steak to perfection rather than me boiling it in some oil.  Nonetheless, my friends/family love it so I am frequently obligated to go.

The best part of the entire meal is the cheese.  You really cannot go wrong with any of the choices.  Last time I went with my significant other we got the spinach and artichoke and I was really considering getting my own table so I could hog it all to myself.  I appreciate that they aren't stingy with any of the dippers (bread, tortilla chips, apples, and veggies).  As for the meat course, please refer to my first paragraph.  Dessert consists of your favorite sweets (Rice Krispie treats, marshmallows, strawberries, cheesecake, pound cake, brownies) dunked in your choice of chocolates...once again, not too much can go wrong with that.

I think the real appeal to the Melting Pot is the experience; they really try to make you feel like this is an upscale, romantic, special place.  For example, they provide a complimentary valet even though the parking spots are only 20 feet away.  The wait staff is very attentive and managers are walking around to ensure your dinner is everything you dreamed it could be.  Going to the Melting Pot isn't about getting a 5 star dinner, it's about the experience of fondue!  I think everyone should try it once..."}
{"text":"High quality food , extra care given for every table , highly recommended ! I have gone several times to the melting pot and each time I am always blown away by the experience given ! The food taste so great and the manager even checks on the table . They offer valet parking and you can even change the lighting at your table to your liking ! Great place for a double date or a personal intimate dinner w a love :)"}
{"text":"Went here for valentines day. everything was excellent but the only complaints i have is that theycant make a decent margarita ( sent itback once, lived with the second) and the second complaint is that they actually add the gratuity on to your check before you even get it.  Who are they to tell me i needto tip the waiter 20 percent?  Food was good, albeit overpriced but the automatic added on gratuity was a deal breaker.   We couldve even lived with there crappy margaritas. And these were \" top shelf \" margaritas mind you.   

No thanks.   We wont be back.  Too bad too because its close to my house."}
{"text":"Went during Queens Feast aka Charlotte Restaurant Week.  I couldn't manage to get a reservation but the nice girl on the phone suggested I try the bar area instead.  My friend & I had perfect timing when we met because a party of 3 just cleared the bar leaving an open spot for us.   The 2 gentlemen behind the bar gave excellent service...so much so that I was glad we ate at the bar.  It did start to get crowded while diners were waiting for their tables, reaching in between my friend & I for their drinks...but it only happened a few times. Overall, a great experience & as always, excellent food!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had talked about visiting the Melting Pot several times in passing. Well last night I decided \"what the heck\" and took her out for a great night.  I was extremely pleased from the time we entered until the time we left the resturant.  We decided on the Big Night Out, which right now Is Central/South American themed. Every  course was great! If you like lobster and a good mix of other meats, I would recommend the Fondue Fusion with the mojo cooking style as it works well with the other flavors.  Dessert is every bit as good as it sounds and more, they even brought out more of what we liked best at no extra cost.  As other people have commented in reviews, set aside a couple of hours. We were there for 2 1/2 hours, but enjoyed every bit of it. Thanks again to the excellent staff and our server Brandon for making a memorable first trip."}
{"text":"First and Foremost... WOW!!

This establishment truly blew me away as far as the ambiance, the service, and most importantly the food.

I recently participated in restaurant week and decided to try this out for the first time. The set up was really nice...intimate booth with a dimmer. Tyler, our waiter was amazing, entertaining and funny as ever. 

Our first course, we chose the Spinach Artichoke Dip fondue (best I've ever had)
The salad was really nice; I had the House salad with mixed greens- their house dressing is amazing
For the main course I had the signature selection (filet mignon,North Atlantic salmon,shrimp and chicken) and the trio of beef (filet mignon, blackened filet mignon, seasoned angus sirloin) all of which when immersed in that broth and dipped in (1of6 different sauces) is prolly the best steak I've had in a while. I also got the lobster tail on the side which was bomb. 
For dessert I got the chocolate turtle fondue which was to die for. To top the night off our waiter, Tyler sent me off with complimentary chocolate covered strawberries.

Overall, For two people we were more than well fed (more than enough food), the food was amazing and the service was impeccable. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere.  One of my favorite places to eat.  Friendly attentive staff."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious, any time we have a special occasion it's my first choice. 
The Cheese course: We have had many different cheeses here and they are all wonderful. The traditional Swiss is great, nice and creamy texture. The fiesta cheese is great for those that are a little less adventurous, its very similar to something you find at a Mexican place. 
The Salad course: the wine and garlic salt is wonderful, always get it on your Cesar salad. but I do have to say I could skip this course with all the other food you get. 
The main course: It is so fun to cook your own food. at first it's a little slow going but once you have cooked some it seems like you can't keep up. After this course you will be stuffed but there is more! 
The Chocolate!!! 
The best thing you will ever eat. you can't go wrong with any choice. You get cheese cake, angel food cake, rice crispies, marsh mellows, bananas, strawberries! 
And the great thing about the chocolate coarse, you can get a coupon and come back to eat it at another time if you didn't save room!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I make a reservation at this location every year for Valentine's Day. The food is always excellent and yesterday's dinner was no exception. The Valentine's Day menu was delicious and we really enjoyed the champagne. However, I'm writing this review because of our server, Kelly. She was the best server I've ever had and quite possibly the sweetest person I've ever met. She was attentive, informative, and kind. She thoroughly answered all of our questions and made appropriate recommendations on the menu. What really set her apart (and why I'm witting this) was her attitude. She was bubbly and pleasant. Her attitude only emphasized that she loves her job and truly loves working with people. These are the qualities that make a good server a great server. She's truly an asset to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.   Food was excellent - accompanied by great service.  Tatyana made a custom drink for me- and was more than willing to work to accommodate our \"off the menu\" requests.   She gave lots of suggestions as made our way through the menu.  Overall excellent experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!! Money well spent. Love the experience and the food is impeccable.. very happy and can't wait to go back.. 
Ask for the Creme Brûlée chocolate. It's So Good!!! Not on the menu but they always have it. You can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I went to the opening last evening and it was AWESOME! The owners are great and the food is wonderful as always.  The restaurant is beautiful inside and I can't wait to go back soon and often! Please check it out and tell them that I sent you! I am so excited that The Melting Pot is finally in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"I went here with five other girlfriends the other week and I cannot even begin to explain how terrible our entire experience was. First, the restaurant was not busy at all- we had reservations for a Wednesday night at 5:00; not exactly s super busy time of day/day of the week.  We were greeted promptly, after being seated, by our server. She was very warm and friendly. We placed our drink orders, which I was not too pleased with because it took about 20 minutes for all five of us girls to get drinks... then at only had two customers and we all ordered wine. We placed appetizer orders and it took about 45 minutes for us to get our appetizers. The server did apologize for the wait, but still- we were starving!  Finally appetizers came and they were tiny portions. We placed our main dish orders and the server was sort of arguing with us that 3 fondue pots can't fit on the two long burners on our table. After much conversation and discussion she finally succumbed and let us order three fondue pots. Once they came out (which was another 45 minutes), the three pots had PLENTY of room on the burner with much surface area for adequate cheese fondue cooking/melting etc. meanwhile, it continued to take quite an unreasonable time for our wine refills. 

The flavors were great- I have to say that. The food was good for sure. Just SUPPPPEERRRRRR SLOW service/food. We ultimately complained to the manager as our entire dinner from start to finish took (get this)--- 4 HOURS!  we didn't leave until 9:00!!! again- not a busy night and it was only 5 of us. 

Overall I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just a quick caveat before I get into the review...I'm not a huge fondue fan.  I find it confusing and more work than I'd like for eating at a restaurant.  That being said, The Melting Pot does fondue very well.  So I shall try to not be biased, and if you don't want to read my review for fear of bias....I'll never know.  

We went to the Melting Pot the night before Thanksgiving, which looking back wasn't the best timing, it's sooooooo muuuuuch fooooooood!  Of course the food was all very good so we ate and ate and ate even though we were full.  We kinda had two Thanksgivings, one with cheese and chocolate and one with turkey.  

There were four of us and we were at a big booth with two burners so we had two pots of cheese, cooking liquid, and chocolate.  It was all delicious.  I can't remember what we had but I get the feeling you can't go wrong with anything. Since we had different tastes but all were open to pretty much anything we picked two very different cheeses, one broth and one oil, and two very different chocolates.  I would recommend splitting entrees if you're in a group.  For the four of us (not big eaters) I think 3 entrees would've been good.  One meat, one seafood, and the vegetarian option would've been a good range of choices and plenty of food.  Their wine selection was good as well, we enjoyed a few bottles with our dinner. 

Our server was possibly the best server I've ever had at a restaurant, Lauren.  As I already said I find ordering fondue confusing, and let's be honest, we all know I'm not the sharpest fondue fork in the drawer.  Lauren was fantastic at explaining the menu and when some of us still couldn't handle making a decision she asked simply \"what do you feel like having?\" and made it work.  She explained everything and was available while not bothering us.  Seriously, Lauren probably made this experience better than it could have been with someone a little less fantastic at their job.  

The restaurant itself is a lot bigger inside than it looks.  But they've done a very good job of keeping the booths cozy and private.  There are private rooms that you can reserve but for a small group a quiet booth was perfect.  It felt like we were the only table in the restaurant (in a good way).  

Definitely check out The Melting Pot.  But don't plan on eating for 24 hours before and after."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here 2 times within it's first 2 weeks of opening. A lot of the staff transferred from the University City location that closed, so they managed to avoid new restaurant-itis. The staff are organized, pleasant and on top of things -- which is good because this place has been packed since the minute it opened. 

The first visit we tried the 4 course Big Night out (a cheese fondue, a meat fondue, a salad and a chocolate fondue) and it ended up being too much food. The quality of your experience depends heavily on how well you can gauge doneness of your food. After listening to description of the various courses, the 6 different condiments and the cooking times of the various items, we were on overload. So it's trial-and-error: dunking bits of this and that into various pots. Usually it works out well - unless you have an interesting conversation partner as I did and didn't pay close attention to your meal. :-)

Our servers both visits were really great: efficient and attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere is really nice and the volume level is exceptional for most area restaurants. You can actually speak at a normal conversational level with your dining companions but it's still a lively place; major kudos for pulling that off!

My only complaint is that both times it was frigidly cold, especially the bar area. I tend to run cold so I was prepared, but lots of other diners had their coats zipped up and I heard a few other people complain. The bar staff said cheerily \"You all are leaving, but we have to be here all night and we like it cold.\" I would reconsider that position: I know restaurants have to turn tables but it was actually uncomfortable the whole time we were there. My husband is NEVER cold and he wore a sweater.

So go, bring a swank hoodie and a bunch of friends; it'll be fun."}
{"text":"So Melting Pot was delicious! The alpine Swiss cheese fondue, salad and chocolate coconut almond fondue were my fav! They give you bread/apples/veggies to dip in the cheese and pound cake/brownies/rice krispies/marshmallows/strawberries/bananas to dip in the chocolate fondue of your choice... The meat entree is OKAY... It was filet/sirloin/chicken/shrimp and you basically cook it yourself in a fondue pot that is your choice of flavored broth... You can go and just get the cheese/salad of your choice/chocolate for like $22 per person! That honestly would be the way to go! :-) But it was a cool experience! It is guest appreciation week so it was only $66 for our 4 course meal! (It's $50 but the chocolate fondue is an additional $16 if you decide to get it-- might as well)"}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best.  There are a ton of different options and combinations that you can make.  It's kind of on the pricey side but sooooo worth it.  The concept is really unique and fun, and it's a great place to socialize with friends.  It would also be a perfect place to take hot date, the romantic possibilities are endless. 

Even thought I know it's tempting to fill up on all the delicious food they bring out, try to save room for dessert.  The chocolate fondue is good practically to the point of a religious experience.  Whenever my friends and I eat here I feel like having a cigarette after, and I don't smoke."}
{"text":"The customer service was great. However, the food was meh. I only liked 2 of the sauces which is the biggest part of fondue. I ordered the signature which came with chicken, beef, & shrimp. I had the oil to cook in which came with 2 types of tempura. I was not crazy about either one. Most of it got burned in the oil and stuck to my cooking utensil. The best part for me was stuffing the mushrooms with green goddess sauce & frying them at the waitresses suggestion. Other than that all the meats were pretty bland.

I had the Wisconsin cheese fondue. There was something about the smell & the consistency that I found off putting. Even now I can smell it & it's not a good thing. It was way too mushy for me & I wish now I would hv sent it back. 

Desert was okay. I can't remember the kind of chocolate but it was lit on fire at the table. That was pretty cool. It had some type of nut in it. It was difficult to pick up the nuts and the different sweets on the dipping utensil at the same time. Just imagine picking up nuts with a tiny 2 prong fork. I just ended up dipping the treats & eating the nuts after with an actual fork.

The decor is very nice but that's not that important to me. For me, it's about the food. I've had some great food from some hole in the wall spots but for the cost of the food here I expected lots more.  

The chocolate martini was delicious. Other than that, I'm glad I experienced it but I'm not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Melting Pot a few times, once to this particular locale.  My experience was enjoyable.  We went with a group of friends for a birthday party.   They sat us in the back at a long table.  Of course this made it difficult to talk to much of the table, but that's true of any restaurant.  

Naturally, if you're going to do fondue (and you only do it about once every year like me), you have to go all out.   Start with the cheese appetizer.  You can't go wrong with any of their cheese fondues (although the bleu cheese one is my favorite).  Then order a salad (so you can say you ate something healthy that evening).  The California salad with walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, and raspberry dressing melts in your mouth.  For the main course, I usually order chicken or shrimp (or a combo), as they taste best to me with the oil that you fry in (yes, I go for the oil cooking style).  Then finish with a chocolatey fondue ike chocolate mint.  Cook, dip, eat.  Repeat.  YUM.  Yes, it's a bit spendy, but I like to have the full experience when I do fondue restaurants.  And by \"full,\" I mean you have to roll me out of there.  

It's not hard to drop about $50 a person to try everything (I call it \"sampling\"), but fondue isn't an everyday occasion for me.  Neither is eating that much.  The things I do for friends and their birthdays... :-)

Plan on spending about two hours there."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this was our first experience there. 

Very friendly staff & nice ambiance. We got Wisconsin cheese, The Classic & Fundue Delight for our entrees & The Original for dessert. We chose Mojo for our cooking style. We had the Cesar & the Bacon & Bleu Spinach salads. I was a little unsure coming into it but the staff asked if we've been there & explained the process. We were warmed the portion sizes were small but we got full--guess it depends on your appetite. Everything was very good, even the apples with the cheese. I highly recommend this place. It's such a fun & different experience."}
{"text":"It pains me to leave this review. Melting Pot has been my favorite restaurant for about 15 years. I took French in high school and was introduced to fondue (thanks to my teacher, a native of France), and I have been hooked on it ever since. 

I'll never forget the night I got hooked on Melting Pot, specifically. Picture it: Washington, DC, 2003. I had been longing to try a Melting Pot, and my fiancé (now my husband of 13 years) found one just a couple subway-stops from where we were staying. And when we got there ... Y'ALL! It was underground!!!!  ... I mean, there isn't a Melting Pot we have visited in 14 years now that could possibly *touch* that place in ambience and atmosphere. Yet, they have all had the same dim lights, the same professional staff, the same laid-back jazz music, the same steam rising above the quiet booths. 

*** When we visited the same D.C. location a couple years later, we were so surprised to find the same bartender there. And what was more surprising?: He recognized *us* and treated us (once again) like royalty. (We haven't been back in more than a decade, and I hear that location no longer exists, which is SUCH a shame.) ***

Since then, my husband and I have sought-out Melting Pot restaurants in every, single city we visit. (We've literally had servers who have sat down at our table and spent our entire meal-time talking to us.) We know what's on our Melting Pot \"Big Brother file,\" including our favorite recipes
that are no longer on the menu but are still prepared for us by request because we fell in love with the recipes (that are perhaps foreign to some of Melting Pot's current staff, many of whom were possibly just out of diapers when my husband and I experienced our first-and-favorite Melting Pot date in DC.)

You can imagine, then, how ecstatic we were a few years ago when we found out that a Melting Pot was sinking roots in our \"backyard,\" in Huntersville. And, as would be expected, we've been regular patrons since it's been open. 

We still LOVE the food. We still LOVE the wait-staff (especially that one waitress who explained to us on our first visit that, even while we had made reservations for a \"romantic spot for two,\"  we had, in fact, been placed in what's widely known as \"the armpit\" of the restaurant - bright lights and lots of noise and foot-traffic during the entire meal - even in spite of our $230 bill at the end of the night ). 

Forget for a moment that you might be seated in \"the armpit\" (suggestion: request ANYWHERE BUT THE ARMPIT ... and, trust me, the wait-staff knows what you mean by \"the armpit\"), the overall vibe of the Huntersville location is completely \"commercial\" and uninspiring. Perhaps it's because it was once a Fudrucker's burger joint, and I remember it as that?! But I'd guess it has more to do with the fact that there are no quiet, isolated booths like other Melting Pots have ... and - ugh - perhaps the hardest pill for me to swallow: this one plays lame \"pop\" music instead of that laid-back, romantic, genius jazz that Melting Pots far-and-wide are known to play. Adding insult to injury for us old-school Melting Pot fanatics: they apparently no longer make the fondue table-side. It's made in the kitchen and brought out to the table burner. Back in the day, the fondue for *every course* was made at the table, and waiters/waitresses would explain what they were adding as they made it. 

We still pay $125-$200 for a dinner for two,  despite all the corners now being cut, including cuts to the amount of food served. (We used to have a big box of leftovers to take home. Not anymore.)

We have continued to make reservations for special occasions, even up to a week ago for our anniversary celebration. We always look forward to the friendly staff and the great food. But, unfortunately, at least this location has turned into a \"fast food\" version of the Melting Pot, with really cheesy music and food that isn't prepared table-side. Bottom line: They're cutting everything EXCEPT costs. And without even the ambience that Melting Pots are known for, I'm afraid that we may be ending our memorable, frequent 14-year relationship with Melting Pot. 

We will try the King Street, Charlotte, location (where we frequented before Huntersville opened) before we give up on our favorite restaurant entirely. Maybe the Lake Norman one is trying to appeal to a different \"crowd\" than the long-time, hardcore Melting Pot patrons. But if *all* of them have turned into what the LKN one is, I'll stick to making fondue at home and saving $150. And that sucks. Because it isn't the same."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is absolutely wonderful. The food is  always fresh and flavorful.
We used to go there when they were in the University area so I don't really like driving to Huntersville but will make the drive for them. We just don't go as often as we used to.
If you go you definitely have to try the yin and yang cocktail. It is absolutely to die for.
The atmosphere is wonderful you were able to brighten and in your lights at your own table. the tables for two are like L shapeed booths which are really private.
Your server will make sure that they accommodate you in every way possible. An example is if you want more pancake or brownies or bananas with your dessert they will bring them out without hesitation.
One drawback is when I first started going to the Melting Pot their portions were a lot bigger than they are now. I'm not saying that you won't get full, it was just we had a lot more to take home back then to eat the next day."}
{"text":"we have been to different locations before, but thought we would try the Huntersville location. The experience was the same as always. The food & service was good, but this location is set up different. The table are set up so when the waitress is trying to serve you the people coming in have to stop and wait for her to finish, or she has to stop and wait for the people to go by. Also, the bar area isn't as user friendly as the other locations. If you want to have a drink, you have to fight with the people that are eating their meal there. I'll always go to the melting pot, but will go back to the other locations next time."}
{"text":"I admit it, The Melting Pot can do no wrong in my book.  

My good friend Jamie took me here for my belated birthday dinner, during Restaurant Week. Even it being a \"special\" week, the service was just as good as a regular night. 

Our waiter was \"Bren\" (I believe) & he was very friendly & knew his \"Melting Pot\" speak. He was very comfortable in his job & wasn't rushed.

We had the Wisconsin cheese trio, I had the spinach salad, the Piedmont (for the main course; seasoned choice Angus sirloin, filet mignon, herb-crusted all natural chicken breast, Pacific white shrimp, and wild mushroom sacchettis) & for dessert, we got the chocolate turtle.

Everything was perfect! The accommodating fruit, vegetables, bread, protein, desserts were fresh. Bren wasn't overbearing at all. Our drink glasses stayed filled. The manager came to greet us & chatted with us a while.

The decor is very cozy - much, much better than the original Kings Drive location & better than the now closed University spot. 

A very nice touch for my birthday was a Happy Birthday card that all the staff signed. I thought that was very sweet."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is absolutely absurd for dinner, in my opinion. The way that they sucker you in to cook your own food for such an outlandish price is beyond me. However, I will say that dessert is absolutely magic. How could you not like dipping marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, and other sweets into piping hot chocolate, graham cracker crumbs, and other viscous concoctions? 

The location is pretty awesome. I really like how it's tucked into King's Corner and is a little nondescript. 

Here's my thought -- Go for drinks and dessert. Dinner can be held/enjoyed much more elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time at this location. It Was my sons 18th birthday and this was meant to be a special occasion meal.  
We Arrived 35-40 prior to reservation time, went to desk and asked if there was any way to be seated earlier. I said if not, that was ok.  Was told sure, it would be just a few minutes until they got the table ready.  Well....40 minutes later, we sat down to our meal. 
Service and food was very good.  Only thing that held me back from giving 5 stars was that my party of 4...ran out of beverages more than once and were left waiting for refills.  Had to ask for refills. 
In my opinion, when you go to a restaurant and pay upwards of $50-$60/plate, you shouldn't have to ask for refills.
Other than that, that night was fantastic.  The hostess from the hostess stand even brought to out table, a special \"Happy Birthday\" card that everyone signed.  This was the highlight of the meal for my son!"}
{"text":"I love the unique experience this place offers, and this place will always be in my top FAVORITES!

I came here with my husband when we went to a restaurant for the very first time ever after marraige. Also, came here for the first time I celebrated my birthday after marriage with just my hubby. This place has delicious dinner entrees that you can heat/ cook  yourself, and a fabulous dessert selection with the perfect concoction of complimentary fondue dips. 

Definitely a five star restaurant. Great to enjoy during special occasions with either an intimate partner or a family size group. Love the King's Corner location and feel. The staff is excellent and very friendly. I hope they stay the same because I only have good things to say about this place."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I've been to the Melting Pot.....the service is still great and of course the fondue  is still on point.  I can do without the entrees, not because it's not good but because I like to enjoy the appetizer fondue and the dessert fondue, adding a meal in between just messes everything up leaving you either too full or barely able to enjoy....and besides, who wants to pay to cook their own food?  I say if you've never experienced it go with the 4 course deal for the experience but from then on, go with the app(spinach is my fav) and dessert(chocolate bailey's is my fav) fondue, it's truly the best part."}
{"text":"Wow just wow!! I took my wife here for our 10th anniversary and was not disappointed. I made reservations online and stated it was for a special occasion requested a private table and opted to get roses and chocolate dipped strawberries in addition to the wonderful food we we're about to encounter. When we first got there they put us in a regular table and we we're next to a table that had a screaming brat!! I love kids but not exactly the romantic night I envisioned! I don't know if the look of disgust was on my face or what but soon after the manager came over and told me that they were in the process of getting us a table on what they call lovers lane. They were waiting for people to leave but didn't want to keep us waiting past our reservation time. She saw my reservation and saw that  I wanted a private table. Neither of us had been here before so we didn't know what to expect. So luckily we were moved effortlessly shortly after to a mind blowing experience. This lovers lane was amazing, the booths we're very private and each had its own dimmer switch for the light. Wow so romantic!! We explained to our waiter, I wish I could  remember his name that we had never been before. He was a seasoned veteran that knew what wine went with what food and he made our experience even better. The food which is fondue? style was amazing, the wine, the deserts just simply amazing!! We had the best anniversary dinner we had ever had. We will be back for sure. I think it was $160 for everything but well worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Let me say first and foremost my husband and I went for our anniversary and I couldn't have experienced anything better! Our waitress, Victoria, was spot on incredible! She took excellent care of us and made us feel like we were her family. She would crack jokes but also had some incredible recommendations on the menu. If you don't want to cook your own food this isn't the place for you. Half of the experience is cooking. They tell you how long to cook things for each temperature. These reviews of everything not being perfect you should stay home. You can't get service like we did tonight anywhere else."}
{"text":"The melting pot never ceases to disappoint. 

No issues getting a reservation, excellent service, and great food."}
{"text":"Such a unique experience. Not to mention the food is to die for. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for a Sunday night during the Queen's Feast and had a group of 6-8 people. The service was amazing!! Our server was funny, engaging, so thoughtful, and just did a great job with the meal and her recommendations. 

The food was wonderful and ample and for the price of a Queen's Feast, it was an absolutely amazing deal! I hadn't been to a Melting Pot in 10 years, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, very organized, and super friendly! We went there for our 31st anniversary the other night, and they did so much to make our evening memorable. They all work together in such an efficient way and are very pleasant. The dining areas are private and romantic, and the description of the food and presentation is engaging. Will definitely go back whenever we can afford it - it's worth the price!"}
{"text":"Great \"date\" restaurant. Very intimate seating and professional staff. Food is great but prepare to spend at least $100 on 4 course dinner for two."}
{"text":"Once you've been to a Melting Pot they're all the same. I'm a fan but this is one of those one and done restaurants. Great for special events like prom, home coming, anniversary, etc. Service is great. I went just for dessert for fou. Cost us $40 which inlcluded 2 cups of coffee. Overpriced? A little, eh? Call ahead for reservations."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Melting Pot restaurant. I was completely blown away. At first I was skeptical of the \"do it yourself\" cooking, but I quickly learned it is just part of the experience. The first thing we got was cheese fondue and we dipped bread, grapes, apples, and more in it. I'm not the biggest cheese fan but it was delicious. The teriyaki glazed sirloin and chicken and vegetable potstickers were absolutely amazing. They were so flavorful even without any of the sauces on them. For dessert I HIGHLY recommend the Smores fondue. We ended up ordering seconds and I have no regrets. Will definitely be returning soon. Very pricey but great for special occasions."}
{"text":"While my server, Sam, was very energetic, he was less than attentive.  Not only did he lie about saying my gift card that I bought when they opened wasn't going to usable on the current day, he just didn't listen to my family as we informed him of what we wanted. It was the endless menu, so we had the option of requesting more of certain courses. Neither of us got the 2nd salad we requested, and only one of us got the additional entree.  That being said, for some reason when my mom said she only didn't want the shrimp or mushrooms, he brought her a small plate of plain chicken....literally, no seasoning at all. Even another waiter commented on that being strange. 1) Don't lie to me 2) Take care of your table and LISTEN. That's literally all it would have taken to have a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to the Melting Pot for years. First in Northern Virginia then in Greensboro, NC and now Huntersville, NC.  We have had nothing but great experiences every time we have gone.  The latest time was on February 13, 2016.  It was a combo birthday for me and Valentine's Day celebration for us.  We had a reservation for 7 pm, we had no wait time, were seated immediately and our waiter \"Chad\" was at our side by time we sat down.  We had the Valentine's Day special. The food was excellent as usual, the drinks tasty and of course I love the company I was with \"my husband\".  We had two managers stop by our table to visit.  The only thing I would have liked was I'm guessing because of the special day the cost was a higher than usual. It is a pricy treat for sure, but we normally only go once a year.  But all and all we love this place and we will come back again.  Hope they decide to open a new Melting Pot in the triad area."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here because my fiancée was accepted to veterinary school and she had always wanted to try The Melting Pot.  I had never been in part because I am vegan.  I knew going in that I was likely going to pick off of her plate, much on some veggies or fruit, and then swing through the Taco Bell drive thru on the way home (literally that was our plan).  Her celebration on this one night is much more important than my dietary restrictions (love - makes you do dumb stuff).  I made the reservation online and ordered flowers to be waiting on the table for her (made even easier by the link provided in the reservation confirmation email).  

When I got the confirmation call I mentioned that I was vegan and asked if there was anything they could do for me and the hostess said she'd note it on my reservation - I was hoping that maybe they could throw together a pasta or something.  Well, the day of my reservation I received a voicemail from Tyler letting me know that I would have a vegan cheese, a vegan dessert and an option for a vegan entree.  I was thrilled.

We got to the restaurant, the waiter knew of my restrictions and acknowledged them immediately.  My fiancée ordered her cheese and they brought my vegan cheese out with it, which was TO DIE FOR.  The waiter even explained what dipping pieces were vegan.  We were too full for the entrees, but my dessert was amazing.  Wild berry puree with peanut butter to melt into it - again I was informed what dipping pieces were vegan.  I was so impressed that a place known for cheese and chocolate was so very accommodating for me and I didn't have to go out of my way to explain \"vegan\" (you'd be surprised how many people don't know what \"dairy\" is).  

I expected to go hungry and instead I left stuffed.  We will absolutely be back.  THANK YOU for making a special dinner really really special."}
{"text":"The food is good. The atmosphere is elegant and intimate. The wine selection is impressive, and the servers are all knowledgeable. 

The prices, however, are astronomical. The servers are so good that they can often overwhelm you with the up-sale. Be wary! Be very, very wary! I've purchased beer and wine there at prices I couldn't afford because I'd been so bamboozled by the bright and shiny servers and their fancy, magic words. I was took. Rope-a-doped. Hoodwinked. Etc. 

Otherwise, however, it's a great place, especially for date night. It's also good for family outings, as kids love the fondue concept. It's a lot of fun, kind of like you're making your own dinner while camping...just camping in a really elegant restaurant."}
{"text":"First time at this Melting Pot location.  Loved it . We sat in a very small, but cozy booth that has a light dimmer guests can control.  We ordered the 4 course meal and everything was delicious.  For our chocolate (dessert) course we tried the Bananas Foster and it was amazing.  Definitely allow 2.5-3 hours for the 4 course meal (we missed our movie.)  Our four course meal with one drink each was $98 before tip.  Love the Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day Dinner cost at the Melting Pot= $317.00 worth it~ NO WAY!!!! What a rip-off.  Having never been to one my husband thought it might be a nice way to spend the evening.  Yes it was unique, ambiance was Ok.. but quite frankly for over $300 I'd rather the food be delivered to me already cooked rather than me having to work to cook it.  I figured out a typical dinner for two at Linberger's Steak House in Sherrills Ford is about $65 that included a fillet special and glass of wine for two.  If you do the math we could have had a fabulous steak dinner 4.87 times at Lineberger's for the price of this one meal.  Best thing....I wouldn't have had to cook it myself.  NEVER AGAIN will I waste my money at The Melting Pot."}
{"text":"I've been to this Melting Pot at least 4 times because I always come for my birthday and special occasions like Valentine's Day.  I'm also part of their fondue club so I get their special annoucements as well.  I really like foodie types of places and I think this is definitely one.  I always go with the \"spotlight\" meal because there is always a four course meal deal other than the Big Night Out that's cheaper.  I get this because substitutions are not prohibited but encouraged and I can get the same exact meal for a little less....definitely worth it! The sevice is generally good, but sometimes fantastic.  I have never been disappointed, but I'm in there a lot.  The food is really high quality food and you can tell.  You also get a TON of it. So, this is an expensive place but is very good for a special occasion.


Here are some tips!!
Now when you get your food...the oil is messy and a little gross but the broths are generally good.  Ask for a two burner table even if there is only two of you.  If they aren't busy or if you made a reservation for one, they generally won't mind.  This way you can have a coq au vin which is now I think free with the \"Big Night Out\" AND the court boullion.  (They only charge you for the one coq au vin. I think $7 bucks if you didn't get the BNO.)  

If you're hungry, ask for more!  People don't realize that all the veggies, bread and fruits are refillable.  Even the desserts!!!  So if you want more mini cheesecake, you can have it as long as you have fondue in your pot...they will bring whatever you want out.  

Go near holidays or major sporting event times because there is ALWAYS a special deal happening around then.

Finally, try Green Gooddess on top of the mushroom with a little salt....stuffed mushroom HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a delicious fondue experience with great wine and a romantic atmosphere.  Although the prices are somewhat outrageous, it is a great place to go to impress a date.  I would highly recommend trying the chocolate fondue with fruit for dessert, because it is definitely a little piece of heaven.  The staff are all well trained fine dining waiters and waitresses, and the owner is a friendly man from Princeton, New Jersey who often visits his guests throughout the night to make sure they are having a good time.  I would make recommendations if you plan on going during the weekend, because it gets fairly packed."}
{"text":"I love the melting pot. It's one of my favorite restaurants and I've been more times than I can count. The four stars is for the Huntersville location due to service. Our waitor was very inexperienced and not what you would expect at a fairly expensive restaurant. He was friendly but not super attentive, we had to wait a bit for drinks, the cheese temp was too high so it started burning. We will definitely go back because I love the food but I hope the service has improved."}
{"text":"Been to couple of Melting Pots around the US. Great happy hour bar menu. Not a fan of the food. My wife favorite place in Charlotte. Over priced. Good for special occasions."}
{"text":"You have to love restaurant week! 3 to 4 course meal for $30 per person, can't beat that. This is a good place to do it too because it can get expensive!

My husband and I went to The Melting Pot for a long needed date night and I am so glad we went here. The inside of the restaurant was pleasing to the eyes, loved the wall (I so want one in my house) of wine cooler, the dim lights, and the smell of the food cooking. We get seated in a cubby hole type booth and it was perfect for us since we were looking for something romantic and intimate.

Our waiter was Jason and he was very attentive on everything! Was a little slow on refilling our drinks once the restaurant started getting full, but that's ok he did a great job on everything else. He was ready to answer all our questions, and if he didn't know the exact wine that was used in one of our meals, he made a point to find out even after we told him it was ok he didn't have to find out for us.

Our 1st Course: Drinks! What else? :) I ordered the Strawberry Blonde Martini (it was on special $7) and it was amazing! I can't even tell you everything that was in it, but it was the right mix of strawberry vodka, champagne, and other things. I just couldn't have 1. My husband got a mango margarita thing frozen with sugar on the rim. He liked it, but not enough to get another one. I can't remember everything that was in it, but he said it wasn't bad at all.

Our 2nd Course: The starter....Feng Shui cheese sauce. Let me break this down for you because this is not your normal cheese fondue. The main cheese is Havarti cheese, a dry white wine base, sake, other cheeses, and topped off with a sprinkle of scallions. For dipping, you are served a bowl of veggies (carrots, celery bits, and cauliflower), assorted bread bits, and green granny smith apples. The only thing that it didn't go well with was the cauliflower. It was the best I ever had! I can't describe how good this was and you get a lot of the cheese sauce too. We were able to dip everything without running out of cheese. 

Our 3rd Course: Salad My husband and I both got a cesar salad that was perfect! It was a traditional cesar, but had roasted pine nuts and homemade croutons.

Our 4th Course: The Entrees They give you 4 or 5 different styles to cook your food, but we decided to spend the extra $6 for the Coq au Vin style. Here's what's in it: fresh herbs, mushrooms, garlic, imported spices, and a hearty Burgundy Wine. It went great with everything we cooked in it. I had The Coastal which included shrimp, teriyaki marinated sirloin, lobster and spinach filled ravioli, boneless chicken breast and salmon. My husband had The Pacific (I think) which included: key lime shrimp, sushi grade tuna on a bed of carrot slices, filet minon, chicken (had some orange stuff on it) and dumplings. EVERYTHING was amazing and so full of flavor. You also get 6 different dipping sauces. 3 comes in a clover tray for dipping that had a teriyaki dipping sauce, a mustard curry sauce, and a kind of duck sauce that had a little spice to it. The other 3 sauces was a spicy cocktail sauce, a blue cheese kind of sauce, and a spinach cream cheese sauce that was great on pretty much everything. Along with the entrees, you get an endless bowl of broccoli, mushroom caps, and cubed red potatoes that were pretty good.

The 5th Course: Dessert!! We were torn between the Disarono white chocolate or the Yin and Yang. We finally decided on the Yin and Yang dessert. It normally comes with dark chocolate, but I am allergic to the dark chocolate so we were able to sub for milk chocolate. It comes with a piece of cheese cake with a cherry on top, rice krispy treats, oreo and graham cracker crusted marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, brownies, and pound cake. All of these are endless as well. Everything was fantastic except for the marshmallows, I don't like them too much. 

I can't believe how full I was!! I didn't think that I would have to roll myself out of there based on the food provided since it was all in small portions, but man I was stuffed! I HIGHTLY recommend this place for a romantic dinner or to celebrate a birthday for 2."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious!!! I love this place for special occasions or just because. It's great that you can just stop it for some cheese and dessert if you can't spend a lot but are having a craving. Always great service and a good time"}
{"text":"So much fun, my boys 16th bday so we headed out to one of my faves. I had my baby shower at the melting pot in the university area, 16 years ago  so it seemed fitting lol. We had an amazingly fun experience. We were 5 of us, we had so much food!!! One prob was stale tortilla chips. We didn't eat them anyway. My boys loved cooking their food lol"}
{"text":"We absolutely love going to this location because of the bartender Paul. He has great knowledge of everything behind that bar. He remembers exactly what we like and don't like. His drinks are an absolute perfection every time. He truly makes our experience wonderful. We call now before we come just to see if he is there. Go see him!!"}
{"text":"Tyler was great and very informative about the dishes, including his favorites. The hosting staff was very friendly and the overall experience was great! Definitely recommend the private seating as well!"}
{"text":"Our server Tyler made last night's dinner one to remember! Melting pot's food is always great - my personal faves are the tomato and green goddess cheese fondue and the cookie butter chocolate (try subbing the white chocolate for dark chocolate! You won't regret it.). Tyler was so attentive, but not overly so. He was so accommodating and made us feel really special. For example, my fiancé was mentioning how he loves the pretzel pieces with the cheese, and without us asking, Tyler brought out extra pretzel pieces. Next time you go, sit in Tyler's section!"}
{"text":"Dined at this location 12/04 and was so impressed.  Our servers name was Ryan and he was beyond amazing.  So attentive, knowledgeable, and fast.  Answered any and al questions we had and had a brilliant personality.  It was endless fondue and he didn't let our plates go empty.  Do yourself a favor and visit this location and ask for Ryan.  I promise, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Since everyone - myself included - mentions just how long it can take at The Melting Pot, I figured I'd also mention that there's another way to go about it that can be just as enjoyable (if not more so).

When you're in more of a rush, just grab a seat at the bar.  It's very rarely used, and when it is, it's usually only for a few minutes by someone grabbing a smoke (which stinks, both figuratively and literally).

The upside is that you get attentive service, you don't wait long for drinks, and it doesn't take long to get anything.  The downside - other than the smoking issue - is that you can't get a full-blown fondue.  Only the cheese and chocolate.  But then, if you're in a hurry, you probably don't want that anyway."}
{"text":"Cheese, chocolate, meat, wine... need I say more? What's really nice about The Melting Pot is the consistent high quality. Every time we come we have a great experience. Great service too. We're big fans of the Thursday night specials for cheese and chocolate, not to mention half price glasses of wine!"}
{"text":"I discovered the bar has happy hour specials that the main restaurant area doesn't have
You can get smaller and fewer items 
That was perfect for our family 
We got two cheese fondue pots. One for the kids and one for adults. 
We got salads instead of the expensive entrees 
And then of course we got 2 different chocolate selections for dessert 
We loved the dessert. I'd come back just for that
The bar seemed to give you more choices 
Our service was great 
This isn't an everyday choice but very nice for special days"}
{"text":"I always enjoy MPot it's a fun meal.  We went on the last day of restaurant week, so they had a great 4 course special for $35 per person.  I never think it's a great idea to go anywhere that week because all the restaurants are so busy and servers are worn out, but we still had good service.  We tried the bourbon bacon cheese fondue for something different and it was good but the traditional Swiss is my favorite.  The bourbon flavor was very mild.  It's worth a try.  The salads are very fresh.  We had the milk chocolate fondue and it was good but go for the dark, it's a lot more satisfying.  

If you are going for the full 4 course or the big night out special make sure you are hungry!"}
{"text":"almost 100 dollars a person to cook for yourself no thanks. I was dragged here once and i will not be back. The service was amazing but the food was not up to par with the price. I think that this place is highly like mainly because you can say you ate fondue at the \"melting pot\" big whoop make fondue at your house and invite some friends over and save everybody some money."}
{"text":"Great first time experience.  Group of 4 of us sat at bar in which we  had 1/2 price bottles of wine (Tuesday's) and we did the green goddess cheddar as our fondue choice which was great!  They also do small plates at bar area Monday - Thursday for $6. The lobster quesadilla was a hit as was the skewers which you can get beef, chicken or shrimp.  I tried all three the beef had bit too much spices on it for me but other two people enjoyed them.  Shrimp would have to be my favorite. We ended of course with the chocolate fondue just the original but it has peanut butter in it which is fabulous! 
Our bartender was very helpful in not only wine selections but in food choices as well.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the unique dinning experience you get at the Melting Pot. We have been on two occasions and both experiences were spectacular. The meats, veggies and sauces are awesome.

If you are going, be sure to go on an empty stomach. The 4-course meal is a gut buster for sure. I would suggest ordering the Individual Entree where you can pick 2 or 3 items. The dessert is also spectacular.

You will pay for this experience but it is worth it if you are celebrating a special occasion. We love the Melting Pot and their servers are always awesome."}
{"text":"I like this place and frequent it a lot with my girlfriend. The atmosphere is nice and quality is high. I also like how the management handles situations or concerns. I reviewed on Facebook...and though I gave a high rating, I mentioned one issue (vaguely) and the manager called me the next day. This is quality customer service and I'm proud to be a regular at this location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Melting Pot in about 15 years, so I was glad to see one open in Huntersville in the old Fuddrucker's building off Statesville Road. This Melting Pot is easily accessible from the interstate and is just gorgeous inside. Nothing like the former Fuddrucker's!

My hubby and I sat in one of the private, two-person booths. I loved that we could adjust our own lighting, and the booths had high sides so you could not see anyone around you.

We decided to try the Big Night Out Americana (Fondue Fusion) meal, at $89 per couple and including a cheese fondue appetizer, salads, a selection of meats and seafood (including a lobster tail), and chocolate fondue. For first-timers, it's a great way to try the fondue experience. But it was a LOT of food. Too much, really. I think the next time we will order items separately and skip the cheese fondue, since it was kind of heavy and our least favorite of the selections.

We are much better at gauging the doneness of items than we were 15 years ago, but this is the one thing that prevents me from giving Melting Pot five stars. I mean, your enjoyment of the food is dependent on your ability to cook items correctly yourself. They give you guidance on how long items should cook, but no timers. That would be a nice addition to the tables!

But, I have to say that we enjoyed just about everything we tried. I preferred the lobster, shrimp, and pork, and my hubby preferred the lobster and sirloin. You also get several vegetables and lots of sauces to choose from. I really loved the curry sauce, and used it on just about everything.

Service at Melting Pot is top notch. Our server was constantly checking on us to see if we needed more drinks, veggies or sauces (sadly, extra lobster was not an option, LOL). 

We will most definitely return to Melting Pot! What a great addition to Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"Best date or anniversary dinner around. Very romantic, very intimate. Service excellent. Food doubly so. Pricey, but they have good specials. Be aware, this is not a quick meal, nor should it be. This is my \"relationship maintenance place\" and I make sure we can afford the meal and the time before I even suggest it. I wish I could do this place more often...but then it wouldn't be special, now, would it?"}
{"text":"Listen guys, this place is delicious! There is no questioning if the food is good, if the seasoning is perfect, or if the experience is a blast...but beware that this is exactly that- An experience!  If you are looking for a date night where you just relax, I wouldn't necessarily say this is your place.  Although I've been for date night, as well as on a double date, there is work to put in,...and for me it is fun! Their wine list is super extensive, they have delicious specialty cocktails and their meats seem to be top notch! I LOVE the spinach and gorgonzola cheese blend, The teriyaki beef is delicious, as is the Mojo \"cooking style\" for all chicken and fish! 
Consider that for a couple with some drinks ( even on a half price bottle of wine night) will spend around $120-$150 including tip!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal here for Valentine's day.  It's a chain restaurant, which is its only limitation in my book. Service was good, albeit a little slow, food was good, and we were very full on leaving.  I would return for a future special occasion meal"}
{"text":"Super delicious food. The atmosphere is nice. A bit pricey but this isn't a typical dinner. You cook your own food at the table. I was a bit confused my first visit but the server was super helpful. They have a two person dinner for 92$. It's worth it."}
{"text":"The new location is a little difficult to get to especially with all the construction, but this place still provides a premium dining experience. My wife and I really liked the booths for 2, they are really a nice touch and provide some privacy away from the larger groups and even the couples that are right next to you.

My favorite part is desert with the rice krispie treats, fruits, and various pastries. On the other hand, the meat/seafood I feel are ordinary and over priced. I know that its meant to be a 3-4 course meal, but I don't feel like it would hurt to give us more than 2 -3 cubes of beef and chicken. 

Good for special occasions or maybe a date night (my wife and I don't get out very often and it takes about 2 hours to eat so you have plenty of time to talk), but not some place that you have to eat at frequently"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!!!  I love the experience and the servers are all knowledgeable and wonderful! 
Paul and Tyler behind the bar are the best!!! I go back as often as I can, but it is pricey!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 star solely on the basis that they don't serve sweet tea. They weren't out... They just don't serve it. This is unacceptable. This is the south. Get it together melting pot.

Service and food was great."}
{"text":"I just love the Melting Pot! I love it for date night, for couples dates and for girls nights. Just make sure you go hungry. Tip: check their website for specials - they have deals like $10 chocolate and cheese fondue at the bar! My favorites are: teriyaki sirloin/steak (better than their filet oddly enough), their salad with the 'black walnut dressing' (which you can buy by the bottle, I do!), their mushrooms stuffed with their \"green goddess sauce,\" the green apples and cheese (I don't even like green apples usually), the graham marshmallows, crispy treats, and bananas in the chocolate. They're very knowledgeable about the wine, always! They are very patient and don't mind educating you on cooking, foods, wines, etc. Great for parties too. Lastly, like Starbucks, they have 'off menu' desert options - so be sure to ask your server his/her favorite. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"This is everything Id expect from melting pot and then some! The drinks: top class. The food: beyond words delicious. The environment: cozy and romantic. The staff: superbly friendly with excellent teamwork. The desert: should NOT be missed. Love this place and the food. I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Delicious fondue and attentive, thoughtful service. The servers and manager went out of their way to meet our specific and special dietary needs. They could not have been nicer, provided better service, or been more welcoming. Very nice dinner experience and terrific food."}
{"text":"Date night out with the hubby.  We had fantastic service and very good food.  We really enjoyed it and it is well worth the price"}
{"text":"Our meal was awesome! We did the Fondue for Two and chose the alpine Swiss cheese fondue, pumpkin salad, Mojo fondue (with filet, chicken, and shrimp), and ended our meal with dark chocolate. We decided to upgrade our dessert dip options and it was the BEST decision ever! And, since we went on a Tuesday, we got a bottle of wine 1/2 off! Our server was super kind and personable, too. Terrific experience overall! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place everyone should enjoy at least once. I went once, and now I'm good. Overall, it was a fun (three hour) experience, but even on restaurant week prices I felt it was a little overpriced. I enjoyed dipping my appetizer and dessert, but was pretty much over the novelty of cooking my own chicken entree at the table before I even started.

Near the end of our meal, our waiter mentioned something about the cheese appetizer, side salad and fondue dessert being available for $22 a person M-Th evenings, which would be much more manageable I think.

*Favorite thing: The house dressing was REALLY DELICIOUS - although sweet strawberries in the Yin and Yang chocolate was hard to beat!"}
