{"text":"Great food, we are lucky to have this place! It can get busy around normal meal times as it isn't huge, but well worth a small wait if it happens.

The burgers are all I gotten, and I really like the mahi mahi burger :)"}
{"text":"Was staying right by here and needed somewhere close AND I love fish tacos. 

Fish tacos and coconut shrimp was amazing and just right to share.

Eddy was also great! Friendly and answered all our questions, since this was our first time.

Also the speed in which the food hit the table was great. Within minutes of our ordering."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos you will ever have! We used to have to drive up to the  Scottsdale location so very happy they opened here!!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Decided to try this place out over pita jungle and it's over priced. $11 for 2 fish tacos and nothing else. Plus the fish seemed over cooked and there was way too much stuff piled on top of it. Calimari was chewy. Definitely not for a family to eat....we could of gotten way more food and better tasting at pita jungle for what we payed here"}
{"text":"loved the fish tacos!  the coconut milk coleslaw is fantastic!  vey nice and clean restaurant with surf boards as tables. highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were okay and large, although they weren't very flavorful considering they advertise 17 ingredients.  This is the only reason I am giving them an additional star, the size of the tacos (although they should be large because 2 of them cost $11 - expensive for a fish taco place).  First, the cashier was very helpful, but was trying to sell me things that were not gluten free when I already told her I was gluten free.  This was in response to them being out of fries...on a weekend night.  How are you out of fries when a large part of your menu is fish and chips?

Then, the wait.  We were one of five tables, all of which had their food when we ordered, and it took over 20 minutes to get our food.  This seems like a long time for a restaurant where you go up to a cashier and order.  Plus, about ten minutes into our wait, a line began to form.  This line didn't move until we got our food 10 minutes later.  Expect to wait in line and for your food.

The service...was terrible.  The girl that served us our food was snotty and rude.  This was our first time there and when we asked her a question, she gave us a terrible attitude.  Then, we asked the manager about the asian fish.  He talked about the wasabe marinade/coating on the fish, we weren't sure what it was but it was missing.  He was arguing that we should've known and told him that it was missing.  We only figured this out after we told him it had no flavor and he told us it has lots of flavor, but he couldn't understand that it wasn't on the fish. How were we going to know it was missing when it was our first time there.  They were also out of the salad dressing we ordered.

Overall, the food is okay, but the service, cost, and wait times will prevent us from returning.  I was hoping it would be good like the Fish Shop in San Diego, but it was not.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful service along with incredibly tasty food. Mahi Mahi burger was wonderful, fish tacos with mango jalape√±o salsa were superb and the French fries were as good as I've ever had. This is a must go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good decor, great food, prompt service. Don't expect cheap tacos here. The fish and chips was on spot with fresh crisp fries. The fish tacos were huge and pretty filling. Highly recommend going here if you like fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I like them fishy tacos. The other stuff, however, is alright and they have messed up my order a couple of times. Once, they gave me their clam chowder soup, rather than the Salmon Alfredo pasta that I ordered. I did not \"me gusta\" that. Other than that, my experiences have been quite pleasant and de-\"fish\"erous"}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos! You do not have table service here so you have to be in the mood for the type of place where you order at the counter and then sit at a picnic-table style bench (with no back). However, if you are up for that then you are set. The food is so good. The staff is very friendly too. If you have kids beware small portions. We've had to get back in line on two occasions because my daughter was still hungry (hasn't happened elsewhere) so now I encourage her not to order off the kids menu."}
{"text":"I came in this past Saturday night. First time in...food was amazing and loved the atmosphere. 
Barbara was our server and went above and beyond to make my first visit extra special. Will definitely be my go-to place EVERY time I am in town!  Thank you Coconut's and Barbara!"}
{"text":"I loved the fish and chips I had here! The people that work there are very friendly and I love all the surf videos"}
{"text":"My husband and I  stopped by while visiting Scottsdale, as we are familiar with the Coconut's Fish Cafe in Maui.  So happy we did!  Great place.  Food is fresh and DELICIOUS.  Fairly priced for the generous portion size.  Staff is friendly and Kim, the owner, represents his business very well.  I wish them the best.  We will DEFINITELY be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Great calamari and chips. They cut calamari steak into strips then bread them and fried them. Calamari was awesome, nice, meaty chunks. Not over done! 
Poke bowl is everything! Great garnish, nice flavor all together. Very helpful staff and knowledgeable about their menu on preparation and ingredients. Would definitely come again! Very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Resturant but the owner could care less about what people want.  He doesn't care about making people happy."}
{"text":"One of the best poke bowls (got mine with rice and salad) in the area! Great, friendly service combined with a relaxed atmosphere. Also have great fish/mango tacos. Would NOT recommend the fish and chips however; not fresh at all."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are delicious! The prices might scare you, 10 bucks for 2 but they are HUGE! Definitely large enough for two to share. The service was friendly and prompt, the second we were done someone came outside to clear our plates. Only compliant is that there is no trash can outside.. Just a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"coconuts is delish wife n i pop in for early dinner. tasty fish tacos handsom sauce on them fab homemade cole slaw a sweet island. flavor. love the surfboard tables. spotless clean. will surely return. to the beach ! aloha !"}
{"text":"Love love love coconuts ! Fell in love in Maui and now I was able to fall in love all over again in Arizona !  
My favorite item I crave the most on the menu is the  Cajun Ono Sandwich served with their specialty coleslaw on top and you have to have a basket of fresh warm fries to complete the order ! 
Fish tacos are also amazing (my moms favorite) and the coconut shrimp is sooooo good ! 
I love the atmosphere. Awesome vibes all around. Service is on point.
Have family visiting this is a place they will love to visit 
Have kids .... Going on a first date ... Or a ladies night out fits all the categories and needs ! 
If you haven't tried Coconuts yet get your butt in there :) 
Go enjoy life with great food and great people! 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Just had the Ahi seared and tacos. Both are fresh and awesome! Owner Kim is always on hand. I would definitely recommend this for fast, fresh and healthy food. It's easy - you get your food in 5 minutes approximately, made fresh and the fish is very high quality. Even Ahi  tuna seared and rare is excellent. Some come with slaw and rice and others with chips (healthy ones!). Great value, fresh and fast."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are great and the size of mountains! I enjoyed the coconut shrimp and the orange glaze it came with. The service was great and friendly. I will def be back to try the salads next."}
{"text":"Was ok for a quick meal. Was expecting more for some reason but then again, it's in the desert and not a few steps from the beach like Maui. 
Fish tacos were quite good. Also had blackened island style Mahi Mahi. So so. 

Kids dog was huge. I'll give them another shot but will probably get it to go..almost 50 bucks for 2 adult and two kids."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff is the friendliest-love the good energy they all have!!!!  Fish tacos are my favorite, delicious, fresh ingredients, consistently great!!!  Restaurant is clean with a playful fun vibe and I love supporting local businesses-Coconuts is a weekly fav of mine in Scottsdale!  Don't walk, run to this fantastic cozy little neighborhood fish cafe!"}
{"text":"So, we read the reviews and decided it was time for fish tacos.  SO glad we went!  Clean, happy vibe; and really GOOD fish tacos.  Enough said..go get some yourself!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos! Ono local style is great too. Amazing, meticulous service! You can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mahi Cajun style and my husband ordered the fish and chips. The food was excellent! We fish and chips were done just right! The service was just as great. The servers were so helpful and nice. I definitely will be going back. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very accommodating and helpful staff to meet my dietary restrictions and specially prep an amazing piece of Mahi Mahi fish and healthy steamed vegetables.  Blackened and Cajun spices are amazing on the \"Local Style,\" refreshing falvored iced tea selection, good value."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time and was immediately hooked. The Ono (wahoo) tacos are absolutely the best tacos on earth! So super fresh and delicious with nothing to be ashamed of like beans and rice. This is pure Hawaiian baby! Super healthy and ultra fresh, not to mention filling. Aloha spirit included!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top 5 restaurants! We found this place in Maui and craved it for years! When we saw this place while driving thru Scottsdale my stomach jumped for joy! My wife and I drive 45 mins at least once a month just to go eat here. The fish tacos, fish sandwich/burger, and coconut shrimp & chips are too good to be true! No other place compares!!"}
{"text":"Clean interior
 Friendly staff
 Convenient location
 Extensive but not overwhelming menu choices
    Really good food!

This may be North Scottsdale's best kept secret. Although it seemed a bit odd to have a fish taco at a Hawaiian themed restaurant I figured, why not? I once had McDonalds in Japan and KFC in London - this was much better.

The fish tacos (you get 2 on separate plates) come with a rather small soft taco shell that's piled high with fish, mango, cole slaw, etc.  It's nearly impossible to fold this up and I guarantee some food is going to drop out - don't worry about it, but get a fork.  I also tried the fish and chips (again - in a Hawaiian themed restaurant?) which were also excellent. 

At first I thought the prices were a bit high (the fish tacos were $11) but after tasting the food I think they're well worth the price.  

FYI - I had a little trouble finding this place. The address is on Scottsdale but it faces Bell just west of the intersection. It's very close to Carlos O'Brien's."}
{"text":"\"Great place, nice and clean, good atmosphere! The fish tacos are, no kidding, excellent!!\""}
{"text":"Amazing! Everyone in the family lived it, including my nephew who's a picky eater. The fish tacos are huge and delicious, the macadamia nut Mahi Mahi is a must try.  Don't forget to ask fire the taro chips and calamari!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!  One is enough for two average eaters :) while you're at it plan your next trip to Hawaii Cox the ambience would make you wanna do just that!  ;)"}
{"text":"best fish tacos! they have huge portions so you can share the tacos for sure."}
{"text":"This place is such a GEM.... I have lived literally less than a mile down the street for over a year now and haven't stepped foot in this place... until 2 nights ago. And I already went back again for lunch today.  

Definitely a Hawaiian style place, the tables and seats are wooden surfboards, pretty cool.  They have a few beers that they offer on tap, as well as bottled beer and wine.  I cannot convey enough how much I LOVED the food.  First time I went in, I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish burger.  DELICIOUS.  You're going to spend around 15 for the meal but it's worth every penny.  Beautiful cut of fish, you pick the type of seasoning you want.  The cole slaw that they serve with it is outstanding too.  Great flavor and you walk out feeling you got your money's worth and satisfied.

They are known for their fish tacos and I can see why!! I ordered them today.  Two good size, stuffed to the brim tacos so make sure you grab a fork! :)  The service was excellent both times as well.  Happy to answer questions, very helpful, very friendly and efficient staff.  

Love it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Chandler. Had the 2 fish tacos plate. Hands down, the best fish tacos I have had.

The combination of the fish cooked just right, their slaw, tomato, mango, etc. and oh the sauce on that slaw. The sauce is just SO good. The corn tortillas have a bit of a crunch to them  and add to the delight of these tacos.

Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"We had the best fish tacos of our life today at this amazing restaurant.  Fresh mango salsa, coconut shrimp and incredible coconut milk coleslaw were delicious!  The servings are very generous and two people can split one order of fish tacos-yes, they are that big!  All I can say is, Thank you for bringing the island style to Scottsdale, Arizona.  The customer service is as great as the food!  Way to go on being environmentally and socially responsible.  We are going to tell everyone we know what a gem this restaurant is-AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"If you are allergic to onion and garlic be aware that the salt seasoning they sprinkle on the fish contains onion powder and garlic powder. The fish sandwich was very good until a couple of hours later when I became ill. I'd had the sandwich plain without the slaw. I called and the manager couldn't figure why I'd become sick until he went to the kitchen and read the salt seasoning ingredients. If you are allergic to the onion and garlic you are allergic to the powders. I will ask for no seasoning next time."}
{"text":"My wife had the fish tacos (which were heaping huge tacos at that) and I had the fish taco mountain which is all the ingredients of the fish tacos served over brown rice instead of the taco shell. Let me tell you, it was huuugge. I love mango and was happy to see that when it came out with it on there. We sat outside on their front door seating and enjoyed the beautiful weather. The coconut shrimp appetizer and sauce was out of this world. I only wish that I had more since they give you six shrimp and I had to split it between 4 people. The staff were super friendly and we will definitely go back there when we visit the area."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on the suggestion / recommendation of a friend.

As instructed, I ordered the taco mountain - winner, winner; chicken.....


Freshly prepared, seasoned perfectly and allowed my taste buds to enjoy the wide range of flavor... I have not had something this tasty in quite some time.

lunch was $20 - an expensive lunch but it was unique food that I could get no where else in Scottsdale (major plus in the land of chains!!)

Order at the counter, so there are no service expectations and no tips. Please do not tip people to take your order at a counter - what is next?? you tip the McDonalds drive thru window ?? get real people

I would happily go to Coconuts again and again. Please do not order pasta or chicken and expect it to be the 'house special' - that is like going to Singapore and wanting a Steak - not going to be well prepared or even a good piece of meat! be sensible

Taco mountain!!! climb one!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this new restaurant so my husband, son & I stopped in for dinner.  This restaurant is AMAZING! Huge portions, fresh ingredients, super clean and a very friendly staff.  The entire interior has a great beachy vibe that reminds you of Maui (where their original location is).  We have been back many times!!
I recommend the fish taco's, my husband loved the \"Taco Mountain\" and my little toddler chowed down on the fish & brown rice!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and saw this on Yelp.  Outstanding food and friendly staff.  Got the Mahi with rice and coleslaw, huge portion and delicious at a great price. Bravo"}
{"text":"Love this place, have tried multiple items and have loved them all. The Fish Burger Mahi blackend is my favorite."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now.  The fish tacos are absolutely the best I've ever eaten in a restaurant, period, and I am a fan of fish tacos.

The coconut shrimp appetizer is also very good.

I gave it only four stars simply because we have only tried a couple of items.

Need to try the clam chowder (when it cools down a bit), and the fish pasta before I can give it the 100% five star rating!!!

That said, the fish taco's are a 10 STAR in my book."}
{"text":"Nice little fish spot if you need to eat seafood and get your fix. Dairy Queen relaxing atmosphere excellent service friendly folks I would highly recommend and definitely go back. :-)"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are fresh and filling. Can't go wrong with any of the sides. Service is also very quick if you're in a hurry. One of my favorite stops for lunch when in Scottsdale. If you need less of a mess, go with the bowl instead of the tacos."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos right here in the valley!  I have driven past a hundred time and finally stopped in last month.  What was I thinking?  The tacos were delicious, quick and priced well.  This is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original Coconuts in Maui many times, so I was super excited when I heard they were opening one in Scottsdale. This place is totally cute, relaxing and laidback. The ono burger is great and the calamari is yummy wonderful! They have TVs on with surfing and beachy scenery. You really cannot go wrong with anything you order on the menu. They offer a variety of ways to cook the food (e.g., blackened, Cajun, lemon butter, etc.) which is nice. I would definitely recommend this place for a group of friends looking for a casual atmosphere to eat good food and relax."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in Phoenix metro area. The coconut shrimp is really good (but sweet like dessert) and the seafood chowder is amazing with big chunks of fish in it. The southwest style fish is my favorite so far. I like that they have a gluten-free menu, too!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Hands down the best fish tacos in AZ. Eat them with your hands and use your sleeve as a napkin. As fresh as it gets."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Huge portions consider spliting if you order tacos."}
{"text":"The food was good. I liked the fish tacos (they are very big!) and the seafood pasta (with alfredo) was also good. I do think the pasta was overpriced (only 2 pieces of shrimp). Also, they charge a take out fee, fyi. Overall, I would go back but I'm not going to rave about it to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor from Michigan & decided to check this place out. The coconut shrimp was TO DIE FOR. The fish taco is supposedly famous, but I wasn't incredibly impressed with that. Overall, the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I remember this place in Maui HI. 
 I am waiting for my food.
staff is friendly but this place  is expensive! .
but I'd  eat here again.
and I'm expecting  my coconut shrimp and chicken pasta with  cream  sauce  is  awesome  ."}
{"text":"So this was our first time at their new location on Ocotillo and although my wife loves this place,  I've had much better fish tacos for half the price.  For a fish platter and two mahi-mahi/ono fish tacos and two drinks it came out to $30.  Bit pricey for mediocre tacos. 

The tacos couldn't be eaten like a normal taco because it had so much stuff on it.  The cabbage was cut too chunky too in my opinion.  I guess most would say it is good to have lots of the filling but if it all spills out while taking a bite and gets all over the place then I find it hard to enjoy.  

They also mixed the mahi-mahi and ono together and you can't get it separate which I thought was weird.  I like Rubios grilled mahi mahi tacos better and they're much cheaper too."}
{"text":"Very good tasting. Big over priced. We got 2 orders of fish tacos (4 tacos) to share and - order of shrimp & chips. Not bad but not awesome. I prefer Wahoo in SoCal."}
{"text":"Food is good but price is a bit pricey when considering it as a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos  ,yummy coconut shrimp ,service staff was great friendly and cute definitely go back you guys should all enjoy!  prices are reasonable under 10 bucks very very good definitely go back there for fish tacos! Reminded me of Laguna at wahoos:)"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, friendly service, clean spot and especially great if you have young kids. 

Loved this place and would definitely go back again.  The fish tacos were really good and was fresh and hot off the press when it came to the table."}
{"text":"Great lunch on Saturday afternoon...the fish tacos are major, and so fresh tasting"}
{"text":"Coconuts deserves every star possible. Great place to get a healthy, quick, and flavorful meal. I call in orders all the time and they have always have my food ready in less than 10 minutes. The staff is friendly and everything I have tried off the menu was on point. 5/5"}
{"text":"Imagine if the burger restaurant islands had a baby with rubios. Great fish and chips, clam chowder, and perfectly cooked calamari. All wrapped up with a very casual Hawaiian surf theme. Would recommend to anyone to try."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and the Maui location. ALWAYS tasty, fresh, and healthy. Good service, good food AND happy hour beer prices. Mike from Maui has a fabulous thing going. Mahalo"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good, the coconut shrimp app was good, the fish tacos were tastes but it is a bit overpriced.  Overall nice addition to the neighborhood.  Wanted to try the Poke but they were out.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I had the macadamia nut crusted mahi-mahi. I liked it. It was pretty sufficient and filling for one person. It came with rice and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Read reviews from others and it was dead on.  Fish tacos were amazing as were the chicken tacos.  My daughter got the chicken caesar salad and said the chicken wasn't good but everything else was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, somewhat affordable, fresh & quick.  I would like a higher end restaurant where one can dine & have more of an extensive menu.  But it really hits the spot if you want in & out quickly with a healthy twist."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yummmmmmmm! We were in the area and chose Coconuts Fish Cafe because of the great yelp reviews! Thank you! Everything we had was delicious. My husband had the fish tacos and I had the Ono local style... I am not a fan of coleslaw, but their's is made with coconut milk and it was de-lish!  Our son had grilled chicken strips with fries- it's nice to not always have the kids chicken tenders be fried.  The fries were thin, a little seasoned and great! 

My only minor suggestions would be a dessert menu- maybe something mango related?? I would also serve the local style fish on a little bigger plate. It was a nice size piece of fish, brown rice, coleslaw, and a sliced tomato with cheese on top... I could have used a little space to spread it all out. 

Overall, the food was very tasty! The staff was super friendly, too! The decor was cute- I liked that I could hang my purse off the fin of the surfboard table.   We wish they'd come to Central Phoenix now!"}
{"text":"Ok, just save yourself the time and effort of finding an awesome meal--Run, don't walk here...fresh. delicious, flavorful. One of the best fish sandwiches (blackened mahi) and fish tacos, ever, period. Go there, enjoy, we are right about this!"}
{"text":"Normally a great place to get a good healthy bite, but not tonight. I called in an order, go pick it up and find out they gave my food to the wrong customer. The manager on duty tonight asks if we want something to drink while we waited for our order to be redone. I ask for the house chardonnay. The manager hands my husband a ticket. I'm thinking, ok we already got our receipt, but oh well. Just to be sure I'm getting comped due to my inconvenience, I make sure we're all set since our food is finally done. The cashier says \"Oh yeah, you're all good!\" He walks in the back and before we get out good he then says \" Oh, he ( the manager) does want u to pay for that\". Never again. Not only did my time and money get disrespected, but I guess I was the wrong color to get a comped glass of wine while waiting for my food that got given away to be recooked. Never again! Great food but manager's customer service sucks. I don't care if my glass of wine was $5.41 ( and I say this with great sarcasm), that was something the company could have eaten due to my inconvenience. Food is good though"}
{"text":"Definitely the best fish tacos in the valley, they were actually hailed as having the best fish taco in the US but I reserve that for their original location in Maui! Where I have been going for years I was thrilled when I heard they were opening a second location here. 


Everything is delicious from their blackened Ono over rice to their famous fish burger but my favorite is sill the taco- its like a flavor explosion- Sooo tasty & filling. And the fries!!! Get the fries they are addictive and yes you will crave them!"}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California to Scottsdale for the first time ,trying to find a healthy restaurant to eat guided us to this place and I have to say we nailed it. The staff they were very friendly and the food was even better. I ordered the seafood salad with mahi mahi and a Caesar dressing on the side and I have to say that the freshness of the salad made me not even use any dressing absolutely delicious and healthy and fresh. My husband ordered the taco salad with chicken and dressing on the side,he was very satisfied with food as well."}
{"text":"I love the original in Maui and really liked when they first opened.  It seems the last few times I have been, the fish is fishier and \"rubbery.\"  I am not sure if there is trouble shipping fresh fish to the desert or not, however, I was so hoping it wouldn't deteriorate. Even, though expensive, I would have given 5 stars a few months ago.  I can't do that now, and will give it 2 1/2 based on my last few visits and the decrease in the quality of the food.  The staff are always pleasant, so I hope they fix whatever the issue seems to be.  We need a place like this where we can get fresh fish."}
{"text":"Coconut's is our favorite place to eat. We LOVE the fish taco mountain. It's so delicious and it's gluten free. This place gets busy during lunch and dinner so get there early. Staff is very friendly. We eat here often (as well as the Shea location) and NEVER had a bad experience. Would give more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever.  I'm originally from SoCal and have had more than my share of fish tacos.  These beat them all hands down.  The French fries were also delicious.
Michael Phillips, chef and owner, was there for the opening of this location.  The entire staff is very friendly and helpful.
We also got a bonus swag bag just for eating there today."}
{"text":"Great food with fast friendly service. I had the fish tacos. If I had to be picky the fish was a little over cooked but the flavour was fresh with tones of delicious toppings.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Coconut shrimp appetizer and mac nut mahi entree were delicious!  Best fish I have had in AZ.  Our kids, 4, and 9 were very happy with their meals too.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service & ingredients.   Clean and nice curb appeal.  Check this place out"}
{"text":"Excellent fish! Three if us had Ono sandwich, fish tacos and fish and chips. Small venue with walk-up ordering. Everything is surf boards with a definite Hawaiian feel! The staff are helpful and good wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good service. Great food. Would definitely go back. Fish tacos are the best in town."}
{"text":"So the wife and I came here for lunch last week as the sign (love coconut, and fish tacos) drew us in from Scottsdale road!  Loved the little surf board style tables they had.  We ordered at the counter and got Two fish tacos and an order of calamari and chips.

Fish tacos were amazing, the fish it's self was cooked perfect, moist and flaky!  Top that with a coconut milk slaw and a fresh mango salsa and mmmmmmm!  The calamari and chips was good, but the calamari were shaped like long and thin fish sticks which was new.

OK so why the 5 star rating?  Well, in 2014 I rediscovered something I thought vanished from the face of the earth long, long ago...CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Eddie (sorry if I forgot or misspelled your name)  was outstanding, he saw to our every need and made sure everything was good, never had to wait or ask twice.  He was very polite.

After finishing our meal and boxing up our food he walked with us to open the door as well.  I had parked right in front of the door, so when we got in our vehicle the cylinder lock had jammed up and we were unable to start our vehicle.  After sweating profusely and trying to start our car, Eddie came out a couple times to ask if we needed help, and when I finally agreed to his help, he was able to start our vehicle right away (saved us big time).  

Upon leaving he refused our tip for helping us and simply stated \"Come back and see us again soon!\"  So that's why I give this place a 5 out of 5, you just can't beat good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Top notch fast casual. Amazing food and staff provides amazing customer service.   Christian. Ashley. Eddie and Steven to name a few.   All locations are energetic and the food is amazing and fresh.   Kim the owner is engaged in his business and right there with his staff. A must try and you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"As a busy mom with 2 teen boys, and plenty of local food options for a meal out,  Coconut's Fish Caf√© is ALWAYS our go to spot. Not only is the staff friendly and informative from the moment we walk in, but the food is fabulous.......plenty to choose from, but we love the tacos and fish and chips the best.  The fish is fresh, sizes are large and the homemade sauces ( Asian Flair is my fav..) are delicious.   In fact my youngest wouldn't even try fish until we ate at the Coconut's Bell Rd. location over a year and a half ago. Even my friends and co workers love to grab a bite and a beer whenever time permits. 
If you are looking for a gluten free menu,  with variety and a super cool place for a taste of Hawaii, Coconut's is the place to go. Great job!! We will be back."}
{"text":"My review is surprising. I'm a little disappointed.  My husband and I were in Maui and ate at Coconut's Fish Cafe about a month ago. I was excited to see there was one in Scottsdale because we liked it in Maui but for some reason it didn't taste quite as I remembered. 

We both had fish tacos. I liked the crispness of the tortilla and the fish wasn't fishy tasting but whatever sauce was on the taco had such a strong horseradish flavor and was extremely not pleasing. 

It sure made us miss Maui because the decor was just like it there. Actually this one has a nice patio because the one in Maui is in a strip mall!

Probably won't be back for tacos. Maybe if we are in the area well try something different on the menu. I usually like to give two tries."}
{"text":"Me and my grandma always go to Coconut's when I'm in town. It's very interesting, not your everyday taco place. I think that their service is great, and the food tastes good, it's just a little over priced because of the large servings. I would love it if the tacos were foldable!"}
{"text":"Great fresh fish tacos and sandwiches, which run about $11 per person (but well worth it). Salads, fried coconut shrimp, sides, etc. Their only other location is in Maui, kinda cool."}
{"text":"I'd been anticipating going ever since I saw the coming soon sign.  Turns out they're Maui's #1 restaurant for fish taco's and Zagat rated them very high as well.  When we went today during lunch time they were pretty full but there were some open tables.  (The tables are in the shape of surf boards - so that right there puts you in the right mood).  If you sit in the main restaurant they have two large screen tv's that play some kind of a surfing video and that just really gets you further into a \"beachy vibe\".  We proceeded to the counter and were greeted by a friendly cashier who took our order and explained any questions we had.

We ordered the calamari appetizer, fish tacos and mac and cheese from the kids menu.  The calamari was exquisite.  Served in strips, with an amazing dipping sauce.  Sweetness, right amount of chewiness and just perfect! The fish tacos phenomenal.  You get two per order and that's plenty.  The tacos are warmed (gluten free) so they have a somewhat toasty-ness to them - full of cabbage, fresh mango, tomatoes and cukes.  The fish pieces are grilled and a generous portion.  The taco's are dressed in a salsa that's tomato based and has just the right kick to it so that you don't need to put anything else in except squirt some lemon if you like.  My son ate about 80% of his M&C.  The fish in the tacos was fresher than fresh and cooked just right.  My son even had quite a bit of it.  

While we were eaten we got table touched by Kim the owner, friendly guy.  The rest of the staff was attentive and friendly and available to bus, get us any extra spoons etc. 

I'm going back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Clean place, nice staff, average tacos, expensive.

I was disappointed with the tacos for a few reasons:
1. too many toppings, and one had a brown mustard taste that ruined it for me; also too much cabbage but that at least could easily be taken off.
2. o.k. fish
3. expensive

I will not go back - $11 for 2 tacos and no sides.  Save your $$ for somewhere else.
All a fish taco needs is good fish, a good white based sauce, a little cabbage and red sauce on the side.

Fish and chips were better but not great."}
{"text":"Went to Coconuts Fish Cafe last night for dinner.  Cute atmosphere.    The food was fair.  Two tacos for 11.00 is a bit much.   Nothing else to go with the tacos either.   The cabbage should have been sliced thinner.  It was in chunks.   The fish and chips dinner was mostly french fries.   The fish was cooked too much.  Almost to the dark brown side instead of golden.  Don't think I will be heading back there again.  I rate it a 6 out of 10."}
{"text":"Yes please! I'd eat here everyday and often find myself trending in that direction. The fish tacos are absolutely bomb. They honestly couldn't taste better even if you were sitting in a tropical beach side shanty off the shoreline in Hawaii. They're everyday never get old good. I'll probably see you there one day because I'm not stopping this habit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Go! Eat here! Do it! If you are reading this review and currently considering stopping into this fine establishment, start driving. We had an outstanding experience. Let me first complement the staff, they are so friendly and helpful, one guy even came over to chat for a few min and told us a little about the place. His enthusiasm for his job and the restaurant was refreshing. Now let's talk tacos...delicious, wonderful, fresh, flavorful, perfection! We had the mahi and the steak. Both were fantastic. I was so delighted with how fresh the fish tasted. In a land locked state, you know fish can be a risk. Not here. Just awesome. They pack so much flavor into each taco, it will make your taste buds sing. It's very casual, the atmosphere is bright and clean, I only wish they were open a little later. Thanks for the great experience, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish platter - I had the blackened mahi mahi. There are several choices for the fish and the preparation. The brown rice and coleslaw were also delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We visited coconut fish at their location in Maui and of course the vibe is a totally different than Phoenix...The food however seemed quite similar and therefore excellent. I wish there was one in Chicago. This place just carry excellent fish options at great prices. It's a great quality and the price is right on target. This location offered only Mahi Mahi and Ono but still excellent with the brown rice and the simple coleslaw. Top choice!"}
{"text":"To Die For!!! The best fish tacos ever! Sad I didn't get a chance to try them in Maui last year. But this place felt like I was back in Maui! 
Super fresh GIANT fish tacos! Place was clean, service was great and the decor feels so beachy! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and very good! I love how they offer multiple options of fish and preparation type. 
The fish tacos here are awesome! The mango salsa they put on top is excellent. In addition, the coleslaw they offer has this kick of wasabi that makes it very fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Bill G
I was on vacation in Scottsdale last week and we stumbled across Cocconuts!!! We went in and fell in love with the place. Their were eight people in our party and we gave them 8 thumbs up!!! The owner Kim was very interested in how our food was and is a real cool guy. Whether I am in Hawaii or Scottsdale I will be sure to stop in my \"new\" favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"A total redo of the old location with really nice (maybe too nice/perfect?) decor.  I live within a couple of miles of this place and had been driving by this place for a while and really wasn't sure about it.  \"Coconuts\"?  Bright green?  Hmmm.

Stopped in last night, with the wife and kids, and am glad I did so.  Delicious fish tacos - loaded so much that when you order two, they come out on separate plates!

Nice and clean.  Ice cold Longboard beers.

Won't be long before I'm back."}
{"text":"Amazing! The atmosphere takes me right back to Maui! Cute surfboard tables and very clean. The staff was very nice, accommodating, and informative. We had their famous fish tacos and it is clear why they have won awards for the tacos. While they are a bit messy being piled high with 17 ingredients it is an experience eating them. They encourage you to eat with your hands although you can't possibly imagine how to get all of that in your hands and into your mouth without spilling out.... But it's possible and well worth it! We had the opportunity to meet Chef Mike, a really nice and informative guy. Chef Mike also recommended the coconut shrimp, they had the sweet taste of coconut with this beautiful crunchiness to them, it's the sauce that makes them and that compliments them so perfectly...its a sweet chilie Thai sauce that is a perfect mix of sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Coconut's is a nice restaurant.  Kind of random that they started in Hawaii and have a branch in Scottsdale, but why not?  We tried the seafood chowder to start.  This soup was actually very good, and they are generous with the Mahi Mahi chunks.  We also had the fish and chips.  The fish was great, and the fries were decent.  My main complaint was the portions - two fish is really skimpy for the $12 price.  The decor is clean and quaint.  Somewhat cheesy to have the surf videos, but in the end, it added to the atmosphere.  The service was also friendly."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Still can't get over how amazing the food was! I definitely will be back no doubt about that!"}
{"text":"A dream come true!!  My favorite restaurant in Maui is now here in Scottsdale! It's healthy.  It's fresh.  It's fun with an inviting atmoshere!   Walking in, you instantly feel like you are on vacation.  Walking out, you feel relaxed and not guilty since the food is fresh and healthy.
They are known for their fish tacos.  Quite truthfully, they are the BEST!  However, my favorite is the ono fishburger.  The seafood chowder is also to die for!
Thank you for bringing Coconuts to Arizona!!!  I'm one happy girl!"}
{"text":"What can I say?
Looking for fresh fish and cool people, coconuts had it down pat. 
Hook line and sinker!

The handmade custom furniture is worth the visit alone. Surfs up!
This is bringing Hawaii to the Sun valley.

Always a good treat, I recommend the taco mountain and fish tacos. Don't forget the coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good prices, quality food.  My wife and I both got the Ono fish.  Mine was blackended, hers with the asian seasoning.  We haven't had Ono fish since we were in Hawaii years ago.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service. Food just OK.  Ordered the fish tacos but was not wowed.  The mango salsa was tasty, but the fish was kind of hard to taste with all the toppings piled on. I took out a bite of fish just to taste it, and it was dry.  My boyfriend had the fish and chips, and the breading on the fish was very dark.  Maybe left in the fryer too long?  Maybe my expectations were high with all the great reviews, or it is just a matter of taste, but I expected more attention to the fish.  I have not been to the other locations.  It may be a different experience."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos and great service!  Fast service but way better than any fast food."}
{"text":"The best customer service I have ever experienced! They were so patient with my unorganized order! The associates were very helpful and courteous! Can't wait to get home and try the food"}
{"text":"We are in from out of town and some locals suggested we try this place. 

Fun atmosphere.   The staff was OUTSTANDING!    Food was excellent."}
{"text":"Well this will be my last time here. On top of the over priced food they also charge extra to go. I'll spend my gas to Rubio's inatead."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp coupon for 25% off Coconut Shrimp which was excellent. Fish tacos are the best I've ever had anywhere. Topped off with happy hour $3.50 Skrimshaw draft beer. Perfect!"}
{"text":"After reading that Coconuts fish taco's were the best I had to try them. And everything I'd read was true. The fish tacos were amazing. The best fish taco's I'd ever had. My fiance ordered the fish and chips and the fish was pretty good too. Their tarter sauce was probably the second best part of both our meals. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Every time we come into town we have to stop and get their fish tacos.  The mango topping makes these divine!"}
{"text":"Finally, I'm here to try the famous fish tacos! Now after my first visit, I don't quite get why this place gets so much hype, and why my coworker is crazy about it!

6 of us stopped by for lunch around 11 and no wait! The line starts getting long around 11:30. We all ordered the fish or chiken taco mountain, quite pricy in my opinion, but the plate is huge! I guess they measured it by the amount of food. It really looked like a mountain, not in the nicest presentation, all the fish, veggies, sauce, and rice are mixed together, the fish, however, was very dry and flavor-less, i hate to say, the only thing I enjoyed was the mango salsa. I barely finished half of the plate and was so stuffed! 

The place does offer a cool decor where the tables are in the shape of surf boards, interior lighting is bright, a clean and simple setup. But for the food, sorry, I would rather pay less and get a burrito bowl from chipotle!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. We've been wanting to come in for such a long time and can't say how happy we were to finally do so.We both had the coconut shrimp which was fantastic. It comes with a pineapple chile dipping sauce that we we really liked. The service was great. Very friendly and helpful. We'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Really good food and fun atmosphere with the surfboard tables.  Everyone was super friendly.  After ordering at the counter, we sat down and enjoyed the tv videos of surfers.  Our food came out very quickly.  The fish tacos were fantastic, albeit a bit messy.   I would definitely order those again!  B/F had the fish and chips and he really liked those as well as the coconut slaw.  They also have nice beer.  I think it is a bit pricey for the casual atmosphere (I can see folks being more willing to pay those prices on vacation in Maui).  That being said, if it was a fancy atmosphere, folks would pay those prices all day long and think it was a steal as the quality is so good."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The chicken tacos are delicious and fresh and my kids love the fish tacos! The coleslaw on the tacos is a nice change from the usual, and I love the the mango salsa is fabulous.  Prices are fair and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great food! We had the fish taco plate and the local fish any style, blackened. Good size portions, fresh food, fantastic staff! Can't wait to try again! Think this would do really well in downtown Phx, near ASU and UA. Gotta space for you...."}
{"text":"Love this place but a few suggestions: provide silverware and napkins when food is delivered to the table - I am constantly getting up for things when I would prefer to sit and eat my lunch. Also, the fish tacos are delicious - I just wish there was the option to order just one. They are HUGE - how can a girl eat more than one?! It's not something that would heat up well, so I always end up throwing one away - so wasteful. Maybe $7.99/1 as an option to the regular price of $10.99/2 tacos.... Staff is always friendly, coconut shrimp is awesome. Seating looks cool, but not easy to get in/out of benches IMO. I hope this place stays around as the food is very good and great quality however some may be turned off by the fast-casual atmosphere with a sit-down full service price. (At least for lunch)"}
{"text":"Just a little background: This is a casual dining chain with a Hawaiian theme featuring fresh fish

It is simply feel good, delicious food. I ordered the 17 ingredient fish tacos and they were everything I expected. The guy who took my order was very attentive and explained to me how the tacos were made after I told him it was my first time eating at Coconut's. The rest of the staff were very friendly as well, asking me if everything was ok. The space is very clean and the employees were constantly picking up after patrons. But back to the food, the tacos aren't the most graceful dish to eat but every bite was full of flavor with tomatoes, mango, coconut milk, organic slaw, and more... They offer great portions at affordable prices. To make it even better they seem to be a restaurant that values sustainability. I left feeling light but completely satisfied. Price, quality, and convenience give this 5 stars and I'm a tough critic!"}
{"text":"Premium fish cooked perfectly. Shared the fish tacos, fish and chips, fish sandwich, coconut shrimp, and calamari. All were excellent. In a nondescript mall.  Interior is casual Hawaiian.

As mentioned elsewhere the tacos are huge, messy and delicious.  The slaw and mango were great. And the fish chunks were perfect and plentiful. 

The fried fish and chips are good but frankly the fish is too good for that preparation.  The fish sandwich is generous but the bun is too much for such good grilled fish.  Eat it open face or bun-less.  

The calamari are steaks rather than rings and are fantastic. The coconut shrimp are cooked perfect and tasty. 

All the fish and ingredients are top notch. And the price is roughly $11 for the entree and $8 for an appetizer. A bit pricey but well worth it.  A premium, express fish place may not be everyone's place, but it fits me and many a casual minded foodie perfectly."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Fish tacos were delicious... Felt like I was in Hawaii. Great venue for kids too! Wish they had more locations...."}
{"text":"Fresh fish tacos are quite large and a bit challenging to eat, while delicious! The fish and chips are delightful with less batter than other restaurants. The onion rings are out of this world! Local beer on tap! Can't beat this place. This will become a regular go-to for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"sooooo good. try the taco mountain. really happy this place is so close! The fish tacos are fantastic. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Soo amazing!  I love their fish tacos. .. the best ! If you are looking for fresh tasting flavorful food this is the place for you ! My new favorite place to eat"}
{"text":"Great service great food , next time we are in Scottsdale we will go back."}
{"text":"Really good fish tacos. The coconut shrimp was less than great though."}
{"text":"I love having this restaurant so close to my home. I've been there about 5 times now and really love it. As everyone else has said, the fish tacos are awesome. I am a fan of grilled fish and never order fried so it's nice to be served a fast food dish that is healthy and delicious at the same time. I also enjoyed their local style any fish plate. The Asian Flair is my favorite as it has a wasabi kick to it. It's served with brown rice and their coleslaw which is one of the best I've had and they make it with coconut milk instead of mayo. I tried the blackened the other night and it was way too salty for me and couldn't even eat it. They were nice enough to exchange it to plain grilled for me. I don't agree about the prices as you can't compare a fast food place like McDonalds to the quality of this food. I would like to see more appetizer choices that aren't fried and  a chowder that wasn't cream based. But I have to admit the calamari was yummy.
I'm off to Maui in June and looking forward to checking out the original Coconuts."}
{"text":"Lets get this out of the way, the service is the only reason this didnt get a one star. After having lived in coastal cities like Los Angeles and Seattle for 16+ years I can definitely say that based on reviews and people I have met in my 3 years in Phoenix, the people who live here do not know the meaning of fresh seafood. Scottsdale is full of old people, so combine that with the fact that these people here dont know what fresh seafood is, and you get a bunch of idiots thinking they're eating \"fresh fish\".

I had their fish tacos, dreadful. I had their \"calamari\", I wish I took a picture of it because what in the hell is the sad excuse of a dish that they call calamari at this place? They're more like chicken tenders rather than thinly sliced squid. The fish was cooked horrifically, it almost had the  texture of chicken. Lets put it this way, I bet the Maui branch of this place is 10x better than the one here in Arizona. On top of all of that because its in \"Scottsdale\" its over priced to shit. Honestly do not go here unless your palette is unable to discern between fresh and frozen. The calamari was the real killer for me, what a disgusting excuse of a dish and waste of money.

I realize to some this might sound pompous and like im trying to act like im better than anyone, but after having a strong craving for some fresh seafood and fish tacos, this place was a major disappointment. I know its arizona, I know its landlocked, but Del Taco does a better job with fish tacos than this place."}
{"text":"Although the food is really good at a great price, this is NOT what this review will be about. THERE are TOO MANY other RESTAURANTS out there with GREAT FOOD. The service, the attitudes of the servers and the manager at this location is appalling. My wife and I arrived at the counter at 8:30pm and were immediately told the restaurant closes at 9pm. I informed this extremely rude worker that 9pm was 30 minutes from then and he replied \"just need to let you know.\" I said we were going to sit on the patio anyway and he replied \"we have problems with people wanting to sit out there for 2 hours\". I'm thinking, Okay, well whatever... You know when that little voice says \"LEAVE!\" ,... well, yeah, I ignored it. Boy was I sorry I dd. As if this wasn't bad enough, it gets worse!!  The food finally came (normally I wouldn't have worried about it ... but we were on a time clock!!) I asked for an extra plate so my wife and I could share one of the dishes, it literally took the guy 5 minutes to get it to us. At 8:45 they start dumping the ice tea after we asked him to please save the one tea my wife drinks and wanted to get one to go. I had to go in to ask again if they could save the tea. I noticed this woman with a gallon jug filling it up with ice tea and I asked if they were going to put that out so we can get refills from it... She looked at me and stated NO! This was for an employee who wanted to take home ice tea. (side note: hope the employee is paying for it!!)  Right about this time a HUGE group of about 10 people walked in and wanted to eat and this guy tells them, we're closing. Sorry!... The group said, \"I thought you were open until 9pm?\" And he said, \"well it's almost that time now, Sorry!\" UNBELIEVABLE!! At 8:50 this same guy and girl come out onto the patio and start stacking chairs REALLY LOUDLY and it seemed quite obvious at this point that they wanted us to pack up our food and leave!! I looked at my wife and stated I am staying here until 9pm and I'm going to enjoy my food and ignore the RUDENESS of these employees. When they were done stacking chairs and bringing them into the restaurant this NASTY GUY comes up to us and looks at our food & says \"Oh, looks like you still have some food left\" and started to walk away. (It was 8:58pm)... at this point I took the opportunity to let this young man know how rude he was being. How his attitude, words and behavior has made us extremely uncomfortable and will definitely make us NOT want to come there any more. At that point the woman walks over to us and identifies herself as the manager (WHAT?? REALLY??!!!)... and says, \"the owner makes us clock out at 9:30pm or we get in big trouble so we have to make people leave by 9pm.\" I asked for the owners name or card as I want to speak with him about this ridiculous policy and it is basically running patrons off. She said he doesn't have a phone number, just an email address. And he's already received complaints about it, but doesn't care. I was shocked at this and want to leave a MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THE OWNER!! If this truly is your policy I say to you, there are literally THOUSANDS of other places to eat and HUNDREDS of new restaurants opening up and begging for business. Although I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN, you will continually & constantly lose customers with this negative and offensive attitude and behavior...  your employees will not only NOT be clocking out by 9:30... they won't be clocking out at all, as you've run everyone from your business and your doors will close just like the last 10 restaurants in that same location has done before you. GOOD RIDDANCE!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing but service is lacking. No food substitutions are available. If a paying customer wants to put Ahi tuna on a taco mountain then why not let them? You have all the required ingredients."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to find the little gem in Scottsdale. Love the coconut shrimp! I was craving it every day I was in town. Food and service exceptional."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the fish tacos based on the reviews. I was really disappointing. The fish and tortillas were over cooked, the tacos were overflowing with coleslaw and the chips with the fish and chips were cold and limp. Luckily Simone came by to ask how the meal was and when I told him, he gave me a $15 gift certificate"}
{"text":"I had read the reviews and just had to eat here. After noticing a few people say they were not full after the fish tacos I went in and ordered the fish tacos along with some sides. I definitely didn't need anything but the tacos. They were sooooo tasty and extremely filling. I highly recommend this restaurant. Only thing that could've been better is if I had actually been in Hawaii eating those tacos!!"}
{"text":"Great place!  The food is fresh, the service is pleasant, and it is clean.  We have had the shrimp (lightly battered on the pu-pu menu), chicken tacos, and the fish burger.  Everything was prepared as requested, presented in a very appetizing manner; the hot food was hot and the cold food was cold.

The combination of clean, true flavors, the cole slaw, and the fresh, fresh, fresh everything makes this place a favorite."}
{"text":"This place is really cool!!  The fish tacos 
were the best I ever had!!  The staff were very
nice!!  Amazing stuff!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is awesome! I always feel like i'm right at home in Hawai'i while dining here. Mahalo Coconuts. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"First time to Coconut's.  I was first impressed with how nice and clean the restaurant was. The staff was very informative and friendly.
I had the fish and chips.  Not enough fish but plenty of chips. The fish was kind of dry.
I Guess I should have gotten the fish tacos.
I wanted to give more stars but I left still feeling hungry.  They gave you a very small ramekin of coleslaw and it was OK.
I will try again and hope to give more stars but for the price and portion...just didn't work this time."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were excellent. The only thing I would change would be more mango. My friend got the local style with lemon butter and fresh veggies. Everything is fresh and yummy. A tad expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite fish tacos. I love mango, but not normally in salsa form or with other foods. But their mango slaw is perfect for the fish. These tacos are awesome. If I had one complaint, it's that you can't really eat them by hand and it's too hard to cut the tortilla up into bites on the plate. But I'd still be excited to go here always."}
{"text":"If you can't go to Maui for a fish taco, go to Coconuts! The order is two generously-sized grilled fish tacos. I expected the fish to be grilled, but the corn tortillas? Oh my! The tacos are grilled, just lightly browning the tortillas. Their coleslaw is fantastic! Not too sweet, with a lot of great crunch! That yummy coleslaw comes on the taco, along with tomato salsa, and mango salsa. As I said, the tacos are generous and I ate all the deliciousness out of the second taco, sadly leaving those toasty tortillas behind.

I will definitely be back. The food in and of itself would do that. But, the friendly staff makes it even better. As this was my first time, the cashier gave me several suggestions. But, I decided to start with those Zagat-rated Best fish tacos. But, there are several things on the menu to accommodate every fish lover's palate.

This is not a sit down and order restaurant. You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table. So, it's definitely a casual dining experience. At least twice I was asked by an employee how my meal was and if I needed anything while I ate on their good-sized outdoor patio.

What a find! Check it out! Unless you are lucky enough to be heading to Hawaii. On second thought, try the location in Maui, if that's the case!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely boring. Everything we ordered had almost the same boring sweet flavor.

Fish tacos: Salt pepper seasoned DRY DRY fish with tons of cabbage some mango and other fixings. Overall flavor was mild mayonnaise sweet. No pop of flavors or interesting flavor profile. Absolutely a waste of $11(or something like that). Seriously, I have had better tacos at Rubio's..they are not very fancy but they always hit the spot and have tons of flavor. Their salsa bar is absolutely fantastic as well and it costs much less. I don't know why people have given their fish tacos such good ratings. Tacos are HUGE though.

Fish Taco Mountain : Again the same sweet flavor profile and again very dry fish with tons of cabbage. Nothing interesting or worth the money. What a waste of money and Friday night appetite.

Would not go back for more disappointment.
Ordered a take out so cannot comment on the service. They would not prepare blackened or cajun fish for your taco or any taco related order. They are pretty firm on serving you their boring recipe."}
{"text":"Pros:
Clean
Tasty fresh food - not soggy and old 
Fast 
Wonderful flavors
Nice helpful staff

Cons:
The portions are a bit small. Some of us were still hungry after eating our meals.

We ordered the \"tower\" - its like the fish tacos but with brown rice instead of the tortillas we also ordered several of the fish tacos orders."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are good, huge. Big enough to make them hard to eat. 
Kids fish and chips was average.
Cesar salad was huge but not great."}
{"text":"Really fresh, yummy food. Seafood was well prepared and staff was very nice. A welcome addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Great food, super dope atmosphere & friendly staff!!! Hang loose Scottsdale !!!!"}
{"text":"Please don't order fish & chips -  it looked and tasted awful. Fish should be served with a crunchy batter & not dark brown cornmeal over cooked mrs paul fillets.

Stick with the tacos. 

Why the big deal when you ask for one fish and one steak taco I was told no mixing? You must order two of the same. The tacos are served individually on two separate plates. Still haven't figured that one out - that was a negative."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding choice for a great fish meal. The waiters were friendly and very helpful. I am a disabled vet. in an electric wheelchair, the waiter went out of his way to clear out a large place for me to park and eat. The fish was fresh nicely cooked and served with courtesy."}
{"text":"I loved this place in Maui and I love it just as much here in Arizona! The coconut shrimp and the fish tacos are some of my favorites. The customer service is great and everyone is always incredibly friendly. Definitely one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet- we've been here twice within a week and a half. Great fish tacos!! I will definitely be back for a third, fourth and fifth time. Also, customer service has been excellent. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The quality of the fish is excellent and I enjoy the casual atmosphere and friendly service. The price point is a little high, especially with the kids menu. I also wish they had a flour tortilla option. But the food is good and fresh with a lot of great options!"}
{"text":"Y.U.M.  Their fish burger is so good that I can never talk myself into trying their other menu items.  The fresh wheat bun is delish, the fish has always been cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Plus, it's a huge sandwich, so I never have to get the side of fries to be filled up.  I was hesitant to try the fish burger because I love good, regular burgers so much, but this fish burger, makes the rest run for their money.  

As for their other menu items, my friend always gets the fish tacos, and loves those so much she can't talk herself into trying anything else. So, I guess those are pretty good also.

The price is slightly higher than what one will usually pay for a work-day lunch, but it is for QUALITY, delicious food!"}
{"text":"I had lunch and dinner here on two different days. This place reminds me a lot of Rubios. The fishburger was all right, but dinner was very disappointing. The tacos and taco mountain had some white fish which was very dry and the fixings seemed to be loads of cabbage in mayo. The chicken burger turned out to be terrible, cold and dry. Overall decor is nice, food is a bit pricey and meh"}
{"text":"This is one of my chandler favorites. The fish tacos are some of the best around and the fries are really tasty. Unfortunately they put some type of seasoning on the French fries that makes it next to impossible for me to stop eating them. The fish tacos always taste extremely fresh. If you're looking for a healthy, quick, tasty joint give this spot a try."}
{"text":"The fish taco salad tasted ok but with a fountain drink my bill came to $15.10 and I was still hungry."}
{"text":"First tried Coconuts in Maui, Hawaii. Absolute best fish tacos we've ever had. My daughter and husband raved over the fish and chips, and the Ahi burger. My middle daughter fell in love with the shrimp and chips. Over all, best fish cafe on the island. I'm sure the Coconuts in Scottsdale is just as fantastic."}
{"text":"The BEST fried shrimp I have had in over a decade! Great food, friendly staff, and no microwave!  Wife and I went here for the first time, we had the Coconut shrimp, and the lightly breaded shrimp. We've been to restaurants that charged 4 times the price, and the quality was less than half. Shrimp tasted great! Crispy, and not covered in a ton of batter. The employees were helpful, and very friendly. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fish tacos are light and yet very filling. Staff was very accommodating and answered all of our questions. If you're a local then lucky you. If you're visiting Scottsdale stop in...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just gonna start with WOW...started with coconut shrimp can't pass on a 25% discount Check-in offer. The Fish tacos, the fish & chips & wait for it the icing was the Poke-bowl that's when the grand slam happened... Gonna be go back 4 sure"}
{"text":"The family has a ton of allergies and they were super accommodating, checked every ingredient, and were willing to customize the dish!  The staff here was fantastic and the food was delightful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, cute atmosphere, and delicious coconut shrimp! Can't wait to come back and try more!!"}
{"text":"Good food, i'll be heading back to try a few other options but the tacos were ok, not spectacular.  The salsa was good but not explosive on my buds."}
{"text":"New to the area and decided to take a break from unpacking and grab a bite to eat with the family. All we can say is that we have found our favorite new place. We tried the coconut shrimp and calamari appetizers and then the fish tacos came out. We loved the Hawaiian d√©cor and the surfboard  tables were really fun.  Tacos are layered with fresh toppings and if we could take a jar of the mango salsa to go we sure would have!  Highly recommend.   We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've tasted. Not to mention the amount of food added to the tacos is enough for two people. Sheesh! :-) Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Coconuts is so unique ! I enjoy going there not just because of the incredible food , the service is amazing . The fish burgers are cooked absolutely perfect , the french fries are thin and crispy  , the coconut shrimp is fabulous , the taco mountain is delicious , and the fish and chips are spot on! The fish is incredibly fresh . I highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos! Being from Maui and trying them all over the islands , I was very impressed! Clean open atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place and decided to check it out.  My wife and I ate there for lunch today and were very impressed.  The atmosphere is very nice.  Great surfboard tables.  Hawaiian beer on tap.  Nice.  Since we hadn't been here before we had no idea about the serving size.  I ordered the two tacos and my wife ordered the fish burger (sandwich).  The tacos were so big that we could have split them and been fine.  The tacos were the best fish tacos I've ever eaten and the fish sandwich was fantastic.  The seasonings and ingredients were all spot on.  The owner delivered our food and decided to talk with us for awhile.  The staff was very friendly.  We'll have to try more of the menu next time but what we had was excellent.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Steven took our order and was so friendly! Great menu; excellent service. CLEAN as we knew it would be. We had fish and chips, and shrimp and all were fantastic.  Two regulars came in while we dined and to hear Steven greet them \"Mary!\" how are you?  was so nice and folksy. This place will do well because of a very good chef; hot fresh food, and a great staff of servers and clean-up crew.  Steven is expert at making everyone feel welcome and special.
We are return customers many times in Maui - so good to see the mainland staff getting the gist of the \"aloha\" feel!"}
{"text":"Two words: TACO MOUNTAIN

I've been here several times and never been disappointed. Fresh fish, delicious mango salsa and the best coleslaw I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight and I will definitely recommend it to my friends. Very fresh food, bursting with flavor, nice menu items...will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love Coconut's! Some things on the menu are better than others, but it is a wonderful place, especially for take out, and it is very consistent! My favorite is the mahi on a salad or rice as well as the fish tacos, they never disappoint! 

If you are looking for a new place for fresh fish to go, give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food here. We usually get the mahi-mahi butter, salt, and pepper, or sometimes I go for blackened. We're there once a week and the food never disappoints. The only complaint we have is that we constantly have to swat away flies while we're eating. The sliding glass door is always open when we're there. We've tried taking the food home instead, but we live far enough away that it's cold by the time we get there. I don't want to stop coming here, but at some point it just won't be worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"A good friend suggested we meet to eat...we did and we have been back many times.  The food is always great, fresh and promptly served in a casual atmosphere, but what makes it great if the highly positive attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice.  First time I ordered mahi mahi with brown rice and cole slaw and it was good, pricy but good.  Second time I decided to get sea food soup and boy what a disappointment.  Almost $11 for very small portion, hardly two small pieces of fish and salty.  I was really disappointed, first impression was good but second impression killed it.  Stay away from soup and try something different."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Coconut's, but I didn't try it until I was really hungry after unpacking for two days straight. The fish tacos were highly recommended by the enthusiastic former Californian who worked there, but I found them to be just alright.

Messy and packed, they were fresh, but not particularly flavorful. The fried shrimp basket was also recommended, so on the second visit, I tried it. Again, OK. 

But I also got the seafood soup -- now that was some good stuff. Creamy, hot, chock full of vegetables and fish -- YUM! I'll go back again to try the fish burgers and salads. It's so close; it's always clean and packed and it's healthy eating."}
{"text":"Throughly amazed with the quality of the fish! I have not had fish this fresh since being on the shore- a must try if you love quick, tasty island food. Try the blackened Mahi Fishburger! The staff are all incredibly friendly and passionate about their food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and I've always gotten the fish tacos - they are really to die for. Nobody in town can compete with their tacos. Always fresh and always very tasty. Beware if you are a big eater though as the 2 tacos will come short in filling you up and if you start ordering appetizers and drinks, it can get pricey. I'm not a big eater and the 2 tacos are just right for me, so I can't complain, but others I have talked to have mentioned this. 

The service is always pleasant and upbeat and the food comes out pretty quick. There is good parking and the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and fresh!   Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got married in Maui, so we definitely have a nostalgia for Hawaiian food!! It's difficult because I've been a vegetarian my entire adult life and my husband doesn't cook all that much, so sadly good food doesn't often come from our kitchen! We were both so excited when they opened a Coconut's in Chandler. We had been to the Scottsdale location, but both work more east. We often meet there for dinner, date nights, even a quick lunch. I always get the veggie tacos, and I don't know which of the 17+ ingredients (maybe it's them all)  
 that makes them so wonderful, but I'm thankful for every single one! Also who doesn't like eating that much flavor with their hands!! My husband typically goes between Taco Mountain, fish tacos, or the fish and chips. 

Icing on the cake is the staff is so beyond friendly, we love Marisa and appreciate her and the rest of their teams service. The place is always clean and the beer is always cold! Needless to say we'll be back...probably this week. :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I did not feel that this restaurant met up with the reviews.  I found the fish tacos average.  I would not order them again.  The restaurant is small, order at the counter and find a table.  I felt it was expensive for the food and the atmosphere.  However, if you like Hawaii, it does have a nice Hawaiian vibe."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. Staff was very helpful and attentive. The fish tacos were amazing. Eddie  rang us up and brought out our food.  He had a passion for the food and made sure everything was perfect.  This place is a must if you are scottsdale."}
{"text":"The fish was very fresh and wonderfully prepared - perfect amount of spices and seasonings.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Known for their fish tacos, there were no questions what we were getting when we arrived to Coconut's. Set up cafeteria style, we ordered coconut shrimps, house salad with mango dressing and the fish tacos (mahi mahi tuna & ono as recommended by the cashier) and headed out to their patio to wait for our food.

The d√©cor here is fun and cute, the tables are wooden surfboards and there are tiki torches and strung up tropical deck lights.

The coconut shrimps were really good, battered in shredded coconut and deep fried, served with sweet chilli sauce. The tacos lived up to their fame, the fresh salsa gave it an added plus. The fish had more of a chicken texture (and taste almost!) which was enjoyed by my girlfriend who's not a huge fish fan.

I'd definitely have to agree with the claim that Coconut Fish Caf√© does have \"the perfect fish tacos\"!"}
{"text":"We always have to get our Fish Taco's at Coconut's when we are in Scottsdale!  Never disappointing!  Everything is so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Surprised how good and large the portions are. Thought it was pricey at the order counter them I saw the portion sizes.
My wife had two fish tacos with Mahi and Ono I had the fish burger with Ono.
We just returned from Kauai and my IMO was a $32.00 meal on the island!
We have not been to their restaurant in Kihei before now I suppose we will on our next visit to Maui.
Good job and glad to see you in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a great place for some refreshing fish! Blackened Mahi-mahi with Tiger Sauce is there best! I love everything here! Service is great!"}
{"text":"Do you love fish tacos?  Then this is the place for you! A ray of sunshine has come to the Valley, straight from the shores of Maui! 

Although my husband chows down on just about everything, I have to admit, without some prodding from me, he rarely raves about anything, and he had plenty to say about his fish tacos yesterday . . . He knew what he wanted when he walked in the door.  He had no idea he was going to get two plates with one taco each -- one mahi mahi and one ono -- both piled high with juicy fresh fish and 17 secret ingredients most noticeably the mango salsa and coconut slaw which are Hawaiian island sweet and tangy.  Both fishes were equally delicious!

I had the fish and chips, a heaping serving of ono and mahi mahi, lightly fried. It came with a mound of perfectly cooked skinny fries, enough for three people to share! It also came with a small side of slaw. I love this slaw -- sweet from the coconut milk with a hint (and I do mean the smallest amount) of heat from wasabi. Oh so delectable! Heaven! 

I have a long list of must-tries including any one of the local fish cooking styles, and the chowder which is New England style with mahi-mahi and ono. Gluten free items are abundant, too.

The restaurant itself is on the small side, and it's order at the counter, get your number, server comes out when it's ready. Benches and tables imitate surfboards. The patio is the place to be if the weather is nice . . . much more quiet. They play island music to add to the ambiance. The owner Kim was on-site and we had a really nice chat with him about his plans for the Valley. We're so glad they picked North Scottsdale for the first location. 

Love, love, love Coconut's . . . it's just missing one thing and it would be perfect . . . the beach!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos and companion had a fish burger. We shared the coconut shrimp appetizer which was very good, the sauce served with it has a nice little red pepper kick to it. The fish tacos were enormous, had we known, we could have split the entree. (Splitting entrees might be a good option for those on a budget since it is a little pricey, and the entrees are sufficient for two meals) I ended up using a fork to eat them as the slaw sauce was very runny and made quite a mess. Having said that though, they were absolutely delicious! Fish was grilled perfectly, and the taco toppings were tasty. Companion raved over the fish burger. Ambiance is casual, bench seating at modified \"surfboard\" tables. Staff was very friendly and helpful with the ordering - a nice aspect since it was our first time. Will definitely go again, and look forward to trying the original one on Maui."}
{"text":"Water is great!! Perfectly cooled and nicely filtered. The fish on the other hand was dry and way over seasoned. And they don't have a option to order double meat made me pay for another meal."}
{"text":"We overheard a very good recommendation. Told the staff this was our first time here. He recommended fish tacos which were excellent. The seafood chowder was good, also. Staff was very helpful and attentive, even to the outside diners. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I love the fish tacos fish burger blackened is my all-time favorite"}
{"text":"This place is great fish tacos the Fish burger blackened out of this world!"}
{"text":"This review is 3 words: awesome, awesome, awesome.  

Awesome food.  Awesome service.  Awesome value.  

No negatives from our family.  Fish is amazing.  Our son will not eat fish, just hot dogs (he's 8 going on 4).  But their hot dogs are amazing too.  Nothing on their menu is short of excellent and I've had almost everything on it."}
{"text":"Tried this place after finding a coupon in the Inside Coup mailer.  The staff is very friendly and you can tell like to work there.  Atmosphere is nice and casual with that on-the-beach surfer stop.  Family style seating in the middle of the room and picnic benches along the wall.  Big screen TV that has surfer interviews that include that surfers styles.  No sound on.  It's a surfer restaurant and watching the guys surf is relaxing.

Kind of a fast food style place -  order at the counter, get your own drink, get your own plastic forks, knives, napkins, condiments.

Ordered the Maui Maui.  For $10.99 you get a 5x5 filet of fish on top of brown rice with a small cup of coleslaw.  My dining partner had shrimp and chips for $11.99.  6 jumbo shrimp on fries with a small cup of coleslaw.  She said the shrimp was good.

Amount of coleslaw was about 3 fork stabs worth.  The coleslaw seemed to be some chopped up iceberg lettuce with light dressing.  Couldn't really tell since there wasn't enough to tell.  Enough fries for 2 people.

The food is okay.  I've had much better Maui Maui at non-seafood restaurants.  

For two 'dinners' and one drink the total came to $25.  Terribly overpriced for the amount of food, you're not sitting down being served, and the fact that the food isn't all that special.  Maybe if the recipes were something to write home about.  

This overprice cafe (fast food restaurant) isn't something I would go out of my way to return to.  I would rather rate this a 2.5 star."}
{"text":"Yum! Fresh wonderful tacos, clean welcoming environment with Hawaiian theme. Great service, friendly staff. What else could I ask for....except - Can you put one in Tualatin Oregon?"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Coconuts?  I love the Fish Tacos. They are the best I have found in town. I would consider myself a \"Fish Taco Connoisseur\" and visit as many fish taco wielding establishments as possible. 

At Coconuts the staff rocks....the restaurant is always clean and the food NEVER fails. This a go-to for me and I share it with all my buddies. 

A great call for sure."}
{"text":"Living in the desert have been apprehensive to eat seafood buy OH MY! This seafood is so good! You know it's fresh cause it doesn't taste or smell fishy at all! Best fish tacos hands down! Literal hands down! Tacos are so full with fish and slaw that you have to eat with a fork! The pasta with fish is also AMAZING! It comes with shrimp, mahi & ohno; I'm allergic to shellfish and they made mine without the shrimp and it was loaded with fish in Alfredo sauce and big piece of garlic cheesy bread....oh my it was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Second time we went to this restaurant and will definitely return soon. We had the fish & chips and the fish tacos. Both were delicious, I especially liked the sides that came with my fish & chips. Unfortunately the fries were a little bit too cold. The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Having been born in Hawaii, I'm always excited to try new places with Hawaiian roots. Coconut's Fish Cafe is a pretty unassuming little restaurant, nestled on the corner of a small strip mall. While the decor is a little kitschy, with the surfboard-shaped tables and lime green walls, all is forgiven when the food comes out.
 
Their fish tacos are moist and flavorful, and the servings are huge. They're not your typical street tacos with more tortilla than filling. The first time I ordered them, the server brought out one taco, and I thought I'd have a hard time finishing it. Then out came the second and I couldn't believe it was also for me.
 
I've also tried their coconut shrimp, which were cooked nicely and were not too thickly battered. Their seafood chowder is tasty as well, not too fishy or salty. The hubby (non-seafood eater) likes their steak and chicken tacos, which are just as large as their fish counterpart.
 
The calamari is a little different than usual, as they are long, thick strips (kinda like thick-cut fries). They are very good, though, and feels like more \"bang for your buck\" since it results in more calamari, less batter."}
{"text":"Was I. disappointed.  After the rave reviews, I was not prepared for the mediocre food.  The fish was over cooked and close to burnt.  The fries were greasy and soggy.  The meals are way over priced,
especially since you basically wait on yourself.  They even scrimp on the self serve drinks by providing small cups."}
{"text":"Had the Fish tacos, the fish n chips, and the Coconut shrimp app.  Fish tacos - great! Fish n Chips - average.  Coconut shrimp - good.  Nice atmosphere, but a bit pricey for what you get.  Would definitely recommend the fish tacos...one of the best I've had.  All in all, a good place to eat good fish tacos and Coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Caf√© is rated as one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. With two locations, one at Bell Road (FLW) and Scottsdale Roads and the other at Scottsdale Road and Shea.  Their North Scottsdale location is walking distance from my office, usually eat there twice a month.  Food is delicious and the staff is awesome! 
   
Small simple menu that you will not be disappointed from.  Their fish tacos are so tasty, and are the perfect fish taco!  You can also order the Taco Mountain, (truly piled high as a mountain) is their fish taco severed over brown rice.   The Local Style Any Fish (Ono or Mahi Mahi) served over brown rice and their famous coleslaw (you can substitute fresh steamed veggies for $1 more).  Their portions are so big that I usually have enough left over for dinner!! 
  
The other day I tried their Seafood Chowder soup for the first time, oh my gosh, each bite was so delicious! The soup is New England base with BIG chunks of Ono, Mahi Mahi and Clams!  

YOU GO THERE ONCE, BE THERE TWICE!"}
{"text":"Healthy, Different, Fresh ingredients, \"Sustainable\" atmosphere, Eco-friendly. Best item on the Menu is the Taco Island... Think Fish Taco with 17 ingredients on a bed of brown rice instead of a tortilla.  Oh it's good to try the other items on the menu, but this one you'll come back to"}
{"text":"Precious Emma just made our meal delightful with her lovely energy & light! The coleslaw was yummy too!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos tonight! The tortillas were fresh and just the perfect amount of crispy, the coconut milk cole slaw and fresh mango salsa - yum!! 

I don't know what it is about the French fries but they really are the best fries ever, I could eat a basket no problem (I order the side just to ensure this doesn't happen).  

The staff are so friendly, always helpful and prompt. The decor is too fun! Love the murals and woodwork - everything was done to perfection."}
{"text":"Wow! I loved this place. The fish is awesome, we had the Mahi Cajun style over rice and the fish tacos - both were delicious. If you're looking for a great meal without the giant bill at the end, then look no further. 

Plus the staff are great - Adam the manager was really nice, he came by to make sure that everything was great and Marissa (I think) was really friendly and explained everything on the menu to is very patiently. Overall great experience, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Another great Coconuts experience! The mural in this store is gorgeous and goes great with the rest of the decor. 

I had the veggie tacos with south of the border - always the best!! Our table had the ahi poke and said it was amazing. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mahi Mahi fish tacos! If you are up for a quick snack or lunch, this is the spot! Reviews are true- flavorful fish tacos. Wish we have same in NYC."}
{"text":"Cute little spot. I wouldn't come here for a lunch date, but with friends it's great. 

Had  the fish tacos a+

Nice I door seating, and also some outdoor seating. 

Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great coconut shrimp and the sauce is amazing. The fries were good too. A lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was good not amazing but would definitely return!!  Had the coconut shrimp.  FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are delicious! A unique flavor. Ambience is very fun, feels like you might be in Hawaii. Kids menu could be more diverse."}
{"text":"Coconut's is one of my favorite places to eat. The service is great and the food is even better. Their fish tacos are AMAZING, hands down my favorite item on their menu."}
{"text":"I pass this place everyday and have always wanted to try it. Stopped in and it was awesome!!! The blackened Ono Burger was bomb!! Also had the Taco Mountain and Coconut Shrimp and they were outstanding too! Definitely going to be a regular spot now."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great FRIENDLY SERVICE.  In fact the people are always working.  They are making sure the guest are treated right.  KIM and ADAM are great.  Tons of food.  I would have never guessed in a million years a little place like this would work but it does and very well at that."}
{"text":"Very few places are as consistent as COCONUTS.  The location at Scottsdale and Shea is just as good as their original location.  My favorite is the CHICKEN TACO MOUNTAIN.  The fish is awesome too"}
{"text":"I now have another Fish Taco Place to frequent! I got the two fish tacos and the seafood chowder. The fish was fantastic with all the spices and fresh goodness like the mango salsa and coconut slaw. I loved the seafood chowder, it came out piping hot and stayed that way the whole time. Plus, they had a great selection of beers. The staff was friendly and service was fast. I saw some reviews on here whining about price, but I found it very reasonable for the quality of the product. This is now a go-to place for me when I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. They have this location in Chandler and 2 in Scottsdale. The fish tacos are fantastic and the seafood chowder is amazing. The \"local style over rice\" is also very good. Not cheap, but high quality and healthy food. Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Was really surprised at how good this place was, as I was expecting more of a taco shop. They took over the former Sushi Brokers property and have done a nice job giving it an island feel. The outside dining helps with that also. I had the taco mountain which was very flavorful. Took advantage of the appetizer discount on yelp and enjoyed the coconut shrimp. The only downfall is it's a little pricey for what you get, but that's expected in that location of town. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Very tasty fish taco with great flavors and a nice Hawaiian flare. It was a nice treat with a friend."}
{"text":"Like many others we thought the fish tacos were outstanding. I was expecting a little more than fast casual but the food was of a white tablecloth restaurant quality at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Just ate there today based on yelp reviews....did not disappoint !! The environment was light, bright, fun, Hawaiian. The service was friendly, efficient, engaging. The food was excellent, well presented, rememberable. The price was very reasonable ( would have been twice the price in the islands). Overall I'd give it 6 starts if possible...a very positive experience which will be repeated whenever I am in town. Everything about it was a +. Very much recommended...they deserve it."}
{"text":"Wow! FUN and yummy! Cool vibe, surf boards as furniture!! Staff were awesome and the fish tacos were the BEST! Really reasonable pricing too!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and found this gem of a place! Amazing food, as my group and I had ordered a majority of the items on the menu and enjoyed it immensely! Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great vegetarian options, good atmosphere and friendly staff. Ahi Poke was great as well!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and great customer service. Was better than expected and when can you say that anymore. Keep it going don't become satisfied."}
{"text":"5 stars for the clean and cute decor 
5 stars for the friendly service 
5 stars for the delicious fish!!!

Taco Mountain= very tasty and filling 
Grilled Cajun Mahi \"local style\"= delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. DANG TASTY! Coconut shrimp, fish tacos, taco mountain, fish & chips and ahi poke salad.  All four of us rated the food 5 stars. Excellent service; clean and nice draft beer. Can't miss!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and Hawaiian atmosphere. We ordered the fish tacos and fish and chips and 1 ice tea. Total was $26. I think that was a little pricey. My husband enjoyed his fish, which looked well seasoned. Kudos on the tartar sauce. The taco had a lot going on! The fish was good and I liked the mango salsa. I typically like coleslaw but this one tasted like it had horseradish in it. Next time I would just order the tacos with fish, cheese and the mango salsa."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner. Staff was super friendly!! We ordered the fish tacos, fish and chips and kid pasta, sauce on the side. They brought us a second plate for the kids meals since our two were sharing, without us asking. Food was delicious, prices were a bit higher, but as expected for a quality meal. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Service was great!  Food was even better!  Definitely going back with the family next time.  Maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"not bad, but not even close to the mouth watering goodness we had in London :( And I mean fish n chips! Its pricey, although most fish n chips places are, and this is in an upscale neighborhood. I am yet to find a good f n c place in town."}
{"text":"The grilled Mahi Mahi was very good. We will be back. Although its a walkup to the counter kind of place for ordering, that takes nothing away from the  good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos.  Everything is fresh and flavorful.  The fish tacos have a ton of ingredients including fresh fruit.  The fish is grilled and it all just comes together in this little magical taco. There's nothing else to say really.  Go here, eat tacos, the end."}
{"text":"Just had the BEST seafood chowder I can remember!!!  It was my husbands order (he's the chowder hound) but it was so delicious I couldn't stay out of it.  I whole heartedly recommend this dish!"}
{"text":"Nice fish taco joint at Scottsdale Road and Bell.  Great grilled fish tacos with a cold beer.  Food was great and the employees were very nice.   Very clean and cute decor makes for a nice setting to have a cold beer and some fish tacos."}
{"text":"They specialize in fish tacos, and I can honestly say they are the best I have ever had!! They are pricey but you get what you pay for here. I do agree with other reviews about the lack of side orders. It would nice to have something not fried, like some black beans!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Food was delicious and the staff was awesome! I look forward to coming here again. I hope others enjoy it as much as I did. The staff was so friendly and patient! Good attitudes are rare these days! Please please, keep up the good work!!! :)"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. We tried the fish tacos, the coconut shrimp, the fish and chips and lastly, taro chips. My wife and I took out and the food was ready quickly and boy did we devour it just as fast. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was our second and last visit. Our fish and chips was overcooked, overpriced and tasteless.  McDonald's has better French Fries, and the Cole Slaw was less than memorable.  However, our craving for Mac and Cheese was quickly put to an end by the $3.25 price for cold Kraft Mac and Cheese that was really disappointing!"}
{"text":"My family tried this place because of the raving reviews on yelp.  I hate to say this, but we were all very underwhelmed.  We ordered several different dishes to taste:  fish tacos, fish burger, fish garden salad, calamari, coconut shrimp and the kids chicken teriyaki for my youngest.  

The fish tacos were good, but no big deal. Why so much coleslaw (which didn't taste like much, and was diced waaaay too big).  The fish burger was very dry, and the salad a bit bland.  The calamari and coconut shrimp were pretty good, but nothing to return for.  And...the chicken teriyaki was so bland and dry that even my young daughter didn't like it."}
{"text":"This great place never disappoints!! Service and the super kind staff make it feel like you are at the beach with your friends!!!   THE BEST Coconut Shrimp on the planet! The Fish Tacos are extremely generous (not a tiny tapas deal)!  Always fun happy environment with great food brings us back time & time again!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! I can't believe we hadn't tried it sooner.  The fish is fantastic and amazingly fresh.  We started with the Ahi Poke appetizer which was delicious and comes with their house made taro chips. As soon as we tasted it, we knew they were telling the truth about the freshness of the fish.  I then had the Ono prepared with lemon butter and it was also amazing.  They serve beer and wine, even though it is a casual environment where you order at the counter and then they bring out your food and drinks.  My husband had the fish taco's and he was equally as impressed.  They also have a kids menu with non fish items which works well for us. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came to Coconuts for the first time a few weeks ago through the recomendation of a friend. She was ranting and raving over their fish tacos and coconut shrimp. 

Well, I finally ventured to try out these \"amazing\" fish tacos and coconut shrimp. The fish tacos are just ok, nothing special.

I went in a second time (a week later) and tried the fish burger sandwich by the recomendation of the staff. I had the Mahi-Mahi and all I will say is... perfection! The local is also my favorite."}
{"text":"We found Coconuts in Maui and fell in love.  The owner is very personable and told us they were opening up in Scottsdale.  We love the way the fish tacos are made and the mango salsa is very good.  The coconut shrimp is really good too!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went to coconuts with my family of 5. We are fish lovers.The fish tacos are good but most everything else ordered was either greasy bland or simply not made from scratch as advertised. Most importantly everything is overpriced. We spent $80 for greasy soggy fish & chips. Calamari that doesn't include the tentacles chowder from a can and cabbage salad that my 7 yr old said tasted like nothing. My son who'll eat anything found the steak in the tacos was  pre cooked & too spicy but the best quote belongs to my elder daughter who says \" the best thing about the place is the soda machine\""}
{"text":"Great experience.  Fish Tacos are worth high praise.  Made to order, while you wait so
they are fresh and piping hot.  Great take out service.  Staff was eager to answer any questions and helped me to place just the right order.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny. The Poke was out of this world and the husband and wife staff remembered my friend's previous order. $20 per person for an appetizer and entree, but the fish was SO fresh and the texture made it taste like we were actually in Maui. Can't wait to come back here, especially for the Poke!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could! Love the people and the atmosphere! Best Cesar salad and fries around!"}
{"text":"We eat here so often we feel like family! Lol good food, good crew!  Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good the soup was not tasty. i will say, the place does have an island feel even the high prices are genuine to HI"}
{"text":"First time here - loved it! There wasn't a table available but the table turnover seemed somewhat fast so after waiting at the bar (bar TABLE, not bar DRINKS) we got one before our food was brought out. 

The employees know their stuff. They educate you, share info, and make the experience a good one. They really get an A+++ on their customer service & outstanding training & attitudes. 

The food was YUM. Loved it! I wasn't stuffed but I was incredibly satisfied...and guilt free! 

This place is small, yet they get the job done. There's extended seating outside which is great but not until our 110 days are done. Meanwhile the petite inside offers adorable wooden tables that resemble surfboards & a nice bar to sit at as well."}
{"text":"I had the mahi mahi fish and chips with coconut pineapple iced tea. Good food and good atmosphere. Hopefully I'll get to come back soon. Thank you Bailey K for the great customer service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant looking for dinner tonight and what a fitting way to kick-start our upcoming HI trip! My fianc√© said it originated in Maui so I was very eager to get a taste of it.

Mr. Sunajo got the fish tacos and I got the Ono burger prepared \"South of the Border\" (Spicy Hot) style. Both were SO VERY good! The burger was juicy and flavorful; a hint of spiciness countered by the sweetness of the coleslaw and all were stacked on a soft, chewy sesame bun. The tacos came in twos and were massive! They were also very juicy and laced with all sorts of flavors topped with a mango salsa and their famous coleslaw. 

Although I didn't think the coleslaw was anything special, the Mr. said his tacos were the best damn tacos he's ever had and this is coming from a man born and raised in HI! Can't wait to bring our friends here!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos, great beers, and above all awesome customer service! Highly recommend. You really can't beat fish tacos and cold beer on a hot AZ day."}
{"text":"Living in a place that has tons of sand and no ocean...it is nice to find somewhere that you can escape and feel like you're at the beach. The surfing videos playing on the TV's trick you into thinking that you are looking out a window with an ocean view.

Fish tacos are what I always order. They are huge!! I forget that I only need one but they are so delicious I have now problem eating both. Price might seem high but they are made with quality fish that is grilled perfectly!

If you haven't been you should!! It is like a little mini lunch vacation!!"}
{"text":"I lived in the area for 6 years and always wanted to try this place. After moving to CA, I visit often staying at the Hampton Inn that is literally 50 yards away from this little gem. Visiting for Labor Day weekend, for the first time ever I walked over. Now, I have been to Coconuts 3 times this weekend alone. Everything has been great! Poke bowl - delicious, a little heavy on condiments, but poke is awesome! Coconut shrimp - delicious and love the dipping sauce. Kids quesadilla - order even when there are no kids in our party! You can choose to eat healthy or go for the fried, either way you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and the taco mountain is definitely worth the try! Their Maui beers are also so tasty!"}
{"text":"Looking for a kid-friendly restaurant on vacation and Coconuts was on the list. I quickly checked to see if it was the same Coconuts I grew to love in Maui a couple years back and discovered it was. Drove there and it was everything I remembered. I had grilled fish over rice and husband had fish tacos and we split both. So delicious. So fresh. Can't wait to have it again soon! If you've not had it, try it!!"}
{"text":"My friends had tried this place and always talked about how great and fresh the food tasted, so I had to try it out. IT IS AMAZING! You have to get the taco mountain. It is delicious. Also, the popcorn shrimp was tasty as well. If you are in the area you definitely need to try it out."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I have ever had... the kids spaghetti is really good as is the kids grilled chicken. The coconut shrimp is also delicious and they have beer in tap!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The fish tacos and ahi poke bowl are incredible and very generous portions. Fresh ingredients, Good vibes, good service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, food is delicious and well prepared, and doesn't break the bank.  The manager is a class act too!"}
{"text":"Went to Coconuts for the first time and we really enjoyed it.  Had the fish and chips--very good.  Used to cod, but the mahi mahi was a great change.  We will be back to try something new.  Edgar at the register has a great personality and was very personable and helpful with the menu!! All restaurants need personalities like his to go along with good food.  Will go again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, you cannot find better fish tacos ANYWHERE. We discovered Coconuts in Maui, and loved it. But we thought the charm of Maui might have jaded our experience. When we saw that they'd opened one in Chandler, we couldn't believe it! So we gave it a try. Simply put, they nailed it. From the amazingly delicious tacos to the Aloha attitude, it was perfection."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh! If you are in the mood for fish tacos, this is the place to head. I had the Taco Mountain, all the same ingredients as the fish tacos, but served over brown rice - couldn't stop until it was all gone, left stuffed. Three others ordered the fish tacos and they loved it too. One ordered a cup of the chowder and said he really liked it.

Tacos are served with a mango salsa, but there is a bit of a bite which adds to the taco taste. Will definitely return. It is a casual restaurant where you order and sit down, staff brings your food. Very friendly and clean. Went on a Friday after work, it was busy, but there was enough seating, easy in, easy out. Average order $10."}
{"text":"This concept got me hooked the very first time I had it in Scottsdale a while back.  These are truly THE BEST FISH and STEAK TACOS I have ever had.  Fresh ingredients, balanced flavors and great menu.  The design inside is super comfortable.  I recently dined at the Chandler location and had a WOW experience.  This restaurant was clean, service was on point, food was delicious and the manager (Bailey) introduced himself to us and made us feel right at home.  Over the top experience!  Thank you Coconuts Chandler - you did NOT disappoint!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The food was fresh and I thought that the mango on tacos was a fresh touch. One thing I would nix is the cheese in fish tacos- it's not bad, just unnecessary. The coconut shrimp is not to be missed, it's delicious! The prices are fair- I can make 2 tacos from one and it fills you up. Clean establishment and good customer service, I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Overpriced for an order at counter place. No option to get a single fish taco. Staff great but feels like a cafeteria."}
{"text":"While vacationing in Scottsdale, AZ, we dropped in within an hour of closing time last Friday evening,and my husband and I were treated like a king and a queen. Did I mention the food was delicious, also? Fun, authentic Hawaiian surfing atmosphere - we especially loved the coconut shrimp appetizer and their special recipe seafood chowder. We took a menu back to our casita, and ordered four adult meals and two children's entr√©es the next night to take out, which were prepared exactly as we requested. Reasonably priced for fresh food - they offered a small selection of beers, also. Extremely clean, very reasonably priced. Plus, we learned that the owners of this establishment just opened another location relatively close to our home - in Sacramento CA. We can't wait to dine there and meet the family!"}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp: 4/5.  Nice amount of coconut breaking.  Kind of small, but least they were 25% off.

Seafood Chowder: 3/5.  Light and served at a decent temperature.  Not very creamy or rich, but lots of nice large fish chunks.  This is definitely a cream soup as opposed to chowder, as it's missing the buttery creamy rich goodness of true chowders.  I was okay with it but dining companion hated it.

Fries: 3/5.  Great seasoning, nice and salty, but not hot enough temperature-wise.

Dining companion did not care for the fish in the fish and chips but did eat it all.

It's your usual fast casual service, about Pei Wei level of customer service interaction.

2.5 stars overall. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and bump them up to 3 stars, for the somewhat authentic Hawaiian connection."}
{"text":"From Plymouth, Massachusetts so we are always looking to fix our seafood craving here in the valley. First time I ordered fish tacos, as others have mentioned these were not very satisfying... I'll leave he tacos to the Mexican restaurants from now on. But the reason for the review is the fish and chips. So good! Way better than what we had expected. Breading looks dark, but do not be turned off. It is really good! The coleslaw that has come with it (we've gotten 4 times now) is a joke though, it's really just hard cabbage. Take a note from Red Lobster if you want slaw people actually want. I heard others complaining about it too. Of course, this isn't the main course but it is nice to have a good slaw with fish and chips. We enjoy the counter ordering and not having to deal with a waitress or wait. Nice music playing and friendly staff. Fix your slaw!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in AZ! I feel like I'm in Hawaii when I'm here. So glad one opened up in AZ! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos I have ever had!!
My friend and I split and order of fish tacos (you get 2 huge ones per order) and the Seafood Salad. The tacos are incredible and very filling. We probably didn't need the extra salad, but the Seafood Salad was also great! We chose the Mahi as our fish, blackened with two different dressings on the side. I barely used any dressing the salad was so good on its own. It comes with 3 large shrimp that were cooked to perfection. The price is on point with the quality you receive and the portions are large.
This is an order at the counter joint, which I typically avoid for business meetings, but the staff was AMAZING! They gave us all the details on the different options and  made great suggestions. They were busy so try to get there before 12pm.

They are opening a second location on Scottsdale & Shea in a couple weeks which is great as that is much closer to my office!"}
{"text":"Delicious, clean food. Even the fried shrimp and fried fish are fried in very light and clean oil. Every ingredient is impeccably prepared with clean taste. One of our new favorites that we have visited four times already this week!"}
{"text":"I met some friends there and we ordered the fish tacos. You get one fish taco for $12! I was very disappointed and told my friends that for my money,  I would go to Habaneros if u want fish tacos. You can get excellent fish tacos for $3.99 each!

My plan was to nver go back, but have to say that I am glad I did. The next time I went with some clients, I ordered the fish salad. It was EXCELLENT!  My clients ordered the fish sandwich and loved it too. 

So, go there for the fish salad or the fish sandwich and skip the tacos."}
{"text":"I ate at the original Coconut's on Maui for the first time three years ago and the fish tacos turned me into a fish lover, I DO NOT like fish that has a fishy flavor so I have avoided eating it all my life. Not so after eating at Coconut's on Maui.

When I found out they were coming to Scottsdale I emailed the Maui owner to let him know how thrilled I was they were coming to AZ.

My husband and I were invited to the pre-opening party which we sadly missed but we made it in for dinner tonight, grand opening day.

The original owner Mike and the franchise owner Kim were there to greet customers. That is one of Coconut's draws on Maui, the friendly service and I can tell Mike has made sure that it will continue here in AZ, you will feel the Hawaiian Aloha when you walk in.

Let me tell you..... the food was as good as it is at the Maui Coconut's.
The fish tacos are not to be missed, they boast using 17 ingredients and they are large enough to share although I ate all of mine by myself. This fish is so fresh and they make everything on their menu fresh from scratch daily.

You can't find fish any better than this anywhere in AZ, and again it is as good as the fish at the Maui store.
Their fish and chips are lightly breaded and you get one piece of mahi mahi and one piece of ono with fries. All delicious. 
Their coleslaw is their secret recipe and uses coconut milk, it really is the best coleslaw I have eaten.

The d√©cor is similar to the Maui store even the surf board tables are made by the same craftsman.

Do yourself a favor, if you want a fresh, light and healthy but EXTREMELY yummy meal give them a try.

p.s. they also have chicken, vegetarian choices and beef but you will be missing out if you do not try the fish.

Thank you Mike and Kim!"}
{"text":"Very fresh fish! And all of the folks working there were helpful and really seemed proud of their food. One gentlemen suggested the mahi fish burger blackened. It was absolutely amazing. We also tried the calamari and coconut shrimp. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye and I stopped in on a whim to grab lunch to go. I ordered the fish tacos. The prices seemed a little high, but these tacos are no joke. Two tacos was a very satisfying meal. The mango salsa was really good, I would probably order an extra side on the future.

The tacos were hard to keep together based on the size, but still very good. It took awhile to get the food, and had it been evening I probably would have opted to have a beer while I waited. They had a couple on tap from Hawaii that looked interesting. It's set up as a casual dining place, but I think it would be a better meal when you are prepared to sit down and take your time with enjoying the meal.

I plan to return when I do have the time to truly enjoy myself. I'm interested in their plates because I have the feeling that they will offer the taste of the tacos without as much of the mess."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their macadamia crusted mahi mahi! I crave it weekly. The fish is cooked perfectly and sits on a bed of brown rice. You can get slaw or roasted veggies on the side. I know it's a little pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the macadamia crusted mahi mahi. It used to be a special but it got so popular that they now have it on the menu at all times! Try it with the grilled veggies instead of the slaw...amazing. Everything here is so fresh and delicious. My husband loves the fish tacos and my girlfriend swears by the taco mountain. Plus, as you enjoy the delicious fish, you can watch videos of Hawaiian surfing...almost makes you feel like you're on vacation!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the famous mahi fish tacos. The entire taco from tortilla to the sauce was very original. 
The customer service is some of the best I've ever experienced
The only complaint I have was the price. I've had many great tacos in my life and it's tough to justify paying $11 for 2 tacos without a drink or sides"}
{"text":"Friday night at 630 and food showed up fast.  Coconut shrimp best I've had. Fish tacos are huge portions and tasty but less cabbage cole slaw would be an improvement.  Tasted the spicey ahi pok√©, it was tasty with a kick.  My blackened Ono on rice was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Our Canadian contingent will come back.  Glad we finally tried this nearby place."}
{"text":"I felt like there was way too much on the fish taco to be able to comfortably hold and eat them. The fish chunks were a bit too dry, the sauce was tasty, and the toppings were good. The best part of the meal were my fries cooked well done. They were so crispy and perfectly salted. Without the fries, this meal would have been a complete let down. The service was great with friendly cash registers/waitresses. Good amount of seating."}
{"text":"After waiting 25 minutes without any kind of service at Pita Jungle, we made the right decision and walked over to Coconuts. The service was OUTSTANDING. They really go above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience. The taco mountain with fish (and extra mango salsa) and the coconut shrimp are my favorite things to get on the menu every time. My daughter LOVED the chicken pasta and garlic bread. If I could give more than five stars, I would!"}
{"text":"This is awesome food for a great value. Very very consistent!! Love this place... Shhhhh....
If you look at my reviews they are probably rated either 1 or 5. My reviews are based on either a GREAT EXPERIENCE or BAD EXPERIENCE.  I don't review average experiences. So if I give 5 STARS I mean it!
Of course I also mean it when I give 1 star."}
{"text":"Holy Fishburger, Batman!  I was so excited to try this place out after friends and coworkers ranted and raved about it.  I had the fishburger asian style on a wheat bun.  It was so darned filling and delish!  the fish portion was generous, to the point where I had to eat the huge burger with a fork and knife!  My friend also shared her coconut shrimp which where perfect.  I can't wait to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! The first time I ate here, I walked out thinking I found heaven. The staff is always super friendly and organized. Although it may seem busy at all times of the day, you get your food really fast. I go here at least once every other week because the food is so fresh. You can't go wrong with the tacos... ever. I do wish they had larger servings because Its all so good! Definitely can't go wrong with choosing to go here. A+++"}
{"text":"OOoo my goodness. The coconut shrimp and fish tacos are the BEST around! The atmosphere is casual but clean and the service is amazing! Family friendly and fast! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not bad for the price.  Love the selection of unsweetened teas.  Will be back to try their pineapple and mango IPAs. 

The ahi poke appetizer had sesame seeds and avocado mixed into it which is not traditional but was surprisingly decent . The fish didn't have the fresh ahi poke taste  or color I am used to but it was still good.

The grilled Ono was a very generous serving for the price and the cole slaw is the best I have ever had.  Tastes like it is mixed with coconut milk and horseradish."}
{"text":"These are the best fish tacos and coconut shrimp I have ever had. It doesn't hurt that they have great music and a calming atmosphere with televisions constantly playing footage of the beautiful ocean."}
{"text":"Coconuts is pretty good. I like it because the fish is really fresh and whatever sauce they use is really bomb. I recommend for fish tacos, specifically the mahi."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and tasty...my group loved all the different dishes. I loved my poke bowl...sooo delicious!  Back soon with other friends soon."}
{"text":"Best fresh tacos & cocnut shrimp. I call & pick up, but their location is nice & clean."}
{"text":"Their fish taco is heavenly. I love this place, the vibe, the service, the atmosphere,,, I can't wait to try more things on their menu!!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were a bit dry and they needed a little bit more seasoning but the seafood chowder, breaded shrimp and French fries were fantastic. Staff was super friendly and helpful. We'll be back to try some other entrees for sure. Definitely be back for the chowder."}
{"text":"Sorry, there is no way based on my first time, this can be rated more than 2 stars. Fish & Chips dry. Poke needs work but better than Costco but Maui Poke it is not. Maybe just a bad day, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We had just been at the Arabian Horse Show - this place was only about a 10 minute drive from the fairground. It's an \"order at the counter\" place with no servers and that hadn't been initially clear when I was looking at other reviews. BUT the food was definitely top notch."}
{"text":"Great concept and decor, but those famous fish tacos had no flavor! I had read such great reviews that I my expectations were probably set too high. While the tacos weren't terrible, the slaw on top tasted like little more than mayo - completely killed the flavor of the fish - and the fish was tough. The theme as cool, though. Great artwork and such. I will go elsewhere for my fish taco fix in the future, though. Bummer. Certainly not worth the $10.99 for 2 small tacos."}
{"text":"Had their fish tacos and have to say they were pretty average. Was not the biggest fan of the quality of the vegetables with the fish tacos. Really crunchy and kind of made the taco hard to eat. The fish overall was very good and flavorful and no complaints about the tortillas.

Service was nice and fast. Overall, not bad but very average."}
{"text":"Incredible first experience! The experience started with SINCERELY friendly staff. I went with a friend and we declared to our order taker that it was our first time there. She was patient, detailed, provided her favorite meals and why. The fish tacos were sensational!! A perfect flavor and texture balance. We were checked on 2-3 times during our short stay. Each time it was a different staff member, each time with that same sincere caring about our experience. BRAVO TEAM!"}
{"text":"Fresh. Fish tacos are torta style. Love the tarter sauce. Small restaurant with picnic tables outside.  Super causal."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure most people don't get enough fish in their diet (myself included), so I'm thinking that Coconut's is going to be one of my regular lazy night stops in the future. The inside is clean and big, and staff was pleasant. I got the mahi mahi local style, which is served over brown rice with slaw. The food came out pretty quickly and although it looks quite basic, the flavor, quantity, and quality is all stellar. The fish was cooked and seasoned really well and the brown rice also hit the spot. It's all really light, so it doesn't make you feel bloated like at other restaurants. I'm on the fence about the slaw, it's nice and crisp and has a little bit of a horseradish kick to it, which I alternated between appreciating and hoping it would go away. The slice of tomato topped with cheese that came on top of the slaw seemed a bit out of place.

Haven't tried the fried items yet but might do so on a day where I'm not particularly fussy about eating light."}
{"text":"Love Coconut's fish tacos. A little pricey but we'll worth it. The tacos are packed with fish and my favorite, mangos. I called ahead this time to place my order for take out. When I arrived, they called me by name at the register and opened the door for me on my way out. Another solid experience."}
{"text":"These are some messy fish taco's so leave your dignity at the door.   The food taste fresh and is very wholesome.   The mango salsa paired with the wasabi make for a great flavor. Definitely the best fish tacos in the area."}
{"text":"Overall food was tasty.  Fish and chips were fried nicely.  Two portions of fish were tasty if a bit small.  Mahi over rice again was tasty and nciely grilled.  Over all prices are a little high for lunch.  It was basically $24 for 2 for lunch.  

Were it's a little strange is the setup.  You walk up to the front counter order your food and pay at the register.  Then you sit down and they bring you the food, but it's not a waiter/waitress setup.  So it's a little confusing if you tip or not.  They say it's not necessary but you almost feel like you should tip because of the way they have it setup, but if you've already paid for the food by credit card, and have no cash, then what?

Over all, food was tasty, but a little pricey and there's the situation above.  Will come back again, but probably not as often."}
{"text":"This is going to be a long time staple in our neighborhood. People recognize quality ingredients and the effort it takes to be consistent with providing excellent fish!!! 

The menu has great value - one order of tacos feeds two!!!!   However, I have been known to devour my own order!!!    The cleanliness & Hawaiian charm of the decor make it fun eatery.  Check out the surfboard shaped tables!!!  The staff is the friendliest and recognize frequent friends who dine there regularly!  And there are many!!!!

As I mentioned, this is my go to neighborhood fast casual seafood eatery!  Did I mention their signature seafood chowder?  Not too rich....The best!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people.  I have come here three times in 10 days. The first two times I got \"Local Style\" over rice, with Cacjun style Mahi Mahi.  OMG! Super delish! Today I got a fish taco moutain.  Wow,  so fresh and delicious again. Everyone is so friendly and the service was fast. Definitely will return many more times."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go for fresh grilled mahi, asian flair, local style. 

Their fish tacos with ono and mahi are scrumptious! Love the mango salsa and the tiger sauce to drizzle on the fish, rice and coleslaw. The coleslaw is also very refreshing and packed full of flavor.

We almost come every week on a Saturday or Sunday for the past few years. Occasionally, we go during the week off we take a day off.

I had one issue trying or the fish chowder that I had to take back because it tasted REALLY FISHY FISHY... They had no problem and brought out coconut shrimp for me that I subbed out. It's decent, but have had better.

If you want a delicate steak type calamari, theirs is delicious! Maui onion rings are also a good option to share.

It's a WINNER! Try it out If in the area. You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Killer, awesome, great fish taco's...although it's getting the full Scottsdale price for everything. For non-table service it' all the money for sure..."}
{"text":"Amazing! Like being back in Maui. Fresh fish and shrimp, lightly breaded so it doesn't overwhelm. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great beer selection. Patio is comfy and setup with heat and air for when the weather changes. Only a parking lot view but hey, the food rocks!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are fish tacos. These are on the top of the scale. Tender and juicy with spicy Cole slaw and mango salsa. Over stuffed and messy but who cares. Staff added to the experience. Shrimp was regular fried with mediocre cocktail sauce but tasty. Check them out it is worth the extra money."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal :)

My family and I visited Hawaii for vacation earlier this year so naturally, this place has become a favorite now that we're back in Arizona. 

The menu is legit, very similar to what you'll find on the islands (meaning it's focused- they serve what they're good at and make what they're good at, DELICIOUS). The plates looked huge and filling- I ordered the traditional fish tacos. These are MEGA because they serve a healthy serving of ono and ahi (grilled to perfection) with 17 other ingredients to make the slaw and seasoned mango that tops the taco. We also ordered a basket of fries and they came out piping hot and perfectly salted. 

Really, 5 stars for the best fish tacos I've had- beats any joint I've had in Cali..."}
{"text":"Hawaii boy out here in Scottsdale for work and what do I find...the best fish tacos in the world!!! I've been to the Kihei restaurant many times, and this has the exact same quality and care put into it. Check it out!! Get the fish tacos, and thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite poke bowl around! The pickles and the mangoes give it a special twist. The fish fresh and melts in your mouth. The spicy version sneaks up on you but so good. Service here is quick and everyone super friendly."}
{"text":"This place was highly rated so I was excited. However the food was a huge disappointment. I had the fish taco and the fish was dry and skimpy.  The staff gets 5 stars. They were very friendly and nice.  Too bad about the god quality."}
{"text":"The fish is very fresh here.  I started with the seafood chowder which was good, and then fish tacos. When they first brought it out my first reaction was that it was not going to be enough to fill me up but I was wrong!  There was a lot of fish  and I was starting to get full after the first taco(2 comes in order)  . I liked that there were pineapple and avacado in it.  My mom got the fish and chips and it was very fresh. The inside is nice and is hawaiian themed with a big screen tv of people surfing and surf board tables. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"So sorry to report I hade such high expectations and was so disappointed ! Packets of mayonnaise??. Restaurants in Scottsdale do better than that! Food quality did not even compare to anything in Hawaii who are your food vendors?

Went back tonight and had the fish tacos (because i had a gift card to use up) wow  they were amazing!!!! I would so go back and have the fish tacos anytime!"}
{"text":"They have a winning formula. Simple, delicious, quick Hawaiian-esque, that is reasonably priced. 

Have Tried Coconut Shrimp, Poke Bowl, Seafood Chowder (Probably one of the best Seafood dishes you can get in metro Phoenix area), Fish Tacos."}
{"text":"Nice little place with wifi and great service! I ordered the fish taco mountain which is served over brown rice rather than shells. Mmmmmmm it's good"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's a Friday. Perhaps it's Lent. Perhaps the food is just that good. But the place is packed. 

Don't be fool by the simple menu of tacos or local style (a plate lunch though would not be this fancy).  

The fish is chocked full of flavor and grilled to perfection. Good size portions. And a kickin hot sauce I've yet to find elsewhere. 

What's a seafood establishment doing in the desert? 

Whenever, we're in Arizona, we'll have one or more meals here.  Yes, it's that good."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos!  Big helping!  Lots of flavor and big enough to fill you up.  Also had the coconut shrimp which were really good.  You must try this place, its highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Fish Taco's were Fantastic! The coleslaw was very smooth, fish was cooked just right and the mango salsa was tasty!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time last week with my boss and a couple of coworkers. It was a little after lunchtime and still somewhat busy, but not at all noisy or overcrowded.

The feel of the place is fresh and bright with plenty of surfer/beach elements for anyone into that sort of thing. In fact, the table that we sat at was designed like a long wooden surfboard. Kinda quirky and cool.

The best part about this place is the food. Oh man. I did NOT expect to be too impressed with the food, but I definitely was! Their fish tacos are some of the best I've ever had.

I'd take the time to describe the tacos in such a way that your mouth starts to water just from reading about them, but instead I'm just going to encourage you to go try them for yourself.

Everything on the menu appeared healthy and servings were substantial. Prices were acceptable considering all the other elements I've already pointed out.

The food came quickly and the staff was very attentive and friendly. I DEFINITELY intend to come back here and WILL be recommending the place to my friends.

Well done, Coconut's!"}
{"text":"Absolute best food I had the entire time I was in Phoenix visiting. The two of us shared the coconut shrimp, fish burger, and fish taco. Best seafood I've ever had. I could eat this every day.  A. M. A. Z. I. N. G."}
{"text":"Easily the best fish tacos in Az. Great staff and environment. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had the Mahi-mahi's Fish and Chips and my wife had the grilled blackened mahi. Both were excellent. The cole slaw was not my favorite. We also had the coconut shrimp...mmmm good!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in town! The service could be better though, it was a lot more inviting when we came the first time."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. Consistently delicious food prepared with fresh ingredients  in a clean restaurant with a friendly staff. The cole slaw is out of this world!"}
{"text":"We liked it so much last night that we are going back tonight.  We want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and the people are super nice. Reminded me of when I was in Hawaii. All the food is great. Taco mountain, tacos, coconut shrimp, poke, fish and chips, fish local style. You can't go wrong! Also awesome is that you can pick the seasoning/flavoring you want on your fish."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been excellent. I usually get the fish taco mountain for myself, and whatever my friends want. I've had the blackened ono ahi sandwich, which is excellent and very meaty. I love fish, but even if you're not a huge fan of fish, just give it a chance. I would say it's the closest to a steak sandwich made of fish you can get.
The coconut shrimp is very good, but in my opinion, a bit pricy. The calamari is some of the most tender I've had, though.
I usually get take-out, as I live and work close. When they say it will be ready in ten minutes, they actually mean it.
My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find such fresh flavorful fish in Scottsdale!  We had heard it was good and were pleasantly surprised.  We had the fish & Chips and found the coleslaw and fries great accompaniments. The restaurant was clean and bright and staffed with caring individuals.  The only reason that its not 5 stars is that I paid more for the casual/fast food than I thought I should."}
{"text":"Today my mom and I had the pleasure of eating at Coconut's Fish Cafe after our hike at Brown's Mountain. We both ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi \"Local Style,\" which means it was served over brown rice and with a side of coleslaw. You can choose between Mahi Mahi and Ono fish and your preferred cooking style. We chose the \"Asian Flair\" which was a light ginger wasabi mayo marinade. There were many choices though, from butter, salt and pepper to Cajun style to South of the Border. We both really enjoyed our plates. I thought the fish was perfectly grilled and flaky. I'll definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"They have incredible Poki, and the fish salad is to die for.

Our two servers Matt and Bailey did incredible job of educating us on the menu as first time diners.

My wife had fish and chips and I had ono salad, that was very, very good!  It's a great place to eat at prior to going to movie at Shea 14."}
{"text":"This food is so dang good I didn't know what to expect and when someone offered it to me, although it sounded good I was skeptical. There was plenty of fish on my \"mountain\" along with fresh mangos and cabbage. If you haven't tried it yet, prepare to be unexpectedly SATISFIED"}
{"text":"First visit today - really good.
The chowder is great. 
We had fish tacos (excellent) and Ono sandwich , Asian style. Very good. 
Will be back."}
{"text":"NIce new eatery in Chandler with tasty food and drinks. Cool modern atmosphere with a surf theme and beautiful mural on the wall. I'm ready to return."}
{"text":"Very nice and courteous staff.  5 stars to the staff and cleanliness of the restaurant.

Very disappointed in the quality of the food.  The Caesar salad dressing was so heavy with anchovies that you could only taste anchovies. The fish tacos were tough and had no taste- I wondered if the fish was previously frozen?

Sorry, but I have marked this one off the list."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a busy Friday evening. The food came out quickly and was hot and very tasty. It's a different style of fish and chips but very good. The staff was very attentive with extra tarter sauce, etc."}
{"text":"Delicious.... I doubt you can go wrong here, but here is what I have done...

I haven't deviated from the fish taco entree because they are too delicious to resist.  Tried the coconut shrimp appetizers recently and they were amazing as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here twice while on vacation. We ordered the fish tacos both times and they were delicious!  Service was great and it was a cute place."}
{"text":"Great place had the fish tacos and they were amazing. Truly lived up to the hype. I can officially say the best I've had."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  The ahi tasted like we were in Hawaii again. Go and have the seafood salad."}
{"text":"Maui!!!! A home away from home for me. So happy I tried this place. Fresh food and friendly staff. I got the fish tacos, super yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp was crispy, sweet and crunchy.  The fish and chips.........not so much.  Fries were tasty and the service at the Scottsdale Road location was friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly and fast service.  Clean, new interior with cool surfing videos to watch while you eat."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find Coconut's opened up in the neighborhood. My excitement didn't last very long. I got sick the first time my husband and I had dinner there (we had the fish tacos). Husband felt uneasy after dinner but nothing serious like me. Didn't think much of it. Then a few weeks later met a friend for lunch at Coconut's. Well, had to cut our visit short as my stomach started acting up and she got the sweats. Will not be back.
The staff is great. Food tastes great just not sure about the quality."}
{"text":"I met my Mama here for lunch, her recommendation, sure thing! Inside was super busy, I gathered I was missing out on something delicious. The ambiance was chill, we snagged a table outside cause it was a gorgeous day. I had two classic Mahi Mahi tacos - I couldn't resist! The flavors and mango just worked, a very satisfying and lite meal. Mama couldn't finish her dish, so I made certain it didn't go to waste :) ...Highly recommend! But the menu didn't offer coconuts?"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos, huge and delicious!! Also great coconut shrimp! Great atmosphere inside as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I get tired of the same old spots to grab lunch or a quick dinner. After awhile all of the Mexican restaurants start to look and taste the same and don't even get me started on places like BJ's, Yard House, etc.

How refreshing to find Coconut's.  The fish tacos and the fish and chips are fantastic. You'll also enjoy the friendly staff and the casual interior."}
{"text":"Found this place because we had gone to a movie nearby.  We had a shrimp and salad dish, both were good.  The staff was very nice and the place looked clean.  We ended up eating out on the front  patio which was nice.

Had a good experience here and I would go back."}
{"text":"I'm shocked with the quality .great food salad with mahi mahi  was amazing .do not miss coconut shrimp was amazing so tasty .
I will be definitely back soon"}
{"text":"AMAZING FISH TACOS. Wow.  They are so good.  I cannot wait to go back and get more.  This place is great.  They have a really nice patio that we sat out on.  It was a really nice atmosphere.  The staff was super nice and funny.  Definitely going back soon.  Just wish there was more than one location.  One in Mesa, Tempe, or Chandler would be really nice."}
{"text":"My whole review can be summed up as \"meh.\" Very little flavor for something that should be amazing plus a fairly high price point for a meh fish taco and fish and chips. Honestly, Rubio's has a way better fish taco for half the price."}
{"text":"Our favorite joint when it comes to fast-casual (sorry Chipotle). This place has something for everyone and then some. My two favorite dishes are the taco mountain (can't manage the taco shells) and coconut shrimp and chip basket. Staff here are always going out of their way to make sure that your meal is to the utmost satisfaction."}
{"text":"It's ok.  If you are looking for a quick lunch or snack it will probably work for you.  I had the Taco Mountain.  It's a good concept, nice presentation and a lot of food. Others in our party had the coconut shrimp and steak tacos.  We all agreed that it was \"ok\".  

That said, I wanted to be bowled over.  But I can only say that the tiny bits of fish were a bit dry and overcooked and thus \"ok\".  The toppings are unique and flavorful but not enough flavor to contribute to the rest of the ingredients (rice was bland). The coconut shrimp was ok and a decent price.  Steak tacos were probably the best of the bunch.  Yet not enough to bring us back.  

A table next to us had the Poke and it looked wonderful.  I'd try that if we ever go back.

I'm so sad.  I wanted this to be a nice neighborhood go-to place.  The search continues."}
{"text":"We took a chance because we love fish and chips.  We also go to Hawaii regularly so how can we lose.....

First off we were the only ones there at 4:15PM (little early for dinner) and 2-4 employees were in the corner eating, on the phone or just joking around.  It lasted the whole time we were there.  Guess it's how things work now a days when it's not busy.

We decided to try a few things:
(2 backup kids meals incase the fish didn't go well)

1) Kiki (kids) meal: hot dog and fries - nice and crunchy dog and toasted bread.  Fries were nice and crunchy but cold.

2) Kiki (kids) meal: spaghetti and marinara- gross and liquidy.

3) coconut shrimp appetizer: tasted nice (preference here) but the dip was thick and jammy with a strange spice.

4) fish and chips: for $12 I had hoped for a few pieces but only got 2 thin ones.  Was dry and overcooked.  I did like the target sauce.

All in all it was \"okay\" not a place we would go again for this meal."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in the area! Quick and delicious!! The staff is super friendly and you'll leave wanting to go to Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten one thing here -- the fish tacos -- but they're so good, I don't see the point of ordering anything else.

You get two tacos on a plate.  They're so filling that my better half and I share one order, making it a very affordable dinner for two but slightly pricey for one.  (One order is 10.99.)

It's another fast-casual restaurant (love this trend, keep them coming!), cutely decorated with a Hawaiian surfer theme.  The tables look like old-time surf boards.

Now, on the tacos:  The regular order consists of chopped grilled (not fried) tuna with a delicious cole slaw, chunks of mango, and a creamy tangy sauce, all on two corn tortillas.  (They're easy to split with someone else because each taco is separate.)

The coleslaw is worth spot-lighting, it brings satisfying texture and crunch in a healthy package (cabbage is very good for you)."}
{"text":"First time visiting Coconuts. Very neat little restaurant with an island decor. The menu is rather limited but the food is outstanding! We shared the fish tacos (house specially) and an order of fish and chips. The food came out smoke'n hot and delicious... Love the tartar sauce as it has a dill accent that really makes it amazing. Highly recommend. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here about five times now. Every single visit, I've had fish tacos which have been DIVINE every time. Best fish tacos I've had in my life. Add hot sauce for some pizazz!"}
{"text":"Very good fish tacos.  Keep in mind this is not fine dining.  It is for lunch or a light dinner.  It is not outstanding if compared to fine dining; but excellent for what it is, which is a fairly quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered Calamari which was delicious.  The Fish and  chips were good.  The tartar sauce had dill in it, which made the meal a five star!!!  Absolutely liked it a lot."}
{"text":"The family and I went here for lunch today...YAS! It's everything all the other reviews say and more! My hubby had the 2 fish tacos, which he enjoyed. I had the fish and chips and I left saying it was some of the best I've ever had! There's no mystery, fatty weirdness that some fish and chips may have sometimes. It's all fresh white flakey Mahi Mahi battered to perfection!!! The homemade tarter sauce is tasty and has dill in it, which mixes really nicely with the lemon you squirt on the fish. Yum....the fries are good, but the coleslaw was super average...but who cares! The fish is the star here :) I'll be back Coconut's!"}
{"text":"Was visiting the area and saw this place. After reading their menu I had to try it! 

I got the mahi-mahi local style with lemon butter. It comes with brown rice and coleslaw (they put shredded cheese on the coleslaw which seems odd to me because fish + cheese is kinda a no no). I seriously dislike all slaw so I cant tell you how it was. The fish was grilled & cooked to perfection! The butter was definitely not overwhelming (i couldve used a little more honestly but it was probably better for me) and i squeezed lemon on it. Very delicious and fresh! 

My dad got the same thing i did & mom got the fish tacos; both really enjoyed them! 

Nowwww about the brown rice. I really don't like brown rice. The texture. So please please make white rice available. I feel like the vibe of this place is healthy, i respect that, but let me have unhealthy white rice on an upcharge or something. I've been to maui 2x and ive eaten white rice there so please just let me have it! 

Nice selection of drink teas. Probably would come back; it's a little pricey, but it IS fish, so it that regard it's fairly reasonable. Plus we did get an app (25% off...improvement would be 50%) for the coconut shrimp (VERY GOOD). But $50 for 3 people seems high for a) lunch and b) frequency of visits.

Would recommend people trying! Clean bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I struggled with giving this a 4 or 5 star rating not so much because I didn't love it, but it just doesn't feel like the kind of place you'd give 5 stars. But the coconut shrimp was definitely 5 star and that's all that mattered to everyone I was eating with. The fish tacos were truly filling and very tasty.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My sister & I did go back to try the onion rings we saw someone else order the last time we were there. OMG they were so delish!!!!!!!!! The batter had a good natural taste with fresh onions. They are huge also! So my sister & I shared a batch. We also shared the coconut shrimp w/Thai chili pineapple sauce. I normally don't like anything with coconut flavor and yes I've tried other coconut fish to find out I still don't like coconut flavor. HOWEVER, my sister insisted we try them. AMAZING!!!!! The sauce was so perfect for the shrimp! I forgot about the coconut flavor entirely until my sister asked if I could taste it. These 2 dishes we so good that we are excited to go back & try something else. We thus far vow to try the whole menu by the end of this year hahaha"}
{"text":"We visited Coconut's when we were in Maui and it was such a great find.  Very happy to see they are on the mainland & we hit up the one in Chandler AZ when we were visiting family.

Great tasty fish tacos with a refreshing mango salsa among other items.  The fish and chips is crispy and tasty as are their signature coconut shrimp appetizers.  Their fries are seasoned well and were a tasty crispy accompaniment.

Overall,  Coconut's is a great value for a quick meal that is anything but ordinary."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting. I came in a week ago and got sick from they're \"fish\". I will never be back to this establishment. Employees seemed extremly stuck up and rude."}
{"text":"Eddie is 5 stars. The guy makes this place exceptional. Outstanding food. One of a kind."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Emily was great on helping us all with our since it was are first time here. Everything was so fresh. Have a Desert Mana iPad. You will not regret eating here. So yummy!"}
{"text":"This is probably by far the best small casual seafood I have had! Came on a recommendation for calamari, from someone who has been to the one in Hawaii. Well needless to say they knocked it out of the park! Calamari and chips, calamari was GREAT! Very thin layer of batter and a thick moist stick of calamari. Fries/chips were good too. Comparable to McDonald's. Also got the coconut shrimp, again crispy coconut outside moist tasty shrimp inside. As for the tacos, I just ordered to compare because I am very picky with ANY FISH! If it at all smells or tastes fishy, I'm not liking it. THESE tacos are the best I have had. Had to look up the fish I think it said ono and mahi mahi? And yes I have had some tacos beachside at popular spots. Hands down my fav. Little over stuffed but why complain, they give you a fork. I don't like giving 5 stars unless I can't really can't find any flaws. Service, great. You can pick up your silverware and sauces at the drink station, I forgot, well someone brought it to the table along with condiments.  Ambiance, great. Good island vibe music, lighting, people. Drink selection was good, beer, wine, soda, tea.... chose tea because they had 4 different types. Now I scrolled through the reviews and seen some people barking about the price. I thought the price was right. If you don't think this fish taco (you get 2 can make about 4) is 2 bucks better than rubios, then by all means go to rubios. This is not a huge chain, they have quality food. Great service. Will FOR SURE be back. THe place has been open 2 months and was packed. It is a world famous taco shop right here on Ocotillo! 

Also I found out after paying that if you check in you get 25% off the coconut shrimp. Now probably could have showed it to them and I feel they would have honored it after paying. But was only a couple bucks, and I didn't want to make a fuss. And I'll be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos I've had. They're big enough that you won't leave hungry. A larger beer selection would be nice."}
{"text":"We've eaten fish tacos in Maui many times, and while we haven't eaten at the Coconuts there, this one definitely captures the spirit of the Maui fish taco we know. For a pinch more coin than you'd pay at Rubios, you get a MUCH tastier (and more filling) meal.  The fish tasted fresh and flavorful, and while it's a challenge to eat (easier for me with big hands... and a big mouth), it was worth it.  I dig the mix of flavors doing a conga in my mouth.  Bring it on, brutha!

For our meal, we sneaked in for dinner about 10 minutes before close en route to a movie, but didn't get the stink-eye from the staff that I feared. They were super-helpful, friendly and attentive, bringing us extra napkins (you'll need 'em), talking about the food, and making sure we were having a good time.  The surf-board tables and big-wave videos playing on the TVs also helped with the vibe (though you remember you are in a strip mall in Arizona soon enough).

Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Badda Boom, Badda Bing... We have a winner! I'm a seafood fan, and this is a fresh, new twist on some old favorites. The coconut shrimp is excellent, and the fish tacos are the best I've ever had (in this country). The staff is super friendly, atmosphere is fun, I truly like this joint. If you haven't been yet, gotta' try it out. Even my non-seafood-loving Mother In Law liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"A handful of my coworkers are vegan or mainly prefer fish as part of their staple diet. Coconut Fish offers a variety of fish style cooking that can provide them with these options. I ordered their Fish and Chips to share and it was good. My coworkers ordered their fish tacos topped with mango which actually was really good too.  Ingredients tasted very fresh, and service was quick after placing your order at the counter.  

If you happen to be in the Scottsdale area and are looking for something quick, healthy eats and fish is your main diet, this would be a good option!!

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Been to Coconuts several times over the past fe months, and each time I'm thrilled with this place!  

Let's start with the food - and at Coconuts, that means (mostly) fish, and for me that means fish tacos.  In a word:  spectacular!  The fish tastes fresh, is grilled perfectly, is accompanied (read: piled HIGH) with creamy cole slaw and mango salsa that capture a real island feel.  Each time I go to Coconuts I  go with the intention of trying something different.....but, the fish tacos are so good I can't pull the trigger on ordering something else.

Now, let's talk about the \"ambiance\".  I really like the fact that Coconuts has a casual feel in the heart of North Scottsdale.  Not fancy; more like a neighborhood place that locals flock to.  Perhaps they could do a little more to make it look a little less like a fast food place, but only if they can find a way to keep it laid back and casual.

I need to give a shout-out to the employees.  They are friendly, upbeat, helpful, and knowledgable about their product.  They are busy (this place feels like it's starting to get popular), but all the workers always seem to be smiling and take a few moments to chat,  

Finally, here's the thing about Coconuts.....at first glance, the price for two fish tacos ($10.99) seems a bit high.  But, don't let that deter you - it is a really good value.....The quality and quantity justify the price."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos! The calamari was cooked perfectly and some great beers on tap. Definitely worth checking out with friends or family."}
{"text":"Great little place to get fish and chips and other Hawaiian inspired seafood. Fish was perfectly fried as we're the French fries."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times now. I was told by a friend to order the fish tacos because they were so good. I havent tried anything else on the menu yet because I became instantly addicted to them. So good and overflowing with fish and lots of fresh toppings. Best fish tacos I've had, especially considering its not a sit down type of place"}
{"text":"Coconuts is an incredible place to great food. I never liked fish tacos before but the super fresh ingredients plus the fresh mango sauce is the key.  My wife craves their fresh blackened fish.  You will swear your eating fresh fish while sitting on the beach."}
{"text":"3 stars for noise (hence \"cafe.\"), 5 stars for food....3 in our group; Maui Maui and the Seafood Chowder. Excellent for both. Best seafood chowder I've had, ever."}
{"text":"YUM!  I noticed the sign for this place on my way to work every day and finally decided to give it a try last week after reading the great reviews on Yelp and I was not disappointed!  They are known for their fish tacos and I love fish tacos, so that's what I decided to order.  You get two per order and they are made with both mahi mahi and ono.  The tortillas are small, but they are overloaded to the point where you really can't pick it up and eat it taco style, but that was fine with me!  Fresh mangos, salsa, cream sauce, cabbage and lots of other good stuff made these some of the best fish tacos I have ever had!  When I come back I would probably split the fish tacos with someone and then try something else from the menu (I've heard the calamari is tasty).  Very friendly waitstaff and just a really good experience overall.  There is outdoor seating with misters and the decor is nicely done...all of the tables are shaped like surfboards!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love love love Coconut's! I first discovered Coconut's fish cafe in Maui and decided to try it when I was in Scottsdale.

They have a nice outside seating area and they keep it clean. 

You go up to the counter and order. In Maui I had signed up for their promotional offers (you rack up points every time you go and you get discounts and offers the more you go). There seemed to be a slight disconnect with the promotional accounts because when I wanted to use my 20% off, she didn't know what I was talking about. Regardless, the person taking my order was super nice and gave me the discount anyways. The prices are fair and the portions are decently-sized.

This time I tried the fish tacos (with tomato salsa, cheese, tomatoes and mango salsa) and the macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi on brown rice with veggies. The fish is so fresh! I was slightly worried about the freshness of the fish in arizona, but the manager said that they fly the fish in fresh every day. I love their mango salsa! Everything in the fish tacos pairs together magically. The macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi is also delicious--perfectly crispy, not oily, with a perfect layer of macadamia nuts. Even the brown rice is good!

Overall, friendly staff, clean restaurant, fair prices, and delicious food! I definitely recommend Coconut's and I can't wait to eat there again.

For all of you in Socal, they're opening a Coconut's in Los Angeles in February 2018. I will definitely be there!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Authentic fish tacos. All recipes from the original Coconut's in Maui. You get two fish tacos for $11 I think. It's a fast casual place. Not fancy, just delicious. That's all you need to know. They staff is always so nice and do a fantastic job of constantly circulating. They are very attentive. Always circulating, running food, clearing plates and always ask if everything was great.  I've never had a bad experience or a less than excellent taco. I love you Coconut's!!!!! Keep up the great job!!!!"}
{"text":"Biggest complaint is the price...the rest is unbeatable!  Came recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed.  My wife, who despises fish in any form, actually ate an entire fish taco!  Large portions (good luck eating a taco without a fork, ha ha!) and ridiculously great tasting!  Very unique to say the least.  Expect to spend $40+ for a pair of lunch entrees and a couple drinks, but I'd go here any day, any time.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are as good as advertised. It was a expensive for fast casual, compatible to Chipotle and other similar restaurants for the experience, but the cost was that of a traditional restaurant. To expensive for fast casual, not enough of an experience for date night. Conclusion: good food, but not enough value to return again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. I must say I was very disappointed with the fish tacos. They put wasabi in the sauce  completely overpowered the flavor of the fish. Definitely catches you off guard. My son had the kids spaghetti. Yuck! It was all watery. The manager knew we did not enjoy the food and gave us a gift certificate to come back which was nice. We personally decided we would never come back, but will give it a second try."}
{"text":"My goodness. Excellent customer service, fresh, delicious fish burgers, crisp, non greasy fries.  What a combination.  Found this place through yelp, and will definitely be back. Burger had blackened pepper rub,  which blended nicely with the added coleslaw. Terrific experience, if you like fish burgers this is the perfect place to sample Hawaiian inspired meals."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for great fish tacos.  Glad to see they're now walking distance to where I work."}
{"text":"The food, service, decor, and cleanliness, are outstanding . I ordered the Fish Taco, and took home half. Kim and his staff were excellent and very friendly. This has only been opened five weeks, but it is a winner."}
{"text":"Great food. I have been coming here for a long time. Service and food is out of this world. Anything from the menu is great!"}
{"text":"Casual counter service, and bit pricy if it were not for the food. Wow! (Staff are friendly and attentive as well.)

Definitely try the calamari"}
{"text":"Had the fish burger with ginger sauce. Delicious!! Get ready for a messy experience! The burger is huge."}
{"text":"Aloha to my new fave! Ok folks, this is some seriously fresh and delicious food. My partner doesn't like fish tacos and when he went and loved it, I figured I had to try it!

I've been twice, once alone and once with 3 friends. Both experiences were excellent. Firstly, the place is clean and I love the decor. It will make you miss the islands. Even though it's in a 'strip mall' facing a parking lot; they did an EXCELLENT job making an atmospheric patio!

The food is super fresh and super tasty! Beer is fresh too. 

The staff is engaged, committed, knowledgable and as friendly and helpful as you could want. 

Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos with all the extras. Food was very tasty. Followed their suggestion with the tiger sauce. A little spicy, but not too much to overpower the other flavors. Definitely worth repeat visits. 

Since it is fast casual, decor was clean but basic."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff.  We were genuinely welcomed and the staff patiently reviewed the menu and options, and provided recommendations.  The food was absolutely delicious. Took their advice and tried their mahi mahi and ono fish tacos.  They were huge (order came with 2...enough for even the biggest appetites). The condiments were Maui-style. Can't say enough about the friendliness of all the staff there.  And the place was spotless. Cold beer..some local and handful of craft.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I am amazed by the freshness of their fish and other ingredients. Here is a restaurant in Phoenix with the freshest fish I have tasted anywhere in the US AND their other ingredients are amazing. I had the poke bowl with perfectly ripe avocado and mango, the coconut shrimp were on point and I really enjoyed my grilled piece of Majo Majo. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fish tacos were superb and the coconut shrimp were amazing! Fast, fresh and friendly!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of fish in the sea...

Looking for healthy food? Coconut's Fish Cafe in North Scottsdale will have you feeling fresh in no time. I've been here a half dozen of times now and the fishy version of a Panera is a great quick bite. The Hawaiian themed restaurant is known for their signature fish tacos. An order comes with two tacos but it's almost too large to eat like a regular taco. They top the tacos with coleslaw and mango salsa. My recent go-to meal is the mahi mahi with coleslaw and rice. If you like spicy, the tiger sauce compliments the tacos really well. It's not too spicy and I can up to use half the bottle. Eat in and watch the pretty pictures of the beach on the big screen."}
{"text":"My co-workers brought this in the building and said that I could try some of their fish tacos.. biting into the food felt like I needed to be sitting on beach somewhere with the warm sun over me and a margarita in the other hand.

So delicious and the flavors mixed together so well.. it wasn't deep fried fish as I typically think of when I think of 'fish tacos'. Grilled fish, mango, tomatoes, cilantro with sauce. Absolutely fresh. The fries were pretty typical and salty. This is a must-stop whenever I'm in the Scottsdale area again."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and what a find. I really love the fish tacos and my hubby said the fish and chips were really good. I have tried the coconut shrimp and also liked that. Overall everything was fresh the food is really good quality. The place is somewhat small but very clean and there is also an outside patio. I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! This is a must try. 

Went with a friend and the girl at the counter suggested splitting the coconut shrimp appetizer and one order of fish tacos since neither of us were overly starving. 

This was perfect! The coconut shrimp app was the best I've ever had. Not greasy at all and the dip was amazing. And there is nothing I could possibly critique about the tacos. They are to-die for!!

Go here now. Be prepared to have a new fish taco obsession. Sorry not sorry"}
{"text":"I was one of the first diners at Kihei location (prior to expansion).  So, when I can travel around the mainland, I hit CFC for coconut shrimp and fish tacos is a must.  I went to PHX and travel out of the way to Scottsdale location - was happy to do it.  FYI...remember to bring a friend to share the fish tacos.

I think the Yelp directions were one block off but don't give up.  Get your fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Just opened, clean, neat, bright with all friendly staff. Wife had long pleasant visit with Ana. Wife had steak tacos and I opted for fish taco mountain. Both excellent but huge! Too much for lunch and subsequently a little pricey for lunch. Presentation of \"mountain\" in a bowl with sprinkles of cheese around the edges. NEAT! Fish was excellent."}
{"text":"This foodie has found a home.
Fabulous, fresh and delicious food.
The restaurant is darling, with tables shaped like surfboards and lots of Hawaii and fish paintings.
The staff are very friendly and helpful.
If you like Hawaiian fish, get over here and try Coconuts!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with a really cool concept. Inside is decorated with tables that look like surf boards and big screen TV's on the walls showing people surfing on Hawaii Five-O waves.

Fish Burgers, Fish Tacos, Fish and Chips, Salads, Soups, Appetizers and more. They even have a kid's menu with the kinda stuff children enjoy. Must be under 10 years old the menu states. I wonder if they check ID's.

The wife and I both ordered their Famous Fish Tacos which they claim are rated #1 in the U.S.A. I was hoping you could choose the type of fish they put on them but they come only one way. They load it up with 17 different ingredients which may be part of the problem.

On top of it being too big to put in your mouth, the flavors of all the toppings seemed to overpower the fish. Both of us agreed it was missing something and fell flat. Not more toppings! The size of the pieces of fish also appeared to be rather small and the texture tasted like the the fish may have been previously frozen. Only saw the word FRESH on the menu when they were talking about their Baked Buns. Hmmm?

24 Bucks for 4 tacos and we were both still hungry. I'll drive to San Diego for that and then some. Would like to see some better napkins that do not fall apart as well. Cha Ching!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing but I guess I'm not used to Hawaiian style tacos. The tacos are huge but the fish is dry and lacked that rich seafood flavor I'm used to in Mexican style fish tacos. I do recommend the coconut shrimp. Those were out of this world."}
{"text":"I not sure what all the hype is about for the fish tacos.  The tortillas had been sitting too long and were not edible. The actual fish on each taco was hard to locate under all of the slaw.  What I did taste was boring. The majority of the taco was cabbage slaw and mango.  Hard pressed to say if there was tomato salsa on the tacos.  In addition, they were very bland.  I'm curious what the 17 ingredients are? Very disappointing especially after reading other reviews.  
The only reason this review garners 2 stars is because the coconut shrimp was outstanding.  I used the leftover sauce to try and add flavor to my bland tacos.
Staff & service was outstanding! 
Price - 2 tacos $12. Coconut Shrimp $11 (6 shrimp) ...too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!!  I would come here everyday!!

Keep opening these up!!  Location looks GREAT guys!!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could.

awesome food and service!  So glad they are opening a new location!

highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"There food is outstanding! If you want fast-food
minus the future heart attack, then eat at this 
restaurant.  Their food is mostly fish, chicken,
and some other items .... It could easily become 
a national chain. It really is that good. I guarantee
it!!! Picky eater from Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"Taco salad was great! Coconut shrimp was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had a craving for coconut shrimp and we had had a couple people recommend Coconuts to us. They did not disappoint! The appetizer was fantastic. We told the gal that took our order it was our first time so she told us about their menu and gave us a quick history on the restaurant. We were there on a Sunday. She was very sweet and helpful. We both ended us getting the fish tacos, we now know we could split an order next time because they are huge. They are delicious though too so we both had lunch for the next day too! They have lots of hot sauce options too. We both had a Kona beer as well. The restaurant is very clean decorated perfectly too so you feel like you're in Hawaii! 5 stars all around! Can't wait to go back and try more food!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! You can't go wrong with their fish tacos. Everything is cooked to order and served hot and fresh. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is so fresh and yummy!! Got the fish tacos and was very impressed. The coconut shrimp was unreal! Seems like a great spot for locals and vacationers!! Would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have the fish tacos about once a week. My husband loves the fish and chips. This last meal I was a little disappointed. They normally make a delicious cole slaw. Today I could tell a lot of Iceberg lettuce was substituted for cabbage. Not as delightful as I'm used to today. I sure hope they go back to the way it is normally made."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always get the coconut shrimp which are delicious and my mom swears by the fish and chips! Really amazing service and the employees always go above and beyond. Will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We love this place! I don't know why I never left a review. We've also been to the location on Shea. Since we were in Maui not too long ago, we thought about going to that location too so that we could say we did but we opted out. 

My two go-to orders are the fish tacos and the macadamia nut Mahi Mahi. Last night, we ordered takeout and I had the tacos. The tacos come with their coleslaw on top with some sort of mango salsa. The fish in the tacos are a combo of Mahi Mahi and Ono. There is also cheese that is melted on the tortilla. Each taco has two tortillas to hold together the massive amount of filling. Quite honestly, it is the messiest taco you will ever eat but it's worth it. Just grab a fork to eat the other half of the taco that fell out. There's 2 tacos in each order. If you are dining in, they come on separate plates so it's great for sharing. 

My fiance decided to go with the fish and chips. His last lunch in Maui was fish and chips and they were mighty delicious so he was craving them. These were too! It was nice that they included packets of malt vinegar - also came with a side of coleslaw, ketchup and tartar sauce. 

Always great service when we are there and always great food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for a casual dinner while on vacation and it was a good pick! I liked the decor and how laid back it was. The food was light and fresh and I liked my salad - filled me up for the evening. Their fish dishes are what they're known for and I believe their tacos are quite loved. Try it if you're a seafood fan!"}
{"text":"Have eaten there twice now in my world-wide search for a good fish taco and like another reviewer today, I ditto the \"what's the deal with the fish taco hype\" as they really are just average.  I thought the first time maybe it was an off day but then I must've come in on a 2nd off day as well?  Paying what you do for them you'd expect better.  The best fish tacos always seem to be at street vendor shacks in less-developed countries as far as I can tell.  Oh well, on to the search somewhere else.  Though I can't speak for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Wish we would have tried this place a long time ago. I had never heard of it before. But it sure is nice to have a fast casual fish place to go to in our own neighborhood. Love the fried coconut shrimp and fish and chips, but they also have some healthier options of grilled fish sandwiches which I will try next time we go. The service has always been excellent and friendly, and the food is hot fresh and delicious. I also love the outdoor seating in the whole place is spotless."}
{"text":"Simply cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is consistently delicious and the service is always great! The servers greet you with a smile and positive attitude. The coconut shrimp is bomb and the fish taco mountain is my go to. It's enough food for two meals (for me). The fish is always cooked right and the food is so fresh. There's also a nice selection of Hawaiian beer and great island vibes"}
{"text":"Super fresh tacos and hot fresh chowder. 
This place is good quality
Be prepared to spend. 
I purchased 2 fish tacos and cup chowder 
$18.  :).
A little more than I planned to spend for lunch. 
 However -the surf vibe feels like home to me. I guess you can say I was a little mesmerized. The atmosphere, the smells make u feeling like you left AZ 
-great food"}
{"text":"Just experienced my 3rd visit to this great \"new\" place. It's obvious to see that great effort goes into everything the owners intended. The staff is friendly and attentive. The ambiance is true to its roots and the food is amazing. My 1st visit I had their signature fish tacos which immediately became a new fave for me. 2nd trip I tried the steak tacos which almost as impressive. This time I decided to try the fish & chips. While having their own unique take on this staple, I think I will stick to the tacos for maximum enjoyment.  I've also tried the poke and the calamari which are both worthy appetizer dishes. The selection of Hawaiian beers is also pleasant...Scrimshaw being my fave. If you're looking for a new take on fish tacos, this is the place with their famous 17 ingredient version which can only be improved by splashing some of their Tiger Sauce on to give them an extra kick. Mahalo."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp was decent.  I also tried the fish tacos..they definitely do not skimp on the fish, i had to eat a decent amount before I could wrap it up in the tortilla!  It was very filling and very tasty.  I would have the fish tacos again."}
{"text":"Awesome, Amazing, Out of this World Tacos!!! Must try!!! The onion rings and fries are so good!!!! The clam chowder is packed full of seafood! I get the tacos every time, which is 3+ days a week! It's that good! They are healthy too! You don't feel guilty eating them, that's the best part!! This place totally takes you to Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot plain and simple. Menu was ample with choice, prices were right where they should be and not outrageous, given the location. Beer on site was not just the plain dive bar regular stuff, a few microbrews, atmosphere was very relaxing with the option to dine in or out on the patio. Plenty of customer service with a smile and most importantly, the food was great! I had the shrimp tacos which seems to be what they're known for and rightfully so. I will definitely come back whenever in the area but will definitely have a hard time not ordering the same because I definitely want to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"The premiere taco spot for Phoenix Arizona is not even a Mexican joint. Imagine that! Here I am in the southwest and while you can find some incredible Mexican food, my favorite, Coconut's provides a surprising angle on the taco game. With the Hawaiian theme, the fish taco is the must try when ever in the Scottsdale area. Two locations make it a little better for the natives but no so much for travelers since there's not one near the I-10 or West Valley. Either location is in a prime location that's easy to get to with plenty of parking and the staff is always tentative to every order. Very friendly and quick service, if you're hungry you'll eating soon after you arrive or out the door if placing a to go order within minutes whether the place is crowded or not. Another favorite here is the calamari. The pieces are nicely breaded and come in thick chunks almost like big fish sticks. Flavors explode your mouth and you'll be wanting more but be careful, those tacos are pretty hefty in size as they pile on the toppings so you'll have to eat some off the top prior to picking it up to grab a bite. Price is not typical and a little high but after the first bite, the quality assures you of what you paid for. If you live near Scottsdale and haven't tried Coconut's, you'll kick yourself for missing out all this time."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, and delicious. Staff is always so kind too! My favorite place for fish tacos in the valley!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on my visit to Coconuts. I'm not really ever in this area, but found myself out there needing dinner and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi on a bun, and a side of coleslaw. Let me start by saying that the blackened mahi mahi was delicious, but I found the rest to be subpar. The coleslaw was bland... It was cabbage only, with what appeared to be a bland mayo dressing. Coleslaw is one of my favorite things. I'm not sure you can really call cabbage in mayo coleslaw. I didn't even eat my side of coleslaw cause it was so bland. The egg bun was good, but some bagged grated cheese, a single tomato slice, and subpar coleslaw on the sandwich was disappointing... $15 and all I really ate was the fish. I think I'll be skipping Coconuts if I'm back that way."}
{"text":"Took the husband and daughter for a birthday dinner to Coconut's.  The place was empty when we arrived, but started to receive customers near the end of our meal.  Long story short and $45 later buys you a lot of slaw, dressing, tomatoes, mango, etc. but very little fish in the fish tacos:-(  My husband had the fish and chips which were solid pieces and done well with fries.  My daughter had the fish burger and for $11 you would think that fries would come with it.  Again, lot's of dressing and little meat,  However, the seafood chowder was pretty good. Plus my husband had a beer for $5. The place is casual with surfboard tables and benches, 2 big screen tvs showing surfers riding the big wave.  Glad we tried it, but unlike other reviews it didn't make me feel like I was in Hawaii, and yes, I have been and have had better fish in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Great food fast and casual. I find myself dreaming the fish tacos.  I know it is weird but they are so good"}
{"text":"Been here once, will be returning.  

Best.  Fish tacos.  Ever.

Fish delicious, grilled, fresh, and plenty of it.

Fresh, good Hawaiian beer on tap.  

Superb customer service.

They have one other restaurant in Maui, rated best restaurant in Maui and #1 fish tacos in the USA.  I agree with the rating."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5 stars if I could... Because service is great and very friendly. Their coconut shrimp was delicious, amazing, and I'd go back for it. However their claim to fame was apparently their fish tacos. And these tacos were not as good as I expected. The fish was dry. And I mean very dry. Tastes like chicken dry. I had to force it down it was that dry!!! :( and they dip it into this flavoring sauce that makes the tortilla all soggy which made it hard to eat. The taste was ok, not great not bad, but the sogginess was what really ruined it for me. It's not a taco when you only eat the filling with a fork! And this claim to fame makes me question how good their other items are. Had I not gotten that coconut shrimp order, I would have given this place 3 stars. All in all I would only come back for their coconut shrimp and I would never eat their fish again. Customer service is nice so No hard feelings with the employees working."}
{"text":"When we are in town we just stay at the restaurant near Coconut's fish cafe. Because we eat here at least two times a week for dinner. Great fish in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Impeccably clean! Vera was friendly and very knowledgeable and the entire time we were there Vera made sure our meal was as expected and then some and did I mention it was clean???? Vera kept the space so spotless we literally felt bad for having scraps fall off our extremely delicious and loaded fish tacos.  A must visit if you're around as you'll be hard pressed to find another fish taco like it."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in town! Great restaurant with an aloha vibe. Ordered the poke bowl today which I really enjoyed. A great, healthy restaurant to go to for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are unlike any I've had elsewhere and very good. Two tacos is a meal too. 

The calamari was excellent, large steak cut into strips. 

Strip mall location but nice decor with (very) small outdoor area too. Limited menu. 

Beer and wine served."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best fish tacos I've had in Phoenix.  Mango? On a taco?  Oh yeah!!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in my meal for its price. I ordered Coconut Shrimp and the Mahi Mahi fish and chips.

The Coconut Shrimp was delicious but it only had 6 small shrimp. 

The Mahi in the fish and chips was good but the the breading did not really work with thier dill tarter sauce. The \"chips\" were just thin cut french fries and not true chips you would expect with fish and chips. The fish and chips also came with coleslaw but it was basically just cabbage with a splash of something reminiscent of coconut."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Had the shrimp & chips and my daughter had the kids fish & chips.  This place has great staff, it's very clean (even smells like Hawaii!), and the food was great!  Will be coming here again!!  Welcome to Scottsdale Coconut's!"}
{"text":"We had not been here before but it is convenient to Shea 14 where we planned to see a movie. It is not a full service restaurant: you walk up to a counter where an employee explains the menu including food and beverages. It does take plastic.  Nonalcoholic drinks are self serve.  Beer and wine are available.  When your food is ready, it is delivered.  My wife got the fish tacos and declared them 5 star. I got coconut shrimp as a meal and thought they were three star, very greasy and low flavor. It included fries and rice. A friend got baked fish on rice and was happy enough.  Service was adequate for meal delivery and dish pickup so I tipped about 11%."}
{"text":"A bit better than I thought it was going to be...  my wife and I both got Poke bowls.  They were both actually pretty good, though my wife says that she prefers the Poke bowls at Pei Wei.  Slightly pricey but not terrible, and overall it was a nice place and a nice experience."}
{"text":"At last, a place that centers around healthy and tasty ways to prepare fish, not smothering it in batter and grease. The place has a fun Hawaiian surf theme, complete with tables shaped like inverted surfboards and large flatscreens showing videos (no audio, which is good) of surfers and giant waves. The fish taco mountain I ordered was a delight -- perfectly grilled chunks of fish over brown rice, with a tangy mango salsa and a flavorful dressing with what seems to be a zestful hint of wasabi. The place is extremely clean and very bright, the service is friendly, and there is also a patio area for semi- al fresco dining."}
{"text":"We loved the fish tacos and the friendly service. It was a good price and don't even get me started on the coconut shrimp (outta this world!). Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place. We have eaten here dozens of times and have never been let down. Their staff is always over the top friendly and the restaurant is always 100% spotless!

Seafood Chowder - Piping hot, rich and delicious! Lots of fish in the tasty broth served with oyster crackers and I add a dash of Tabasco.

Fish Tacos - Delicious grilled fish topping double semi crisp tortillas on a bed of pico style salsa, slaw, cheese and mango. Sooooo good! You can't pick them up because they are so huge. These are knife and fork tacos.

Fish & Chips - The fish is lightly breaded and very moist. Think English fish and chips. Their chips (fries) aren't anything special but they still are good. 

Calamari - Lightly breaded strips of calamari fried but super moist. It is a big order for an appetizer, I would say it is a meal sized portion."}
{"text":"The fish and chips was delicious and everyone there was very nice. I heard about the original Coconut's in Maui from my boss and now know why she loved it so much. I will definitely be a regular now."}
{"text":"Not impressed, I was so wanting to like this place.  Close to home and so many great reviews.  Cute decor and friendly staff.   That is where it ends.   For $11.00 you get 2 small tortillas with some chunks of fish and chopped cabbage.  It was not special, just OK.   I've had better from food trucks in Arkansas.  There were quite a few diners, so they may have some other entrees that are better.   Their ads really over rate the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place is legit for lunch or dinner. The food is fresh which is key when having seafood that is not breaded and fried. the staff is very helpful and nice. The eating area is always clean. I try to go here when im in the mood for fish and im in the area."}
{"text":"Boy, the concept of this place is genius! Great food for people who want GOOD, fresh, casual food. This is NOT \"fast food,\" - so don't expect a $5 dollar dinner. This place is winning awards and racking up all kinds of great reviews! It is well deserved, too!
As much as I have always loved Arizona, those of us from the coast are hesitant to order fish when we are inland. Call it attitude, but that usually comes from experience. I thought I was going to have to go to Roy's everytime I craved my favorite Hawaiian white fish. 
Coconuts follows the Hawaiian local style of fresh and friendly. They do fish so well, and so many ways.....there is something for everyone. Mahi Mahi was the first fish that won me over when I tasted someone else's - blackened. Ono is now the fish I crave. So, If you have someone that isn't a fish eater, introduce them to the sweet goodness of Ono (Hawaiian word for \"delicious\"),  Opakapaka, and Mahi. Just ask the staff that work here, and they will help you understand the differences, your choices of preparation, etc.
I'm a fish taco lover. I tried for a long time to eat them the healthy way -  with grilled fish......and found they were flavorless. They relied on the breading and frying to give the tacos flavor. It's because most restaurants use Cod, which doesn't have much flavor. Coconuts uses a grilled combo of Mahi and Ono, and WOW......what a great taco!! This redefines any idea of fish taco you've had. You get both the smokiness of the grill and the natural sweetness of the fish. Then they top it with the crunch of their coconut-milk based coleslaw and fresh mango salsa. This is not a taco you hold, so get a knife and fork ready. 2 tacos....$10.99, but you may not finish the 2nd one. Trust me - someone at your table will help you finish! No one in our party left anything on our plates! 
My husband ordered the fish-and-chips.....and I asked him \"WHY?\" He keeps ordering fish-and-chips and being disappointed. Even at some of the most reputed Irish restaurants in the area, the fish has been bland and greasy. Well......not here. Coconuts uses the Mahi for this dish, as it is both flavorful and steak-like in quality and holds up well. My husband was finally in fish-and-chips heaven with great fish, well seasoned breading, and not a bit greasy. Dinner for two with soda was $28.
The ambiance of this place is a light, happy, surf vibe. There are chicken and pasta dishes on the menu for the \"fish-dubious\" - and they also serve wine and good Hawaiian  beer. The staff stopped by often just to make sure we liked our food, if we needed anything, or just to converse and be friendly. They are very proud of this place, having fun - and it shows. I just wish the patio was bigger, but this place is - as we say in Southern California ....\"way bitchin\" and on Maui.....Coconuts is \"no ka oi.\"  Coconuts broke da mouf, fo sure."}
{"text":"Coconut's serves up the best fish tacos on the planet. I've been to the Arizona and Maui locations and they are phenomenal. The tacos feature delicious grilled fish, cole slaw, mango and other awesome toppings. You get two giant tacos with one order. We've also tried the fish and chips (both are great), the teriyaki chicken bowl and the taco salad. All are winners. Love that they serve Longboard draft beer from Kona Brewing Company, too. For a small cafe-style restaurant, it is on the expensive side (maybe they're just trying to replicate the real Hawaiian experience of paying top dollar for normal stuff). Glad to see it's soon coming to Los Angeles, where I live!"}
{"text":"Such a cute islands atmosphere. The staff were super friendly. Ordered the chicken Caesar salad....,, yum!  The wait for the salad was longer than I expected"}
{"text":"I was here with my daughter because she said this place is great and loved the food. I was hesitant because I don't like fish tacos and that seemed to be what they were known for and trying to get me to buy. I ended up getting the steak tacos and fries instead. The tacos had very different toppings from your typical tacos and honestly it was phenomenal. My daughter enjoyed her shrimp. We both enjoyed the fries. I was impressed by one of the staff members wiping down each and every bottle of condiments with sanitizer wipes. That told me they keep it clean! I like that! The staff were all very friendly and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like this place and recommend it if you're in the mood for fish! Poke is great, fish tacos are two huge tacos that you can actually share. Travis was super friendly and helpful and really looked like he was enjoying helping us. That's refreshing these days. I love the tiger sauce, whatever you do, try that tiger sauce...so good! 

They have plenty of seating inside and a nice patio outside. I will return again soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"Oh my the best Ono, if you went to a fancy restaurant it would cost you double (at least)...I just got it with butter, salt & pepper and it was grilled to perfection! Make sure you get the calamari appetizer, no rings here!"}
{"text":"This place is located among other eating places in a retail shopping area.  Ignore those places... run, don't walk, to Coconut's Fish Cafe.  The restaurant is meticulously maintained and is very clean (even restrooms).  Staff are friendly and very helpful.  Because of some questions I had about a dish, the front desk person inquired about my tolerance for spices.  She had a suggestion that was helpful. Now the food... great portion size, great flavor, great presentation... I'm thinking overall it was... great.  We had fish and chips and the fish taco mountain.  We will be back to Coconut's Fish Cafe when we are back in the area... and, we are bringing more family."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different so I dropped by. The place looks nice, clean and new. The menu looked good but I though the prices were high, oh it was so worth it. I ordered the seafood soup and my wife got the fish tacos.  One bite and I knew they were doing things right.  Food was awesome and the staff was friendly and helpfull. Great place and great food. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my fav spots in Scottsdale.  Super affordable and the food quality is fantastic!  Service is really good the employees are really friendly, has a laid back island vibe."}
{"text":"Went to get some fish tacos because of the reviews.  Place was very nice and clean - had the Rubios vibe in the setup.  I ordered their fish tacos and my partner the fish n chips..  Tacos were huge, not a lot of fish..more cabbage than anything.  Added some Chalula and they weren't bad.  The fish n chips was so so.  My partner wished he would have ordered the grilled fish because that looked really good!

The new thing we tried was the spicy poke w chips and boy oh boy it was really good!!!  Great fresh flavor.  I'm curious about the bowls now.  I may be tempted to go back to try it.

I like the place enough to go back now that I know what I like."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the fish tacos are to die for, but just tried their calamari this last time and it was beyond amazing as well. I definitely recommend this place if you're interested in a fresh, delicious lunch with a slightly different taste than all those Mexican or wannabe restaurants.

Only downside: they're open at 11, and I'd like to see stop by earlier to grab am early lunch! ;)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my coconut shrimp.  Overall, food seemed fresh and good. A bit on the pricey side. Friendly workers. Just wasn't overwhelmed but don't regret going there. Will try it again."}
{"text":"This place is amaaAAAaaazing. I ordered a fish sandwich -- ono, spicy -- and it was incredibly delicious. I immediately wanted seconds, but settled for the last two bites of my girlfriends equivalently delicious fish tacos. This place really captures the Island flavors I haven't had since I was last in Kauai. Even better, everyone was nice and friendly and you could just tell everyone enjoyed working there, heck, even the guy wiping down tables. Coconut's will be a must stop for me every time I visit the Scottsdale area. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best places for grilled fish! Love the seafood salad specially the Cajun and blackened seasoning!! The poke is amazing and fresh!! Will be back every other week  healthy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Coconut's isn't the first Hawaiian chain to hit the valley and it almost certainly won't be the last.  But to be fair to owner Michael Phillips, this is one Hawaiian chain that really can trace it's roots back to the islands.  I personally have not yet visited our 50th state, but I've sampled a fair share of Hawaiian cuisine at valley spots like Hula's, Leo's Island BBQ, and a number of poke shops.  With their original location still operating in Maui, Coconut's now has locations throughout California and Arizona.  On a Sunday at lunchtime, I wandered into Coconut's Shea location.

Located in the Harkins Shea 14 complex on the northwest side of 74th Street & Shea Blvd, Coconut's resides just a few doors down from the theatre.  There's room for I'd guess about 60-70 at a time with the majority of seating out on the patio.  Order up front here, grab a number, and they bring the good stuff out to you.  As today was well into the triple digits, I happily planted myself inside amongst the surfboard smooth wooden seating.

Now then, to the important stuff.  There were two menu items that stood out both from Yelp reviews as well as per the manager on duty.  First off, their Coconut Shrimp appetizer.  Six shrimp battered in coconut and then fried.  Plus they're served with a thai chili pineapple sauce.  Secondly, their Fish Tacos, the dish that apparently made Coconut's famous.  17 ingredients are in each of these tacos altogether, but here are the important highlights:  Ono and Mahi Mahi fish, cheese, coleslaw, tomato salsa, and mango salsa on a pair of corn tortillas.  Lastly, I got a beer.  In this case, a Hanalei Island IPA from Hawaii's very own Kona Brewing.  Total cost for the food, drink, and tax came to about $30.  The verdict?

The IPA was incredibly refreshing, slightly fruity, and with a mellow hoppiness that goes down easy.  The coconut shrimp each had a great crunch and the chili pineapple sauce gives you the flavors of both without the pain.  I could've eaten dozens of these.  Lastly, the main event.  The tacos.  These tacos are piled ridiculously high so good luck biting into these without half the ingredients falling onto your plate.  If you can keep it altogether for at least the first bite, you will be as impressed as Zagat apparently was.  An explosion of flavors & textures that match the array of colors that make up this taco.  I really loved the mix of different salsas to give the tacos extra depth.  Two tacos were more than enough to satisfy my appetite.

So yeah, I get why this place has caught fire.  The price point versus the portion sizes might be slightly on the high side for some, but the quality of the food is such that I didn't mind paying a few extra bucks.  And as other Yelpers have noted, the staff are over the top friendly here and were incredibly knowledgable about the menu and the restaurant's backstory.  With all the Hawaiian restaurants I've been to in the valley, seems like the only logical next step would be to book a flight to the islands at my next opportunity and get the genuine article.  Someday, Hawaii, someday."}
{"text":"Really amazing fish tacos. Just like in Maui. Kid friendly and great service. The calamari strips were perfectly cooked and served warm - could have been a larger portion (or maybe they just didn't match the fish taco portions which were huge). Keiki menu got the hot dog and fries for our bears. They loved em."}
{"text":"a nice change from typical fast food. I had the blackened mahi burger and fries. There was plenty to share with my friend.  We'll seasoned and fairly reasonably priced. I'll be returning here again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cocunut's since it opened.  We have always enjoyed their food.  The restaurant is the cleanest in the Valley.  The staff are always nice, friendly and efficient.  It is pleasant to watch the surf videos.

BUT the food has gone downhill in the last few months.  We usually eat there on a Sunday or Saturday at lunch.  We get blackened fish.  We first noticed a problem when the cooking was inconsistent and you'd hope the bad patch was over. The next time might be spot on - the next time mediocre. The fish was being overcooked so it was tough.  It is hard to cook fish so it is moist but cooked through.  Whoever was cooking before did an excellent job.

Today we ordered blackened fish and what came out was lacking in seasoning altogether.  It's pretty bad when a blackened dish only has flavor when you put tartar sauce on it. 

I really like the restaurant and hope they'll review this.  If people were complaining that they wanted bland food, well, I guess that is what they are offering now."}
{"text":"We tried the coconut shrimp appetizer which was excellent with large shrimp and the coconut was obvious. The sweet sauce was wonderful. I had fried shrimp and fries which were good served with a smokey, spicy cocktail sauce.  Tacos looked great but we didn't try them. Great beer selection. Covered patio was perfect because the weather is beautiful but is equipped with heat, fans and ac. Great service!"}
{"text":"Well they give you a lot of fries.  Coconuts is certainly not Ivars.  The fish is good but the batter too heavy.  The coldslaw tasted funny like it was not fresh.  The tartar sauce was good with dill.  We just moved to the neighhoid and likely won't be back.  The music is too loud."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location several times, as well as the original location on Maui. The taco mountain - with ono and mahi - is my favorite. Great place for lunch, but go early as it gets busy!"}
{"text":"Get the local plate with the blackened mahi mahi and the coconut shrimp. It's so fresh. Love the ambiance. Makes you definitely feel like you're in Hawaii. From the reggae/Hawaiian music to the surf board tables. The staff made awesome recommendations and after serving us our food they meticulously cleaned the place. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was amazed! Locals tell me that there is only this location and the one in Maui.

Hands-down the best coconut fried shrimp appetizer I've ever had in my life. Fried to perfection, with the most delicious sweet chili sauce.  

Then you get to the fish tacos. Every one that you order includes the fish and their 17 ingredients, including a coconut milk-based slaw! The only downside where they lose a star in my opinion was the fish was a little dry.

Also it was a little strange that it was the middle of the lunch hour, and each time we went up to get a fork or knife, they didn't have any cleaned and ready.  Maybe an off day?

Only minor issues... I definitely recommend that you try this place!  I also loved that it was casual... You order at the counter and then they bring you the food."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were so good that I had to come back 4 days later and I live across town! For a gluten free person to find something so delicious is wonderful! Thanks Coconuts! Come to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and Chelsea and another girl (didn't catch her name) took our order at the register. They both were so pleasant and always smiling. The food was awesome! We had the coconut shrimp, fish tacos, and one other dish that I forgot the name of, but it all was great!"}
{"text":"I was staying a hotel nearby and this place came highly recommended by the hotel staff. Several said that this has become their favorite place to eat in the valley. I am not a big fan of fish or fish tacos, but decided to give this place a try to see if I could be swayed. I was pleasantly surprised, the \"Perfect Fish Tacos\" were excellent. The mango salsa was really good. The two tacos were quite filling. I was most impressed by the service - very friendly, patient given that it was my first visit and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the wasabi hint in the coleslaw. Makes me miss Maui!"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere was AMAZING. A great spot to unwind and enjoy fresh air and tasty food. 

I got the Poke Bowl, and was in love with every bites flavour. The portion was excellent and I seriously have no complaints whatsoever.

Fianc√© purchased the fish and chips and loved the flavor of his dish, the only complaint he had was it had only 2 small filets and wasn't a good amount of food for the price.

Overall, tasty, fun, and we will definitely be coming again! We wish there was one close to home so we could always go!

We also used the check in offer for 25% off an appetizer, and got the calamari which was hands down the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place out last night. It's located right next to Carlos O'Brien s, has a nice parking lot layout.  The place is decorated with a Hawaiian theme with flat screens playing surfing videos. 

We ordered with the gal at the front counter and she was SUPER nice and giving recommendations on drinks and such but didn't really tell us what to expect or how the routine was. We didn't realize that you're supposed to get your own silver, napkins, condiments, etc. 

We ordered 3 mains, 3 appetizers, and 2 beers and a tea, and the bill before tip came to over $82.00 which gave us all a little shock. We didn't have a problem with the bill; most places in Scottsdale are about this price BUT usually, the places that charge $20 or more per person also include table service and a set table. 

We had the calamari appetizer, the coconut shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, fish & chips, and a chowder. The calamari was excellent, the coconut shrimp was very decent (good dipping sauce-sweet/spicy but I suspect frozen). My dad loved his tacos, my mom not so much (she felt like they could have put more fish and less fluff cabbage on it, especially since you're paying over 10 bucks for just two tacos). I loved my fish (great breading on the mahi!) but the chips were obviously frozen shoestring potatoes that they had fried up on order. Don't get me wrong, they tasted decent enough but maybe they shouldn't say everything is made from scratch when it isn't....My husband thought the chowder was nothing special as it tasted like canned chowder soup that they had tossed previously frozen seafood bits into and doctored up. My folks couldn't stop raving about the beers though!

The food was out to us in under 10 minutes after ordering which surprised us as the dining area was full of people. We had food runner (maybe a supervisor of sorts?) who was nice enough to grab silver and etc for us but he was BAKED. (red eyes, delay in reaction, awkward interactions-the guy was not only baked but was something closed to SUPER baked :P). The guy was really nice but it was pretty darn obvious. 

The food was really good but the casual atmosphere just doesn't match the price points that they have going and almost serves as a deterrent from going on the regular. I would hate to see this place close due to greedy prices but I fear that's the path they are taking :/"}
{"text":"I love having this healthy option near home.  I have been here twice now and I enjoyed it every time.  I keep having the same thing because it was so delicious.  The local fish is a platter with grilled fish, any way you like it.  I always choose the south of the border, it is spicy, but not burn your tongue spicy.  I love it.   You also get the cole slaw and tomatoes and onions.  I never eat all my brown rice.  I was glad that the second time I got it, the amount of rice was smaller, I still left about half of it on the plate.  I am a portion conscious person and I think the piece of fish is really big.  My hubby had the seafood salad and it was delicious, I stole one of his grilled shrimp.  The first time the wait was a little long, but it was the first week they were open.  The second time the food was out within 20 minutes, which is very reasonable.  This will definitely be in my rotation."}
{"text":"I don't normally do fish tacos except in Hawaii and Cali and I can't lie I am addicted to this place. Best fish taco, so tender and plain fabulous!"}
{"text":"Interesting - better than average for fairly fast adult food.  Fun decor - I guess the inspiration came from Hawaii.  If you're in the mood for some good seafood tacos etc give this one a tryl  Oh - does load up with customers - go early or plan to wait in line."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed.  I had the fishburger and my partner had the local grill.  With fries, drinks, and a cup of soup, we wound up spending over $40 for what amounted to fast food.  The food was okay, but horribly overpriced.  Sorry--unless you're made of money, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Long Board, fish tacos and coconut shrimp....heaven.  Full house, sevice still great and friendly.  Consistently good food is wonderful and fresh!"}
{"text":"I am happy  happy  happy!   Best fish tacos, and cold Long Board...oh my gawd!   Will I  be back?  Um, YES!  Often, you bet!  Will I be in Hawaii soon?  Yes.  Did I  have a Hawaii moment today?  Yup, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"For the type of food it was, it was okay. I got a fish and rice bowl and my husband got the fish tacos. We also ordered the taro chips and the coconut shrimp. In the cabbage slaw on both of our entrees there was an awful lot of horse radish which was a little offputting. It could have been a really good meal if the mangoes were ripe. The best part of the meal was the coconut shrimp. I was raised by true Hawaiians and I feel like this was not Hawaiian food in the slightest. Just because you use ingredients that are found in the islands doesn't make it Hawaiian. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm always super wary of \"fast\" fish joints, esp ones that also serve Poke bowl (in the middle of the desert). But Coconuts surprised me - the Poke bowl was fantastic! Fresh, large and definitely a great combo of ingredients. We also had the Mahi Mahi fish and chips - pretty darn yummy as well. The restaurant is very casual, not much to the counter/seating, almost looks like a temporary set up. I was especially impressed that there was a baby changing table built into the women's bathroom wall (so you know it wasn't put in later). I know, it's a weird thing to notice, but I appreciated that the owners had the forethought to think about their customers. The only cons are the seating. The tables are round tops and surfboard shaped longs. There is not enough room to put everything! It felt very crowded. All in all would return :)."}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming to Coconuts. It's a great alternative to the ubiquitous burger or taco places. The food is delicious and healthful and the staff always friendly. If you're undecided, try the Cajun style Mahi over brown rice- yummy!"}
{"text":"Finally ! Perfectly grilled fish! The Taco Mountain with Ono & MahiMahi was excellent! The owner Kim is a real nice guy too. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I tried this place about a year ago and keep coming back. The food is amazing and the service is superb!!  The manager is always so gracious as well as the staff. I have tried  North Scottsdale and  Shea and they never disappoint .
Give it a try."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The fish tastes so fresh. The fish tacos are amazing. The first time we went the chef was walking around greeting everybody and the second time the owner or manager was walking around to every table and talking to people. That's impressive as good service is so hard to find. Can't wait to check out the Maui location in a few weeks."}
{"text":"I got their fish tacos, with no mango salsa, and OMG! Best Fish Taco I have ever had. The service was quick and the staff were all very friendly. Their hot sauce is amazing as well, I would recommend this place 100%!"}
{"text":"Our second time here, yay!

These people are an interesting mix of talent, and somebody really did a great job hiring. Congrats. 


Kristen (on the left) and Chelsea (right), waiting timidly for the next customer. 

This is their normal pose at the counter.  
They are required to be amazing and fun to work with--or else!


Full of energy and charm, Chelsea knows the menu well, and this crew really take care of business.

This reflects well on the ownership when their people, who work day in and day out, make their customers feel appreciated and important.


I had the fish tacos again, and two of them were plenty filling. Fresh, with nice fresh chunks of mango. Tasty stuff. 

no matter how big or fancy anyone thinks their business establishment is, and whatever business you're in, the only activity that really matters is getting, and keeping customers. 

Nothing matters more. 

#1 Getting. 
#2 Keeping. 

This is a must-visit.

{"text":"BOMB DOT COM!

Fish Tacos & Coconut shrimp, every time!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy delicious, and eating there makes you feel like you're in Hawaii. Delicious fresh fish, and some of the best calamari I've ever had. Fantastic beer on tap...what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Very reasonable for fast casual fish place. Fish tacos are really tasty. Also have beer and wine. Just don't go expecting gourmet style food"}
{"text":"This place took me back to Hawaii. Fresh fish tacos and coconut shrimp. All I needed was a drink in hand and the dandy each and I would have been in heaven. Fries were tasty but not very impressed with the cole slaw. Tasted just like mayonnaise in cabbage. Nothing special there but the rest of the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I'm always greeted by friendly servers and staff here, and definitely served in a timely manner. The fish seems to be pretty fresh but I'm more satisfied with their poke bowls. The portion sizes are extremely generous but the sauce tends to be laid on quite thickly. Aside from that, the seafood seems to always be well seasoned and cooked nicely!"}
{"text":"Yummy fish tacos! However after eating the 2 that came in my order I was still wanting more. Tasty but not filling enough."}
{"text":"Some of the best seafood in town. Good customer service and quick in and out. Told all my friends and will continue to go there. I would recommend the fish and chips or the shrimp."}
{"text":"Started with the coconut shrimp with a Thai chili pineapple sauce, excellent.  Next up both the wife and I had the standard fish tacos.  The fish was well cooked and flaky, not dry at all.  The real star though was the mango chutney and the combo of other sauces which were piled on top.  A very solid addition to the north Scottsdale food selection."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews about there fish tacos I had to check this place out for my self. This place was a pretty awesome place I really liked the tables that were shaped like surfboards. The food was really good and healthy. Like others have said the fish tacos were good but not the best. The prices were a bit high for lunch but then again fish isn't really cheap. This place also offers local Hawaiian beer which I also thought was cool. Overall if you looking for a place thats healthy and good this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's the only place I trust to get really good fish fast.  Everything we've had has been great, especially the fish & chips, the taco mountain (so much food...two people can split it), and the fish sandwich.  Also, this place introduced me to Tiger Sauce...had never seen it before.  It goes great on their stuff, and now I know that you can also get it in the grocery store."}
{"text":"This was so good.  I haven't had poki since I was in Hawaii.  It was delicious.  Casual but nice.  Friendly staff.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in Scottsdale for a quick Mahi taco or burger. I've had just about everything on their menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Atmosphere to the food is on point. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed the Maui location and were pleasantly surprised to find Coconut's touch of aloha here in AZ. Although we experienced a minor issue with our first order, the manager Bailey immediately called wanting to resolve the problem. Our next visit matched our Maui expectations as we thoroughly enjoyed both our \"local-style\" Mahi-mahi and Ono plates. Casual atmosphere and staff are? energetic and friendly, making sure that we enjoyed? our dining experience. Nice touch of aloha here in the desert."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos I've ever had.  This place is amazing."}
{"text":"I love the concept and the space, it always smells great when you walk in! I just wish it was more affordable. The price is just a bit much for what you get. I've had two taco mountains that were more like taco hills than mountains, very disappointing for what it costs."}
{"text":"I have patronized this restaurant 2x in the past 10 days.  Love it!  Had the fish tacos both times.  The staff is awesome.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere is perfect.  The famous fish tacos are sold in pairs.  The only change would be to sell the tacos 1 per order.  Sometimes you want 2 and sometimes you only want one or maybe you want 3 to share!  Otherwise, it is all good."}
{"text":"We loved Coconuts while living on Maui  and were so pleased to discover it was just down the street from us. It's just as good as the original and we would definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos. Very much like a \"Yahoo's\" if you are familiar. Quick , friendly service. A bit pricey, but the fish tasted fresh and the portion was large. Will go again."}
{"text":"I had read such great things about the Maui location and was happy to have one in Chandler. I had great expectations but was disappointed. The fish was dry."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had first tried Coconuts when I was in Maui and it was so good! It's a small kind of fast food vibe and it's not fancy by any means but the food is so good. The shrimp tacos are delicious. 
It is a bit pricey for what it is but I love it, probably because of the Maui nostalgia."}
{"text":"Clean place with super staff. Lots of variety on menu. Food was very fresh but something missing in the flavor of my fish tacos. However my wife was very pleased."}
{"text":"This place is great the price is a bit high but in my option it's well worth the drive for me the calamari is my favorite"}
{"text":"I was impressed! This was my first time to eat Fish Tacos. So nice taste!! Price, not cheap, but value price. I also ordered Coconut Shrimp. It was also good taste. But portion was small and price was a little bit not reasonable. I stronglly recommend to order Fish Tacos! I hope to taste other dishes."}
{"text":"What a great place! The food is amazing and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They are proud of their food, and rightfully so. As a group of 4 we shared 2 orders of fish tacos and 2 orders of coconut shrimp for a light dinner. It was the perfect amount of food and reasonably priced. They have a nice little selection of beer and wine, as well as a fun atmosphere. The fish on the tacos  tasted fresh and the toppings were the perfect compliment. You won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch yesterday and had a great experience.  I had high expectations since the reviews were so good...and it did not disappoint!  We both tried the grilled fish tacos with coleslaw, cheese, tomatoes and mango salsa on top - beware these are not easy to eat, but worth the mess!"}
{"text":"This place is very delicious! The fish they serve is Hawaiian Ono and Mahi and grilled to perfection. Very tasty but dangerously tasty when put together with their taco! We also loved the coconut shrimp and calamari. Great friendly staff, nice clean and new, great atmosphere, love the music!!

 Love love love coconuts!!"}
{"text":"Was out running errands and got hungry. Looked up restaurants in my area and up came Coconuts.  I will keep this short and sweet. Service, cleanliness, atmosphere and food were all excellent. The only negative thing, and really it's a small issue, is they don't allow you to get different proteins on the tacos. Again not even close to a deal breaker for me. Just my first time and want to try the steak and chicken. No problem!! Will be back to try fish or chicken tacos!! Excellent place!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my room mate ate here today for lunch.  The decor is nice, and the service overall was friendly.  I thought the fish taco was good, my room liked the chicken on his chicken taco.  We both picked certain things we don't care to eat off our tacos, and at the end of our meal, a gentleman I presume is the owner or at least the manager came over and basically told us that we should order something else if we don't like something, because in their opinion, the food tastes best when you eat everything that comes on it by design.  Neither of us cared for his wording, or the way he talked to us."}
{"text":"This place has put a lot into itself. Very high production value, the food is great, however when I walked in the cashier said \"aloha\" so cheesy. I would of just turned around and left, but I was not alone. Food was good. I'm not sure what to make of the attitude"}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe is a fantastic, Five Stars fish cafe.

The five of us drove here on our lunch hour and lucky us, there were only a few customers in line. Nice!  A good sign, when UR working against a clock. 

I ordered the P√≥ke (Photo) for $11.99 which was outstanding.  I love fresh Tuna and Coconut's might be some of the best I've every had.  Order it and see!

My coworkers ordered, the Chicken Tacos for $11.99, Steak Tacos (Photos) for $11.49, Fish Taco for $10.99 and a cup of Chowder for $5.74. Add in a few IPAs, or soft drinks and we all averaged about $15 each.

I tried my friend Josh's Fish Tacos and his was great, too.  So why they Four Star review, Georgie? Well the non fish group thought theirs was average. Okay, so you go to a place called Coconut's Fish Cafe and you order chicken and steak?  I'm sorry, that is so LOL. 

Step away from the meat taco guys and no one will get hurt!  Order the Poke, Fish or Shrimp Tacos and you'll fall in love with Coconut's Fish Cafe as I did.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos. Fresh toppings. Good service. Loved the experience. Mahi Mahi was awesomely grilled. Overall I would like to go back anytime."}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant  is diffinately over rated and over priced.  Our food was cold, under cooked and expensive.  You walk up to the counter and order, pay and then sit down and wait for your food.  We ordered a salad, fish & chips, two soft drinks, the bills was $37.00.

The salad was ok, but the fish and chips was gross.  We threw it out and left and are never going back.  SAVE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"absolutely love the fish taco's, I have not had any better. The place is very casual and super busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"We originally found Coconut's during vacation in Maui years ago - I thought I was seeing a mirage when I started working in Scottsdale and found this location, but it's true! Coconut's is a small chain with only a few locations, and 2 of them are in the Phoenix area. It's almost unfair that I can enjoy incredible fish tacos without the trip to Maui (although I'm sure I can come up with another excuse to go). 

We've stopped in here a couple times during the lunch hour - it gets busy, but not crazy. Regardless of what time you come in, you'll be able to get a seat, but if you're bringing a group, try to get in by 11:45 am. 

They've got their famous fish tacos (2 for $11), which are enormous spreads of grilled fish filets on corn tortillas, covered in an amazing mango salsa. Steak tacos are similar, and equally great. There are also classics like Fish & Chips, or healthier plates like salmon, rice, and veggies. This is a great place to bring seafood-curious kids, too - surfboards and pictures of the beach adorn the place, and servers throw around \"shakas\" like currency. As much as possible, Coconut's brings some Aloha to the sweltering heat of North Scottsdale. 

This location already has top billing in our lunch rotation. We'll be back! :-)"}
{"text":"These tacos are so good I haven't been here for weeks and simply thinking about them right now has me writing  this review. **and a big thank you to marissa for the great hospitality**"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food. We ordered carry out.. Went to pick it up and I was impressed by the nice decor and cool surfboard tables complete with fin sticking up. The order was nicely packaged, and they were friendly.

The food however was pretty darned pathetic.  

Fish and chips: How can you make a bad french fry? I am not sure but Coconuts succeeded. The fries were very, very, very salty to the point where I considered washing them in the sink and putting them in the oven to dry. The fish was a strange rectangular slab of unidentifiable whitish fish, with an appearance like it was bought in the supermarket freezer section next to Mrs Paul's fish sticks. The tartar sauce was probably the worst tasting that I ever had. The cole slaw had less flavor than plain chopped cabbage, which was a good description of this tasteless veggie side. They have perfected low flavor chopped cabbage.

Shrimp and chips: The fries suffered from death by salt like the above fish and chips. I think they must add some other weird spice because these just taste bad. Worst french fries of my life. The shrimp was dry and the breading uninspiring. Flavor and texture was 4 out of 10.

Coconut shrimp: these were ok, but only on par with ones you get at the Chili's restaurant at an airport.

Macadamia Crusted Mahi: This was ok, but only ok.

I am shocked this place gets more than 3.5 stars. I suppose they have gone on an aggressive campaign with family and friends to boost their ratings. The location and decor are nice, but I grade heavily on quality and taste of food, and this place fails.

Final verdict. I will never eat at this place again. the food is just plain pathetic."}
{"text":"If this restaurant was closer to my house, I'd come here a lot! The fish tacos are huge and delicious! Love their mango salsa! I do wish you could order just one taco. Two is too much for me and reheated tacos are kinda icky. Personally, I like the coleslaw with its slight wasabi taste to it, but my husband doesn't prefer it. 

My husband thought the steak taco was good but nothing special. 

Last trip my husband ordered taro chips. I thought he was crazy but they turned out to be surprisingly delicious. 

They have a pineapple coconut tea that is TO DIE FOR!!! I absolutely love it!! If I could get just one taco and the tea, I'd make the drive here much more often. It would be my crack. 

All this being said, service is spotty. It's quite common for someone to come by to see if you need anything but 90% of the time they've never brought the requested item to us. I think they're too busy to be able to do more than deliver the food and clean tables, but they try."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Can't believe we did not see this place when in Maui. Mahi salad, coconut shrimp and fish and chips were all delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful. We can't wait to go back for more! And when we go back to Maui we will go again."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is pricey but the food is clean and delicious. Wife had a salad with Ahi Tuna and I had the Mahi Mahi plate with rice and veggies. The fish was cooked perfectly. My daughter got the kids pasta for $6 which is nuts so probably won't come back with the kid, by will definitely be back myself for more delicious fish."}
{"text":"Cute place to grab a quick bite. Fish tacos were a bit dry and didn't really like the breading on the fish n chips, could be better if it was tempura.  Fish is very mild, no fishy taste."}
{"text":"Although the prices are a little on the high end I would still say the quality of the fish is worth it. Go for the fish tacos and you won't be disappointed. I always appreciate a restaurant with quality ingredients over one that just tries to dump as much flavor into one dish as possible."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants.  This was a great find.  Amazing Coconut Shrimp, Fish Tacos, and Fish N Chips.  Highly recommend.  Some of the best fish tacos I have had."}
{"text":"First - get the fish sandwich - it is delectable and fresh...yum!  Try the coconut shrimp - the dipping sauce is amazing.  We ate at Coconuts Maui and found out we had one in our own backyard :). Owner is a great guy saw him here and in Maui - crazy."}
{"text":"It's not cheap but the food is great and really worth it.  The fish tacos are not to be missed and I really enjoyed the fish and chips, too.  

The service is quite good; you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.  Last time I was there, I noticed the staff working very hard to ask customers what more they needed, clear tables and just generally keep the place clean and keep things moving.  The employees are unfailingly friendly.

This is a good place.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Great place! I was afraid they would have Talapia in their fish tacos. I was pleasantly surprised to know they do not serve Talapia.

It is a nice clean unpretentious restaurant with pleasant employees. The food is unique fresh and delicious. I will return."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is amazing and really fresh. We've been coming here pretty much every second weekend because I just can't stay away 
I always get fish tacos and those are amazing. So far my bf tried their pasta, shrimp and chips and Cajun mahi mahi-all amazing!!! The prices are a bit on the high side but you get what you pay for-YUMMY FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very difficult review to write for me.  This place does have pretty good fish tacos.  Probably the best in the area.  They are big and full of fresh ingredients.  The fish isn't fried and wasn't too dry, but could use a bit more flavor (give me a squirt bottle of secret sauce, not Cholula hot sauce).

Here are my main issues:

1 - The tacos are too damn big.  It is impossible to eat them without making a complete mess.  Why not give 4 easy-to-eat tacos rather than 2 that are impossible to eat.
2 - Why 2 plates (one for each taco) with every order of tacos?  This is just odd and takes up way too much of the already limited table space.
3 - If they are going to serve huge, messy tacos; why can't they put a napkin dispenser on the table?  I had to make a half dozen trips to the dispenser across the room.
4 - Why no shrimp tacos?  They serve coconut shrimp (which were pretty good) so I know there are shrimp in the place.  I love shrimp tacos so I think they should be on the menu.

Anyway, the prices are reasonable, the staff is fast and friendly, the decor is unique,  and the place is clean.  I know I am overly critical but I really do think Coconuts is a great addition to the area and hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Coworker suggested Coco's for a quick business lunch as it is one of frequent haunts. Since this was first time I asked a few questions and received a few very detailed answers. Kudos to you for being so knowledgeable about your menu and the ingredients. I did not notice the big Poke Bowl special as I was ordering or I would have opted for that, next time for sure.

Yup, their fish tacos are fabulous, especially when you add some Tiger Sauce. Your 2 tacos come loaded with coleslaw and about 10 other fresh ingredients. I would have liked to have seen more fish in my taco than veggies but for a quick lunch NP at all.  Great fast service, excellent food, and reasonably priced. Yesiree Coconuts goes right into the lunch time rotation."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos!!  my only issue is that the corn shell is WAY to small for the amount of stuff they put into it...it makes a huge mess!! servers are polite and helpful, however there was one girl just wandering about who looked to maybe be new or something...also, the uniforms were quite inappropriate...there should have been a real uniform for this job instead of short shorts and a tank top, or the one girl who looked like she just rolled out of bed...step up Coconuts and get your staff a proper uniform!! Other than that, I loved the cute surf board tables and atmosphere!! How I managed to skip over this place when I was in Maui is beyond me...maybe next time I'm there Ill check it out."}
{"text":"Ironically, we visited this place (finally) right before we went to Maui. Cute little place with great food that's not too pricey (for Scottsdale, anyway). Loved the fish and chips and the coconut shrimp. My boyfriend also loved the fish tacos. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. I come here to eat at least 3 times a week! Seriously good"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we took a drive North to try Coconuts.

Unfortunately we were just disappointed, we just found nothing special about the food.

We had grilled fish tacos and fried shrimp.  The tacos really just had no taste, were just bland.  Best part of the taco was the tortillas.

Fried shrimp were nothing special, just plain old fried shrimp.

Service was good, all the staff were accommodating and pleasant."}
{"text":"This plAce should be illegal.  We are so addicted.  Have to go at least once a week to get our fix.  
The fish tacos are outstanding and the quality is top notch.  The coconut shrimp and chips are fab too.  There fries are some of the best we have ever had.  Cole slaw and mango salsa are to die for.  The staff is helpful and friendly. They don't have a lot of turnover the owner must treat them pretty good.  Try this place you will be hooked too."}
{"text":"Fresh, yummy seafood for affordable prices. Order at the counter, service was great, place is clean and the food was delish. They accommodated allergies & kid preferences with no problem."}
{"text":"Found this great Maui Gem in the heart of Scottsdale ! So friendly! High quality and amazing coconut shrimp and fish tacos! The French fries were delish also! Highly recommend this cute new  restaurant!"}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe is average, overpriced, but does have a relaxed, casual atmosphere with good service. When we arrived for dinner on Friday night the restaurant was packed but luckily there was patio seating outside.

I ordered the popular Coconut Shrimp, which is discounted with a Yelp check-in, and the famous Fish Tacos. The coconut shrimp was deep fried and had a discernible coconut taste but was not worth the cost, even with the discount. The Fish Tacos (2 tacos per order) comes on two separate plates, which I did not understand because the both tacos could have easily fit on one slightly large plate. 

The taco is not huge circumferentially but is piled high with toppings of tomato, mango, cole slaw, and cheese. The taco is too large to hold in your hand to eat as a normal taco so you will probably need to use a fork and knife. For me, the white corn tortilla was too difficult to cut through so I was just eating fish and toppings. I also really did not like that the tomatoes, mangoes, and cabbage for the cole slaw were huge chunks. Also the fish was overly salty and did not even pair well with the extras. If you go here, skip the overpriced Fish Tacos."}
{"text":"We took my parents and kids for my mother's birthday and were delighted to find a large surfboard table to seat all 7 of us. Fish and chips, seafood pasta, and fish tacos were fresh and delicious. The only down side was the ordering system. The line to order winds through some of the tables and is noisy. We couldn't save our table and have everyone order at the counter so we were running back and forth to get the family's order and tell the gal at the register. After that, the food came quickly and was great. The calamari and dipping sauce was better than I've ever had-and I've had Legal Seafood's, which is the best, or so I thought. GO there!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while driving in North Scottsdale.  The name caught my eye.  So glad I decided to go inside.  I tried the coconut shrimp - you get six scrumptious nice sized shrimp, the coconut flavor really pops and the dipping sauce is a nice blend of spicy and sweet.  I ordered the blackened Ono with brown rice.  I absolutely love it, so fresh and perfectly flavored.  Their pricing is a bit high, but the quality justifies that.  I go there at least twice a month, would go more often if they were closer to me.  

PS. Open one in Central Phx, please!!"}
{"text":"Awesome poke bowl, super fresh tuna! The food is always delicious and the staff is super friendly! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had in my entire life. Who would've thought in the middle of the desert?"}
{"text":"I took my wife here tonight, I got the \"famous\" fish tacos and let me tell you I am a taco fanatic. They were okay, the fish was super dry and had there not been sauce to put on it, I'm not sure I could have finished them. Definitely not worth $6 a taco. It would of been closer to worth it if it had come with beans and rice or some sort of option for a side or two. I was EXTREMELY disappointed at the fact that my wife ordered veggie tacos that consisted of a veggie hamburger patty cut up and slapped on a tortilla. You're joking right? I was expecting fresh saut√©ed vegetables when I was paying $11 for two tacos that come with NO sides. I admit I could have asked what was on it, but why would I have assumed that it was a veggie patty? Why would it be? It looked like a frozen veggie patty from Costco. We have had veggie tacos many places and they have all been fresh veggies. I thought they maybe ran out of vegetables and said \"let's just try this veggie patty out\" I don't understand how this place has this good of reviews, maybe I had a bad first experience or maybe people just like spending money on mediocre food. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After discovering Coconuts and their awesome fish tacos in Mauii, I was thrilled to have one open in my own backyard. No doubt the fish tacos are the best I have had. The fresh ingredients bring out the flavors of perfectly grilled Mahi Mahi and Ono, and it is all topped with the most wonderful Mango salsa i have tasted. 

Working my way through the menu, another favorite is their local style fish. I get blackened Mahi Mahi. Again it is grilled to perfection with the blackened seasoning bringing out the flavor of the fish. It is a large portion of fish that is accompanied with brown rice and a cloeslaw that I fear I am becoming addicted to. It is not the typical mayonaise based coleslaw, rather it is made with coconut milk, some secret ingredients and just a hint of wasabi. 

As far as appetizers go, you can't beat the coconut shrimp, the calamari is tender and flavorful, and the seafood chowder is right up there with my east coast maryland crab favorites.

The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable and the food has easily made this a new favorite. I am looking forward to working my way through more of the menu as I am sure I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The workers were so welcoming and very friendly. The chicken tacos were amazing! I'll be going here again!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had! And the portions are huge!! This is definitely a must go to if you happen to be in the area!"}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe was highly rated and close to our hotel so we figured we'd check it out.  Kids were pissed and wanted something else but it was my night to choose.  When we got there we were a little surprised at the limited menu. It didn't matter, as the only thing to do is order fish tacos.  The are absolutely delicious and are more than a meal.  The cole slaw and other accoutrements that go on the tacos are so good.  I can't imagine ordering a burger or chicken when the fish tacos were beyond good.  Even the kids thanked me after we left because they thought the food was scrumptious."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had - anywhere! 

Fried calamari was delicious and the dipping sauce was soooo good! I hate it when calamari is chewy, and this was def NOT chewy.

Servers might be overly attentive - always someone coming up asking how everything is, or asking to take plates away. I think I was only there for 20 minutes yet had 3 different employees checking on us every few minutes. Was a bit much but on the bright side, it's better than not at all. 

Another thing, the tacos are messy, would be nice to have napkin dispensers right at each table instead of by the drink station."}
{"text":"We started with the coconut shrimp appetizer which was delicious!  Fantastic fish tacos. First time we ate here and absolutely loved it!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"A great option for something different in the realm of quick-serve restaurants. The fish tacos were very filling and I had to take some of the filling out to be able to eat them, but they were LOADED with really cabbagy cabbage anyway, so I left most of that on the plates. The combination of the other flavors was good. The fish and chips was breaded v. battered, an interesting take, perhaps healthier? I will go back to try that and the sandwich. The workers were all helpful and excited to welcome new customers. It was busy mid-day since it's in a pretty commercial area. They're open til 9 and I hope they do well at dinner too! They serve beer and wine, so they probably do!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish taco and local style grilled fish (ono with Asian flair). The fish taco was good but there are many better, cheaper options. The grilled fish was dry and flavor was average. I would not recommend it if you don't like wasabi or the slight sting in your nose wasabi gives. 

Overall, wouldn't come again. Not for the 
price."}
{"text":"Small menu but yummy food. First time to try it. I want to go back and try some more items. Fish tacos are good but super hard to stay. Messy. But yummy."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Fish \"tacos\" are good although served tostada style, open faced?  Cute and fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"Uber had a hard time finding via GPS, but we walked thru plaza and found.  We walked up to counter and ordered the fish tacos.  AMAZING!!!!  We also used the Yelp coupon for 25% off coconut Shrimp (also AMAZING).  We dined outside and the blackbirds were constantly trying to steal a bite .....  But cute patio.  Casual environment and fast service!!!"}
{"text":"Love it! Best fish tacos in AZ. Big portions and good fish! Nice staff and quick service. Might seem little bit expensive for tacos but it is well worth the price."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here.  For the first time in my life, I like cole slaw!  Just the cole slaw served here, though.  Also, I have never been a huge fan of fish tacos, but the Coconut's fish tacos are absolutely craveable!  My only complaint is the small size of the seating area.  This is not a good place to come with a large party."}
{"text":"Fish tacos and grilled mahi were outstanding! Service was awesome , will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is good but will not allow you to customize.  How hard is it to sprinkle a little blackened seasoning on the fish ... Really?"}
{"text":"Coconuts was great! The service was friendly and speedy. We also enjoyed the fried coconut shrimp and lightly breaded shrimp. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very tasty place and customer service was excellent  try the fish burger it was very good"}
{"text":"Had the taco mountain with lettuce & coleslaw. This salad had two different types of large chunks of fish. Delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had no idea they were now here state side and found it to be as delicious as Maui. The sweet guy at the register was very kind, the restaurant was clean and of course the food was great! Fish tacos with mango salsa-perfectly done. We will definitely come back before we head home to CA!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, friendly employees, wonderful atmosphere. We come often."}
{"text":"Usually having quality fish means spending $20+ at a nice place with waiters and waits.  I now have young kids so that is not an option.

Luckily coconut's is here. I can have quality fish dishes at decent prices in a fast casual atmosphere.

Both times I have had the mahi plate, one time was Cajun (it was great) the other was their Hawaiian style which was also good. The rice was decent, and the steam veggies were healthy but lack flavor. 

For a healthy meal I was decently satisfied too."}
{"text":"Fantastic! 
I'm am not one to want fish when out to eat but this has made me a believer! Everything from the mahi-mahi to wasabi coleslaw was amazing! The price was so worth the portion size and they even have wine and beer selections. 
It's not a fancy restaurant but it hits the mark for island feel with their upside down surfboard style tables to their island music! 
Great place all the way around!
I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Not much that I can add as the previously posted reviews sum this establishment up fairly well. Legit fish tacos, excellent calamari, great outdoor seating, decent beer and wine selection, and an extremely nice staff. A must try when in the area."}
{"text":"We love Coconuts!! We've been to the Maui location, and both Scottsdale locations and are thrilled to have one closer to us in Gilbert!! 

We love the tacos!! Fresh mango salsa, delicious Cole slaw, amazing fish on double corn tortillas-delicious!! The chicken tacos are great too!! 

Tried the coconut and regular fried shrimp-also yummy and well made. And we like the fries too! 

Go check them out! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are awesome.  Totally different then traditional tacos.  They have a tropical, sweet taste to them.  Decent coconut shrimp.    My favorite was the taro chips and poke!!! If you're into tuna poke and house made taro chips this is the must try! This place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"*Coconut Shrimp, taste great. But over priced at 10 bucks (w tax) for 6 shrimp.
*Ahi Poke, taste great. But but over priced at 12 bucks + tax
*Fish tacos, not good. Too much stuffings makes tortilla soggy. 
Would recommend Fish tacos at Santa Madre Taco Shop in Ahwatukee. Much much better fish tacos.
At Coconut'sFC you are paying for beautifully designed decor as well."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a weekday night.  Service was quick and the food was delicious.  My husband ordered the chowder which was his entree - quite filling. My Taco Mountain was wonderful - plenty of grilled fish, tasty slaw, a touch of salsa over brown rice.   What a treat! 
It's a very creative dish and a great mix of fish and veggies!"}
{"text":"so this place already has almost 600 reviews and almost 5 star rating so what else can I really say? so let me quote the great foodie, Cookie Monster, as his famous line sums it up - \"Nom nom nom nom nom.\" Need I say more?"}
{"text":"wow the food is amazing. Definitely coming back before I fly home this week. After living on the Island for 2 years it's great to have such good food yet again. Aloha"}
{"text":"Pretty good fish tacos.  Service was great, although the price was a little high for what you get.  The ceviche was really good though.  I would return."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this on our 2 year anniversary for dinner. We have been wanting to try this for awhile now.

We started off with the coconut battered shrimp appetizer, we checked In with Yelp for the first time and received 25% off on the item. This dish was great! Crispy, generous portion of coconut batted shrimp. You should definitely get this. 

We ordered the ono burger which was good but not great. Lots of bun here. The fish was very good but sorta lost with the enormous bun and cheese and tomato and sauce.

My wife loves fish and chips so we also had to try that. She said, and I agree, that they were good. They were grilled which is different from the battered type. The fries that accompanied were really good. Thin, crisp and also soft in middle. Perfect with ingest or ketchup. Loved them. 

This place is from Maui Hi so the atmosphere is vey surf oriented. The tables are made out of what looks like old surf boards. My wife said this place gets high marks for the \"sweet Hawaiian vibe'. I agree. 

Service as 5/5. Food 4/5 for me,3.5/5 for my wife for a 4/5 overall. We will definitely be back for the coconut shrimp and want to try the fish tacos next."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the yelpers are raving about but I tried this place a couple of months ago.  I didn't think it was that great and the prices really high.  My husband has the tacos and I had the coconut shrimp.  The coconut shrimp was good but not for the price and the tacos are better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place for lunch, it was our first time. I had the fish tacos, they were good and fresh. It had a little too much cabbage, etc for me which over took the fish in the taco. My wife had the Poke bowl which was greasy and delicious. We shared the coconut shrimp appetizer which was a generous portion to share."}
{"text":"Just ok.

Food:
Tacos were ok, The tortilla was a little too toasted, fish a little dry, and lacking overall flavor.  I personally liked the mango, it added a nice touch.  $11 for two tacos is pretty steep, overall.  Three stars

Tried the chowder.  It was good, although not the best chowder I've ever had.  It was a little soupy for a chowder and I wasn't a big fan of the stringy onions, but the addition of mushrooms and fish made it nice.  Again, $5.50 for a cup is a little pricy.
Three stars

Last, the french fries were ok.  We had our whole order to go, and even though we only live 2 blocks away, the fries were cold by the time we got home.  Would have been better hot.
Two stars

Service was slow, but at the time, the place has only been open 5 days.  They had plenty of seating, inside and out, and there was plenty of parking as well.  

Overall, I'd give it a 2.5 star experience."}
{"text":"I read in the Arizona Republic a great article about \"Maui's favorite\" opening in Scottsdale, Thursday. I was so stoked, as this is one my all-time favorite spots for fish tacos.  I even planned my day around eating fish tacos for lunch. We drove to 16640 N Scottsdale Rd, which is a hidden location off Bell, (not Frank Lloyd Wright as the AZ newspaper published). The OTHER item the AZ Republic author and editor missed is \"Which Thursday were they opening?\" 

We walked into the smell of fresh paint and a really friendly new owner apologizing that we were here too early. He was unaware the AZ Republic ran the article, but happy that we are DEFINITELY coming back as the Maui spot, named for the original owner's cat, is really incredible. Coconut is already painted on the wall and the surfboard shaped tables fill the restaurant which is larger than it's Maui parent.

The Kihei favorite opens its first mainland location Thursday 4-4 at the corner of N Scottsdale Rd and Bell in Scottsdale, AZ!"}
{"text":"Just as great as the Frank Lloyd Wright location.  The fish is so good!   Taco mountain is my go to.  Lots of patio seating."}
{"text":"Just like Maui!  Best fish taco ever!  Mike and half of the staff here are from Maui getting it up a going.  They are doing this right.  It is going to get crowded once the word gets out."}
{"text":"Got the fish tacos. The fish was cut in little pieces and they had no flavor except for salt and were overcooked. There was a weird horseradish tasting sauce in the tacos and the mangos in the mango salsa was super hard still not yet ripen, and the tortillas were dry."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue. Spent 2 weeks in Hawaii last spring. My daughters wanted fish tacos while we were on Maui so we went to Coconut's Fish Cafe. We had a great time and the fish tacos were great. We came back home to AZ and low and behold, there is a Coconut's Fish Cafe in our own back yard. As it turns out, Coconut's has a couple of locations in the lower 48, one of which is on Shea and Scottsdale Roads in Scottsdale. We dropped in this past July before going to a movie and were pleasantly surprised. OK, we couldn't see the Pacific Ocean from the window, but the fish tacos were just as good. As a bonus, they had Longboards on tap. We will be back."}
{"text":"I just had the best dinner of my life. I had the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi over brown rice with chunky Cole Slaw. The fresh slice of fish was huge It's called the bowl but not served in a bowl. If I could eat that every night I would sleep smiling. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The Decour was awesome. The line was superlong but it was very fast and the employees were great. Fantastic seafood selection and the place was very clean. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wahoo! as good as it gets!!  (Couldn't resist!)  Stopped by the new Coconuts with a couple of buddies for lunch after golf up the street.  I am a frequent traveler to Hawaii (check my other reviews) and always look forward to the local fresh fish tacos.  Coconuts does a great job with fresh Ono (Wahoo), Mahi Mahi (Dorado), and Ahi (Tuna) fish tacos.  I had the Ono local style with rice and slaw.  Excellent fresh flavor at an unbelievable price considering we live in the middle of the desert! One of my buddies had the \"Mountain\" which consists of all three types of fish and looked great.  Third buddy had shrimp which he said were crispy and tasty.  The place is brand new so was very clean and had an upscale feel for an order at the counter restaurant.  The service was quick and pleasant.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our favorite place in Maui and since its opening near my hometown it has become a regular stop for me every time I'm in AZ.  Its so good I was skeptical to write a review in hopes of not having it be a somewhat hidden gem... well that ship has sailed awhile ago (which is good for business).

Scottsdale location (FLW and Scottsdale Rd- yes they're opening another one soon) is every bit as legit as Maui (in terms of quality).  Sometimes the service is a little slow (they can get super busy), staff can be a bit aloof and yes the price is slightly high for taco's (but the quality is there)...  however it's still a great place (I would give them 4.5 if I could)

Still one of favorite all time restaurants.  Grab a longboard and the fish taco's for your first visit... expand after that."}
{"text":"Update, as I mentioned in my earlier review that I was going to have to give it another try. I did and I really enjoyed it. I have to say, these are the best fish taco's I have ever had. 2 taco's and I was full. I found a new favorite place."}
{"text":"I am coconuts for coconuts! These are the best fish tacos EVER! Piled high with delicious cabbage slaw and mango chunks. The tortilla is warm and delicious! You will need plenty of napkins and a fork to finish, but it is worth getting messy for."}
{"text":"Great clam chowder and appetizers. The staff and manger were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed 2 fish tacos at Coconut's Fish Cafe yesterday after seeing many friends posts on FB. The service was incredible and the fish was fresh and great!!! I would recommend that every try Coconut's......."}
{"text":"This place is clean simple and has Awesome fish tacos !!!! Staff was friendly with good customer service a rare thing nowadays . I will definitely be back . You cannot find something like this quality unless you go gourmet ."}
{"text":"The tacos were a lot bigger than expected which is always good. It was very good and had a cute little Hawaiian feel. I would go here again, it's a quick little stop for friends"}
{"text":"This place has tasty fish tacos. It's clean and consistently good. My friend ordered the fish salad and she loved it. Wish they were open later."}
{"text":"I was needing a place that we could get a delish fish taco or fish burger (it's Lent on a Friday...ahhh!) So I yelped 'fish tacos', and up this come. It was a little on the pricey side but I thought, you know what...sometimes good food comes with a good price tag. :o)  When we arrived, the parking lot was really busy, so parking was quite tight, but luckily we arrived before noon so at least we HAD a spot to park in. (good choice to arrive then too, I might add, the noon hour was PACKED). Anyway, there were some good choices on the menu, and even when you order, they ask you 'how you would like the fish prepared...with seasonings (ie: cajun, lemon butter -- which I got, etc..) The gal at the counter was super nice and didn't make us feel 'rushed'. We made our selections, Fish burger (with wheat bun) and fish tacos.  We didn't wait, long (they give you a number and they bring the food to your table.) We got the food, and I attacked it. :o) So yummy, the fish was a very good size, and the coleslaw on the sandwich along with the dressing was tangy and creamy. (Just a little messy) And my husband got the tacos. They aren't the type of tacos you fold in your hand and eat. They are on a crunchy, small flour tostata-type of taco shell. So he had to cut with a knife and fork and eat it. No biggy. He liked the tacos, the mango salsa and coleslaw were great on it.

We ate pretty quickly, because it was so good. And side-note,  I noticed that the people bringing out the food (and clearing the plates) were so nice as well!! They even tried helping find a table for this family of 5! Just a great experience overall. Good food, good customer service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful fish tacos! Also enjoyed the Poke. Staff was welcoming and ambiance is inviting and fun. We will absolutely come back again. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were pretty good but nothing super special, the coconut shrimp on the other hand were the best I've ever had! I thought the price was a little much for what you get though. Supposably the best in Maui... well the fish is probably fresher there too. Just saying."}
{"text":"This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B."}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe, Scottsdale, AZ

I found the restaurant and reviews on Yelp. My friend and I decided to try it for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was clean, the service friendly, and the food very fresh and tasted great. 

We would recommend Coconut's to friends and frequent it again."}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe is a casual semi fast food kind of place where you order at the counter get an order number, seat yourself,  and someone runs your food to you. They feature mostly fish of Mahi Mahi , Ono , or Ahi and the signature dish is their Fish Tacos. 

I tried the signature dish , the fish tacos. I liked that they gave you lots of fish in your tacos that with all the sauces on it the fish had a nice fresh taste. I also thought the coconut milk dressing was a nice touch This dish is two dishes of food and you can't eat it all because of the four white corn tortillas and the what seemed like a half head of colon cleanser, (cabbage) that's chopped in really big pieces. It's GOOD if you think of it as an open tropical cabbage salads with fish. I say that because I found it impossible to pick up even after eating half the toppings to pick up. 

The Ono Fishburger my husband ordered had a very tasty piece of grilled fish on it. But this fish comes with too many sauces. South of the Border Sauce (if you order that flavor) Tarter and all that coconut milk sauce from the coleslaw. You need to order that on the side unless you like all that mixed together. It also comes with a thick slice of tomato and a pile of shredded cheese. 

I like the concept of this place mostly healthy lighter proteins and lots of cancer inhibiting cabbage that stimulates the immune system kills harmful bacteria and helps burn fat from your body among lots of other things.

I don't like the sleeveless servers because it doesn't seem sanitary.

I also don't like the toilet paper dispenser in the un-hanicapped ladies bathroom because it's nearly on the floors and I thought about photographing my toes to get the paper. However I really didn't want to BURN that image in anybodies mind so I didn't.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"First time! Ordered the Seafood Pasta and Caesar Salad and it was sooooooo ono (good) I WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"Have been in with my wife a few times now and we both loved it! The food is fresh with healthy options. The staff and service are great. The fish is perfect.

The first tie. I went I had the fish tacos. Really good but a little tough to eat, knife and fork required. The coconut shrimp are delicious. My favorite is the fish sandwich with blackened mahi. 

Will be back soon."}
{"text":"As a local Hawaii born and raised person, to find a Hawaii (Maui) place in Arizona is cool. 

The atmosphere reminds me of Hawaii. Surfboards, tv with surf, fishes and photos on the wall that reminds me of Hawaii. The cashier says \"aloha\" just to greet customers with the Hawaiian flare. 

The staff Jesse, Raechel, as well as the server was very friendly. The hospitality felt like the \"aloha spirit\" back home, which people like to talk, get to know you, happy and smiling all the time in order to make people feel welcomed. 

The food was amazing (photos uploaded). In Hawaii, we do family style so I got to try four different dishes. 

Ordered the steak salad (~$13), fish tacos (~$11), coconut shrimp and chips (~$12) and \"local style\" (fish was Ono) over rice (~$11). Prices are very reasonable and definitely a great price for the quality and quantity.

The coconut shrimp with the Thai chili sauce was absolutely delicious which I could definitely enjoy as a meal or appetizer. The Thai chili sauce enhances the coconut shrimp and the chip (fries) tastes amazing. You can dip the chip in the Thai chili sauce. 

The steak salad was very delicious too. The steak was great (cooked medium-well) that was chopped into cubes with a large amount of greens. 

The fish tacos were really good and they gave Thai chili sauce so it went in the tacos. Zagat gave the fish tacos the \"perfect fish taco,\" which I will agree. It had grilled Ono and Mahi Mahi with organic tomato salsa, cheese, house made coleslaw and mango salsa. 

The Ono (fish) local style over rice was greatly cooked grilled and delicious. Ono in Hawaiian also means delicious. The tartar sauce was very good and also recommend the chips be dipped in the tartar sauce. 

The Thai chili sauce can be used for dressing for the salad which my friend did which also enhanced the salad. 

Definitely would go back for the great food, atmosphere, staff and to feel like you are in Hawaii."}
{"text":"First of all, for having such a young crew, the service was exceptional! The line was quite long and the service was fast and super efficient. The staff is always friendly and they work non-stop. 

The food was amazing as well. It's very affordable for fresh seafood. I went in twice on my week and a half trip to Scottsdale. I will definitely come back in next time!"}
{"text":"We used to live in Scottsdale and frequented the location on FLW, we have also been to the location on Shea and Scottsdale Rd. Now we go to the location in Chandler. They are consistently excellent. I usually get the fish tacos but last time I tried the macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi, it was amazing! The portions are ample for sure. If you have not been here yet try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never even considered getting anything other than the tacos but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and get something else....the taco mountain!! (hehe) I didn't think it was possible but I may have found a new favorite. Marisa enjoyed a giggle with me as I expressed that I was finally ready to try something new (does that qualify as new?). For me it will always be the little things that count. Marisa was simply taking my order but I felt like I was talking to a friend. Great food and friendly smile, what more could I ask for! Thank you, thank you, thank you, coconuts for making dinner an easy choice in my day :)"}
{"text":"Love the lightly blackened mahi mahi with rice and coleslaw. A little slow service, but food was good."}
{"text":"Easy night out for dinner with the family. They enjoyed their fish and chips. Fish wasn't overly oily even though it was fried. Portions were fair. I enjoyed the fish tacos. You get two loaded ones which is a challenge to fit in your mouth, but delicious. Would go again."}
{"text":"Really great food, great service, and reasonable prices. My husband and I both had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, kids had spaghetti and a hot dog. Everyone loved it. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"$12 for two tacos and a courtesy glass of water in a walk up order line.
Nice interior and tasty fast food but small portions which makes it not so great of a value"}
{"text":"I'm in that Neighborhood on Wednesday nights... It's Wednesday!!! I can't wait for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Love it!! Had the seafood pasta with white sauce and poke bowl! Both delicious!  Prepare to spend about 40/2 ppl. Nice atmosphere and fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Amazing. These are the best fish tacos I have EVER eaten.They offer a great selection of dishes including pasta and soup. My neices even loved it aged 6 and 9. The staff is friendly. They literally brought a piece of Maui to Scottsdale. 
This is quality casual dining in a friendly atmosphere. The also recycle their used cooking oil into biofuel. Their containers are recyclable too.
Check it out once and I know you'll become a regular...

{"text":"I agree with rw from Scottsdale. The fish and chips were bad. My fish was way overdone and the fries were soggy. My friend's fish tacos looked much better. Not a big fan of fish tacos but wish I got those instead."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after playing tpc. The pro shop recommended it for fish and chips. Fish and chips was ok. Another in our party had a salad with grilled salmon which looked and tasted really good. Could have used better direction and service when we were ordering. Young gal was not very helpful. Told us we couldn't get grilled fish- it was all battered.- not true."}
{"text":"Have passed coconuts many times and I regret every time I haven't been here! So so good. The fresh flavors and menu is spectacular. Definitely doesn't feel like you're in az enjoying fresh mahi mahi tacos and coconut shrimp was also fantastic. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a must!  Yummy coconut shrimp. The fish is perfectly grilled and fresh. Loved the macadamia nut mahi mahi. Delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb fish tacos were so good and the coconut shrimp were delicious 
nice clean dining area this is a must stop place to eat"}
{"text":"Since trying Coconut's Fish Cafe, I go almost every other week. The first time, like most first-timers, they sold me on the fish tacos. These tacos are massive, not wimpy-shrimpy tacos. It was a filling meal. However, I would not rate this place solely on this dish, though it does get a lot of attention.

On my second trip, I wanted to try a few of the appetizers. The calamari were good, but the coconut shrimp was incredible. It tasted almost like too much of a \"treat\" to not be a dessert, the shrimp were good size and the coconut flavor was rich and expansive.

On my third visit, and now for every subsequent visit, I stick to my favorite dish: Blackened mahi-mahi \"local style\", served with brown rice and slaw. It is an incredible, perfect-sized health dish for a hungry patron during lunch or dinner. The only thing that kind of weirds me out is that the dish is served with a tomato slice with shredded cheese on top, maybe it's a traditional thing but I didn't find anything on Google. At any rate, if you don't want it they are happy to not include it with your meal.

The staff are always attentive, immediately after my food arrives I am set up with napkins and silverware (and a bottle of Tiger sauce, now that they know I love it) and even when busy the staff make it a priority to ensure everyone is enjoying their meal.

Last but not least, the store is always EXCEPTIONALLY clean. Condiments are always filled, bottles are clean (I hate when you grab a condiment and get leftover on your hand, gross!) and there isn't a speck of dust or food whenever I sit down. Bathrooms are exceptional too!

TL:DR:
Coconut's on Shea and Scottsdale is fantastic, but if you've only tried the fish tacos and were not impressed, give something else a shot!"}
{"text":"Had fish taco's today and they were great.  Thought the price was a bit high but then saw what I was getting.  Well worth the price.  Loved the atmosphere and vibe!
Nice addition to neighbourhood.  Will definitely go back again.
Christian very friendly and explained many of the various dishes to my sister and I.  You're lucky to have such a great employee."}
{"text":"I went in today for the first time with my family for dinner. We ordered fish tacos and some fried calamari. The fish tacos where different than I was expecting. There not like traditional fried fish tacos. Instead they where grilled with cabbbage and some mango salsa on top. They where amazing. The calamari was also great. I will be definitely returning for more fish tacos."}
{"text":"A tasty fish taco (ono and mahi mahi) that makes it easy to tolerate the very cliched Bob Marley inspired surf ambiance that permeates the place.  One complaint.  Come up with a sub $10 lunch option or two.  This is a lunch heavy neighborhood and that is an important cost threshold for diners."}
{"text":"Dang!! Wanna to give a higher score...have been looking forward to trying this place! I love coconut shrimp and my fianc√© loves fish tacos/burgers so I thought it would be a new favorite. Not so. It was good for sure...but nothing above what I have had elsewhere. The sauce with the shrimp was really the wow factor that gave it some individuality. The burger was good as well, with a nice piece of fish. The fish slightly over cooked but nice flavor. The fries were crisp and yummy. Sadly, the reason I'm not more generous with the stars was the unhelpful obviously uninterested cashier at the register. We came in on a Saturday where several other restaurants were hopping with customers. Coconuts a two tables of couples. We were greeted by a young lady that was standing with her arms folded gazing out the window. I get it...we all have our Down Time. But once I stated how excited we were to be here our first time there as no attempt to educate us about the menu or possible preparation options. We made our selections quickly cause I felt we were inconveniencing her with our lack of knowledge on the menu. Once we got our food the evening improved! We dined outside and enjoyed people watching! The gentleman that was attending the outdoor tables was a dramatic difference to the young lady in the restaurant. My pet peeve is service! A friendly smile, helpfully suggesting favorites and making the place an establishment you want to return to hinges on staff."}
{"text":"Love their tacos!  I ask for the slaw on the side.  Even then I cannot contain the taco in my hand and keep my face clean. It's probably quite the scene.  The coconut shrimp and mahi mahi aren't bad either"}
{"text":"This is the type of place I have been waiting to land in Scottsdale Forever!  Lets hope they make it, and I hope this town knows what a great place they have on hand here.  I haven't ventured outside of the fish tacos on the menu with the exception of the much easier to eat taco mountain, but this place delivers on all fronts.  Unassuming, great food, great staff, and even Hawaiian beers on tap.  We were fortunate enough to be there opening weekend when the chef was in from Maui and got the whole scoop on how they procure their fish and all.  Bottom line, it's a fantastic, affordable place with a great vibe, and I hope they do very well!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews while I was in town. The reviews were dead on-the food was great. Light. And a super cute ambience, clean and nice patio. Great food selection and courteous staff. I would def go again !!"}
{"text":"I got the grilled Ono cooked with butter, salt, and pepper, served over brown rice and the awesome wasabi coleslaw. Food was EXCELLENT!! Fish was perfect and tasted really fresh. My kids had the kids fish and chips and chicken teriyaki.  They both loved it. The fish and chips are really really good. I am adding this to my regular places to eat at."}
{"text":"Friendly from the moment I entered.  Got the coconut shrimp.  Perfect.  Better than most... not greasy at all.  Perfect crunch.  Tasty dipping sauce.  Good price for shrimp.  Beer pint kinda high priced."}
{"text":"Lunch hour traffic was minimal, happy me, no crowd.  Pretty little place, spacious, clean, bright and different with the surfboard tables.  All the staff were friendly and very willing to help. We ordered the calamari and chips - WOW, it was the best fried squid EVER!  A ton of french fries, crispy, tasty and impossible not to consume them in their entirety.  A ketchup based slightly spicy dip was much tastier than plain ketchup and the requested house made tartar sauce excelled.  Also ordered the fish tacos but they had so many different ingredients it was impossible to lift and eat.  The individual ingredients were good but hid the flavor of the fish, lost in the mix.  Next time I will order a straight fish dish, I'm sure it will be excellent.  We drank Mango iced tea, good but not great.  It is worth trying again and soon."}
{"text":"Thought we would try the Chandler location for lunch, having eaten in one of their Scottsdale locations.  A rather noisy venue as my sound meter registered between 75db and 80db with about 50% capacity of diners.  I think it takes away from the taste and enjoyment of the food, but that's me, maybe not you. The mango flavored tea is always good.  I had a cup of seafood chowder, unfortunately served about the same time as our entrees :(  We ordered a local style fried fish (ono) blackened, which was very flavorful despite being over cooked, toughening and drying out that beautiful cut of fish.  It came with some very nice brown rice, a thick slice of fresh tomato and a little cup of coleslaw and one of tartar sauce, and all the lemon slices you want.  Too bad, the fish could have been great but hard to chew.  I had the fish and chips and my mahi mahi was also fried just a bit too long.  The fries were enough for 3 people, crisp and tasty.  I thought that their special coleslaw had little personality and hardly any flavor.  It's sad that a fish place can't cook their fish properly, and the portions were quite generous.  The chowder was a 5 star dish, but the entrees were ruined by the chef.  I doubt that we will choose to dine with them again, a 2 1/2 star eating adventure!"}
{"text":"Saw this place was new so went with the wife after her target practice at the gun club. Am originally from Hawaii so always liked island food.  The place is a little kitschy with surf board tables and Hawaiian music playing. At least the Hawaiian music was not something too touristy.

Wife had the fish tacos and I went with the fish burger. Also ordered a side of onion rings. At $6.99 the rings are a bit pricey but they give you a ton!  They may be frozen as a previous reviewer reported but hot and crunchy.  We are all but one. 

The fish tacos come on two plates and are good size. They have fruit on top and are tasty. It comes with a lemon wedge but I wish it was lime. No cilantro either and not spicy. Coleslaw instead. Overall good but not outstanding. 

The fish burger was much better. Coleslaw again with tomato and sauce. Nice piece of fish. Well cooked too not tough like so many places I've had a fish burger. It is actually a piece of fish and not ground so kudos for that. I had the Ono and I would recommend it.  Also had the asian zing sauce, again recommended. I had the wheat bun and I think I will try the sesame next time as the wheat bun is okay but a better bun would make this sandwich epic! 

Good place, very busy. Will be back. 

Overall a"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious for super fresh and flavorful fish tacos. Love the shrimp tacos, also. Never disappoints and we love to go there when we're in the area. Portions are BIG so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I first tried this place with some very high expectations.  Boy was I not disappointed.  The first time I visited I ordered the fish tacos.  I went again the following day.  More fish tacos.   I wanted to go again for dinner on the second day but didn't want to seem weird.  So instead I ate chicken I made myself, all the while feeling emptiness and desperate longing for fish tacos even though I probably hadn't even fully digested the ones I just had for lunch.   The funny thing is, I never really liked fish tacos before.

I noticed on both occasions I visited that the employees ate the food here on their lunch breaks and seem to have enjoyed it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants around. Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere really makes you feel like you're in Hawaii. The fish tacos are definitely something you should try if you're thinking about stopping by. Also I recently tried the poke which is now probably my favorite item on the menu"}
{"text":"Their fish taco mountain might be the best thing I've ever eaten! It's huge too, definitely big enough to share for lunch. The wasabi coconut milk coleslaw mixed with the mango salsa is an amazing combo!!! I highly recommend this place.

I've been to both locations and had great experiences at both."}
{"text":"Greeted on entering and felt welcomed.  Menu had a good variety  Great music added to the Maui vibe. Cute decor.  Husband ordered fish and I had shrimp.  Both very good. Now if they had island style macaroni salad. Didn't see any but all was good. Would go again"}
{"text":"Always good....love the shrimp n chips.....very busy at lunch....can be quite loud thou.....parking a bit sparse........wish they ran more coupons !!! I would go more !"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've had since I was in Hawaii, actually tastes just the same. Love this place. Food is fresh, service is great."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good, didn't like the fact you couldn't mix and match however the fresh fish was delicious the tacos were very very large pretty decent value for your money. We will Ben back to try the other dishes. The appetizer tuna poky was delicious."}
{"text":"Try the Mahi Mahi burger with blackened seasoning!! 


I tried the fish tacos as well. They were delicious, but my fish burger was outstanding! The mahi was so juicy and tender!! The blackened seasoning was perfect. It was a generous portion of mahi mahi fillet, fully covering the bun. 

Inside is very casual, so I may have expected lower prices, but the quality was so good, that it made sense. $25 for 2 people with 1 burger, 1 order of tacos, and 1 drink (and 1 water). The staff all seemed very friendly, and attentive even though there is not a formal wait staff. I like the decor but the atmosphere is a little quiet.

Sometimes, I guess you can believe the hype! I look forward to returning and trying the coconut shrimp next time. 

If you have kids who love fish, this would be a great place to bring them. They offer a kid's menu."}
{"text":"Casual. Order up front and sit. I had the Mahdi Mahdi fish and chips. They were very good. I like the fact it was very lightly coated. Not the heavy batter you sometimes get. Thin good fries. My partners at dinner all got the fish tacos. It comes with Ono. Two tacos, kinda huge. 2 people ate with forks. Coleslaw on top with mango salsa, too much stuff for me. They said good, not great. I will be back whenever I need my fish and chip fix."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  Fun atmosphere. The fish was great! Fish tacos, taco salad and calamari is what my family ordered. The sauces are tasty too!  The service is friendly and the place is really clean."}
{"text":"I really like this place.   Fresh fish tacos!   They are huge with lots of fresh ingredients.    I will definitely be back.   The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"So far the best fish tacos in town. One is enough to fill u up, but it's hard to put down, so two will do! Delish!  and don't get me started on their French fries...the seasoning on the fries...amazing!"}
{"text":"Super yummy!! Everything from the shrimp to the fish taco is insanely excellent!! The staff is very friendly and energetic. The only reason I had to keep that fifth star for myself is the prices are outrageous. Even if the fish was flown in fresh daily it would still be too much to pay for fried food."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were very good...fresh tasting and filling.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Went there with three members of the Family today, and here is the lowdown from what we had to eat:

Blackened fish sandwiches were pretty darn good.  Generous portion and well seasoned.  Tartar sauce is dill-based and quite good.

Did not try the fish tacos, and I hear they are good from other family that turned us on to this place.

Here are my issues.  On the outside of the store there is a huge sign on the canopy that states:  \"All of our food is made from scratch\".  From \"scratch\".

That is simply not true.  I had the shrimp and chips basket, and the shrimp was described as butterflied and lightly battered.  Sounds good, no?  Well hate to break it to ya, but they were clearly frozen and from their local restaurant supply place.  Don't believe me?  Others have placed examples of the aforementioned shrimp in the pics section.  Have a look.  I have had these at countless chains across the country, and can spot them a mile away.  Likely TESCO or shamrock delivered.  Uninspired at best.

Also, french fries- Frozen Shoestring, Mickey D's style
Also , onion rings-  Frozen Beer battered style 

(I was fine with both of these being frozen, and there was an ample amount of both.)

What I DO have a problem with them stating that EVERYTHING is from scratch, when it is clearly not.

Also, their \"famous\" cole slaw was bland, practically tasteless on its own.  It fared better on the really well done fish sandwiches.

I am not by any means a \"power\" reviewer on this site, but I am being honest here.  Fix your breaded shrimp and do them the right way.  Not that hard, and likely cheaper in the long run.  

OR, change that sign out front because it is not indicative of what is happening with some of your food.  Not going to one star this review because of the excellent service and fish sandwich.  I hope you guys do well, but be honest or change a couple of things."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos and ahi poke. The poke was amazing! The fish tacos left some to be desired. It's so full of cabbage it was hard to eat and get the flavor you wanted and I think I received chicken instead of fish. I ordered rice and it was left out of my order. Not driving back to get a little side of rice though. 3 stars because the the food tasted good and service was great.

Edit: The business owner contacted me and was very concerned about making my experience better! I will have to say that this is very rare and says a great deal about the service you will receive. I have added a star for this above and beyond service."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos! You get two tacos with the meal, but they are are filling. I couldn't finish the second one and had to give it to my boyfriend. This was my boyfriends first time trying poke and he loved the poke bowl. Best food experience ever, thank you!"}
{"text":"excellent preparations.  have eaten there twice, once fish tacos and a pasta dish second time.  large portions.  delicious and novel."}
{"text":"Great tacos!
Clean and friendly atmosphere!
Okay now here's my rant.
IM STILL HANGRY!
13$ for 2 tacos is real ridiculous! Don't get me wrong they were good but per taco is 6$ and some change worth? -Umm no! Good thing I didn't get a drink. Okay maybe just maybe if they threw another taco in there with just a tad more fish inside the tacos I would given a 5 star. I suggest you try but be ready to pay."}
{"text":"Situated amongst a few other eateries and dessert joints, Coconut's Fish Cafe can be easily looked over but I'm sure glad I didn't... I ordered two fish tacos thinking I may still be hungry after but no way... Those tacos were huge! Not to mention delicious... Dual corn tortillas were required to keep all the ingredients in check... Loved the Mango Salsa and the Coconut Shrimp... Definitely try some hot sauce, and if it's a nice evening, sit outside in their patio area... Coconut's Fish Cafe seemed kinda pricey at first, but after the first bite it all was worth it! Definitely check in on Yelp and take advantage of a deal!"}
{"text":"Taco mountain was great 2 months ago, but for the past 3 visits the fish has been overcooked and dry. Come on guys! 
The fish special has been great."}
{"text":"OMG, so delicious, and the service was excellent. I ordered the devinchi salad, it was great but a little too spicy for me cause of the jalapenos. Our waiter Casey took care of taking it off the bill and getting a ceasar instead. We also ordered the chili burger...amazing! Dont miss this spot if you're into burgers!"}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp were amazing. Mahi Mahi with rice and slaw weren't bad. Could use a little more Cajun flavoring."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! It was also pretty crowded for a Thursday night after 7pm & we took a slightly dirty table (which someone came by shortly & took care of that).

So taking the advice of other Yelpers we ordered the fish tacos (yes, they look kinda small but are STUFFED full of the fish,  coleslaw and yummy mango salsa) and when asking the hostess what the next best seller is, she said fish and chips so that's what we ordered (ok plus cup of chowder and coconut shrimp which were cooked perfectly!).

All fresh tasting, all seasoned ok (we both thought our entr√©es could use little more something-cilantro or another punch of flavor ).  But overall delicious and we'd come back again."}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE this place. One night there was a terrible freeway accident so I took a different exit to avoid the backup. Well, I just think it was probably terrible as there were lots of cops at the scene. Anyway, I stumbled upon this hidden gem tucked away in North Scottsdale in a spot that's somewhat easy to miss, I probably drove by 100 times without seeing it. 
I got the fish and chips. Best I've ever tasted. Some fish and chips dishes are so salty that they're not enjoyable. Not so with these. The slaw has what, wasabi in there for a little kick? That's what it tastes like to me. YUM, yo. Yum all around. So, I shared the fish with my cat as I always did, and he loved it too. (RIP Neko, you little stud, my 12-year companion. I'll miss sharing food with you forever). 
Sorry for the sad side note. The wound of losing such an awesome feline friend is deep and fairly recent. But definitely try Coconuts."}
{"text":"This is a great place for simple seafood. Fish tocos were great and I think my friend got a magi magi which was also very good.

During weekday lunches it gets super crowded and I would not go here again at this time.

You order at the counter and seat yourself, then they bring the food out to you."}
{"text":"Fish tacos was great. Had calamari, fried shrimp and ahi poke. Food was fantastic, will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Beautiful place but, being a true Southern girl had a hard time getting excited over the fish.... Good service & locale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fish taco places! The staff is very friendly too! A little on the pricey side but it a great treat to have once in a while."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Service was excellent. Told the guy at the counter we had been here and he went through the menu and recommended the fish tacos. They were great. Fish was great!!! Massive portions. 

We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The Food is great,  service is great,  atmosphere is great, and the fish tacos are GREAT!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! All we need is to have one in Mesa next."}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best places to eat fish tacos. Their fish tacos are cooked to perfection each time, it's always consistent, and it's topped with their mango salsa which is delicious. You get 2 tacos for  $11 and some change depending on which location you go to because tax varies in each city. CFC is known for their fish tacos it has 17 ingredients & trust me you won't leave hungry, both tacos will keep you satisfied.  Love that they use quality fish and that it's grilled and not fried. Their other items on the menu are also good but I make the 30 minute drive for the fish tacos, totally worth it. 
They have 3 locations 2 in Scottsdale and they just opened 1 in Chandler.  Since I live in Mesa I don't have to drive as far and go to the Chandler location.  
Staff is friendly, the ambiance is Hawaiian themed, and I love that it's dog friendly.  My dog usually sits out side the patio. 
I've gone to California several times for fish tacos and nothing compares to Coconuts Fish Cafe. They need to build one in Mesa!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Hawaiian style food. If your looking for quality fish tacos then just stop your scrolling and head to coconuts."}
{"text":"This is by far our most favorite fish place.
They have the best coconut shrimp
Always friendly staff.  Best mahi mahi.
Food delicious every time!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop into Coconut's Fish Cafe while doing some car shopping on that side of town. Soooo, glad we did. The restaurant is very cute and super clean and the staff was very helpful and friendly. You can tell they really enjoy their job. When we placed our order we were a bit shocked at the price (about $25 for two, two taco plates, glass of water and a bottle of water) but when they came out they were HUGE! Each taco was served on two corn tortillas and what we should have done was split an order with my boyfriend. The tacos were awesome! We will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"This is a riff on a traditional Hawaiian food truck, but as a restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  They have fish tacos, salads, grilled fish and similar fare.  It's incredibly popular, and for good reason - the fish is good, the atmosphere casual and fun, the staff helpful.  I particularly like getting grilled mahi-mahi over Caesar salad ... though the grilled fish platters (with rice and salad) are good too.

This is a place where you go to the counter and order your food, then they bring it out to you - kind of low key, but it grows on you.   The wooden tables are shaped like surf boards - Coconuts has character.  It's different than any other restaurant in the area - this isn't a mall chain, and the food stands out from all the standard American fare in the area - and that keeps me going back.  The menu is fairly small, but you can select enough variants to make it interesting (i.e. there are several preparation styles for the grilled fish).  On my first visit, I wondered what all the fuss was about, but now that I've been in Scottsdale for a while, I find I keep going back - that it's one of my favorite places to grab a bite."}
{"text":"My husband and I started eating here a few months ago. It's close to home and convenient for a quick bite. Food is very good. We've only tried the Mahi Mahi and fish n chips, but recommend both. Prices are pretty resonable for the area and not much different than any other restaurant. Service is a hit and miss. The young gals working there are mostly very friendly and attentive with an occasional employee not wanting to put much effort into work. That doesn't compromise the food however. The one thing that took me by surprise on my last visit was watching a gentleman pick up the wash rag off of the FLOOR behind the cash register and start wiping tables with it. When we were leaving I asked the gal at the counter who the manager was and she said well he's the owner and pointed to the very gentleman that picked up the washrag and wiped tables. I said to him, \"I just watched you picked up the wash rag off the floor and start wiping down the tables.\" I'm sure (or hope) he teaches his staff restaurant cleanliness. You can tell he was embarrassed  (which was not my intent at all), but he did apologize. I think he will be more conscious going forward. I DO NOT WANT THIS TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT AS THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD AND WE WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE EATING THERE. Because of this however, I could only give it four stars."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with unique surf board tables for outdoor seating. It's found in a busy area in a small complex of shops. Fish tacos are their speciality cramming 14 ingredients into each one. Quite delicious but the tortillas are disappointingly hard. Makes for a stellar casual lunch date especially if you're in the mood for fish in whilst in the desert."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp and the steak tacos are what I live for. Just go. Don't ask questions."}
{"text":"The food and friendly staff always make Coconut's enjoyable to dine at. The fish is always fresh and tasty. The shrimp salad and fish tacos are great. 

Nice to get some island flavor here in Chandler."}
{"text":"Nice surprise for last-minute dinner selection. Coconut shrimp was cooked perfect and the dipping sauce had just the right amount of spice to it. Also had the fish tacos - the sweetness of the fruit along with the creaminess, but not too much, of the coleslaw and the perfectly cooked fish was outstanding."}
{"text":"This was really a fun place to take friends from out of town! The people working there were great! The food was yummy! I will go back even tho it is 30 miles away!"}
{"text":"Love love  this place. Not the cheapest food in town but your paying for quality. Fav is fish sandwich & the bowl. They have two locations but I like the originals one off Bell/scottsdale Rd best just simply because it has so much more indoor seating."}
{"text":"i thought i wrote a review for this place? anyway, after some excellent review-age by Marisa S, the wife and i drove beyond our 1 mile radius for some early bird eatage at coconuts fish cafe. 

i had 3 fish tacos...i'm not sure what kind of fish, but it was a standard white fish. what surprised me was how much freaking fish was in those tacos! it was overflowing with the sea! and with it's tasty slaw and mango toppings, i needed a bucket full of napkins after devouring their deliciousness. the wife had a fish burger and the fish filet actually stuck out about an inch around the entire sandwich! it was incredibly big, messy, and delicious!

i was impressed! there are numerous other fish options, along with some non-fish options. the place is spotlessly clean, and looks like a chain restaurant. but it was tasty and will be on our go-to list now. staff was super friendly and it being slow when we went in, had no problems hanging and chatting with us!"}
{"text":"WOW! Finally some real fish tacos in the desert. These super stuffed delights are so d@mn tasty. Not cheap, but not pricey either. Don't worry you will be full. The fish is super fresh & the mango's, plus the other 15 ingredients work in harmony."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting Hawaiian style seafood and chips! It's sit down but laid back order and get a number and food is brought to your table. The atmosphere is nice bc there is outdoor seating and the staff are really accommodating. I wanted something specific to substitute and the manager made it happen. OH and they have Maui brewing company beer weeeee (and wine for your vinactics). Would come here again for fish and chips. I would have to say that it is quite pricey."}
{"text":"This place is a success because they keep it simple with only a few menu items.   The fish tacos, salads and fish burgers are awesome.   Everything else (e.g. calamari, prefrozen coconut shrimp etc) save your coins; but the fish is on point."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this place !!! The fish tacos really are as good as they say ! I'm obsessed !!! I tried the tacos 2 weeks ago, and now I'm there at least once a week! haha !!!  As far as fish tacos go , these are the best I've ever had in Arizona . I've still to try their other dishes , but the tacos are so damn good that I have a hard time not getting them every time that I go there ."}
{"text":"Staff is average, food is over priced cafeteria style dinning.  Tea selection is great, chairs are uncomfortable"}
{"text":"This small seafood joint is a little slice of the Islands set in a shopping area in Scottsdale.  Although the d√©cor is basic and you order at the counter, the food is exceptional.  My beautiful plate of macadamia-crusted mahi-mahi with red pepper/mango salsa, coconut coleslaw, and rice made promises before I took a bite, and the flavors and textures delivered.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient and the food was very reasonably priced.  Gourmet food in fast food surroundings!"}
{"text":"This is is awesome for Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Really good casual seafood (price not bad) and inviting atmosphere.  I look forward to coming back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Very good food and they have longboard on tap. Fish tacos are really good, but too much cabbage on em for my taste. Staff was really friendly and knowledgable of the menu."}
{"text":"I think this place justifies the high price for the 2 fish tacos by not giving you the option to purchase just 1 which is really too bad.  I see many comments that they are pricey which they are especially when you HAVE to buy 2 even if you can't or don't want 2.

That being said, the fish tacos were good, not bad and not great, just good.  The mango salsa stood out.  The fish was well, lets just say average and certainly didn't warrant the high priced fish taco plate.  I didn't taste anything exceptional about the fish at all, was really bummed out.  I wanted this place to at least meet the hype some people give it.

Yes, it is bright, clean, makes you feel like your near the beach but the fish in the fish tacos came up short, way short.  

Mu guest who doesn't like fish, had the steak taco and was also unimpressed with the meat's flavor.  Needless to say, we both agree, this place is too pricey for the taste.  As another reviewer wrote, save your money go get a flavorful bowl at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Finally tried Coconuts tonight and was beyond impressed.  We were greeted with an \"aloha\" as soon as we walked in.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was great.  My wife and I both ordered the fish tacos and they are by far the best I've had in Phoenix and probably anywhere.  

One order of tacos is plenty for one person.  No sides are needed, however, I'm sure they are good.  The tacos were full of fresh ingredients and you can tell that a lot of thought and care goes into the food.

It's nice to see a, healthy, well priced, really good fast casual restaurant open in North Scottsdale.  Two people can eat a big meal and get a couple soft drinks for approx $30.  Coconuts will become a regular in our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great fish tacos and the best coconut shrimp.  We are from Colorado but make sure we come here every time we are in Chandler, Az."}
{"text":"Really, for it's category (order at the counter) this is 5 stars.  You will get better fish here than at 5 star seafood dining places in Scottsdale.  If you want low-health fish and chips, etc.  you can find it here and it's delicious.  If you are a healthy eater, try their blackened or grilled mahi mahi, tuna, ono, etc.  It blew me away at how good the high quality fish was.  The atmosphere is casual but clean and nice.  Also, the fries are fantastic.  This is a great restaurant if you have people in the group who are health conscious eaters and people like me who seek to destroy their bodies with fried fish and fries.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I cannot get enough of it!
Everything is always fresh, people are nice.
I wish they would play some different video's on the big screens, the surfing video's are getting old!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I go deep sea fishing every summer in San Diego and Mexico and this reminds me of my trips. Fresh as can be fish tacos and huge portions.   It's a taco that you need a fork to eat it!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be very clean, well decorated and the food quality excellent; for a fast food place. Order at the counter and they deliver your food quickly, hot and fresh. Service was very friendly. This is where the good part of this review ends.

One draft beer, one soda, a two taco meal and fried calamari meal. Also added a coconut shrimp appetizer at 25% off thanks to Yelp! The grand total... wait for it... $40.

Four stars because service, cleanliness and food quality. Could have been Five Stars if it was price at value which for me would have been about $25. 

Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Well, it was my second time here last night, the first time was nearly a year ago. I was not quite as impressed this time, unfortunately. I think that is mostly just because they are more popular now, the place was crowded and extremely loud. The service was good. They did bring out the wrong order, but fixed it right away.

I got veggie tacos, which is probably one of my favorite foods, so of course I liked it. My bf got fish tacos and they were ready abnormally fast, which made him curious. Also he said his tortilla tasted kind of too hard, like maybe it was old or overcooked. I did not have that issue though, mine were fine. Liked the salsa on top, and the veggie patty is pretty tasty. Small portions for how pricey it is though. Left wanting another taco, or a little snack..which is crazy for a $12 meal. Also don't like that the two tacos are served on separate plates, just don't get it!

I do really like the decor of this place, very cute with the surfboard tables and Hawaiian feel. Also it is clean which is a big plus. Coconuts is alright in my book, would probably like it better if I ate fish haha. This restaurant was something different, but not really a personal favorite for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place!  Food was delicious and fast!  Great variety of options and good quality!"}
{"text":"Limited menu = great food at a reasonable price. Loved the fish and the shrimp. What they do, they do well. Very casual atmosphere is fun and a good place for lunch with kids."}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoyed this joint!  It was a warm night, but the ice cream sandwich place next door had their misters on full blast which made the patio tolerable.  

My check in got me a discount on the best coconut shrimp appetizer I've ever had!  We grabbed the ahi poke appetizer to share as well, which was spectacular.  

We shared the tacos (serviceable) the chowda (amazing) and the fish n' chips (delightful)... the tacos just had too much going on and would have been better served with less fillings / less mess.  The chowda was the best I've had in Arizona and the fish was crispy and perfectly cooked yet not greasy - something that is NOT easy to do when frying fish.

No room for dessert, but that didn't matter cause we washed it down with a few beers and were incredibly satisfied with our meal.  For being a casual (order / pay up front) type place, the food was really spot on.

Best part is, it's next door to the ol' ABC - so I got to reminisce about all my good times getting yelled at before they closed down.  GO HERE and get some of the best Hawaiian seafood in town!!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought of great Hawaiian vibe in Scottsdale. Coconuts provides that and much more. 
The menu is a cornucopia of fish and seafood served in a very appealing way. The food is delicious and seated at tables in the shape of surfboards one can enjoy island food while perhaps imagining being in Hawaii. 
The place is run super efficiently and the staff is cheerful and helpful. 
Today I had the Poke Bowl and it was perfect. Lots of tuna sitting on a bed of greens and rice accompanied by appropriate condiments. 
The grandkids loved their chicken and fries. 
This is fast becoming a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Very cool concept with amazing food and wonderful people!  First time and had he calamari, shrimp, and then fish tacos.  All excellent!  I hope they bring one to Fort Worth, Texas!  Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. I like the local style fish plates, taco salad, and the calamari the most."}
{"text":"The \"Island Style\" mahi-mahi grilled fish plate with rice was brilliant for dinner.  I had visited for lunch before and had the fish tacos, but now I realize that the fish is so fresh, it is better to ditch the tortillas.  My party ordered the mahi-mahi with the Asian Flair and Lemon Butter ... both were exceptional.  The coconut shrimp was decent.  I want to try the seafood salad next time.  The wait staff was very gracious and helpful ... nice experience for a place that is not exactly a full service sit-down restaurant.  You order up front, obtain an order number, and the staff brings the food to the table you select."}
{"text":"Love this place, great tasting fresh food every time! There tacos are excellent. The fish plates are well portioned, served with brown rice and healthy. The chowder is great, just make sure you ask they don't give you too much broth but more fish, can be sparse. Overall a good experience, in a well maintained clean environment. They even clear your table."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fish tacos are amazing and a little hard to eat being stacked so high with awesomeness. My favorite here is the calamari and chips. The calamari here is different than I have had before, cut in long strips and delicious. The portions are great and I love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"As an out of towner who visits every so often, I look forward to the fish tacos here.  The flavors are well matched and there js a lot of fish in each serving.  Servings are large and the taco mountain was delicious and could easily serve two or three people.  It is clean and service is fast and friendly.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Visited the establishment for the first time on 5/26. Fish taco tasted very fresh and tasty.  

While this place is a order at the counter and have food delivered to your table, they also promptly remove dishes after you have finished your meal.

Prices are in the 9-13 range for meals.. Again.. you get what you pay for when comparing to places that charge less!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I loved this place so much! I was a bit wary of having seafood in Arizona but we were pleasantly surprised by this place. Over our week stay in Scottsdale, we tried the Ahi poke, taco mountain, fish tacos, seafood pasta, Cajun style mahi mahi on a bun, lemon pepper mahi mahi island style over rice, and macadamia nut mahi mahi. It's extremely hard to pick what our favorite was.
Everything is cooked fresh and seasoned perfectly. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I thought the quality and freshness of the food was really good.  The prices are a bit high and comparable to several local sit down restaurants in the area.  The tacos were very filling and the fish was perfect.  They do have beer on tap that was also a nice plus.  Overall a very nice place if not somewhat expensive for the actual food received."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

I really battled between 3 and 4 stars but taste of tacos and prices forced me to pick a 3. The decor at Coconut's is great. I just love the feel and those surfboard tables. Staff was friendly and answered this newbies questions. As for food, given the yelp discount on the coconut shrimp, we had to give them a try. Hands down, 5 star shrimp. The sweet dipping sauce just made the appetizer perfect. For the first entree, we rolled with the fish tacos. Fish tacos are my jam and I was so excited to try the tacos so many raved about. Yes, they are pricey but I have no issue paying for the best. Sadly, my search for the best valley fish taco will have to continue. The taco just did not hit the spot. Yes, it was good size and had fresh ingredients but it just lacked my idea of a perfect shrimp taco.  The fish was not full of flavor, the sauce was non existent, and it just did not have that street taco feel I love so much. My daughter who hates fish ordered the chicken Alfredo that was tasty and if I visited again, the Alfredo may be the way I would go. Yes I know, not what one should say when talking about a fish taco joint. Lastly, the prices for everything was a little high but probably in line with the Scottsdale arena. Overall, little disappointed but that is probably due to my hopes being so so high."}
{"text":"I adore this place! The employees are always happy, and helpful.  I order the fish tacos with mango salsa and am never disappointed. The fish is seasoned well and the mango salsa is truly amazing! You get 2 per order but they are always filled with tasty fish and yummy salsa. I have ordered the pasta here as well it was good but not as delightful as the tacos. This place gets busy during lunch so recommend going a tad earlier or later to avoid the rush. My coworkers and I eat here at least once a week. If you are in Scottsdale definitely give the fish tacos a try."}
{"text":"We came here over Christmas vacation looking for some fish tacos. The ones that we got were definitely very large (too large to eat easily), but they didn't really have the \"wow\" factor that we were looking for. Also it was kind of pricey for just fish tacos at a non-fancy place. We would possibly go back, but not necessarily for the tacos."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos on the planet. If you're looking for your standard fried fish tacos, you won't find them here. Everything is grilled, healthy and light. So much flavor packed into these. Only downside is that it is virtually impossible to eat without making a huge mess. Get lots of napkins before you sit down."}
{"text":"This is a nice casual place, clean, fast and busy.  It has the best taco I've ever had. Great mango salsa and taro chips."}
{"text":"Pretty decent shrimp and chips.  Not too greasy - you get a nice portion of 6 decent sized shrimp battered and fried crispy & served with tartar sauce.  The fries are similar to In N Out, which is a good thing.  The cole slaw had a weird horseradish vibe that I wasn't into, but not harsh enough to be inedible.  Will definitely head back and try something else - the tacos I saw others order looked pretty good."}
{"text":"The best fish taco's in the valley,  end of the discussion.
In reading the majority of other reviews I would suggest they are pretty much spot on.   The thing I think one needs to keep in mind is that of expectation.   This isn't \"fast food\" which is prepared hours earlier and warmed up for your meal.   Th food is prepared fresh and the quality of the ingredients is very apparent.    Prices while not cheap are a bit misleading since the proportions are ample and 2 tacos to an order will fill you up.   We have visited 5-6 times and the place has just gotten better each time.  Our initial trip soon after opening was not nearly as efficient as have been the most recent trips.   The staff we found to be excellent and the facility is spotless even when they were very busy.

Fish tacos and the fish burger are clearly our favorites.   I think these guys have found a great niche.   The statement \"good food isn't cheap, and cheap food isn't good\" clearly applies.   

I would highly recommend Coconuts fish cafe!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are fantastic. My people are island people, so when we found out that these tacos had ripe and tasty chunks of mango on our fish tacos, we went bananas. Or should I say...mangoes ;) (Yeah, I went there.) The fish quality was fresh and didn't taste like a frozen TV dinner like some other fish taco places I've been to in the past. I was surprised by the size of the taco, since I'm accustomed to having street taco-sized tacos throughout Phoenix. Come with a solid appetite as they are quite filling. The taco mountain (Fish, mangoes, veggies, on top of rice) was also good, but I highly recommend sharing this with another person because it is certainly a lot of food for riding solo.  Which I did, 'cause I'm such a genius. (Well, at least I owned myself, so now you don't have to)."}
{"text":"Nice fish that's well seasoned at a fair price.  I like the mahi Cajun style and enjoy the brown rice and cole slaw that comes with the order.  Their green iced tea is delicious and the employees are super friendly!"}
{"text":"My mahi burger with cole slaw was very tasty.  I got it Cajun style and it had just the right amount of spice without overpowering the fish."}
{"text":"Great ahi poke but the fish tacos are just okay. The Kihei location is much better but this place does the trick when you want fish tacos island style!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service from everyone and great food! Even had an Native Hawaiian elder that sang songs and talked about the culture. Great addition to the neighborhood and we will be back."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are AMAZING, order 2 with an ice cold Longboard and you've found the perfect combo for a hot afternoon!"}
{"text":"Simply as good as it gets.  Wonderful tacos Hawaii-style!  Fish is fresh and tasty. When I went in for the first time, I was back two additional times within a week.  So good!  Friendly, hard working staff, place is clean and packed to the gills (pun intended) every time I have been.  Hands down, a 5 star rating in my book.  So happy this place is close to where I live. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Aloha friendly staff will make you smile.  Great food a little higher on price but it's all fresh so worth it.  The fish tacos are amazing and coconut shrimp is super good.  Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The atmosphere is so inviting and relaxing, thank you Barbara for the warm welcome and the recommendation for the fish tacos its was amazing"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place after reading all the reviews!  It was good.  Not great. We had the fish tacos and my son had the fish & chips.  The corn tortillas were dry, hard and chewy.  Really ruined the taco experience. Not sure if that's normal or there was just a lazy cook not heating fresh tortillas.  The flavor of all taco ingredients was okay and actually bordered on bland. I can make better at home. the fish & chips were average, but I know they are known for the tacos so will give them a pass there. All in all, a fair experience that didn't make me want to go back."}
{"text":"OK, itis well known that I hate fish. So when I was talked into going here I was not happy. So, I scanned the menu with many un fish items and decided to buck it up and try the coconut shrimp that I heard everyone in the restaurant raving about. They use fresh coconut and serve it with a tangy sauce. Well...it was unreal, crispy, not fishy, fresh and once I added a tablespoon of ketchup to the sauce, oh Mama! I also had crispy onion rings that were delicious along with coleslaw that has horseradish in it...the food is exceptional as is the service. Add friendly and helpful employees and you have a recipe for success. A must try. Go early as it is a small place."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were a flavorless disappointment. The fish breading was bland as was the fries. As I looked around it was senior citizens patronizing them so maybe they are cooking for their diabetic and high blood pressure dietary needs. Apparently the chef has a poor relationship with seasoning and salt!
At least they were clean, friendly, and the food was hot"}
{"text":"Great spot to get a taste of Hawaii or SoCal here in chandler. Friendly staff, good food and cool location."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting the Phoenix area; since we went to the original Coconut's in Maui during our honeymoon and loved it, we decided to come here.
Husband got the fish tacos, which were as good as we remembered -- fresh fish with really good coleslaw and mango salsa.  I got the fish taco salad, which was also really good with the mango vinaigrette; my only wish would be to add a little bit of the coleslaw to the salad (the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5).
The service is also really great. Employees are friendly, warm, and enthusiastic. We were greeted when we walked in and attended to throughout our time there, despite this not being a sit-down restaurant.
Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Best place for Fish Tacos in the valley! We moved away from Scottsdale, but we regularly take special trips up from Gilbert specifically to go to Coconut's. I've tried so many fish taco places, and nothing compares!"}
{"text":"I wanted to be wowed...but it's nothing special. The coconut shrimp at Red Lobster or other restaurants is better so is the side sauce. Also I've had better frozen in the box. Didn't have fresh coconut taste or flavor oomph.
It's quite expensive for a quick order type place. Fish tacos looked too \"busy' with too many sauces and stuff and couldnt see the fish. I'm sorry...but the macaroni and cheese the kids had at table nearby looked like best thing there."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a quick good meal. I always order to go and it has always been good. This last visit I walked up to the counter and the gal who was taking my order seemed a bit put out. I usually call in my order. I asked if they could make shrimp tacos (they have shrimp on the menu) she quickly answered \"no\". I then asked if she could check with the cook and I would be glad to pay. Her answer again \"no we don't do that.\" I ordered something else, paid and then waited for my order. It was done and brought out front fairly quickly. I stood up thinking it was mine and I could be on my way. The cook told her it was there and ready. I stood at the counter then thought well maybe it was someone else's order? I was the only one in there besides a table that was finished eating. The gal who took my order continued to merry and clean ketchup bottles for 5 minutes after I stood up. I finally asked \"is that my order?\" her response was \"yes it's not complete yet.\"  She then did a couple other things, put the food in a bag and said here you go. I had tipped when I paid and I wish I hadn't."}
{"text":"Thank you! Best fish I've had in a while. Kids loved the coconut shrimp, and the fish tacos compete with anything on the mainland. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I came here for the fish tacos but I keep coming back for the salads.  The taco salad is pretty good and the seafood salad lets you pick your fish and how you want it cooked.  I mix it up a bit.  Keep the dressing on the side and ixnay the cheese for a nice healthy bite.  They added the ahi poke with taro chips which is always a hit."}
{"text":"I came here at the request of a friend. Boy am I glad I did. Those have got to be some of the best damn fish & chips I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. My mother and I were treated by a young woman named stephany who seemed very happy to assist us and another young woman named Rachel attended to us even while we're eating. Bringing us extra sides and checking on us. This place gave me and my mother a great experience and the food was delicious. I highly suggest coming here and also expect excellent customer service"}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the fish tacos. Very fresh and tasty.  Healthy but fun. Not fried. Consistent quality. I've only taken out this far.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome at what they do: fast, healthy, Hawaiian style fish dishes. Service is friendly, ingredients are fresh, prices are reasonable, and portion sizes are great. I'll definitely be going back. I ordered the seafood salad with Cajun style mahi. It was awesome. Others at my table ordered the macadamia encrusted mahi rice dish and the blackened mahi island style dish. Everyone loved it. The coconut based slaw is genius! Ambiance is super casual and fun. Only criticism would be that service seems more prepared to deal with take out orders - so if you go here to sit and eat you may have to nudge your server a bit!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos!  However, i love the coconut shrimp.. i have to get an order every time.  The place is on the smaller side w outside patio.. always busy...but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Aloha! But wait, maybe Baja Fresh should consider hanging around az a little longer. I heard about this place and thought I would give it a shot. Just like some other reviews, i feel that the fish tacos are huge. I thought the norm for tacos these days were maybe 3 smaller tacos. And this place serves your tacos on individual plates. These tacos are very busy lots of ingredients. Service was good. Pricing.. Little steep but not surprised knowing the address. Might be back. Not sure."}
{"text":"BEST fish taco around. Hands down. My husband had the pasta with seafood and alfredo sauce, it was good but too heavy for me. I was shocked that 2 tacos filled me up SO much. I cant wait to go back. The seafood chowder was also a highlight. The kids mac and cheese was just KRAFT brand but our 1 year old liked it so we cant complain!"}
{"text":"Absolute best fish tacos! I've tried a few of the other options here and they were all good but the fish tacos are my favorite. The serving sizes were also bigger than I expected."}
{"text":"A friend has several check ins here so I decided to give it a try based on their rating. Their signature items seems to be the fish tacos so that is what I tried and they were really good and also huge. Basically you sort of try and fold it up like a normal taco and then go back with your fork and clear the plate of the mound of food that has gathered on your plate because you couldn't quite get your mouth around it so some fell out on every bite. Everybody I came in contact with was friendly and upbeat. There are some other things I want to try on the menu so I will go back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this little gem tucked in to a strip center at Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale! Talk about fresh fish and inexpensive meal in trendy North Scottsdale! The fish tacos are world class with a mix of fresh ono and mahi mahi served in big chunks mixed with a cole slaw of mangos, tomatoes and 15 other ingredients with a fantastic \"secret sauce\" all sitting on a freshly warmed fresh taco-Yummmm! Yes, the companion restaurant is in Maui, HI so you don't feel too far from the beach with the wood tables carved like surfboards and Reggae music playing.
Try it-you'll like it!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous!! It reminds me instantly of a sea town like Key West, Fl with its feel and decor. The staff is attentive and pleasant at this fast casual restaurant that apparently comes straight from Maui, HI, their other location. 

This makes me want to go to Hawaii now. Their calamari is in sticks meaning they use the body instead of rings/tentacles. Very tender well breaded.

The fish tacos are totally crazy good. Mexico City meets Maui in an explosion of flavors. The owner told us the fish is flow in from Hawaii daily. The price tag is a tad high for tacos but I dont care. They are worth every penny.

Now the only dilemna, is when can I go back?"}
{"text":"Been to the one in Scottsdale and this is on par with the other locations. I love love love their fish tacos! So many good ingredients and there is plenty enough sauce! I get these to go because these delicious fish tacos are chock full of great ingredients. Try it once...I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Wow. I was not sure what to expect when we came here on Saturday night. We live nearby and have seen a few restaurants try out this location and not make it very long. But we love Hawaii and anything tropical so when we saw a place called Coconuts we had to stop in. Holy moly this place was incredible. 

The service: friendly but not intrusive. 
Atmosphere: casual (order then sit and they bring food to you). 
Food: Hawaii in your mouth. 

The coconut shrimp was light, fresh and flavorful. The fish tacos were heavenly. One server told us people in Maui wait an hour to get these tacos and I understand why now! I will be back. Awesome patio too. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"I had just come off a disappointing dinner at Grand Blue, diagonally across the parking lot from Coconut's, the week before. Seafood in the desert two weeks in a row? Why not. I had heard good things about this restaurant from a friend and wanted to try it out. Fortunately, I walked away from dinner a happy camper.

We ate out on the patio. It's a good thing I watched what other people were doing while we were sitting there; otherwise, it would have been a long wait. You order at the cashier's, then they bring the food to you. We were told to try the fish tacos, their signature dish, and were very pleased. The serving was generous, the fish was fresh, and it stood out among the many fish tacos we have had.

We also ordered the grilled macadamia-crusted mahi on a salad. While the fish portion could have been larger, the price was right and, as with the tacos, the fish was fresh. The salad also included several shrimps, and while they were a bit salty, they were a welcome addition to the salad.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the coconut shrimp.  It was so delicious! We also had the fish tacos. They were packed with fish and toppings on a corn shell. Very good!"}
{"text":"This is a very clean and modern cafe, the plates are all large and they are not skimpy with the fish! If you like light and healthy food I think this would be a good pic. The ahi fish I had was not too rich in flavor it was very plain and simple but delicious! Their veggies were also plain just steamed so if you love salty heavy foods this is probably not the spot for you, although they do have pasta which I'll probably try the next time I go! Definitely recommend if you're eating clean but still trying to go out to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place every time anytime ;-)

Keep doing the good job"}
{"text":"Wow, really really average tasting tacos for the price. 11 dollars seems steep for tacos loaded mostly with non-fish items, and even then the taste was sort of predictable. Also ordered the Poki bowl and that too was underwhelming. Dont really see the hype for this place at all, doesnt seem to really outshine any Rubios by that much for me. Honestly makes me want to watch Finding Nemo and never eat fish again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Coconut's Fish Cafe. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by two nice young ladies. I ordered the fish and chips with coleslaw. I waited about 8 minutes and my order was brought out to me. 
The fish and chips were very hot. I squeezed some of the lemon over it, and put some malted vinegar on it, I then dipped my fish in the tartar sauce. It was so yummy. The fish was crispy and tasty. There was enough for two people, so my husband and I shared the fish and chips. 
The restaurant has a nice select of shrimp, fish, and calamari dishes. I found the prices to be reasonable. The restaurant is clean and the decor is in the Hawaiian theme with a television in the corner showing surfing, underwater sea life and people in the water in Hawaii. 
**The restaurant gives a military discount as well.**
We will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Hmm ... something's changed with their fish tacos. I hadn't ordered one in many months but did today. They weren't as delicious as I remember. The fish was somewhat dry and tough. The coleslaw sauce was soupier and the dish was slightly spicer than what I'd had in the past."}
{"text":"Great food, great concept! Kinda fast food with super-fresh seafood. Had blackened Mahi and it was the best I've had in years. Love it!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has gotten so many good reviews. As soon as you walk in, the place feels bright, airy, and super friendly. The menu is not extensive just enough variety and everything looked good and healthy, including the kid's menu. 
Their signature dish is their coconut fish taco and for $10.99, it's big- one taco per plate piled high with coconut shreds, fish, mango, and cole slaw. One order is enough for 2 average eater. 
My son got the grilled chicken breast with fries (the other choice was brown rice) and it's a 6 oz. piece of chicken so plenty for a 8 year old. 
All orders come with a drink.  
It's self serve but when we were there it was not busy so the server got us the utensils, ketchup, etc. so that was super nice. 
Hmmm, I think my son charmed her. Haha. 
We'll be back again- if only to sit at the cool surfboard tables!"}
{"text":"No sandy toes, but everything else fits!  The fish tacos are great!  I never can fold them and eat them like tacos!  There's just too much \"goodness\" piled on those corn tortillas!  Hubby swears by the coconut shrimp. It's as good as the coconut shrimp at Shrimp Station on Maui!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I have ever had, friendly staff and quick service Definetley recommend"}
{"text":"Everything it is promised to be, food is delicious, the service is great.  I had the fish tacos, can't say enough, very flavorful and clean. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Quality grilled fish tacos. Very tasty, just a little pricey ($11.50 for two hefty ones). Had some nice beer choices. Vibe is nice. Service was spot-on -- guy at the register was very friendly and explained everything, brought out our food. Owner stopped over and spent some time with us. Still a little too \"fishy\" tasting for me -- next time I'd try chicken. I wished they had a fried fish version."}
{"text":"Coming from CA I use to get fish Tacos from another popular chain that is also from Hawaii. I can't tell you how excited I was to here of another Hawaiian influenced taco place that's only found here in AZ in the mainland. I had the fish tacos and they were the best I have had. It was interesting because I was just lamenting the fact that there wasn't the other chain here in AZ after eating there on a visit over New Years. How nice it is to not only find that which I was missing but to find something better. I wish they had a fish burrito but I was happy with the tacos. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visits here are consistently good. Service is friendly and fast, the food is always delicious! On our last visit we had the coconut shrimp (a favorite) and hot soup (it was a little chilly out, at least for Arizona). I ordered the coconut water drink which was good, but I still say they need to serve fresh coconut water (many other places in the valley do, so why not here?). 

I see recently one of the Coconuts restaurant's opened in Los Angeles and they have pineapple upside down cake with ice cream. Wonder when we are getting that here? I did drop a line to management via email, but never received a response (a little disappointing). Ah well."}
{"text":"Wow, I never would have thought of fish tacos, but man these are awesome. and it did help to have a very icy cold beer to boot"}
{"text":"Best fish Tacos in the western US. Great food excellent service you have to try this place. Calamari is great and my wife lives the grilled fish with rice."}
{"text":"We had the fish tacos, tuna poke bowl and grilled ono with the lemon butter sauce. Everything was outstanding! Since we are from out of town, we asked for suggestions. Jacob was extremely helpful, gave us great recommendations and was super friendly. I also noticed he interacted with all of the customers to make it a fun environment. All of the staff were in great moods and friendly. I wish we had a Coconut Fish Cafe in Nashville!"}
{"text":"Mahi mahi fish was used in the tacos sold in pair of two. Good portion of fish to slaw, however the taste of the fish can somewhat get lost in the jumbo.  Fish was fresh and not too over seasoned.   Still, I favor the fish tacos in Santa Barbara fish market which had some unique and lively seasoning. Was worth the while driving over to Coconut's."}
{"text":"Best fish in Scottsdale.  Great atmosphere friendly staff.  Always good.  Fantastic fish tacos.  Great portions.   Like Hawaii in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos! Wait was ok. Seems popular. My first visit."}
{"text":"Had the two fish taco plate.  Not sure why they make you get TWO fish tacos when it would be nice to have two different tacos.  The highlight was the tortilla as the fish was good but not great and the mango should have been softer.  Enjoyable overall."}
{"text":"It's dangerous how close this place is to my house.  It's so delicious and fresh. Maybe a little overpriced but that won't keep me from stopping by this little place again.  I had the fish taco mountain, which is basically a fish taco on brown rice instead of a tortilla. It was huge for $12. Definitely give this place a try for a fish taco you won't forget."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Not great, but definitely not bad. The service was great, so between the two, the wife and I will likely be back. It's nice to get some fish tacos here in Arizona (we are from California) that are worth their price."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to this place because I love a good fish taco! Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. Though I shouldn't judge the place based off of one experience. The restaurant was busy when we arrived but they did a great job of handling the customers in line. The cashier was patient and friendly. We were able to order almost right away. I of course went with the fish taco combo. I was a little concerned that the rice and beans were a separate charge. My girlfriend told me the tacos were huge so I trusted her and didn't order the sides.

Bought a soda and the carbonation was off. The Dr. Pepper tasted flat and lacked that joyous bubbly fizz we all love. The tacos were ready almost as soon as I sat down. At first I was impressed! However, I was a little concerned about the speediness of the food. Had my food been sitting back there under a heat lamp waiting to be served? I'm not sure. All I know is I ordered my meal after her and she had veggie tacos. So how was my fish ready first? They weren't cold but they weren't hot off the grill either. They also brought her the wrong meal, I laughed when they put down fish and chips instead of her usual vegetarian/healthy obsessed dishes. The corn tortilla was stiff like it had been cooked too long or sat awhile. My girlfriend said hers was soft so not sure what  happened to mine. I did enjoy the mango salsa that came with the tacos. Added in a sweet and salty kinda taste to the meal. Not enough to put it in my top taco list though.

I finished both tacos and was still hungry! I'm all about portion management, but very rarely do I leave a restaurant still hungry. Especially when paying 13+ for the meal already. I'm not frugal, I just like reasonable prices for what I eat. My girlfriend was sweet and offered to buy me another taco but decided to save that extra space for dessert elsewhere! I'd probably go back and give it another shot since I'm a reasonable person, but with other better places to try it may be awhile!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for price value and quality of food. You can order anything and you will be amazed at the quality of the fish"}
{"text":"Ok I really wanted to like this place since it has great reviews and my friend has always said good things about it but my experience today was just meh. I am pretty disappointed.

The fish tacos were pricey, not a problem for me if they were worth it. BUT my fish (mahi) was dry and hard and nothing can save it. Seriously it was hard.

Service was great and fast, but I can't really get over how hard the fish was and frankly I couldn't taste the flavoring they added to it. Ugh"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, we are constantly searching for places to get \"fresh\" seafood. After eating here, we won't have to look any further! The fish was incredibly tasty, no fishy and light. We had the fish tacos and macadamia nut mahi mahi. Both were great! Plus the service was friendly and very helpful. Decent kids menu too which was a surprise! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Our favorite fish tacos on Maui opened up a location in Scottsdale, so I had to try it out while in town.  Well, it looks, feels and tastes exactly the same as Kihei!  Hands down, the best fish tacos in existence.  When are you going to open a spot in Washington?"}
{"text":"Felt it was overpriced for what was served. I personally didn't have the greatest experience here, but even the food wasn't up to par. The fish tacos were too dry and a little bland (lemon/lime help). Not overly thrilled."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time, the fish tacos are so delicious and filling... A little messy to eat but worth it  the shrimp and chips are also just as delicious, especially the coconut shrimp!  The service is great, the staff is friendly!  You will leave happy"}
{"text":"Ate there on Thursday evening arriving 20 min b4 closing-- no worries the two young ladies on the evening closing staff were very friendly and pleasant. We ordered the Ono  and the mahi  mahi dinners with rice and slaw, one blackened and one lemon butter.  Both were very tasty and well prepared. The coconut milk slaw is very good as well.  We also had the seafood pasta with the white sauce(lite creamy Alfredo type). This was heart stopping good with generous portions of fish and shrimp in the pasta although you will need another 45 min on the treadmill to work it all off.
I am excited about returning. I have been to several similar casual dining concepts in CA with  the freshly prepared fish but had not found one in Phx. Looking forward to enjoying an evening or afternoon meal on the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos with Ono and Mahi Mahi.  Try them with the Tiger sauce.  The taste is awesome.  Nice vibe inside the restaurant as well.  Well worth the visit if you hunger for fish tacos or other seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp was good. We shared the fish tacos. I think my hubby makes the best fish tacos. The tacos were good. Not comfy seating. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Different concept. You order at the counter, grab a seat and they bring your food to you on little plates. I thought it was a sit down to order place so that makes the tables turn over quicker and not somewhere to linger. Nice selection of wine and beer. I can't say that I've ever had anything quite like this food before. The fish tacos are amazing. Coconut milk and wasabi bring a new hint of flavor twist. Adding squeezed lemon just knocks it out of the park. I'm not a coconut shrimp fan but am now! The breading is not heavy and the dipping sauce is to die for. Coleslaw is good too. Great place to conforms quick bite and I'm glad we have it located so close to our house! They do a lot of take outs and make that process easy too!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there today based on a recommendation. I ordered the two fish tacos which were just perfect. Two corn tortillas with fish, cabbage with a little coconut milk (modified coleslaw) and mango chunks on top. Squeeze a little lemon juice on it and you will smile. My wife ordered Cajun spiced grilled mahi mahi with brown rice. While it wasn't as tasty as the taco (probably because there was no mango) it was still very decent. There was a small cup of a tartar sauce which was too sweet for my taste and some cabbage slaw. The funny thing is that we just returned from Maui days ago and never knew about this place. The service was very good even though you order and pay at the counter before seating yourself at a table. The server who brought our food was pleasant and attentive and empty plates were promptly cleared. We were asked if we needed anything. You can eat there if you don't have much time because it's pretty fast. We will be back because it was healthy and delicious. I don't generally give 5 stars but if there was an option for 4.5 that would work for me."}
{"text":"This is our new spot for tacos! The fish tacos at Coconuts are fresh, delicious and flavourful.  The staff is so friendly too! One of the sweet girls even held the door for us to make a run for our car in a thunderstorm.  This is how you run a business:)"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were just alright. I had high hopes after reading the previous reviews. My fish was over cooked. The corn tortillas were grilled, but to a (hard) crisp. I guess I prefer a soft corn tortilla that folds easily and a fresher taste than having my fish covered in a mayonnaise-heavy-slaw. Not for me... 

But, on the positive: GREAT service, immaculately clean atmosphere, and a nice little beer selection!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Too much filling for tiny tortillas. No way you can pick that up and fit it in your mouth. Had to use silverware just to be disappointed by a serious lack of flavor. Nothing seriously wrong here, just not enough great things to keep me coming back. Prices were a little high too."}
{"text":"Fabulous flavor and staff just a nice at this location as they are in Maui. Kudos to the owners he has great staff at all the locations we have visited. Fish tacos are to die for. Amazing mango salsa. Mahalo"}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews I decided on the fish tacos;  a delicious choice!  GF, healthy AND tasty!  Friendly efficient service and unique decor.  Eating dinner on the bottom of a surf board in the middle of arid Arizona!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The coconut shrimp is the best I've ever had. Be sure to use Tiger Sauce on the delicious fish tacos. This place is unique & worth the price for the quality of food! I work & live near here & I will definitely be a regular here. I can't wait to try the chowder!"}
{"text":"This bowl of clam chowder is delicious! Steaming hot and full of real clams...lots of them. I also ordered the coconut shrimp with a  yummy dipping sauce and a green tea. All's great except only four stars because the prices are too high for a order food at the counter, get your own drink cafeteria style -no waitress kind of place."}
{"text":"I'm gonna hop on the bandwagon here to say that the fish tacos aren't all that. It's half Mexican half Hawaiian so way too many flavors are happening. They don't tell you what's in the taco on the menu so if you don't like wasabi, don't get the coleslaw on top! A wasabi coleslaw, on a fish taco?! Yuck! A white corner tortilla, Mexican cheese blend and some blended pico de gallo start the bottom of the taco. Then the EXTREMELY flavorless fish fills the middle. You can't even fit this tiny thing in your mouth because of the mango and coleslaw and tomato immediately fall off and onto plate. Seriously this is not the best fish taco..not even close. Only reason this is getting a 3 star review is because they kindly made me a new taco with lettuce instead of the coleslaw but it didn't make it any better..
Plus..our order was brought out to us in less than 5 minutes. Some may think that's great but that just shows me they do not freshly prepare their foods or care about the structure and presentation of the food. Refrigerated and pre-prepared ingredients 100%. The fish is most likely kept in a warmer all day."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp was fresh and made with high quality coconut - gotta try it to start. After that, the two colossal fish tacos were among the best I've had, and definitely filling. Their mango salsa was too spicy for the kids, but perfect for a hot sauce liver like me. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The most horrible fried shrimp ever, that I've ever had!  I'm a professional sports fishing Captain from Florida.  My wife and I went for lunch today.  The order person said it was \"wild-caught shrimp and lightly breaded.  The shrimp had been fried while frozen, they were greasy and heavy with breading, and a small piece of a horrible excuse for a shrimp.  Do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money!  Over priced,  and frozen seafood!"}
{"text":"I work at an apartment complex near by and someone in management came by and brought us coupons and marketing things for new residents. She was extremely nice and we are happy to refer residents to Coconuts Fish Cafe! Thank you for your kind interaction."}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos.  I thought they looked small but they were definitely plentiful and delicious.  Kids hot dog was pretty large and delicious.  Coconut shrimp was nice and crispy with a great coconut flavor.  Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"oh my, i love fish...fish tacos, fish salad, fish burgers, fish burritos, fish spaggetti... this place is great!!
but really, food is awesome, service really good, except when they say hello like 10x and keep  interupting you while your talking with your date and enjoying your fish tacos to say \"everything ok?? i know they are being nice, but really. i just wanna hog down a fish burritto and go"}
{"text":"Good food and fantastic service! The employees are very accommodating and patient, and the food is fresh and healthy. The prices are fair, but the portions are a little small. $9 for 6 pieces of coconut shrimp is a little ridiculous, but I will say it's the best coconut shrimp I've ever had. 

Opt for the ahi tuna salad! The salad portions seem bigger than the rice portions, and they only have brown rice."}
{"text":"Very good food and we went twice in one week. Price is a little high but overal great fish taco. They did not have an option for only one taco more an option for blackened fish but what they did have was very good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  It's a bit on the pricier side but heck it's Scottsdale, what isn't?  

The flavor of the food is just amazing.  I'd totally give it 5/5 stars if it was just a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Loved the Macadamia crusted mahi, paired perfectly with brown rice and coleslaw. I was starved, and this was a surprisingly good healthy meal near the PHX Lifetime fitness.

I ate here 3 nights in a row and couldn't bring myself to order anything else, their specialty was just so good, and the combination with coconut coleslaw and brown rice was just about perfect. Healthy and tastes great."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here yesterday and I have to say for a counter-fed (no waiter or waitress) meal it was a very pleasant surprise.  I had an Ahi tuna salad that was well-prepared and very generous.  The location is tucked a bit out of the way but certainly if you are located in this section of the Scottsdale corridor I would certainly check it out if you would like a well-prepared lunch.

The only deficits that I would point out would be the following.  First, the tables can be a bit cramped for say, four full-sized guys to sit at for a meal of this type.  Secondly, the parking can be a bit hard to get to since this strip mall seems to get quite a bit of traffic.  Neither of these is a deterrant to reccomending this as a great place to grab a nice meal."}
{"text":"This place is great! Tried it on Wednesday night then went back again on Thursday with friends. Only been twice but so far the food has been consistent and fresh. I'm incredibly picky with seafood, and previously would mostly only eat it at a place we love in San Diego - Coconuts is a great comparison and we're not even near the ocean!"}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend who's daughter just got married &!we wanted to gush about the wedding. I chose  here after searching on Yelp for a fish place for lunch near us. We'd both go back again. 
We both had the same plate,  \"Ohna\" ( Hawaiian ) fish with brown rice and coconut coleslaw! The fish tacos looked even more generous but a bit  messier to eat. We would both return again with our husbands. It was a deal for 10.00 approx each for a low fat fish lunch!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new seafood place and discovered this little gem.  The fish tacos and the seafood tacos were delicious.  The seafood was cooked perfectly.  The coleslaw was so fresh.  One of my party had the nut crusted fish.  It was served over rice with the coleslaw on the side.  It also was perfectly cooked, NOT overcooked.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went last nite with some friends and ordered the seafood chowder ( of course!). Then we had a couple of Ahi plates that were prepared seared to order. The staff is great and we love this taste of Maui."}
{"text":"It is so hard to find great food, and great service here in the valley....if you love seafood this is the place to go!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is place is amazing!  Delicious food in a casual \"Maui\" atmosphere with great service.  The tacos, grilled fish platter, calamari and taco mountain are so good.  So glad there is another location at Scottsdale/Shea!!"}
{"text":"The EXCELLENT !!!!!!!! I love Hawaiian style missed Maui ! It's here in this place! Manager was very concerned and seems hard worker!!! Love this place in Arizona!!! Made me feel like  I'm in Maui my favorite place!!!!!! I ate like pig!!!! As usuall.... And flip flop wine is great price and taste!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment.  Reminds of being in Hawaii.  I always get the fish sandwich but my wife loves the taco mountain.  Good stuff for the kids too."}
{"text":"First time there. Really enjoyed the coconut shrimp and the fish tacos. Will definitely be back. Service was great, especially since its a fast casual style establishment."}
{"text":"Best poke and fish in the area. Wish there were more places like this spot! Haven't found anything comparable."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life?!  A great food experience.  I suggest the poke bowl and the shrimp tacos.  Best I've ever had.  Very fresh ingredients, friendly staff and clean.  I hope the OC in SoCal gets some Coconut's soon."}
{"text":"I've been looking for somewhere to get a yummy healthy salad close to home. Coconuts hit the spot. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"First tried this restaurant in Maui, Hawaii. Food was great there in Maui and great here in Scottsdale! Friendly staff in both places!"}
{"text":"Life is better in Hawaii but when you are in Scottsdale eat at Coconuts! We love the Blackened Ono dinner plate. The plate comes with a generous portion of fish which you can choose how it is prepared, plus rice and coleslaw. Service is fantastic. You order at counter then everything is brought to your table when done. We have eaten here since it first opened and always had a great meal!"}
{"text":"This location is a hop and a skip away from me. I hadn't paid it much attention until a random drive home and decided to stop into the plaza. I went in and it was a bit busy but nothing too crazy. I love coconut shrimp and so decided to try the coconut shrimp here as take out. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste. The shrimp were large and fried nicely.  I enjoyed the dipping sauce too. My boyfriend ordered fish tacos but he wasn't as impressed -- probably because there was an error with the order. But I enjoyed my coconut shrimp. We have not been back since the first visit but being that I just realized this restaurant is listed as one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale, ( plus its close to home), I will try to stop by more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos! On par with the Coconut's Fish Cafe in Kihei on Maui :)"}
{"text":"Nice! Neat! Wonderful! Yummy! Yet fresh and tasty Ahi Poke. Highly recommended for all ages. Cute Hawaiian atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time.  Love their fish and chips.  I will try something else when I get tired of them."}
{"text":"Good fresh seafood, little pricey for lunch but reasonable for dinner. Not a be seated & waited on place you have to order your food & drink from the counter but they do deliver food to your table.  Three of us shared an appetizer & two orders of tacos & it was just enough food.  Great place to eat at in the summer heat with the light citrusy style food."}
{"text":"Already the second time here and I am home. All it took was one bite of ahi poke 2 years ago and a monster grew from within. This place really satisfies that craving every time. I went to Hawaii once and Maui was one of the places. This brings me right back to the shores."}
{"text":"I usually come to Yelp to write positive reviews, however, I  went to Coconut's last night and I had to write a review out of frustration. I ordered a bowl of the chowder. I love all kinds of chowder and order it out often. It was not thick and creamy like most chowders, but more a watery base. That's not why I'm writing the review though. When ordering I asked if we could substitute the little side of coleslaw for something else since neither of us like coleslaw. The person helping us said she couldn't. Then I asked if I was able to order one taco and she said we can't do that. Lastly in trying to order, I asked if I could get one fish taco and 1 of another kind she said they can't do that, that they portion the meat in advance and it wouldn't work. I think coconuts needs to take some lessons from Chick-fil-A, In and Out Burger , even McDonald's. I've never been to a restaurant that was so un-accomodating to the customer. Give me a break that you can't do one taco or have one fish and one chicken. Very negative experience. I will say the guy that came to clear our plates was very nice and considerate."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to spend the time to write this review after seeing how many people gave this place such a great review.  My take - Mediocre, overpriced, & a mess!   I agree wholeheartedly with Mike O.'s review from a month ago.  Ono is dry and too dense.  Can't hold on to the taco without it falling apart.  I can think of several places with better fish tacos so I do not understand what the fuss is all about.  If you like a better fish taco at a good price in this area, go to Habeneros.  It is a shame Rumbies is now out of business, it was a far superior meal at a better price.  If you think paying $11 for a 2 mediocre fish tacos is acceptable, then go ahead and try it.  And by the way, there is no salsa bar, and no chipotle mayo for your taco."}
{"text":"My favorite local fish joint.  Never disappointed.  Either Local Style, Ono fish n chips, or lightly battered shrimp.  Cannot miss on a great healthy meal that won't put you in the poor house."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. Loud, overpriced and nothing special.i so wanted to like it but it's just not happening for me. Back to Rubio"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very cold and uninviting. Prices are rather high and selections are not great. Went there with 4 friends and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Every bit as delicious as Coconuts Maui!  Loved the fish tacos!!  Enjoyed the Coconut shrimp and fries were also good.  Longboard beer to make you feel like you're on the island.  
Scottsdale owner stopped by to ask about quality of food and service and was happy to take our input.  
We had stumbled upon Coconuts in Kihei (Maui) just a week prior and thought the food was terrific.  So happy to have this new taste of paradise situated only a couple of miles from home.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place since it's down the street from me. Went with a group of 3 and we decided to go for some fish tacos.
The fish was really damn good, and I'm not a huge fish fan. I really liked the coleslaw on top. I just wish there was a single taco option since the place is a little pricey. A whole plate is 2 tacos and pretty filling, but maybe not for a guy's appetite. The calamari was also quite tasty.
Everyone is friendly and it's a clean, bright environment. Definitely worth a try if you've been craving some Hawaiian style fish."}
{"text":"Please, please, please open in Tucson. I love you Coconut's Fish Cafe. The Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi is so delicious. The coleslaw side is also so tasty. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona since moving here from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The wait staff is super friendly. I like the casual island vibe. And the food is terrific. My only complaint is that it is a bit too expensive to come here regularly for lunch, and that is when I usually like to come here. By the time you get your meal, a drink, plus tax and tip, you are spending about $20, which is too much for a regular lunch spot. I really do like this place a lot - my only wish is that they would add some lunch specials."}
{"text":"A great experience!   Food was fresh and good tasting!  Prices good!  Resturant clean and nicely decorated!   Comfortable seating!  Even better then that the Coconut team was well trained and extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"Seafood pasta was fantastic, lots of Mahdi mahi and very good flavor.  Fish taco mountain was great too. Would come back."}
{"text":"So good! We got the mahi mahi ( blackened and lemon butter) and the calamari to start. Will be trying the tacos next"}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are my fave! So good. The tortillas are grilled so they don't get soggy and fall apart. Amazing fresh slaw. I'm actually from Maui originally and this place gets my approval. I've had the poke bowl which I thought was just so-so which is why I'm not giving 5 stars. But overall this place is good."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time and didn't know it was there. I walked in and could feel the island vibes. I stepped up to the counter and explained to the person taking my order that I had never been before, so he kindly went over what came with the 2 dishes I was considering. I went with the fish tacos and my oh my were they delicious! It was super filling! The staff is great the customers were beautiful and the beer was ice cold. I will be visiting here again to continue eating great good. I hope everyone tries this place at least once! This place should be in more cities!"}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos anywhere!! Fresh fish from Hawaii shipped in 4 times weekly. Unique flavor and tacos are huge. Service is impeccable!!!"}
{"text":"The poke bowl didnt have the freshest fish. Just stick to the fish tacos. They are amazing and overloaded with great toppings."}
{"text":"This food was so fresh and tasty simply put amazing! The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was even better. If I had one minor complaint it was a bit over priced however after tasting the food it was well worth it."}
{"text":"My parents are in town and we decided to go here for lunch. Great choice! I knew it'd tasty based on Yelp reviews and the crowd inside. We got fish tacos and fried calamari. All were really good. The tacos were overflowing with fresh mango, tomato and avocado pieces. The fish was fresh. The calamari was possibly the best I've ever had. No exaggeration. Not sure how they cook it but it's very tender and melts in your mouth. The fries that came with were good enough, especially if you like thin cut fries (like McDonalds). Nothing spectacular though. The service was great and employees respectful and friendly. I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really, really tasty fish tacos! They are a little on the pricy side but the amount of fish, quality and freshness will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Comfortable casual atmosphere, food is prepared fresh and doesn't take too long. Fish tacos were generous portions at a very reasonable price, and just as tasty as the other reviewers say! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my husband, who eats here when in town on business. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the beer on tap was tasty, and the food was delicious. The coconut shrimp appetizer was very yummy and hot, and my poke was delicious and the perfect size. The seafood pasta dish was HUGE, so only got partly eaten, but had lots of seafood. The fish tacos were yummy and large too. Not an inexpensive meal, but quite good and what I would expect from a traditional sit down place even though it was walk up and order. Loved the surfboard tables, too fun!"}
{"text":"The food was average but the service was great! This place is like semi fast-food with higher price to me.

I had ahi-poke for $11.99 and I expected in a bigger portion but came out in a small portion on little plate with few taro-chips, it was OK. I ended up eat again at home because I was still hungry.

My niece had fish taco for $10.99 and came out 2 giant tacos in two separate plates. It was really hard to eat it because there is no way to fold it, so the only way you can eat this taco is by fork and knife. I tested little bit and I thought it was OK, wasn't that much flavor."}
{"text":"It's pretty obvious the food is here is good! I had the fish taco and the fish bowl, so good! Another big plus is the staff is so friendly and so nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Casual but nice and affordable. We split the fish tacos (a must) and ordered both the calamari and the coconut shrimp... AMAZING! Great staff too. We love going to places where the employees are excited about the food they serve."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos = LA FLAMA BLANCA

Taco Mountain is flame

Steak Tacos are Flame 

Poke is Flame"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is extremely expensive for what you get. The mahi mahi sandwich..this fish is great, but then you have this large bun, so all you taste is bread. No fries, no mac salad, just a fish sandwich for around $10.00...then you add a drink. I hope they adjust their menu and pricing, otherwise they may fade away in the sunset."}
{"text":"The servers were very friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. We had calamari appetizer which is quite good.   I have the coconut shrimp and they were very good. My wife had the fish and chips and she was not thrilled about the fish. The grading feel like it had been over cooked."}
{"text":"Yummy fish tacos! I love that the fish tacos are not breaded. The mango salsa compliments them amazingly well. It's like a tiny piece of Hawaii transported to the mainland."}
{"text":"I had the Poke bowl here and it was sooo good! It is really a huge portion compared to any other poke bowl that I've had! You can choose to have it with rice and/or lettuce. I got both but next time I would probably just choose rice. Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"Great food but they need sun shades. It's hard to enjoy $30 worth of tacos with the sun in your eyes"}
{"text":"By far some of the best fish tacos I've ever had. I'm not much for standing in line and ordering but the tacos are worth it. I actually went back up and got seconds. Pretty decent beer selection for as few as they have. The restaurant has a really cool surf theme going on inside and they have outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Oh, Yelp. Usually you are so good to me. But this time you let me down. Coconut's was quite a disappointment - these tacos were certainly not up to the hype of some of the reviews on here. 

We went on a Friday night ready to fill our faces with fish taco goodness. We got two orders of tacos and a basket of fries. In retrospect this ended up being enough food for two people - not to mention it was close to $40 bucks which is a lot for a couple tacos and fries.

The tacos are large, loaded up with mahi mahi and ono, slaw, tomatoes and mangos. They looked really good. First of all they were a mess to eat. The toppings went everywhere because it was so much. But the biggest disappointment was the fish itself. It was super dry and totally bland. The only flavor to the tacos was in the sauce. I was really expecting more from the fish itself since they are called Coconut's FISH caf√©. The French fries were like McDonald's fries and were probably the best part of the dinner. 

Given the price and how dried out the fish was, I highly doubt we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Never had poke before. That said we love sushi. SO wife wanted fish and chips, was in the area and stopped in. The poke app is AWESOME. Tuna and avocado with sesame and soy. Bomb. Plus get the spicy chili sauce on the side. Perfect. Counter service was fantastic and so was table side. Had the fish tacos and made the wife jealous. Two overstuffed FRESH tacos + mango = yum. The fish and chips were great of course but go big or go home. A little pricey because of FRESH fish flown in but price is right and so is value. Environment is beachy and chill. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm very upset I didn't try this place earlier.  I think they are the best fish tacos I've ever had, that includes the tacos in Maui. First, the place is immaculate inside.  It is like very very clean fast food.  I ordered to go and only waited 5 minutes.  I ordered the fish tacos, it comes with 2 and they are massive. I was going to get two orders and the guy talked me out of it.  The tacos were perfect, overflowing with perfectly cooked fish and topped with fruit and slaw. They said the Mahi was breaded but it didn't seem like it.  The tortilla was corn and complimented everything very well.  All of this delicious food was 12 bucks.  It was worth every penny.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This place is always on point. The fish is always cooked perfectly and super moist. Local Style is the way to go. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tried the grilled fish local style- mahi mahi blackened on brown rice! Comes with a cole slaw type salad with tomato and cheese on top. On the side you have a white sauce for the fish. Great portion and delicious tasting!! Coconuts had a coupon that allowed me get 25% off an appetizer for checking in on yelp. Got the coconut shrimp which is coconut breaded shrimp deep fried comes with a sweet sauce....really delicious. I was very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos. I went to Coconut's in Maui many years ago and fell in love. I am so thrilled that Coconut's came to Scottsdale! Always consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"It was ok. The fish in the fish tacos were a little dry and not much flavor, nothing special about the coconut shrimp. The calamari strips were good, but wasn't worth paying $40 dollars for lunch."}
{"text":"First time costumers and  the Friendly and helpful staff made us feel welcome , great atmosphere, delicious food. We will definitely come back to this place ."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Coconut shrimp (25% off with Yelp coupon) , fish tacos, and fish and chips were the things we ordered, and all were great! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good place to try.  I went with the Taco Mountain while my daughter had he two Fish Tacos.  Almost too much food, we should have shared just one plate and that would have been fine.  Good surfer vibe, workers seemed cool, I will be back"}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos and thought they were a bit on the pricy side, but then I got my food and the tacos are enormous and really tasty. I was stuffed and definitely happy when I finished them. My boyfriend got the calamari and chips and wasn't nearly as happy with his meal as I was with mine, so I think I'll just be sticking to the tacos."}
{"text":"Had the fish \"tacos\". The flavor was really good. But I would not call them tacos. They are more like tostadas. There is so much filling on the little corn tortillas that you cannot pick it up and eat it like a taco. They actually serve it with a fork and knife. I know I probably sound OCD, but I was disappointed in having to eat tacos with a fork and knife. It was just weird."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced, but a welcome change from the usual fast food fare offered in the area"}
{"text":"Love their fish tacos!! Best ones in town but I actually get shredded lettuce instead of coleslaw. I love the casual environment and food is alway delivered promptly."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Really good fish tacos and good  service.  Well trained and pleasant employees.  A winner!"}
{"text":"Had a couple of their famous fish tacos. Very pricey for the food you get. The tacos were mostly cabbage. They even used the core of the cabbage which was bitter. On the good side their fish was very tasty just not enough. For the price Tortilla Fish has them beat no contest."}
{"text":"This place is always good. I love the local style mahi. I am not a cole slaw type, but crave the one they serve here. It's so refreshing and light and pairs perfectly with the mahi and brown rice. We checked in on yelp and got a discount on the coconut shrimp. It was crunchy and hot and the sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"This place was poppin' at 1pm on a Saturday! Seating was jampacked!

Fish tacos: I found it odd that they plated the 2 tacos on two separate plates. Poor servers had to juggle more plates!! No sides but it's ok since you just get 2 tacos piled high with grilled fish, slaw and mango! Deliciousness increased two-fold with the slathering on of the tiger sauce they had available for use by the shoyu.

Spicy Ahi Poke: Paired with incredible taro chips! This was a great app to start off the meal.

Grilled Fish plate: Hubby's entree...he seemed to enjoy it! I thought it was very random to have a slice of tomato with shredded cheese on top haha. 

Coconuts is definitely a solid lunch spot! I wouldn't say it was anything too unique or earth-shattering but everything was well-done and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for ahi tuna! The seafood salad was yum! This location had a fun atmosphere and all the staff had smiles on their faces! I will definitely be back to check out more of their menu."}
{"text":"I ordered a taco salad here thinking it would taste your traditional taco salad. It was over priced and was basically just romaine lettuce with chicken mango salsa and cheese. I guess you can't go to a place that's famous for their fish tacos and fish entrees and get a salad."}
{"text":"Wonderful fish tacos and the perfect place to eat healthy on Taco Tuesday! This place is in my neighborhood so I go quite often. They are kid friendly and the d√©cor is a surfer's dream! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is extra clean."}
{"text":"Definitely obsessed with this place right now! The poke bowl is my favorite but you can't go wrong with anything else you order. Their coleslaw is different than any other I've ever had and their fish is always so fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. My wife wanted fish tacos and I wanted poke and we actually found this great Hawaiian place that gave us both what we wanted. Also have a very unique selection of heist flavored teas available. Very creative and very tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"These fish tacos beat all that I've ever had in California. All the different ingredients come together well, so use your hands when consuming them. You won't be disappointed! Looking forward to their expansion"}
{"text":"I just love this casual Fish Caf√© the fish is so fresh and everything taste amazing the fish tacos are also very good  thank you so much for moving to Scottsdale and Shea right by my work so nice to come for lunch or take out dinner A must for everyone to try!!The staff is so friendly where do you go to a restaurant where they open doors for you!!!that isn't $50 a plateThe only other place I have had  Mahi this good was Ocean club and paid a heck of a lot more for it!!!all the best to you guys at this wonderful place"}
{"text":"The place has a very unique set up.  All tables are shaped like a surf board.  the place is bright, nice and clean.  Staffs are super friendly and courteous. 

For the meal, I ordered the fish sandwich, my wife had the coconut shrimp, and kids had the fish tacos.  I have to say, the shrimp is good and the sauce is tasty.  Fries is great too.  However the fish is a bit dry.  Perhaps I ordered ono instead of mahimahi, but still a bit dry.  My friend had chip and fish and he had the same common.  

If I need something, I would come in to eat.  Would I come out of my way for this? no."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The staff is always friendly and the food is great.  Always fresh so unique compared to similar \"fish taco\" experiences.  This has become a regular stop for family and friends.  Highly recommend Coconuts."}
{"text":"Hugggee portions so start small.  The coconut shrimp was great and the fish tacos are insane and almost too much to eat.  The mahi was some of the best I've had.  Usually mahi dries out but this was very good with the butter/salt/pepper preparation. There's indoor and outdoor seating, beer/wine available and reasonable prices considering the portion sizes I mentioned earlier."}
{"text":"I just finished a wonderful dinner at Coconuts. I shared with my hubby; coconut shrimp, fish tacos and macadamia crusted mahi mahi....all very fresh, flavorful...awesome! Adding to a great experience was being waited on by Steven...he had such positive energy and great attitude!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"BEST FISH TACOS EVER! I come here probably every two months and I am so in love with the fish tacos and coconut shrimp! So delicious! The only thing that seems different though is now they're putting salsa on their tacos which they didn't do before. I don't know why. But other than that this is one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Just flat awesome fish tacos.  Perfect serving size.  Your taste buds and your body will thank you after you eat this delicious, yummy food!"}
{"text":"I received a mailer that advertised Coconuts Fish Cafe and explained how they came to be, their philosophy of fresh food, and with two coupons. I showed my husband and we put it in the pile of places to try. Last weekend we finally gave it a try and I'm glad we did. The location is pretty close to where we live and we had actually been to the restaurant previously when it used to be a sandwich shop. It's not a bad location and the inside was completely different. 

When you first walk in, the flooring is all wood and the tables are cute surf boards. You walk up, place your order and pay. They give you a number and you take that back to wherever you decide to sit. We ordered two orders of fish tacos and an order of the coconut shrimp (our coupon was if you spent $20, get free coconut shrimp). The shrimp came out first and were AMAZING. The coconut crust was super light and crispy. (Not thick like a bread coating.) Oh, these were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. They also came with a sweet and sour like sauce for dipping. Only 6 to an order, but I could have ate another helping. 

Next our tacos arrived and it was crazy. Two tacos come per order and they come on separate plates because they are huge. There are 17 layers per taco and it is piled high. You need two hands and an extendible jaw to fit this taco in your mouth. Luckily, I grabbed forks for anything that spilled back on the plate. Overall, the tacos were delicious but very filling. My husband and I agreed we could have ordered one set of tacos and split. I'd definitely recommend sharing if you are a light eater. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow amazing!! We got the fish tacos and they were not fishy at all. That's huge for me. The mango and fresh slaw inside was insanely yummy! We also got the onion rings and seafood chowder. Truly all was superb!! Wine is inexpensive and beers on tap were fab! Out the door for all of this was $37! Cute place w wooden surf board tables... We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here thinking this was going to be a fantastic place(based on all the hype and reviews). 

As soon as you walk in you're pretty much in line. The girl picked up the phone as soon as we were next so we had to wait a bit.

I ordered the fish and chips with a bowl of seafood chowder soup and my husband ordered the fish tacos.

The soup was okay, the onions were cut too big, garlic overpowered the soup. 

My fish was really bland, I had to put a ton of salt, squeeze a ton lemon and dip in tarter sauce to get any flavor. They put the fish on top of the fries, so the fries were super greasy and soft. Blah!

My husband didn't like the fish tacos. Too much going on with all the mango and whatever else they put on it, to where you can't even see the fish or even fold it into a taco.

$40 for 2 of us we could've went to a chain restaurant and had a much better meal for cheaper."}
{"text":"This place was great for fast food seafood. I had the Blackened Mahi plate and he had mahi tacos. Both of us were satisfied with quality and taste. Food was delivered to table hot."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Absolutely love the fish tacos and the ahi poke is one of my favorite ever! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was very good!  Both my wife and I enjoyed both dishes, will return soon!"}
{"text":"This small Hawaiian themed foot print Is fast food meets quality eats.  Two Scotsdale locations:  Shea & Scottsdale Rd and across from the Promenade.  Truly, one taco order can be split, with two corn tortillas topped with fish, sauces, salsa and lots of slaw.  An ample seafood stew, salads, steamed veggies, fresh fish cooked to order and many other sides and menu items.  Beer & wine and many bevy alternatives.  Speedy and spendy, but worth it.  Give the Tiger sauce on the table a try as it is xcellent with fish."}
{"text":"Food was quick but mostly flavorless. We got
Macadamia nut Mahi mahi - bleh
Kids spaghetti - bleh
Kids butter noodles - bleh
French fries - soft
Calamari - good
Grilled ono - okay
Mango even keel IPA - yum"}
{"text":"Just got back from Florida and went to some really special fish restaurants. None compared to coconuts! Although we can't have a huge fish selection here in az it's nice to know we can get some great fresh seafood here. The mahi is full of moisture and local style blackened is my go to.  I also come often for a snack of coconut shrimp appetizer currently 25% off every time with Yelp checkin!  Try the Asian flair sauce (wasabi aoli) with the coconut shrimp...or mix it with the Thai chili pineapple sauce it comes with!"}
{"text":"A buddy/co-worker mentioned this place to me and I thought to myself sounds good but everyone claims they have the best taco spot.  Well it was a lot more than just a taco shop had some of the finest seafood/Hawaiian style food in the world ! I had their tacos that had like a mango salsa and what taste like ginger topping and I absolutely fell in love with their spot."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. Coconut shrimp was delicious and fresh. Fish tacos were amazing and flavourful. While fish was well cooked. Loved everything including the service and the vibe. If I'm in town again would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I just have to say that we love this place.  The service is always friendly, the food is super fresh, and the ambience is just fun! How you can walk out of a restaurant in the middle of the desert feeling like you're actually at the beach is beyond me. 

The fish tacos are not to be missed. We always end up licking the juice off our fingers in a very unattractive way. But that's how you know it's good! You literally don't want to miss a single bite!

Highly recommend Coconuts, whether you're a regular local or in from out of town."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for lunch to check out Coconut's. The atmosphere is really cute, nicely decorated and made me feel like I was back in Maui. I had two grilled fish tacos that were very different with fresh mango chopped on top. They were delicious! My friend had the tuna poke bowl and she really enjoyed her food as well. I'll definitely go back and take my husband and friends. Good job Coconut's Fish Cafe! After moving here from South Florida years ago and not finding any good seafood, however, the fish tasted fresh and solid white Ono I believe it was. Please check out Coconut's and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. So happy to have Coconuts in Chandler. Used to drive to Scottsdale for them. Great casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I just had the macadamia nut Mahi Mahi and it was fantastic! My little girl had fish and chips, also, terrific! Great food, great service!!! Please open in Queen Creek, we need a healthy, wonderful place like Coconuts!!!

LOVE IT!!!!"}
{"text":"excellent fish tacos.. its not the best fish tacos i ever had, so they don't totally get full stars.. overall excellent location.. clean and friendly staff.. will go there again.."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it a higher rating but was disappointed. I will say the mahi mahi was good. The rest of the experience was bland. The gal taking my order was bland and unhelpful. The rice that came with the mahi mahi was chewy and tasteless and just bland. The coleslaw was very bland. The quesadilla that my daughter ordered was also just blah. When I mentioned the tasteless rice was chewy, the worker turned and left, never returned. Very expensive. Maybe I just ordered wrong?"}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos! They are so fresh, and the mango salsa is a perfect compliment. They give you huge portions, and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Super Yummy Fish Tacos and Coconut Shrimp!!!  My mouth isn't big enough to eat this. So much inside, it was a lovely mixture of flavors.  I had to tap out at just one. Definitely coming back to this spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food, price & choices. 
Kids menu was good choices. Interior setup had a Hawaii feeling, similiar to Islands of the past."}
{"text":"Definitely overrated and overpriced! We are always on a hunt of great restaurants in AZ(California spoiled us endlessly with amazing food) so when something new opens and people rave about it, we rush to it! Unfortunately, Coconut's doesn't taste authentic enough. And the price is a turn off."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting fish tacos! Gotta love a simple meal of two tacos that includes the freshest ingedients (mango!) where you  feel completely satisfied at the end but none of the guilt. Smart,  use of not just one but two, lightly toasted tortillas to hold the yummy contents including a light, coconut sauce (no mayo!). AND havent even mentioned the amazingly attentive staff, even if they're following the newest trend of top-quality food with counter service. Oysterbay wine, draft beer, Martinelli apple juice, all the fresh lemons you want....the list goes on, including a third location opening soon in Chandler! (Written by Boston foodie, if that matters.)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious food. I LOVE this place! Reminds me of being in Hawaii. Please open a north Phoenix location!!!!"}
{"text":"I accidentally posted his to their other location which I'm sure is equally as good but want to make sure this new spot gets the credit it deserves. Super friendly staff convinced us to come in and try their famous fish tacos and we were not disappointed. Sooooooooo so good. My husband and I split one order and a side of onion rings (also legit). Good vides, great food, we'll be back for sure!!"}

{"text":"I'm never sure about trusting fish in Arizona but both meals I've had here have been fresh and delicious! The first time I went I (obviously) had to try the fish tacos and they were really good...plus they are huge! Yesterday I went back and tried the grilled fish over brown rice (pictured). I chose the Mahi Mahi and a lemon butter prep, requested sides of salsa and their really yummy mango salsa, and it comes with cole slaw too. Super delicious food, not to mention a healthy and good-for-you lunch option. The open patio really does make it feel tropical! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So good. Got the fish tacos, and they are large as other have noted, but unlike others I was able to pick them up. I have large hands ;). Very delicious and right amount of flavor, liked the pineapples. Get an appetizer and you could probably split the tacos unless someone is starving. Clean place and friendly staff. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the blacked  Mahi.mahi, with Cole slaw and rice. it was very good. Great flavor.  Can't wait to go back and try some of there other stuff.  Place is very clean and the staff is great too."}
{"text":"Not the best fish tacos I've ever had but pretty good.  For first timers they recommend their coconut shrimp for appetizers and their fish tacos for the meal.  The shrimp were surprisingly good - batter a tad bit too thick in that you could barely taste the shrimp but the coating had a good flavor with the coconut.  We liked it better than we thought it would be.  
The fish tacos come as 2.  They are HUGE.  Even my bf thought you could do just one as a meal with the shrimp appetizer.  The tacos came with a LOT of fish and toppings and sauces.  Flavorful.  I tend to like mine simpler but with the amount of fish you get, it's pretty impressive.  What I really liked is that they really crisp up the bottom tortilla so that when you pick it up to eat, the tortilla stays in tact.  No worrying about it coming apart which is good b/c the toppings are overflowing.  I do like that they had a good amount of chunks of mango for the mango salsa.  They don't skimp.
I miss the fish tacos back home but these are a pretty good substitute."}
{"text":"What a horrible mess. Bland, blinding (lighting) and chunky. Fish very moist but bland as hell without the squirt-bottle slather. 2 stars. Maybe for lunch?

i think they're trying to fill the hole left by Rumbi's departure across the street.

--cute upside-down wooden surfboard-like tabletops, but
# the tables slip and slide easily on the floor. hang on to your dinner!
# presentations completely off. feels like it started as a food truck and they forgot to upgrade the food when they found a permanent buiding.
# who wants to eat a huge pile of food ketchup-bottle-squirted with goopy sauce all over the top?
maybe if i'm standing at a street vendor in mexico!
# get rid of the cash register and table numbers. you can do it better and cheaper with waiter service.

This place has huge competition in the immediate area. Maybe this concept works in Hawaii, but there is absolutely no beach to be found, and the only view I have is of the parking lot and the mexican restaurant next door."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos!
Full of fresh, fruity salsa, sauces and perfectly cooked fresh fish. Very healthy and filling. Tacos are big too.
This is a really casual place, but it's clean and the Service is great!
My kid ordered a hot dog of all things but he really liked it and every time we drive by there he comments that it's the place with the good hot dogs!"}
{"text":"This is a great little eatery designed after the restaurant of the same name in Hawaii. This is a dine in restaurant with a definite Hawaiian theme complete with flat panel TV's with continually rolling surfing videos.  Wood tables and benches are designed to look like surfboards contributing to the Hawaiian surf theme.

The restaurant staff is super friendly and helpful.  Fish dishes are the specialty and the food is awesome. My favorite is the taco mountain. This is a popular little eating spot that enjoys lots of return business due to the atmosphere and the great food. Great place for a quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"I really thought this place was great. Really good food, everyone was friendly and helpful. Nice little casual get away. I enjoyed it so much I went for lunch and dinner yesterday. I'm in from out if town and staying in a hotel close so i figured why not? :) I highly recommend it. I will probably go back again tonight. I'm kind of boring though. Lol

Have a good one!"}
{"text":"First time eating at coconuts fish caf√© let me say it was amazing.  I had the local plate which consists of mahi-mahi grilled Veggies and rice which was  some of the best rice I've ever had in my life. The mahi-mahi was marvelous!!!! My friend had the seafood salad which consists of grilled mahi-mahi and shrimp on mixed greens and we loved every bite. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this gem. The fish tacos were delicious and full of flavor! I can honestly say that the coconut shrimp is the best I've ever had! And the service and friendliness top notch! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My in-laws have been coming here and love it. They can split the fish tacos or risk overdoing it by having both. We ordered chicken and rice for the kids, the shrimp appetizer, steamed veggies and side salad. All very fresh. Service was outstanding and beers great and reasonable. the chicken kids had was dry and clearly overlooked but hey... You don't come here for chicken. 

Just for the fish taste I would recommend and will be back.

{"text":"Stop reading this and go get some fish tacos. Coconuts has a good variety of fish fare easy to order and fast service. Jasmine blackberry tea was delicious."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos and sea food chowder. Seemed a little expensive, but after seeing and tasting OMG more than enough food for two and so yummy.  

Definitely a unique experience and a great place to take your honey.  

I like the paintings on the wall showing the different types of fish they serve. 

We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Coconut's has the best fish tacos and tuna poke. We were so impressed with the food, availability of gluten free options, and service. The outdoor patio was really nice too. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"One of the best fish tacos you'll ever have.
It's overflowing with deliciousness and super flavorful. Good deal for the price!

The people there are always super friendly, we've gone on Friday nights and never had to wait, and they have decent beers on tap."}
{"text":"I took my family to be here after church Monday I had to fish local style my wife have a taco salad and my son had fish and chips. After we left my son started getting sick and threw up for about 4 to 5 hours and was sick all the next day. I called the restaurant to notify them and talk to the manager and come to find out they cook the shrimp and the french fries in the same oil cross contaminating. They never notified us or had a sign out saying that they do that. I called the health department and they went out and had a chat with inspected their kitchen. Don't go to this place if you have children with a shellfish allergy. They still to this day do not have a sign up notifying you that they cross contaminate their food.The manager said she would call me back to check on him and never did. Typical."}
{"text":"I had fish tacos in Maui before, I can say this place's fish tacos are just as good, except they are about twice as big.  Very good!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. I got the coconut shrimp appetizer, 6 of them, was really good but over after that it went down hill. The macadamia nut mahi mahi was over cooked and kinda bland. The sauce that comes on it is weird and the side of slaw has no flavor tastes like you are just eating cabbage. The fish and chips, well the fish part was good but the chips were fries not thick cut fries like British chips are suppose to be, also they were not crisp. The tarter sauce that comes with it is more of a dill sauce. Over all the place is overly priced and just ok tasting. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars, it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Inside, it feels like a vacation in Maui! The staff was informative, enthusiastic and friendly. I had the ahi burger (filet, seared) which had cole slaw on it (which I usually pass on, but had a good feeling about it this time. Or I was just super hungry!) Delicious. And my gut was correct about the cole slaw, creamy, savory and chunky cabbage - yum! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thirty two bucks for two fish tacos, two iced-teas and an order of fish and chips.
I'm opening with this in order to partially explain the low star count.

My spouse enjoyed the fish tacos, which did live up to all the hype. Sadly, I had a basket of fish and chips and it did not.
Of the three pieces of fish, the first piece sampled was foul, reeking of spoiled fish and tasting like jack mackerel, one of the fishiest flavors in all seven seas.

The second piece was delightful compared to the first, while the third had me on the edge of my seat wondering whether it was spoiled or flavorful? 
I took a small bite to test the water. It was neither, somewhere in the middle with its fishy odor and complete lack of flavor. 

I should have sent it back but didn't, since I'd just gotten into an argument with my spouse over what to order and needed to prove she didn't out-order me.
So I ate this stinky load o' bait by coating it with ketchup, holding my nose and swallowing it whole, like I was a fucking sea lion or something.
Fast forward four hours.

I'm sitting here with a bad case of heartburn, a sick stomach, a wallet that's thirty two dollars lighter, and a spouse who \"can't wait to go back.\"
Well she can go back and eat the whole damned place out of fish tacos for all I care, but I'm never going back. Fuck that. I have principles and one of them is this:

If I'm going to eat out, it should never be a mystery. At the very least, I have certain expectations and albeit low, they're expectations just the same. One such is to NOT get blindsided by knowingly munching on anything stinkier than all fuck."}
{"text":"Love the tacos! It's a cross between fast food and a nice sit down Resturant! I like the flavor of the tacos very refreshing!  The staff is excellent and the place is pretty cool!! Clean too!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are excellent and great portions. The onion rings are also some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"This place was great. You walk in and order at the counter but the guys working there are so nice and sweet. I had never been so I asked how they liked to eat their fish burger and then ordered it. I know they are known for their tacos but I wanted a burger.

IT WAS MASSIVE!!! The fish was extremely fresh, flaky and tender and didn't have a hint of fishy flavor. The tartar sauce was great as was the slaw. Next time I go I will try the tacos fo sho! Everything is grilled so you don't feel awful eating and even after, you feel great. I ended up just eating the fish and slaw because I felt like the bun took away from the fish.

FYI - the pricing is high, but the portions are huge and you also pay to have some of the freshest fish in AZ so its worth it. Not an all the time lunch place but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe is amazing! I haven't had fish that tastes this good since back home in Australia. 

I tried for a long time to find fish and chips in Phoenix/Scottsdale that I liked and my search is now finally over. 

The menu is awesome and I have now officially tried everything and haven't been disappointed once.

My stand out favorites are of course the fish and chips, fish tacos and macadamia crusted mahi mahi. 

I love the atmosphere in this cafe. The surf board tables are especially cool and with the surf videos playing and beach decor all around I almost feel I could step out the doors and straight onto the beach. 

The staff are also wonderful. Always friendly, smiling and very helpful. 

I was thrilled to see a second location has opened up in Scottsdale :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The employees are very welcoming  and the food is fresh and delicious. I ordered the local style and my wife ordered the seafood salad. Both entrees were absolutely fantastic. It's like a slice of paradise in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos and they were wonderful. The seafood chowder was delicious. The service was curtious and professional."}
{"text":"I don't know how to explain this place.  I don't see it as a normal cafe.  They serve appetizers and entrees plus beer and wine.  I guess it doesn't matter as long as the food is good.

We heard about this place having good fish tacos so we decided to check it out.  When we get there, it is pretty clean and the setup is comparable to other taco shops.  They have music from Hawaii playing over the system and the decor is made to look like you are in hut on the islands.

We are greeted at the counter with an Aloha.  The waitress could be from Hawaii but I am not sure.  I then place an order for 2 fish tacos, a fish and chips, a Ceaser Salad with grilled fish, and a kids fish and chips.  I also use the check-in deal for the Coconut Shrimp appetizer and 2 beers.  After the order, I ask her who's idea was to take this from Maui and open it up here.  She couldn't understand me initially due to my pidgin accent but she eventually got it and pointed me to the asst manager Adam who gave me the breakdown.  I told him this place doesn't really look like home but the prices remind me of Hawaii.

We sit down and notice the tables are shaped like surfboards which was cool.  To my surprise Adam comes back and gives us a plate of poke and fresh taro chips.  Super Mahalo to Adam for that.  Shortly after, the rest of the food comes.  The poke was goos but the taro chips were awesomeness.  They shave it and fry it there then lightly salt it.  The kids loved it.  The Coconut Shrimp was also good and had a little heat to it.  My tacos were filled with so much that I could hardly bite it.  Once I did get my mouth around the monster, I was impressed with all the flavor.  The cabbage tasted fresh and gave it a different texture.  The fish were large chunks and the sauce not to overpowering.  The surprising part was the ripe mango chunks on top.  I am really not a fan of ripe mango but this gave it a fresh taste to the taco as if it was cleaning the pallet for the next bite.  

The family liked their orders.  My son didn't like the fish grilled but finished it anyway.  The ladies also finished their fried fish and only left a handful of fries.

We will be going back when soccer season is back but need to save up the cash for our next feast here.  Hawaii is expensive.  Even in the AZ."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last night with my dad and stepmom; we really dug this place! Although their fish selection was surprisingly limited, they were all GREAT healthy options (and could be prepared a bunch of different ways, e.g. Cajun, blackened, Asian style, etc.): mahi mahi, ahi tuna, and ono (otherwise known as wahoo, a really good mackerel-tasting type of fish). Everything was fresh, flavorful & served quickly! I got the ono (prepared South of the Border Style), with brown rice & steamed veggies; my dad also got the ono (prepared with butter, salt & lemon), with steamed veggies & Hawaiian 'cole slaw'; stepmom had the grilled shrimp and panko-crusted shrimp plus steamed veggies, plus a glass of Oyster Bay White Wine (which she also really liked). Anyways, we had a real good experience here--not just with the food but also with the cozy, happy and laid-back island vibe of the place (cute little surf board-shaped tables, surfing videos playing on the flat screen TV, reggae & Hawaiian tunes playing overhead, great service,  and a young, good-looking, efficient and upbeat staff! We could easily see why this place is so popular and why it quickly filled up quickly the entire time we were here (we barely got a table--which luckily, was able to accommodate my dad's wheelchair, since it's a bit cramped inside and plus, it was too cold to sit in their outdoor dining area). But anyways, I'm 99.9 % sure we would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I actually hesitate to write this review...only because I don't want this place to be (even more)  flooded with fans, and then I can't get in, LOL.  Superb food, very reasonably priced, in a cute atmosphere, with excellent/upbeat employees.  What's not to like?  I've dined here many times and once at their original location in Maui, HI (which was slightly more expensive and not quite as good!).  My guy loves the coconut shrimp and I always order the Ono or Mahi \"Island Style\".  Only teeny drawback:  they tend to slightly overcook the fish & it tastes a bit dry; I asked them to \"undercook\" my Mahi & it turned out fine. Love this joint...excellent for take-out too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went their Saturday night around 7:30 pm and it wasn't very crowded. But after we ordered it got full. Our order came pretty quick and tasted very good. I had the fish and chips. The portions were about 6 in.long and was filling. So I recommend you eat their."}
{"text":"Aloha, indeed .. I absolutely love this fish cafe ! It is one of three spots in the area Scottsdale road , Shea and one in Chandler. I always get the fish tacos , they are just so amazing. I've also had the grilled fish and it's fantastic if you are wanting a lighter choice . Fish tacos are made with 17 ingredients which include mango salsa that is to die for !!! Hubby loves the ahi poke bowl with pickled cucumbers, ginger, radish , mangoes , ahi , edamame , & red onion over greens & brown rice ..The bowl is light and tasty . I also enjoy this restaurant due to its commitment to sustainability and use of only earth friendly products . Tacos just arrived ! If you haven't been here yet, give it a try!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, not anymore! I went there today and picked up a fish taco order. I then came home and ate it. Almost immediately afterward I regergated the entire meal. Can you say bad fish?"}
{"text":"I thought it was just ok. There are many good places for fish tacos better than this."}
{"text":"Fantastic food once again. The Fish tacos are some of the best I've ever had and the service is always quick. The mango salsa on the tacos really put them over the top. This is the type of food that fills you up and doesn't make you feel bad for it."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer,  a cup of seafood chowder and the ahi poke. All were fresh, flavorful and delicious. I would recommend giving it a try. A little pricey but very good."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first due to the price point on the fish tacos. $11 seems like quite a bit just for two tacos w/ no sides, BUT I was redeemed. We placed the order to go and the fish tacos filled and entire to go box for 2 so lots of fish and yummy toppings.

Service: Very fast and I was greeted by a very friendly cashier as well.

Fish: Tasted extremely fresh and I believe it was grilled Mahi. Well seasoned and flavorful

Coleslaw: Fresh and crisp and not overdressed. Almost had a horseradishy (word?) taste, I liked it, it was not overwhelming. And the mango salsa was so good, the mangoes tasted very sweet and ripe, sooo good. You will want a fork to scoop up and eat all the goodies that fall out, because they do fill the tacos generously. And another thing is that the corn tortillas hold up the whole time, I really despise a broken corn tortilla, lol! But they do them right!

 Keep it up Coconuts!!!"}
{"text":"Food is terrific! Restaurant is always clean and the service is always prompt - Especially when Chelsy is working! Love her inviting smile and dedication to awesome customer service! Thanks for always putting a smile on my face & yummy food in my stomach!!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a small shopping center next to Paris-Paris off Scottsdale Road and Bell.  If you've ever had WaHoo's, you have a good idea what to except.  It's Hawaiian style fish tacos.  This means:
     - Fish is grilled, not battered and fried
     - Fish is mahi-mahi or ono
     - fish comes in good size chunks
     - No cheese or sour cream
     - The portions are HUGE

The fish was fresh, the mango salsa topping was delish.  My husband and I each got the fist tacos, 2 to an order, and both commented that next time we'd get one order and try something else.

My biggest complaint are the prices (10.95/order for the tacos) and that the rest of the limited menu is made up of fried foods.  There aren't any sides to speak of (fries or onion rings), the apps are all fried (shrimp, calimari, etc).  Seemed out of place for a joint which serves everything fresh and homemade.

Overall a good tropical style fish taco."}
{"text":"I was hoping what happened to this place wouldn't be it's typical.  They were great when they first opened, got popular and then they tanked.  Food has gone down hill BIG TIME and it's now probably just another tourist trap ... not good news for yocals.  We had the fish taco's and they were HORRIBLE.  The lower tortilla was too hard to cut with a knife and the upper one was soggy with virtually no fish on them.  When I brought it up to the kid working there, he said \"that's how we usually cook them\".  Ummmmmm, really?  We get a refund but for just the taco's and they keep our full tip on the bill for just two drinks.  The young lady (Manager) needs some training.  It's sad as this a little gem in the hood when they opened.  We won't be back and judging by the few people there, they won't be there long."}
{"text":"First time here - ordered the poke and fish tacos.  Everything was fresh and fabulous.  The tacos were enormous and the mango salsa was delicious.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is here. 

Took company who was visting from Maui and even they were very disappointed. 

Greasy fried fish and sides. And awful taste. 

Probably the worst casual seafood place I've every been to."}
{"text":"Coconut's is an interesting mix of expensive, good quality fish prepared in a more informal way (As fish and chips, tacos, etc.) served up in a casual setting. I stepped into the restaurant and loved the beach theme decor. The tables and chairs are surfboard shaped!

After browsing through the menu I decided on the fish and chips ($11.99). It was a generous portion of 2 battered fish, with crispy fries and coleslaw served in a basket. The fish had a herb seasoned breading, and was more tender than super crispy. The fish was nicely cooked. The fries were decent, but I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw. It tasted bland with very little dressing.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Service was cheerful and friendly, and the staff would check up on me to make sure everything was OK."}
{"text":"Poke is fresh and flavorful!  Kids menu kept our children happy while we ate some Hawaiian treats on the shaded patio."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos!  We go here often.  My husband doesn't like fish so he gets the chicken tacos and they are really tasty.!  I love this unique place great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were amazing!  The service was above average.  They were friendly and quick.   This was my first time here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!

Really love the island vibe, love the music, love the artwork. Was pleased to see my favorite artist, Heather Brown, only her art should be in the main dining room not the bathroom!  :)

I had the vegetarian tacos which I LOVED!  Different from your standard taco, I was initially reluctant to try, but turned out they were really flavorful & tasty. I love the house made slaw!

I will def be back."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in AZ! You get 2 huge tacos with one order. They are messy and perfect! The fish taco salad is also great but the tacos are #1! I have been back multiple times and will continue to be a customer."}
{"text":"The blackened fish sandwich is pretty tasty. We are happy to have this place in our neighborhood. I hope it stays! I wish they served white rice instead of brown though..."}
{"text":"Coconut Shrimp for appetizer is nice with the mango sauce. 

Macadamia nut MahiMahi is a generous portion size with brown rice and coke slaw. 

The fish tacos are big enough that one would be enough.scrumptious and flavorful with lots of texture.  The corn tortilla shells had a nice crunch where they didn't fall apart.  

Come hungry for some great seafood at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love some of the people who gave this place 1 star just so they could be different and go against the grain.  I mean come on people, Phoenix has some of the worst restra"}
{"text":"Love coming here when I am in Scottsdale.
You have to try their amazing tacos. You will be impressed. Love everything about this place. First Coconuts I experienced was in Maui. Just wish I was in Hawaii eating here"}
{"text":"First time trying coconut's fish cafe today. I took the food to go and it was AMAZING!!!! I can't wait to go back again and I'll definitely dine in next time. I instantly recommended to some friends. 

I ordered shrimp and steak tacos, as well as the shrimp and chips. They were all phenomenal  the family enjoyed it too!"}
{"text":"I had the seafood Alfredo and it was huge and lots of fish. The calamari was gross, chewy probably overcooked  with some lame breading that fell off. The coconut shrimp was good with a really interesting asian sauce. Staff was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp were scrumptious! My husband and I split them for our appetizer. So yummy, and we order them out frequently. Definitely a winner here.
They were cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce was delicious! I thought I was back in Maui! 
My Husband tried the chowder next and liked it a lot. It was full of seafood and had a very unique, delicious flavor.
We split the fish tacos and they were the best ones I have ever eaten. They are not the usual fish taco with SW flavor a. They are definitely a Hawaiian taco, and the mango adds a delightful sweetness to their special ingredients. I wish they were in Denver where we live. This is a place I would come to often!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in chandler. Friendly service, simple and fresh menu with tasty options"}
{"text":"Mahi hahi on a bun with butter, salt and pepper is amazing! Huge piece of fish! Tastes fresh like it's just been caught. My kids love their fish and fries."}
{"text":"I picked up a friend for lunch yesterday and when the location we originally planned to go had no parking (impatient) we drove up to North Scottsdale to try Coconut's since I had read so many great things about it. The restaurant is very clean and not too theme-y, I liked the layout. They have a patio and tvs inside playing Hawaiian films on silent. They have a pretty big menu, and I asked if it was possible to have two different tacos with the tacos plate (I wanted to try the fish but couldn't commit to two). I was advised that they don't \"do that\", so I just got two chicken tacos with a side of fries and a drink ($18). We were told the wait would be about 15 minutes and it wasn't too busy but we kept ourselves occupied. My friends fish tacos came out first, and when I came back to my seat after getting a refill I saw one taco and fries. I was a little confused, but about 5 minutes later out came the other taco. I was also confused because since they came out on different plates - why couldn't I get two different ones? Whatever

The tacos are giant and you could probably share two and a side with someone else. I wasn't a huge fan of the mango salsa (or any sweet salsas for that matter), but I liked the tacos and probably would have enjoyed them more if I put some hot sauce on. I also liked the fries - came in a huge basket that we shared. The service was good and while it was a little pricey, I will probably come back to try their infamous fish tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos. The Mahi tacos are scrumptious. Service was exceptional. Will definitely be back.  Order tacos in the original style."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if possible...I am not sure how they have the best fish tacos, the fish lacked flavor, over cooked and dry.  The only thing on the plate that I enjoyed was the mango salsa. The other salsa provided tasted like pace picante.  The best fish taco definitely is not here I would take Rubio's over Coconut's any day...very disappointing."}
{"text":"We love this cafe.... great food never disappointed, my favorite is the taco mountain!! His favorite is the ahi poke!! We love the staff but especially Nora (daughter) she's always there to please her customers!! Go try it today.... you will love it too!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds us of Hawaii and it's always a fun dinner with my teenage boy and hubby who can't get enough of the fish tacos or the best Fish and Chips in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love their fish tacos as well as their fish salad, highly recommend this place, very casual, great for a quick stop, the only reason I didn't give a 5 star because they are a bit on the pricier side but  they are very good."}
{"text":"First I have to mention how the staff are always extremely polite and pleasant!!!  The fish tacos are delicious. This is a great place to grab a quick, healthy and lite (depends what you order of course) lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious fish. That salad is OK. But for the price, I thoroughly recommend the place. Not great but always reliable"}
{"text":"Very impressed!  Split an order of spicy poke with taro chips, perfection!  Also split an order of the famed  fish tacos, wow!!!!  grilled ahi & ono topped wth tasty mango salsa & coconut milk slaw. Mmmmmm. So good!  Are we still in Az? Kinda felt we were sitting  in a casual beach side Hawaiian eatery where the knowledgeable & friendly staff really made you feel welcome! Aloha! We will be back! Hanging 10 on this one :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome food- just discovered it today, loved lunch so much-- I ended up there for dinner. Please open one of these in Columbus Ohio!"}
{"text":"What a fun little find! We had the fish tacos with the amazing, homemade mango salsa. Everything tasted so fresh. The furniture are cute surfboard tables and benches. There is also mist patio outside (no dogs). 

Hope to visit the original restaurant in Maui someday. Thanks for bringing a piece of Hawaii to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Looks like you're in a beach town with a little Maui thrown in.  The fish tacos are yummy!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit to Coconut's and had an absolutely wonderful experience.  Staff was most helpful!  smart, well trained and really geared to customer service .  Fish tacos outstanding and plentiful order of 2.  Coconut shrimp and calamari both hot and fresh.  Well prepared with great sauces .  Fish and chips hot and fresh.  Delicious food, great staff and comfortable setting."}
{"text":"I came here a little skeptical because I don't like fish. I got the chicken tacos which were absolutely incredible. There was so much flavor and complexity to them. The slaw on top was great, the sauce was awesome, and they were big and meaty. I was a little annoyed that I couldn't get 1 chicken and 1 steak taco, because they \"proportion\" the meat for the cooks, so it was for their convenience, not mine. I would have appreciated if they would take the customer into consideration when making these decisions and accommodate that. So 1 star off for that. Otherwise, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Close your eyes and imagine waking up on the beach of a tropical island. You see palm trees lilting back and forth in a gentle breeze like tall, proud hula dancers from an age long past. As you lie on the white sand and let the salty waves ease you from your slumber, you hear steel drums and the melodic hum of a dozen islanders approaching you. Soon they surround you and lift you up on a magnificent litter made of woven palm fronds and a kaleidoscope of soft feathers. The islanders set you down in the shade of the swaying palms and begin to rub your body with warm hunks of wild boar lard. As they grease your arms and legs, more islanders begin feeding you delicate morsels of grilled white fish. In between your heavenly bites, attendants pour sweet, nourishing milk into your mouth from halved coconuts, not bothering to wipe up the excess drops that dribble down your chin, slowly collecting on your chest in an pale pool. Before long, your skin is covered in a soothing blend of coconut milk, pig fat, and briny ocean water. Grains of sand and flakes of fish stick out from your hair like the trappings of some ancient sea sprite. You lie back down on the sand and doze in perfect contentment.

Now open your eyes. That's about what it's like to eat at Coconut's Fish Cafe."}
{"text":"We had their fish tacos,  what they are known for. Just 2 tacos piled high with fish, coleslaw & I don't know what else... In fact so high that it was impossible to pick up to eat without making a big mess!!  Each taco came with 2 corn tortillas, so we made 4 tacos out of it!  Very good & very filling!!  I would recommend anyone to try this place at least once!  The counter girl was very friendly and answered any questions we had.... She also mentioned instead of the tacos we could order the mountain high something (sorry I forgot), but the same things comes on a bed of rice instead of tortillas (maybe a little less messy too)"}
{"text":"Loved it here!!!! Fantastic service and amazing fresh food!!!! Had the fish tacos and wow!!!!! Don't miss this place fresh, friendly and fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is a must for Scottsdale! The staff, especially Eddie, added so much to our wonderful meal. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The fish tacos were to die for!! We will definitely be back.....or fly to Maui!"}
{"text":"If you want a generous portion of mahi in a semi-fast food environment for a great price, come check this place out. I was torn between the tacos versus the mahi plate but decided on the blackened mahi and hubs got the macadamia crusted mahi. 

I loved my food! Nothing makes me happier than good food and coconut's fish cafe made me happy. 

The coleslaw wasn't your typical coleslaw. I don't know if it was the cabbage but I almost tasted a hint of wasabi. It was delish.

Love the fact it comes with brown rice too. Healthy and tasty. Best of both worlds!

Oh, don't forget to try their coconut shrimp. I could eat them by the platter full. So good!"}
{"text":"Ono local style on brown rice with the coleslaw was ono! (Delicious!)
Staff was friendly and helpful, prices are reasonable, and the fish was cooked to perfection! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and got the fish tacos.  They were absolutely huge.  I couldn't even pick them up without stuff falling out.  Very good too.  The coconut shrimp was pretty good, also."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are really good. Chicken Caesar salad is really good here too. Everything is really healthy tasting which I like. I love the Hawaiian water bottles they sell. The place is really clean & they have cute surf board tables and a cute area to sit outside."}
{"text":"This place is good the fish tacos are great they taste fresh and its grilled not fried which is great for me because I'm not a huge fan of fried fish tacos. Be careful though because there's two in an order but the tacos are so stuffed you may only be able to eat one. The staff is very friendly and attentive I didn't know the was avocado in the mango salsa which I'm highly allergic too I told the cashier and she had them make me a new order without any attitude. The only thing I might complain about is the inside is kind of bland there's very little decor but I think the service and great food makes up for it. I will definitely be a repeat costumer especially since it's so close to my house"}
{"text":"Delicious. I have been looking for a good fish taco place for years. As a Seattle native, I am picky, and getting fish at restaurants in a land locked state always gives me the heebies unless I go to a 5 star restaurant. This little joint opened up right down the road from my house and lemme tell you, so worth it. First off, the gentleman working behind the counter was awesome. Seriously, this guy loves his job and it is so apparent. He asked if it was my first time then went through all the ingredients in their tacos, what makes them special, and recommendations. Didn't even sound canned, just authentic. I ended up getting the fish tacos (two tacos, so massive) and the seafood chowder. Both unbelievably delicious. Coconuts gets this pacific northwesterner's stamp of approval. I am a customer for life, thanks guys for such a great experience."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here. I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious! The order is HUGE. 2 tacos but 1 would have sufficed ( and I am a pretty big eater). The grilled fish was excellent and the toppings ( Cole slaw , tomato salsa and mango) was great ( I was a little concerned it would  not all
 mix well but it does ). And finally, the servers could not be any friendlier . A MUST RETURN restaurant ."}
{"text":"Had the Ono prepared Asian style. It was delicious. The Cole slaw had a nice spice, and the hearty brown rice was a nice base.
Will definitely visit again. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I've been avoiding this place, but I'm glad I finally pulled the plug to eat here.  I was not disappointed at all.  With all of the reviews pointing to the coconut shrimp and the fish tacos that's exactly what I ordered.  The staff was friendly and the food came out very quick after ordering.  The coconut shrimp was probably the best I've had in a while.  The fish tacos were loaded with fish and toppings!  Don't forget the awesome tiger sauce that makes them a little more spicy!  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Being from LA we have tons of places that serve fish tacos. After reading an article on Eater about Coconuts coming to LA, I was super excited to try as I was going to visit my parents in Scottsdale. I'm so glad I did...BEST FISH TACO I HAVE EVER HAD! Yes, that's a bold statement, but very true. The fish was perfect. The slaw was amazing. So fresh! I can't wait to go again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times now and while I still love this place, their fish tacos and seafood chowder, I have a few suggestions I hope are heard...

- as another reviewer noted, please add the coleslaw to the taco salad. I didn't check my receipt detail, but I hope I didn't lay the $5.99 thats on the menu for a side?!
- the Caesar either didn't have enough dressing or the dressing is too \"watery\"
-even though it was a busy Lenten Friday night, I didn't expect to wait forever for silverware to be replinisged, firsthand forks, then on another trip knives, the finally spoons... Might be a serious dish washing problem?
-food came out in 3 shifts so no one ate together

I still love the food, although there may be some inconsistency as not everyone's vet taken here or talked to agrees.  Hope, hope, hope it gets figured out."}
{"text":"Will write  a more detailed review later. Coconuts is now my FAVORITE  place to go for fish. Everything is fresh, hot and delicious. The restaurant is sparkling clean and service is great  Definitely a must try for fish lovers. :)"}
{"text":"What a great find this was.  Everything on the menu looked good but we narrowed the choices down to the shrimp appetizer (6 lightly breaded, full sized shrimp - 3 panko and 3 coconut) which were great.  For the meal, we chose the famous fish tacos and weren't disappointed.  Plenty of fish, topped with cabbage and diced mangos.  Nice slightly spicy sauce on the bottom of the tortilla gives everything a nice balance.  Al fresco dining was a great choice on a terrific January evening.  Very nice servers added to the experience. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. This food is incredibly delicious and nutritious. I always feel very righteous after eating here, like I did my body a big favor. Brown rice, delicious fish, and the best coleslaw ever. I usually have the Taco Mountain, which is the fish tacos on brown rice. The tacos are also yummy, but messier to eat. At the fountain drink station they have zero calorie SoBe Diet Cranberry Grapefruit drink. Delicious! The Coconut Shrimp appetizer is a must. 6 shrimp with a lovely sauce. All seafood is fresh and perfectly cooked. Yum. I eat at both Scottsdale locations all the time."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I've tried several items I the menu and have yet to go wrong. Their mahi mahi is always prepared perfectly. It's great to get a little taste of Hawaii out here in the desert."}
{"text":"California Family 
Loved it loved it loved it!!! The fish was so delicious and the staff very nice. Would recommend to anyone looking for good and healthy place to eat."}
{"text":"I don't like coleslaw. I don't like fish. The fish tacos with coleslaw are amazing and also gluten free. I am so happy this place opened!"}
{"text":"The staff couldn't have been nicer, helping us order and keeping the place in shape.  I have to type this review with a hand over my eyes.  It's painful delivering a negative message to such nice hard working people.  Let's pull off the band aid-The fish tacos are dry and under seasoned and $38 for 2 orders of fish tacos, tasty onion rings and 2 drinks in a no waiter restaurant is too expensive.  There."}
{"text":"Not my first time at this place, been to three locations, one in Scottsdale, this one, and the one in Maui.. very surprised at the consistency of the food, usually multiple visits in different locations do not yield such great results. 

I usually get mahi mahi \"Local Style\" which is over rice and delicious coleslaw (not like any other slaw, if you like slaw you will love it, if you don't like slaw, you will love it) you can get the fish grilled in so many ways, I usually get butter salt & pepper, lemon butter, and if I'm feeling squirrelly.. Cajun. 

Let's not forget the fish tacos, the gem of this place, I don't eat them for lunch because I never finish and I'm usually on the road so I can't doggie bag it..  these guys are just as delicious as the plates but with more flair, and uniqueness. 

We need more spots like this, Coconut's.. please open up in East Mesa."}
{"text":"These are the best fish tacos ever! I came on a recommendation from a friend who just visited them in Maui, and wow I'm so glad I came! Met the owner of the franchise when I was eating dinner and he was very helpful and friendly and shared his whole story on how he opened the location."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my food but found it very messy and hard to eat. I ordered the tacos but ended up eating it with a fork and knife. That's my only complaint everything else was good."}
{"text":"Ya, wow!  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  The food was amazing.  The service was amazing.   The chef is walking around making sure everything was good.  You could tell this guy genuinely cared and wanted to make sure everyone was happy with their food.

I ordered the Ahi Poki, fish tacos, and Mahi Mahi salad.  All of it was amazing, but that Poki stole the show for me.   Another surprising thing, they don't skimp on their portions.  It's legit.   I felt the price I was paying, for the portions I was receiving, and the quality of the food was all proportionate."}
{"text":"The fish tacos here are amazing! They're huge so one was enough for me! Best place to get a quick fish taco that I've found in AZ. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great fish tacos this is the place you want to go.  The flavors are all there but the only really I can't give it 5 stars is because half the taco ends up on the plate... they pile 2 small tacos up WAY too much.  I would be perfectly fine with the portions if they were just in bigger shells. I hate the fact I get tacos and eat a large amount of it with a fork, just not what you would expect.  It's also relatively expensive.  You can get fries but they are additional to the taco price, which are also expensive.  I'll still be back but some small improvements could go a long ways."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews did not disappoint. The fish taco mountain was delicious. The dipping sauce for the coconut shrimp was was different in a good way with a little kick. The surf motif was nice and the videos transported you to the beach watching surfing. NEED to get to Maui. :)"}
{"text":"I was vacationing in Phoenix for a few days and wandered in here to kill time and my hunger before heading to Taliesin West. Can I just say wow? Service was so friendly, and the blacked Mahi Mahi over brown rice tasted incredible. Super juicy with a perfect grill char. Whoever is cooking back there knows EXACTLY what they're doing. I also don't typically like coleslaw but this was so fresh, and balanced perfectly with the fish. It's very casual but if you're deciding where to eat after shopping in the area do yourself a favor and come here."}
{"text":"It's a little storefront.  You order at a counter and about 15 minutes later (it will be freshly prepared) someone brings you your food.  You fill you own soda and iced tea. The menu is limited almost exclusively to fish, shrimp, and calamari, prepared either fried or as tacos.  How can Coconut's possibly earn five stars??

The answer is in two words -- fish tacos.  You get two to an order for about $10, served on individual plates.  At dinner, one filled me up about 3/4 of the way, so you can order soup, salad, or a side dish and share.  But you may prefer overstuffing yourself to giving up that second taco.

The staff will proudly inform you that there are 17 ingredients in a taco, but by itself that doesn't prove anything.  What's important here is that there are not one or two, but three distinct components that shine through, each one a superstar.  #1 - the fish, which is a mixture of grilled ono and mahi-mahi.  #2 - the cole slaw, chunks of cabbage with coconut milk (no mayo).  #3 - fresh mango pieces.  The other 14 ingredients no doubt are also contributers to the overall flavor.  You pick up the taco with your hands so that you get a mixture of ingredients in each bite, dripping juice and dribbling tomato pieces onto your plate, grinning from ear to ear, and not talking to anyone while the flavor lasts.

I can't say quite as much for the other menu items.  For example, the fish and chips is okay, with the fish being the same fine ono and mahi-mahi but the preparation being indifferent deep frying.  The chips (french fries), however, are almost as good as McDonalds, and that's saying something.  I still have to try the coconut shrimp, chowder, and a couple of other sides ... if I can ever find the room."}
{"text":"This is the second time at Coconuts.  Fish tacos are very good the first time, piled high with all the fixin's.  Today I had the fish over rice cooked with butter, salt and pepper.  Very tasty and a sizeable piece of Mahi Mahi..  Very good with a beer chaser.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled ono with brown rice and veg. Kinda disappointed because I read a lot of reviews and had high hope for this location. When dish arrived. The fish were over cooked. It's quite dry. Even thought I ordered it with lemon butter sauce. The fish were very rubbery. Brown rice and veg were fine. My friends ordered a fish taco which they were known for but maybe it's a mistake ordering this fish."}
{"text":"By far the BEST fast/casual place a person can go! Things on the menu are healthy and fresh! With gluten free options there is nothing to complain about. 

The manager Ashley was super sweet and kind. Checking on us as well and answering any questions we had! The food came out of the kitchen super fast and super fresh. I've eaten here before and every time, it's been amazing!  It's a serious must go!!!"}
{"text":"Get the fish tacos and order a beer.  The fish tacos are made with love.  It's a legit dish with quality ingredients.  They need to expand and open more locations."}
{"text":"The portions are really small for the price. The food is good but you can get better elsewhere at that price point. The coconut shrimp was good however the sauce they served with it was horrible. We had 6 people in our party and not one person cared for it. Other then that the food was just average. This place looks like fast food but I don't think it is. If you want seafood or fish I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good for a fast food lunch. The fish tacos and fish and chips are good, the kid meal spaghetti was drowning in grease. Decent beers but mediocre white wines. Very friendly service. Need I add it's located in a strip mall?"}
{"text":"Stopped by during break from Phoenix Open, great place.  Fish tacos, coconut shrimp are off the chain, atmosphere with surfing being shown on TV's & surfboards adds to cool Hawaiian vibe.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the coconut shrimp. I love the Ahi Seafood salad. I love macadamia nut Mahi Mahi. 
This the closet thing in the valley to eating on the North Shore. 
The staff is absolutely phenomenal and very friendly"}
{"text":"Yummy fish tacos and Poke but Coconut Shrimp is the must have here! Friendly service and food came out fresh in less than 3 minutes! Worth the drive from Chandler, we will be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos.  First rate ingredients and execution.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I don't love the decor/ambiance.   It's feels a bit like a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I only had their spicy poke bowl, but I went to a different place for my first poke bowl and almost never had another. The other place, poketrition, served me room temperature tuna that felt old. I didn't eat most of it because I was worried about the quality. This place totally changed my mind. I got mine on salad to keep it lighter than rice and I was so good. And the perfect amount of spice too!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally had a chance to see how good the food really is. When I first walked in it seemed like there was a buzz in the room. Guess it was people enjoying there food and time here. Very interesting with surf boards as tables and benches. 
We ordered their famous fish tacos, fish & chips and a cup of seafood chowder. Once we ordered the food then boom, it was at our table very fast and friendly service. 
I though the fish tacos were really good. The mango and tomatoes really brought out some really good flavors in those tacos. The fish and chips was good with two small portions of fish. The tartar sauce really brought out the flavor of the fish. Without the tartar sauce, the fish seemed a little dry. The seafood chowder was very good and glad we only ordered the cup cause it was perfect to share with my wife. We had just the right amount of food and thought it was a little expensive but what do you expect for seafood. 
Overall I enjoyed the service and the food. Hopefully we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has the best fish tacos I've ever had. I don't even like fish tacos that much. The staff was friendly. The fish tacos were a large portion."}
{"text":"My new favorite little  place with a nice patio, great customer service and, the  BEST fish tacos anywhere!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's like a cross between a fast-food and a regular restaurant.  It has a really casual upscale fast-food atmosphere, and the food is really fresh and delicious!
It has become one of my favorite places for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Love this place so much.  Great location - great food.  Fresh fish, and authentic island food."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, and tasty. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Fish taco is decent but definitely not the best; does get lost under all other ingredients they pile on top of fish
Fish fillet in the fish and chips meal is dry and overbreaded, nothing to brag about.
Clam chowder was decent.
We tried fried calamari - rubbery sticks. 
They claim to prepare everything from scratch - out food came out after less than 5 minutes - not sure how it's possible to prepare fresh to order (there were 5 of us).
Not a fan..."}
{"text":"Today I had the seafood salad with the grilled mahi - fish was so tasty and moist - cooked to perfection.  The shrimp were just as tasty!
My new favorite weekend lunch spot."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the calamari appetizer and the taro chips. I got the blackened ono and expected a small portion for the price but was pleasantly surprised at the full plate of food with a nice portion of fish probably 5-6 ozs.  The fish was nicely cooked and was nicely spiced.  about a third of the plate was coleslaw, maybe a little too much mayo for me but it was tasty.  The remaining portion of the plate was brown rice with the fish on top. The weird thing was the thick sliced tomato on top of the cole slaw, it had shredded cheddar on it.  But some how it worked once I cleared enough space to easily cut it, a poor mans version of Caprese?   I cleaned the plate, was nicely full and happy with the dinner.  I'll be back to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go to get our fix for a nice piece of fish!  We always have great service and the food is awesome!  Ono is our favorite and they know how to prepare it!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great as it always is here folks are friendlier than the other location Very important to us!"}
{"text":"We had the shrimp and chips and fish and chips and really loved it. The French fries are really thin and hot and crunchy and were so good. I also loved the coleslaw but it's not finely chopped so that could throw you off if that's your preference. The cocktail sauce was also spicy and delicious. Service was awesome and the guys came over to the table to refill drinks and bring more sauce which was nice even though it's sort of a self service place. Total bill for the three meals and a bottle of wine was about $56.00."}
{"text":"Surprised to find fresh mahi-mahi and ono tacos topped with chopped mangos and coleslaw in Arizona! The creamy fish chowder was off the hook!"}
{"text":"For those expecting a breaded crunchy fish taco, these are different. But be aware they are quite delicious. Too mountainous to pick up and eat, the chunkiness of the cabbage and fish pieces make for extra work when it comes to digging in... but it's worth it. For lunch, I tend to split an order of their flagship fish tacos (two of them come per order). I tried their spicy Ahi poke as an appetizer and was quite impressed. Served with plantain chips, it delivered that sushi-grade raw tuna experience that you sometimes crave. And the marinade (soy, sesame, and green onions) it was served in was perfect... yum!

They have a decent condiment selection here too, next to the self-serve drink fountain. However, I was disappointed recently to find that they either no longer stock (or were out of) the Tiger Sauce. I thought it was a great complement to the fish tacos. Cholula is fine... but the Tiger Sauce plus Tabasco was my jam!"}
{"text":"What a great find! We were sent here from a local chef/owner who RAVED about the fish here. Being a self proclaimed fish snob, I couldn't wait to check it out. They delivered! Fresh, delicious and generous portions of some of the best fish AZ has seen. (finally)  I also love that my husband can get his taco fix and I can stick to something healthy with a salad if I'm not up for tacos or fish and chips. Yum!  Also, great staff every time we have been in."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good seafood in the desert, but this places does it. Their fish tacos with mango are tasty!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good ! Food is delicious, good size portions, clean and friendly staff  food arrived quickly once order was placed. Ordered fish and chips and the fish tacos both were amazing, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite spot to go out to in the valley. I love the fish burgers!! Service is top notch and is always a good time. Prices are decent as well. If you have not been to this location go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Im in LOVE LOVE LOVE with their fish tacos! I crave them! I am so glad they opened up a location in S Chandler."}
{"text":"The food was good but not for the price. 2 fish tacos for $11?! No sides just tacos. They lose a star for price alone. If you have extra money to blow the food is worth it. The tacos are stuffed to the brim and are tasty. The atmosphere is fun.
Negatives :
Bad fishy smell outside (I'm assuming heat and dumpsters aren't a good mix)
Too pricey for the food
Positives :
Good food
Great design and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend and was told the fish tacos are excellent.  Couldn't agree more.  Super fresh fish and the tacos were very tasty.  Will be returning soon to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Great place! I've eaten here often, and made it one of my favorites. It's a little on the pricey side, but well worth it. Try the Taco mountain or the fish tacos. The staff is extremely helpful. And will help you with how you want your fish prepared."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from my friends who've had it in Maui and raving about it, when they told me one just opened up here, I had to try it. My mom and my aunt and I just went and it was amazing. The restaurant is so cute especially the tables and the menu has such variety. My mom had the fish tacos that come with mango salsa and they were excellent. My aunt had the fish and chips and it was wonderful as well. I ordered the seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce and it was to die for. There was a lot Mahi Mahi and shrimp in the dish which was nice and they make it from scratch every time. The sauce wasn't too alfredoy but had a little different taste to it and it was really good! Definitely a place to go to and keep going for a long time! Plus the service is nice! So great!"}
{"text":"just ok for over priced food.  orders the fish salad.  what a healthy dry dry piece of fish with no flavor.  they forgot the 3 grilled shrimp.. had to request it and they provided.

fish tacos and fish salad.. $30..  nah..

fish tacos are a mess to eat.. tortilla just ok.. again.. dry fish .

table were cute surf board themes, but try to seat 4 around with food plates.. no way."}
{"text":"I just had fish and chips for lunch last time. I should get serious next time trying their great food."}
{"text":"Really good all the way around!!! We had the fish tacos and the calamari and it was excellent! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service ! The restaurant was very clean too ! The manager and his staff were very friendly  ! We will def be back !"}
{"text":"If you love fish tacos, Coconuts is tough to beat. Great service. Great food. 

As an added bonus, this place is very kid friendly. Whenever we are in North Scottsdale we try to go to Coconuts."}
{"text":"So glad they moved so close to me. Love the concept. Food was delicious and served promptly. The place was packed too and still received fast service and my food came out hot and fresh. I had the Mahi grilled with Southwest seasoning served over brown rice with steamed veggies. Fish was moist, cooked perfectly. Sauce was spicy but not overwhelming. Brown rice was good. Veggies were fresh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I didn't know I would like this place so much!  Every single employee has always been very kind and friendly, with helpful suggestions. 

The fish quality is great, I love getting the spicy ahi pokey with taro root chips, fantastic!  It's on the menu as a starter, but I usually have this for a low carb filling meal.  

I have had their fish tacos, and like everyone else says they are delicious. I generally do not like coleslaw things, but here it is not overly soggy and not sweet. It really does work with the tacos - trust the menu!

 My only complaint is that I cannot get one taco ala carte; it's an order of 3, and I can't eat that many by myself. So I don't get the have one unless I bring a friend.

 They have a great little patio out front with sunshades. A pleasant place to set."}
{"text":"As overpriced as you would imagine for this area of Chandler. I enjoyed the Caesar salad with mahi-mahi and will consider the tacos next time I'm in the area. Nothing to go out of my way for though! Probably one of the only decent seafood places in S. Chandler, hence the high prices."}
{"text":"Fish tacos and coconut shrimp! Okay and the taco mountain rocks as well.  Who knew the best fish tacos I've ever had would be in a land-locked state!?"}
{"text":"Went with the family and everyone really enjoyed it. Casual beach feel, helpful quick service. Fish tacos are the specialty and were really tasty. Loved the fresh fish, coconut milk slaw and mango. Great combination. Small and eclectic selection of beers on tap too."}
{"text":"I have a picky wife and this place satisfies her health consciousness and my love for delicious food. Fish tacos are bomb!"}
{"text":"If crack were a food, it would be Coconut's Mahi Fish Tacos, and I would already be in jail....

Discovered this place through a friend, and my first thought on looking at the dining area was 'okay, it's students on a budget night', that's cool.  Surf board table tops, bright colors, counter service and Island music...  I asked the super friendly and peppy server behind the counter about leaving off the cole slaw, and the crushed and disappointed look on her face immediately changed my mind.  We were served two huge, drippy street corn tacos loaded with mango, perfectly grilled mahi that tasted like it had just been caught, and shredded fresh cabbage etc in a delightfully light and fresh sauce.  I clearly saw that I had ALMOST made a disastrous mistake, and was glad I took the plunge.  The poke was and continues to be fresh, fresh, fresh, served with light taro chips, the coconut shrimp is amazing, but it's those tacos that get me..... as I drive up N. Scottsdale, I can almost hear them.  They call to me, taunt me, assault my senses with flavor and wafting smells through my car windows, and I cannot resist.  The service is always cheerful and fun, the outdoor space is nice, and take out never disappoints."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing and packed with flavor in every bite. I've been here probably over 40 times and this place has not disappointed me once. Friendly respectful staff and amazing food what else could you ask for. And very reasonable prices for the amount of food which is a lot."}
{"text":"Definitely the best fish taco place in the area! Everything was fresh and delicious. I wish this place was closer to Chandler so I can eat there every day."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Menu options are fantastic and reasonably priced. The only thing I wish they had was delivery. The cafe's atmosphere takes me back to Hawaii and the staff is always friendly and helpful! Love your teas too."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp and fish tacos are really incredible. We wish we had a place like this back in New York. We came here twice and instead of trying new things the second time, as we normally would do, and we could not resist repeating what we had the first time."}
{"text":"We had been at the Coconuts in Maui and were really looking forward to trying this Coconuts.  The restaurant is easy to find, clean, and well-kept. The wait staff was very helpful and friendly. When we entered we all ordered fairly quickly since we were all getting the famous fish tacos.

When we got our tacos we were all very excited to begin. The presentation was beautiful.  The tacos were big and piled high, and very colorful.  After taking a couple of bites, I realized these just weren't the same tacos.  First, they were tomatoes mixed in with the mango salsa. Those two flavors just don't mix very well.  Second, there was a particularly peppery flavor somewhere in the mix.  It was also very little mango salsa, and what salsa there was was not very sweet.  

Overall, it was a disappointing experience. I think if they upped their game a little, they would be on par with their Maui counterpart."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Cute little place. Too busy for its size! Tasty tacos. Finding a table is the problem."}
{"text":"Cute little seafood cafe. Service is always friendly - you order and pay at the counter and they bring your fresh-made food to your table. 

Many fresh and fried options. We tried the calamari and shrimp. The shrimp wasn't anything special and reminded us of something we'd get from Costco and cook up at home. The Calamari on the other hand was delish - a great, non-traditional strip format (not the usual calamari rings). We've had this on two separate occasions and each time it was very tender, as it should be. The breading is so light it does not detract from the taste or texture. All it needs is a couple squeezes of fresh lemon and it's perfect. No sauce needed."}
{"text":"Coconut's Fish Cafe is about the closest I can typically get to Hawaii here in the Phoenix area.  I've been lucky enough to drop in here on several occasions with family and friends and it's always a great meal.

You're usually greeted with an 'Aloha' and a smile at the counter.  I typically order the Grilled Mahi Mahi \"Local Style\" over rice and it is top notch.  You have an assortment of seasonings available to you, from Asian Flair and Cajun to simple Salt, Pepper, and Butter.  The coleslaw it comes with is also super flavorful, I'm always licking my plate clean!  They also have some great fish tacos amongst other seafood choices.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu here.

The cafe is not terribly large, but I've never had an issue finding a spot.  They also have a small patio that is great during summer evenings.  Everything is decorated with a Hawaiian theme and there's a nice relaxed atmosphere about the place.  I've found it can get a little busy during the Friday lunch rush, but they're pretty efficient at getting your order out.

What a great spot in North Phoenix.  I'll be back to Coconut's again soon, hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great advice on fish tacos. Had an employee even come over to explain best way to eat them. Great vibe here!"}
{"text":"I was more than surprised by this restaurant. It's a tasty experience with some of the nicest people working there. You can get a beer and enjoy a taste of Hawaii. Love it! My entire family went and ate and played games and drank beer. We were visiting family in the area and needed a break so we escaped to this place and felt completely refreshed.  I recommend this for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Aloha!! This place seriously is amazing! The staff ate great, funny and helpful and the food ridiculously awesome. Totally would recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is as good as it gets!  My husband loves his poke bowls from San Jose, CA and I wanted to try this place.  He ordered the spicy ahi poke bowl over rice and greens (me, too), the kiddies ordered the steak tacos, and fish tacos.  The food wasn't too spicy nor overpowering.  Hubby said that this poke bowl was different than his SJ favorite, but not disappointed, saying this may be his favorite AZ poke bowl.  Woo Hoo!  The steak and fish tacos came with the coconut milk coleslaw, which none of us preferred.  It was not bad- just not our flavor.  We are definitely coming back without the kids!"}
{"text":"You bring me back to Maui!! Wait, I'm in landlocked Phoenix? How does this fish taste as fresh as it does in the desert of PHX? Simple menu with a clean surf motif dining room, Coconuts is a straight forward seafood paradise in the heart of the desert. Started with the Coconut Shrimp App, awesome shrimp with a delicious chili sauce! Make sure you check in and get the app at a discount! For Dinner I went for the fish and chips. The fish isn't like your typical beer batter fish, but a light crispy layer of panko (I believe) covering a mild moist fish. I believe that the fish is only frozen once based on the taste. I also snagged a taste of my GF's fish tacos, that mango salsa, cabbage and ono is unreal. That taco will make you feel like your on the beach in Lahaina watching dolphins play with mermaids. Yeah, they exist! Coconut's, Mahalo nui loa!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch occasionally with my coworkers. It's definitely a hot spot in North Scottsdale for such because sometimes it's hard to find an open table to sit down. Although I've not ever been to Hawaii, it definitely has the tropical vibes down. 

My first time coming, a coworker raved about the fish tacos.... so that's what I went with. The cashier let me know that the fish comes in daily from Hawaii so what you eat was swimming in the ocean the day or so before. And you can taste it, it's not gummy/funky-tasting fish! Two tacos + shared coconut shrimp are a tasty and light lunch. Definitely suggest checking in on yelp to get the discount on the coconut shrimp! The mango slaw is delicious and could use a little more mayo. Totally worth the $$ for what you get."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the newly opened Chandler location. Very popular and busy. Very good service and excellent fish tacos..
I bit pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Scottsdale somewhat on the corner of Scottsdale & Bell Road.  The restaurant cannot be missed as the sign was visible from both roads.  
Lots of available parking.  Upon entering there's no delineation of eating area and line-up area to order as one does have to walk through the eating area amongst the tables and proceed to the from to order.  Not a big deal for me.
The restaurant was well lit with lots of space.  One can choose to eat inside or out though the latter was a bit limited on space if you're there with a large party. 
The eating areas were very clean even the bathroom facilities after a visit.    

Menu - Clearly visible above the checkout and pretty much self-explanatory.  

Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  They answered any questions we had regarding the menu.  
There's even lots of young waitstaff that bring your food to you, cleans up the tables, and even would stop in and ask how's your meal which were also helpful in answering any questions we might've had.  

Food - I had the fish and chips which came with a small cup of tartar sauce, a small cup of salad, and wedge of lemon.  The fries was hot and tasty.  The tartar sauce was well seasoned and looked like it had either chopped coriander or cilantro in it.  The salad was bland and was under seasoned.  The fish wasn't overly fried where there was more batter versus fish.  It was very well seasoned, soft and tender, and broke apart nicely....not tough.  My meal was served in a basket though I thought it should've been served in a large plate instead.  I found the basket too small. (-1)
The wife had the rice with salad and mahi mahi and found that it too could've been served in a large plate.  I only had a bite of her fish and it was the same as mine - soft, very tender (very easy to cut into), well seasoned, and didn't have that briny sea-salt taste to it as I've encountered at other restaurants.

I really do like this place and will definitely be back to try their fish taco which I saw someone devouring, and try their fish burgers!"}
{"text":"I found this great place a few feet from the hotel Hampton Inn. Great tasting Mahi blackened and excellent freshly made Cole slaw hit the spot the other night. Trying the fish tacos and the coconut shrimp tonight. With plenty of choices around, I came here twice so far. I may hit it once more b4 I go in 5 days. The only thing better than the food is the mega friendly bunch in there. Steven is a service rockstar!!"}
{"text":"First night in town, needed something quick for family of 4. Fast. Asian feel with counter service. Dude behind counter was friendly and helpful with menu questions and directing to an upsell opportunity. Fish tacos x2, carne asada tacos and chicken tacos. Two over stuffed corn tortillas with unique coconut slaw. All enjoyed overall flavor, kids had issues with the slaw and carne asada. They may have been road weary. Adults enjoyed the outside dining area and flavors. Good experience."}
{"text":"So So Great!! Food was awesome! Service was even better! I got the fish taco mountain, husband got chicken tacos. So yummy! Thought about licking my plate!"}
{"text":"Took the wife here for lunch and it was amazing.  It was very busy when we went but the food came out fast.  The fish burger (Mahi mahi) was amazing!  The wife ordered the calamari and chips which was still good but she regretted not ordering what I had.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We read some of the reviews on this place, and made a point of going. 
We tried Coconuts for the first time this week. What a major disappointment! We ordered the Fish Tacos (which, being a flagship menu item, should be awesome.) The tacos are served on open- faced tiny tortillas, the cubed mango pieces were not ripe so they were rather hard, the 3 tiny pieces of fish were DRY BEYOND BELIEF, and the slaw on top was nothing special. So, for $11.00 you get 2 of these lousy tacos. The restaurant is very small with NO ambiance at all. (At least Rubios makes an attempt!) This place got a big thumbs down from us!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was just ok.  My wife had the Poke salad which was delicious.  However the fish tacos, which they claim to be their signature item, is mediocre at best.  The fish was dry and they didn't have much flavor at all.  Considering this is their speciality, I was a tad disappointed.  

The thing that bothered me most though was the service.  We ordered a dish for my son, paid the bill and had our food delivered.  They didn't bring my son's food out and a toddler was forced to wait while the rest of us had food.  You would think for the inconvenience that they would comp a $4 kids macaroni and cheese, but no.  Out comes the cashier with a receipt to take our card.  No apologies...just we forgot to charge you so you'll have to pay.  I guess that's what happens when you have teens running the joint.  

Based on our experience, I would not return."}
{"text":"I love tacos. All kind of tacos. Coconut was good but not amazing. I got the ahi tuna tacos with everything. The reason I gave a three is because I learned that Hawaii style fish tacos aren't my thing. It was clean and the drink was included. Overall nice establishment."}
{"text":"Nice job on the interior.  I was excited to try this place given the reviews on yelp.  Wow what a let down.  Honestly, the worst meal I have had in ages.  Got the gluten free Ono with a Southwest sauce (Think that is what they called it) over rice.  The fish was like a hockey puck it was so dry and overcooked.  The rice overcooked as well.  

It was so bad I almost feel like I was the exception rather than the rule.  With that been said I know many other places I don't have to risk if my meal with be good or not.  Probably won't be back. :("}
{"text":"I was so glad anew restaurant opened in south Chandler. So we had to try it! Never did I expect a more delicious piece of fish ever. I order the grilled MahiMahi in a lemon butter sauce. It was served over delicious rice with delicious cole slaw on the side. Just awesome! My husband had the fish & chips. He loved it! It is not easy to get a good piece of fish in Az but so glad I finally found it about 2 miles from my home. We will definitely be back many times! The staff is terrific!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. I would have given 5 stars but my only issue is it is somewhat expensive for lunch. I typically walk out spending around $14 which for me for lunch is a little high"}
{"text":"Fish was perfectly cooked and the sauces were pretty dang good. Indoor and outdoor seating with misters. Beer on tap as well. Good fish at a good price."}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is.

The heavyset black girl working the counter was a little bit rude when placing an order.

The Poke wasn't very good and was kinda stringy fatty. We are a bit spoiled with Poke since have it in Hawaii so often.

We also got the Mac Crusted Mahi Mahi. Very bland flavors actually. We needed to add salt and pepper and then even it was a tad overcooked.

Will probably go back and try again since its in the neighborhood. Wasn't insanely impressed this first time around."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped and had fish tacos and fish and chips for lunch. The food were great! The place was super clean. I can't wait for our next stop to try something else, love everything here!"}
{"text":"Dined for the first time last week and will definetly be returning. The fish tacos were D-E-L-icious!! A bit pricey, i did notice, but they are a decent size and with 17-ish different ingredients they really load them up! Atmosphere is very casual. Good for a quick lunch. Everyone that worked there was very friendly! Excited to return!"}
{"text":"I had the fish taco bowl.. Delicious! Healthy too... Grilled fish on top of brown rice and cabbage with a mango salsa on top. New favorite spot"}
{"text":"Just opened, and I now hear they have locations in Scottsdale,,, Well, Now I'm in Chandler trying it out !!

Poke - Excellent Chips for the Pile of marinated Ahi, with Avocado... Now, I don't like Avacado, but the marinated dressing on this masked the flavor and ate the whole darn thing.. Portion size, this was almost the size of a healthy entree. 

Seafood Chowder Bowl - Wow, this stuff is great, and so much flavor with oho, mahi mahi, clams .. ohh la laaaa,,, Definitely on top of the best seafood chowders in AZ and maybe Cali as well... 

Fish Tacos - What their known for.. Way different than anything I've had before, this is a fish salad/ slaw/ great healthyness on top of 2 corn tortillas (since 1 would break too easy). Topped with Mango which added and extra woot woot there... Now, I am no expert on eating this type of \"Taco\" and tried to pick it up n hold it to eat, and it got messy. I ate the scraps that fell off later with some chopsticks. 

The downlow ... Great place, very clean as just opened, and Owner and Chef were on site answering questions. Price wise this was a little higher than expected, but then again, your getting good amounts of FRESH fish.. BEER on TAP !!! woot, except I'm ion the wagon for few months so opted for Tea.. They had China Mist tea with a Coconut Pineapple version,, that did itself justice.. 

Will definitely be back !! great Job Kim and Mike ,, nice place great concept !!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie tacos and they were some of the best tacos I've had in my life if not one of the best vegetarian meals I have been served at a restaurant. I've been a picky vegetarian for 8 years and I was very impressed with the meal I received. My boyfriend also says that the fish tacos here are better than the ones we had in San Diego a few months ago."}
{"text":"I am from Houston Texas and we do not have coconuts there but now I really wish that we did. I highly recommend the poke bowl, if You don't know what they are they do contain raw fish They are light and amazing. Over all the restaurant has a healthy delicious menu and I have not been to a location yet that did not have a friendly smiling staff."}
{"text":"When I first came here I figured it would be just another average addition to my list of places for lunch during the work week. How wrong I was!

This place has hands down the best fish tacos I've had anywhere in AZ. And they are HUGE! You get two in an order and boy are they filling and worth every penny. The fish is topped with slaw, some sort of mango salsa, plus a special sauce. I hardly know how to describe it. SO good. 

The menu may not be huge but trust me, what items they do have are done right. The appetizers are amazing too. The coconut shrimp are the best coconut shrimp I have ever had. Truly jumbo size (not a tiny piece of shrimp with 4x the breading trying to masquerade as a jump shrimp here) and the coconut breading is to die for. 

The location is clean and the staff always incredibly friendly. Even if I sit outside they have someone regularly popping out to clean tables and check on everyone. It may be a casual atmosphere, you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table, but the service is not lacking in any way. 

Great lunch place and one of my favorites in the area."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos in Town hands down! I've eaten here a few times now and they have been equally fabulous every time. The grilled Mahi mahi that they use is extremely fresh and never even a hint of fishy taste to them. Actually I'm pretty sure people that don't like  fish would even approve of the Mahi mahi that they serve here. In addition to the fish the taco is topped wi an amazing coleslaw mixture and a deliciously refreshing mango salsa that just sets it off. The staff is always very friendly, and the restaurant is always very clean and super contemporary. Theres no wait staff so you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you on a real plate which makes it great if your in a hurry but don't want the fast food experience. Plus they pick up after you. It's such an awesome place and Ive been telling all of my clients about it since I work right across the street. Also the coconut shrimp is really good too but just make sure your hungry. The tacos come in an order of 2 which I was skeptical at first since I'm a Big eater but their HUGE and fill me up every time. I love this place and can't wait to take my friends and family here."}
{"text":"The fish is good. Definitely different then the usual fish fry. Sadly, the service is not great. They bring appetizers, soup and entree all at once. We were sitting outside which was nice but the food got cold and the table was really crammed for space. When we were finished, we sat with baskets and bowls all over the table because no one came to pick anything up. It is sort of self serve and sort of full serve. Again, food was good. Really like the coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday with my mom for lunch at around 2 and it was the best! The line was almost to the door when we walked in but it went by super fast which surprised me. The store itself is kind of small but there's a lot of tables inside which is nice. The tables are surfboards which I love. The menu isn't too big but a good size for a bite to eat. The prices are a little bit high but the tacos are huge and you get two tacos for 11$ so it's worth it. We ate outside and it wasn't hot at all. The outside is covered and has fans and a bunch of misters. We did have to wait around 10-15 minutes and my mom did end up having to go inside to ask if our order was going to be done soon and right when she came back outside the food was brought out. Such good service, the guy who brought us our food was really nice and asked if we needed anything else and how it was tasting. Overall this place is awesome! Best tacos ever! I got the two chicken tacos and they were sooo good! Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos and they were just ok.  Not great.  After all the hype over their fish tacos, I expected a lot more.  Also, as some other people said, the corn tortillas were hard on the edges leaving me to believe the tortillas were microwaved or just sat out in the open to dry out.  

My husband had the Ahi Tuna salad and he loved his dish. 

We also had the count shrimp which was very good.

Our order was not taken properly, so we ended up with things we did not order."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very polite staff! I enjoyed the calamari it's thick and fresh. The tacos were fresh and delicious as well."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the great meal we had here. I had the grilled Ono (butter, salt and pepper) and my wife had the macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi. The highlight, how ever, was the Ahi poke....sooooo ono! It was the best poke I've had since leaving my home in Hawai'i by far and I would rate it in the top 10 poke recipes I've ever had! The fish tasted fresh and was perfectly seasoned, the rice was well prepared and the cole slaw was simple but delicious. The portions were perfect and the staff was excellent. 

Mahalo nui loa a me ka Aloha!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great grilled fish and perfect portions for my toddler. We're here a couple times a month."}
{"text":"This is just as good as the one on Maui! So glad we have these locations in AZ. Food is delicious and service was great!"}
{"text":"Super friendly people and delicious authentic Maui fish tacos! For an order-at-the-counter restaurant, the staff always goes above and beyond to provide exceptional service."}
{"text":"Yum! Really wanted to try this spot after it opened, but opportunity hadn't been available. Scottsdale is a bit far, so I'm glad that Chandler's a little closer, but still about 25 mins away. The fish portions are really good and I'm glad it's brown rice served with them. The only I probably would omit on my plate is the shredded cheese on the salad as it doesn't seem to work here, albeit colorful. The seafood chowder is a favorite, holy moley!  Blackened and Cajun flavors are delicious and have yet to try the butter & garlic (next time for sure!). I think portions for the shrimp and chips is good, but a little skimpy on the fish and chips which looked like a kid's portion. I'm also happy about the array of different iced teas to choose from! Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Reminded us of being in Maui. Food was good - ambiance Hawaiian. It wasn't packed when we went in, but upon leaving people were coming in by the droves, well maybe not droves, but close to it! 

The videos of surfers made it even more like being there."}
{"text":"I've travelled the world and this place has the best fish tacos I've ever had.  In Phoenix of al places."}
{"text":"Always delicious!!! One of my favorite quick and healthy restaurants! The entire staff is friendly and kind. Pleasure being a regular here."}
{"text":"Omgee what a great mahi mahi sandwich. 

Grilled to perfection with a toasted bun and coleslaw.  I don't care for the coleslaw but I think others may like it. This location is clean and low key nice spot for lunches. Return factor is high."}
{"text":"My wife and Lucy love this place and the people that work there. It really has the aloha spirit. Norie and Chris and the rest of the crew there make you feel like you are family and always welcome. Plus the food is GREAT. I personally love the fish tacos!! We have gone to the coconuts in Maui many times and we get the same feeling. Its great to see a franchise not alone keep the same food quality and spirit also.

{"text":"This place just gets better every time we go!  We have come to crave the Taco Mountain--such a perfect combination of flavors and textures!!!  Everything is delicious, from the chowder to the grilled ono with asian sauce to the fish tacos!  They even serve terrific iced tea--china mist, as well as wine and beer.

One of the best parts of all of this meticulously run restaurant is their ALWAYS delightful, professional and hardworking staff.  From Bailey to Trevor and Marissa and Kirsten, it just doesn't get any better.  Always immaculate, inviting, and feels like a wonderful local find. Hard to stop watching the constant surfing videos.   We love this place!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Coconuts for about 6 months.  We crave it!  The food/fish is so good, so fresh, so delicious, it is addictive in the very best way.  We have not had a bad or so-so meal yet--each dish is better than the last!  The fish chowder is to die for, but so are the fish tacos, taco mountain and everything else on the menu!

The atmosphere is charming and I love to watch the surfing videos.  The tables and benches are cleverly designed to look like surfboards!  The staff is always so helpful, friendly and professional! Steve is the BEST!  We thought for sure he must be the owner!  But the staff have been amazing every time we have been in--someone is doing something right! 

What a treasure! One warning though: once you try Coconuts, you will want to come back AT LEAST weekly!! It's just that good!"}
{"text":"Had a business associate in from out of town. He wanted to go somewhere he couldn't go in his home town. We both had the fish tacos and both agreed they were they best we've ever had anywhere.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Be warned: You will end up craving the fish tacos! Luv 'em."}
{"text":"Eaten at this location several times now and it's just as good as the original in Kihei.  Consistently fantastic fish and service."}
{"text":"I love the artwork in the women's bathroom. Oh, the food is good too!
Been twice, got the Ono burger both times just because its that good, I couldn't NOT get it. Although, went with the hubby, so we also shared the coconut shrimp...so tasty as are their French fries. I think about this burger all the time and have to tried to copy at home, and just never the same. The only reason I take it down one star is for prices only. I get that they serve quality seafood, but for lunchtime for example, prices are a little on the high end."}
{"text":"I got the fish sandwich. It was very good - probably the best one I've ever had. The fish is grilled. 

The service is friendly.

My one complaint is that the sandwich is too talk with the bun. I have a big mouth, but not THAT big. If the bun was less tall and wider, it would work better.

Vegetarian (vegan?)  optiins and kids menu.

Will return."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fish tacos are bomb. The calamari strips are bomb. My only complaint is their seating. The surfboard seating is not only uncomfortable, but unstable as well."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this new restaurant and found it was a very casual place. A good lunch spot but don't go if you are expecting a sit down restaurant for dinner. You order at the register and they bring your order to your table. They do serve beer and wine and a variety of seafood dishes. We both had the macadamia encrusted Mahi Mahi. It was served on a large bed of brown rice with a side of cole slaw. The fish was a good size cut and it was tasty. The rest of the meal was not very exciting- the slaw was tasteless and the rice was- well it was just brown rice. The young kids working the counter were very nice and the place was clean. I would go back but for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Yelp.  Looked this place up and discovered I drove past it for a while missing the opportunity to stop by.  All I can say is wow.  Seriously amazing food that would bury the competition in the Caribbean.  Check in with Mayor Eddie, who politely let me know I was eating my taco \"like a white guy\".  You have to get your hand around the back of it to savor the 17 different flavors.  He was right.  Great job...

The staff was eager to help us in any way.  Very attentive and fun."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful! This is the only place I go to for lunch. The staff is wonderful and the food couldn't get better. So many healthy options!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place. They serve very crave-able food so I'm sure I'll be back soon. If you eat tacos as often as I do, I'm sure you will appreciate the Hawaiian flavors and freshness. However, I found the tacos to be a little too large and awkward to eat. The mango salsa is a nice fresh flavor, but it was lacking popping spice and flavor overall. I think I'll go for a salad or poke next time. I also got the coconut shrimp appetizer, which was a delectable treat."}
{"text":"3.5. Ok I'm missing something. Based on reviews I was expecting some amazing fish tacos, and I thought they were fine, but nothing that I want to eat again. I found them to be a bit dry. Not a whole lot of fish. Mostly cabbage. My mom's had way more avocado and mango than mine. 

I did enjoy the coconut shrimp, but I'm not going to go back unless I'm craving fried shrimp, but that doesn't happen very often. 

Service was good. The place was packed and hard to find a place to sit. Not recommended if you are looking for a relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"I liked this location.  Much more seating than the Scottsdale one.  Good customer service, clean, well organized.  I had the fish tacos.  I do not like that you have to get 2 of them.  I am not a big eater and they boxed up my other one.  Flavor was good, but it seems a bit dry to me.  I need to try some other items because the fish taco does not do it for me."}
{"text":"Coming from San Francisco, I was a bit hesitant to order fish tacos in the desert.  So pleasantly surprised at how good they were!!  Food tasted very fresh too!  We'll be back.."}
{"text":"My son found this place by reading yelp reviews.  When I first walked in, I wasn't that impressed with the small size and the \"order at the counter\" style restaurant.  My opinion quickly changed.  The people behind the register were extremely helpful in describing their recommended items.  My husband and I were also surprised by the decent selection of beer and wine. My entire family ordered the fish tacos.  They were beautifully plated and extremely delicious. They were probably the best fish tacos I have ever had. Also, I must mention that this place was immaculate. That is HUGE for me. The restrooms were extremely clean and the floors and tables were spotless. The service was excellent. Our plates were cleared as soon as we finished and we were checked on at least 2 times during the meal. We will definitely be back! Great job Coconut's!"}
{"text":"First off the food is delicious but you go here for the fresh fish.  The tacos are proportionately large and the price is fine for the quantity and quality of food.  If you want a white table cloth go somewhere else.  If you want flavorful food and friendly and timely service step on in and enjoy! Worth the trip just make certain your expectations are right.  This is a paper napkin,  juice running down your arm after biting into a taco kind of place - - - exactly what I was looking for!  Don't forget to try the calamari!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the fish tacos at Coconuts.  They are reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"I came in here with my wife a few days ago because we loved the Scottsdale location! They were very friendly and convinced me to get the poke bowl. Fish tasted amazingly fresh! My wife got the local style, and the coleslaw was so different and delicious! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place rocks make the most awesome mahi mahi on a bed of rice so delicious and there other items so good
Feels like hawaii"}
{"text":"The fish tacos and battered shrimp were awesome. I wasn't too keen on the coleslaw especially it being made with horseradish sauce. The staff was very friendly; however, I did not appreciate them placing a placard on my table where my kids were sitting mentioning not to \"hold\" a table before we ordered. Not cool at all. Overall, I would give this place a 5 star BUT they really upset me with that little bit of unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"Fresh coconut shrimp to die for and fish tacos were great too. Fast, clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp was amazing. Dipping sauce perfect combo. Fish tacos were juicy and fresh. Coleslaw taste homemade. Was fresh and crispy. 
Great value and excellent taste. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This is a hard one to write.  We loved the atmosphere, and the food was very good, unfortunately, we both got sick after, with diarrhea.  Not sure why, but something want right.  That's the hard truth."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious fish and chips (Mahi Mahi) and out of this world onion rings. The only complaint I have to give is very minor. It has to do with the order and pay up front. If they would treat this as a regular restaurant then I would have ordered one or two more beers. Alas I felt it was too much time to get back in the order line to pick up one last beer. Perhaps you can have someone act as a runner to get additional beverages while waiting for the meal."}
{"text":"Tried Coconut's for the first time. Had fish tacos. Thought it might be a meal combo, but it was two small plates each with one taco. Fish seemed fresh and grilled not breaded. They put way too much on top of the tortilla, felt more like a tostadas. The fish taco combo at Rubios is more to my liking. The atmosphere  was very casual with an outside patio option."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner one evening. There was no wait and the employees were all very friendly! We each ordered Shrimp tacos and a order of coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp was amazing as was the shrimp tacos! You should definitely check this place out! I will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Get the fish tacos, and throw some tiger sauce on it... you won't regret it! Service is great, and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for fish. This is a great spot to go to. It's quick and easy. No fuss place. I got the fish salad and my husband got the fish tacos. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal at Coconuts. I had a blackened mahi-mahi and a Caesar salad. The fish was cooked perfectly and the salad was excellent. The staff was friendly and efficient. If you want fish at a fast food casual sit down restaurant you need to give Coconuts a try."}
{"text":"The most outstanding and amazing place to eat. I wish I got the guys name at the counter. Super friendly, really helpful, and genuinely seemed upbeat. Food is outta this world, the taco mountain and fish tacos, they are simply fantastic. Atmosphere and ambiance is ideal. So glad I was able to enjoy this spot while visiting!"}
{"text":"There is nothing you could not love about coconuts fish cafe. The fish tacos are the best in Phoenix. Not only is the fish tacos made with the best mahi mahi it is topped with a great slaw and mango salsa with cheese and creamy sauce all wrapped in a delicious tortilla. They are very messy when eaten properly but worth it. Very filling and come two in a order. The restaurant has a very fun and laid-back atmosphere and is also very clean. The staff is always friendly and willing to answer questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish! Mahi-Mahi fish sandwich done \"south of the border\" style is a must try! Coleslaw is great, everything is really fresh! Good kids menu as well with non-fish choices for them if needed. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stumbled upon Coconuts after a movie. We both ordered the fish tacos and had a great conversation with the owner. Come one come all for some amazing tacos. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Decent food, cute inside. Prices way too high for portions. Ordered calamari for app and got about 5 strips. You can pay the same amount and get quadruple the portion and tastes just as good at Rehab Burger downtown. Also ordered Fish and Chips...$11.99 for 2 pieces of fish and a bunch of fries. Seemed more like $11.99 for a bunch of shoe string fries."}
{"text":"Great service. Mediocre fish. The fish and chips gave me terrible food poisoning and the restaurant wouldn't do anything to help me out. Which is really too bad."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite fish tacos!!!                              Always awesome guys keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Coconuts Fish Cafe to finally open here in Scottsdale.  

I had my favorite Fish Tacos and it took me back to Maui!  Absolutely delicious and the mango salsa was perfect.  The Mahi Mahi and Ono was plentiful.  Truly wonderful and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Really great start!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Fish Tacos and Great Chowder.  Nice personal visit by Executive Chef.  We be back there.
(Add a porter or stout to beer offering.)"}
{"text":"Very clean and stylish cafe with surf boards for table tops. Good food and service. The fish tacos are delightful. They are large servings to share or take home. Singles feel comfortable here. This is a nice location next to a busy intersection tucked away in a corner. This would be a good place to frequent."}
{"text":"So ono! We went here on a Friday night for dinner and were very pleased. The restaurant is open and airy with great touches to make it feel like Hawaii. 

We started with the coconut shrimp. It was off the charts good and the sauce is amazing. It was better than any shrimp we had in Hawaii, and we lived there five years!

I ordered the Macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi over rice with coleslaw. Normally I'm not a coleslaw person, but this was good. The mahi was a large portion and was delicious--cooked perfectly and so flavorful. 

My dining companion ordered steak tacos--in a fish taco place. The tacos were huge and he said they were great. 

This place is worth a visit. I wish we lived close because I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Delicious food, simple eatery.  Counter service.  Also check out the coconut shrimp, delish.

Chowder is so-so.  Stick to the fish tacos with mango sauce.  Healthy, fair price.  Good service."}
{"text":"Went to Coconuts for the first time tonight because we needed a touch of Hawaii.  In one word \"Aaaamaaazing\".  The fish tacos were fresh and delicious, tasty and with a tinge of sweetness and very satisfying.  The best thing about it was it was all gluten free and just what the doctor ordered.  We sat on the patio in August, which was a feat in itself given that it was extremely comfortable with the misters and the fans.  Who said you can't eat outdoors in Scottsdale in August.  No problemo, it was very comfortable.

Met Kim, the owner, who was a delightful man, and had a wonderful chat.  The restaurant's not fancy, just very comfortable with great food.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"12 year old son and I shared the fish and chips. We really enjoyed the fresh fish and thin cut fries. The tarter sauce not so much because it had wasabi and just wasn't what we expected. So we used lemons instead, wish they had malt vinegar too. Still the fresh fish and chips were delicious. We weren't super hungry so the one order was perfect for son and I. 
Service was friendly and the place was clean.  We ate out on the front patio on a sunny day and it was clean out there too. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty options abound. Great fish tacos in a fun environment. Definitely a place that I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a reasonably priced restaurant in Scottsdale and found this place on Yelp. I ordered the fish tacos as and hubby ordered calamari and chips. The two tacos are way too much food for one person, they serve them on two plates for sharing. So we split both meals. everything was excellent. We even got to meet the owner who was going from table to table greeting everyone and making sure the food was good. We are in Scottsdale for a few days and at hoping to get back there before we leave."}
{"text":"So after seeing all of the race reviews and having driven by this little place, thought we would go see what it was all about. Upon first walking in the door you are greeted by a strong coconut smell. Not bad. And sort of expected. But strong. Then we walked up to the counter where who we can assume was the manager was arguing on the phone with someone and didn't give us a second glance. The cashier walked by us and said we would be helped in a moment. So we looked over a very undescriptive menu. To our right was another employee eating their food. To our left was the owner. When the cashier came back we told her it was our first time there and then she told us \"well then wait a second\" while she left to talk to the employee eating. We stood there and waited until she came back and half heatedly tried to explain the menu options, only confusing us. I wound up ordering the fish burger and my mother had the \"new England clam chowder\". I'll get to that in a second. So while this happened the manager is still arguing and the owner is on his laptop. So I go and get some \"iced tea\". Which apparently translates to \"Luke warm tea\". It was so nasty and left a weird taste in my mouth. I've had that brand before and always liked it. So I was surprised. All of the tables were filthy, despite the employees hanging around and the lack of any customers besides ourselves. There was trash pieces on the floor. We essentially bused our own table before we could even sit down. Then when our food finally arrived I was told that I basically ordered my food incorrectly for asking there to be no tartar sauce. Not one but two employees came to tell me so. I don't like tartar sauce. On the walls are all of these praises from varying sources! So I thought \"well the food should be good!\" Upon closer inspection all of the framed reviews are from their Hawaii location. Not the Scottsdale one. Seemed kind of weird to us. But oh well it's a new location, right? All of numbers are super worn and faded and the drink machines look crazy old. Well maybe they were saving money for the decor? So I take a bite of my fish burger and the bread instantly tastes chalky. The fish was alright so I ate that instead. My mom had the chowder and the coleslaw. The coleslaw was bland and gross. Just like cabbage with a cream over it. The chowder tasted like it came from a can. And it had tomatoes. Which is really weird. I was born and raised in boston. I had never seen a \"new England style\" chowder with tomatoes. So we picked at our food. Cleared our plates. Bused our table. Again. Then slowly made our way to the door. We were completely ignored. No one said goodbye, or even acknowledged we had been there. Bottom line: won't be going back. The establishment wasn't even slightly impressive. We talked about our concerns next to the eating employee who stared at us then walked away completely ignoring what we had said to her."}
{"text":"I like the way this restaurants displays from the island of Maui. The tables as surfboards and photos from Hawaii does separate this restaurant from others. Tried the steak tacos which consisted of the steak, pineapple, lettuce and tomato. It was good and also my girlfriend enjoyed her chowder."}
{"text":"I think it is really more of a 3.5, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as I have only been here once and give them the 4 stars. Let me start by saying that I came across this place as I way planning a trip to Maui for this summer and when I realized that Coconut's opened in Scottsdale I figured we would try it here first. I was very excited that they serve ono fish (my personal favorite and one of the only fish I like). I went with my mom and the BF yesterday for lunch. The BF got the fish and chips and my mom and I shared the fish tacos (thankfully!). The BF thought the fish and chips were just ok. I thought they were pretty meh. They didn't have a lot of flavor and I definitely wouldn't return here for the fish and chips. The fish tacos, on the other hand, were very tasty. The fish was tasty and not too 'fishy.' The sauces and slaw were all very delicious and came together nicely with the fish. My complaints include that you cannot pick up the taco, it is too big and it's hard to eat, the bottom tortilla was so hard I had to saw through it with a knife to eat it, and I wish they had the option of getting one taco because I feel that I could not go here alone because I don't want to throw away a whole taco (it's way too much food). The prices are high, but they do give you a lot of food. I would probably come here again if someone else suggested it or if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't rush out and drive across town to come here."}
{"text":"Good grilled fish-Ono and Mahi.  The combo plate comes with brown rice and a crunchy slightly sweet coleslaw-out of the ordinary and a nice crispy cool contrast to the grilled fish.  You have different sauces and preparations to choose from for the fish.  Healthy and satisfying.  I also love their huge fish tacos-crunch away!"}
{"text":"Had the mahi plate early afternoon, $13.50 after tax for a decent sized fish some brown rice and vegetables that were cooked well. Definitely pricey but the fish was cooked perfect and was tasty with the sauce."}
{"text":"Almost every time we head to see a show at the Alamo Drafthouse we first head to Coconuts.  It. Is. Delish.  We fell in love with the Seafood Salad, which is a salad with the fish of your choice and dressing of your choice.  We get the Mahi Mahi blackened with caesar dressing.  YUM.  The coconut shrimp is also delish. I loooove the decor with the big sea turtle on the wall.  Whoever designed the restaurant gets many props for all of the detail to make the place have a Hawaiian vibe.  Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to find a Coconut's off the island of Maui.

In full disclosure I wish I had bought a franchise.

Yes, I would drive from the airport to the little strip mall that houses the first one. And than back to airport on my way home.

The fish tacos are off the charts, hands down the best I have ever had anywhere. I agree with CNN AS One of the Best in the world. I wish they sold the tacos by eachs, 2 is good, 4 is to much.

However you should also try the other food!! The fish sandwiches are also iconic!!   

I cannot wait for their global domination. It's that good.

Yes the locals eat there."}
{"text":"I tried this place after getting so many favorable recommendations from friends.  The service was just fantastic, so friendly, and they made helpful suggestions.  What underwhelmed me was the actual food.  It was good, but maybe I am just not crazy for fish tacos because I found that the taste was merely pretty good, not great."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Fish Tacos & Coconut Shrimp, are amazing and their service was top notch! The sweetest ladies ever!!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Quick, easy, great food and clean environment! The employees are always so kind and friendly!"}
{"text":"This is very good food in a very casual evironment - picnick bench casual.  The fish and sides are a class act though.   A bit more pricey that i care for, but ok once in a while.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Coconut's has a great poke bowl with a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy your food and relax (or work on your computer) a little. You order at the counter from one of the friendly employees and then they bring your order to you. I also had a side of mixed veggies to go with my poke bowl and left very full. Portions are large. This is a nice place for fish or poke bowls when you don't feel like being waited on in a fancier place."}
{"text":"Really, really good fast casual fish place featuring fish tacos, fish and chips, and fish plates served with rice and a fresh slaw.. Fish and sides are fresh, sauces are flavorful without  being overwhelming, and the atmosphere is a fun Hawaiian surf theme. The friendly staff do whatever they can to make your visit enjoyable. The place gets crowded on evenings but they are able to move through people pretty quickly. Honestly, I don't have a gripe about this place."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Fish tacos, Ono salad, coconut shrimp appetizer...yum!  Quick, healthy and moderately priced."}
{"text":"Coconuts is my favorite place for fish tacos in Maui, so I had to try the Scottsdale location.  I wasn't disappointed.  Yummy fish tacos with delicious mango salsa on top, what could be better?  The employees are super friendly, the restaurant is very clean, and the d√©cor is fun with surfboards for tables.  You'll find yourself saying \"mahalo\" when your food is delivered to your table."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! All the way from Maui? Hmmm?! Well I walked in and was greeted right away as I stood in line. It's an order at the cashier kind of place. I ordered takeout and the girl that took our order offered some cups of water while we waited. Food did not take long at all. Ordered fish and chips and was told that all the fish and chips was served with mahi-mahi. Yum!! My daughter had the quesadillas which now that I think about it was not very good. Was served with corn tortilla rather than your typical flour. Anyway, we were satisfied and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place at least once a week.  Their freshness & flavors are always spot on. The staff is very friendly & helpful. We especially like the fish tacos & the coconut shrimp. We have tried different items and  have enjoyed those also."}
{"text":"Unbelievable fresh fish dishes and the service is first rate!  The fish tacos are brilliant and the macadamia nut mahi is not to be missed!  We will absolutely be here again."}
{"text":"Having a Coconuts location in the Ocotillo area is awesome! Tonight my hubby and I enjoyed some delicious and healthy eats. We took pleasure in the fresh Ahi Poke, moist teriyaki chicken sandwich, fries with different homemade sauces and beer. All super yummy. What stood out to us was the great customer service we received. We met Eddie the Manager and a couple of his crew members, Paris and Andrew. They were beyond accommodating and each had superb personalities. Outside of the food being quite tasty we would come back based on their charm. Thank y'all for your outstanding professionalism and marvelous hospitality!!! We will see y'all soon!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here off and on for more than a year and we especially like the fish tacos with sweet mango topped. We are seniors and can only eat one each of the enormous tacos each. Because my wife is ill I came in alone today and tried to order one taco which I knew would be a challenge to finish. Not possible to order one taco they told me so I paid for two and almost finished one. Disappointed because the mango topping was rather hard and not sweet at all. I will be back one more time but not alone and give it one more try. Seniors beware huge tacos and no senior discount."}
{"text":"I just moved from SOCAL and I thought I would never get good fish tacos in PHX. I was wrong. These might be the best I have ever had.  It was so fresh. Not super cheap, but good food never is."}
{"text":"We had fish tacos at the original restaurant in Kihei, Maui.  We were always wishing they were located here in Arizona, too.  Well, darn, we got our wish.  This place knows fish.  The food is delicious and the service is fast.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  I don't think the price is too high, either."}
{"text":"It's ok. Fish and chips were over fried. Ono burger was also overdone but flavorful. Clam chowder tasted odd and fishy like a seafood leftover party."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a really solid score for being authentically Hawaiian.   We tried a poke bowl, a taco mountain, and the fish tacos.  Oh and shared some coconut shrimp.  I really liked the fish tacos the most.  That said I like fish tacos so that makes me an expert right?  The service was super attentive and friendly.  Whomever trains here has done a superb job in hiring and establishing rigor of friendly."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  Had the fish tacos and coconut shrimp and fries.  So good.  Place filled up before noon so was glad that we were there shortly after it opened at 11:00.  Since we had not been there before we got a great explanation of what we ordered and flagged a roaming waiter for more of the mango salsa when we ran out.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love seafood! This is pretty good for a smaller restaurant. Worth giving it a try. I don't k ow how fresh you can get away from the ocean, but this is pretty good."}
{"text":"We like this place a lot.  We've had take-out from here at least 10-15 times and find that the food is consistently good and tasty.  WE're big fans of the Fish Taco Mountain (which you can get without rice if you are eating low-carb).  It's delicious and really filling.  Frequently, I can't finish the whole thing.  We're so happy that they've moved into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Never disappoints and the kids always ask for it.   Good place for fresh fish in a casual environment.  Reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"If you are from Hawaii or Hawaiian, this place is not for you!!!
Fish is old & low quality. 
Because they said Ahi Poke spicy is with indian spicy, I asked for regular. As soon as the plate was set on table, very strong smell hit my nose. Just the look is not fresh but the smell just did it.
I took it back to the counter & explained the smell & taste. They took it back & brought $12 back to me. That was nice of the guy (who seem to be the manager on staff).
The interior is decorated nice & the Hawaiian music was a great touch.
They seriously need tomget better quality fish & learn to keep fish in good condition. Especially the people who grew up on Poke from the island."}
{"text":"First day open and they handled it like pros! Service was impeccable and food was even better. Excited to have them in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and decided to try Coconuts for dinner on the way back to the hotel based on the Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. I orders the coconut shrimp appetizer and the Poke Bowl. Both were amazing. If you find yourself in Scottsdale or Tempe, give them I try."}
{"text":"I have been to the Coconuts in Maui and let me tell you, I was transported right back to Maui when I ate here. The food is so fresh it's hard to believe you are in the middle of the desert and not beach side. Most of our party got the macadamia nut Mahi and some got tacos. 

The macadamia nut Mahi platter was amazing. The fish was fresh, it was cooked to perfection and the combination of the nut crust and the salsa was tropical paradise. The tacos were delicious as well, the tortillas were fresh and did not break apart on you when attempting to eat your over stuffed taco. 

Employees were friendly and helpful and had a great Aloha spirit!"}
{"text":"Best fish taco I've ever had and I've sampled a lot. Great combination of flavors and perfectly cooked fish.  Great friendly service. This place is a keeper"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Always a very good experience. Very fresh fish salads sides and the staff is very helpful and friendly. This place definitely gets busy at lunch and they have another location at Scottsdale and Shea. If you are missing Hawaii or in the mood for some excellent fish in the desert as funny as that sounds this is a great convenient spot"}
{"text":"Great, fresh fish n' chips! Great atmosphere. Price is decent, I wish the portions were a little bigger though."}
{"text":"Great good and great atmosphere. Wife and I stopped here for lunch one day and couldnt have been more satisfied. We will def go back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time and the inside is pretty cute. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they are so big! You get two shrimp tacos with the order but they are so big it's like if it was 4 regular tacos. It came with shrimp, cole slaw, pineapples and tomatoes. They were very good and do recommend them"}
{"text":"Very good first experience. Had the mahi mahi (blackened) local style over brown rice with cole slaw and a tomato on the side and it was awesome. Place was clean and service was great. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I first went here in Maui and are thrilled to see it here so close in Chandler. The staff is so friendly and nice and always making sure you have a good experience.  Kid friendly and have a good menu. The fish that they serve, whether it's in tacos or served alone as an entree is exceptional for these parts. Highly recommend going if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing mahi mahi. The fish tacos were an 8/10. Amazing flavor in the fish and subtle sweet taste with the mango. The tortilla was a little hard/dry. For the amount of fish you get. The price is reasonable. The Disney like music was amazing and relaxing also. I felt like I was in Moana haha"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly service!!   Onion rings are really good, been coming here forever and just tried them!  Clam chowder is pretty darn good too, always fresh.  Best quick service fish around by far."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips for sure. The fish tacos are the best I have ever had. I just ate at Coconuts in HI and I am super excited to have one  here in Chandler and to have discovered it is just as awesome as the one in Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"We love Coconuts!! We love fish and Hawaii!  The coconut shrimp is our favorite appetizer.  I personally love the seafood salad with Ahi, and the Mango dressing.  
We drive 20 minutes to come here about once a week. 
All the staff are friendly and we are gratefully considered \"regulars\"!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff, like it a lot!
The fish chowder was outstanding 
The fish taco's excellent"}
{"text":"We ordered the standard fish tacos and were not disappointed. 

Flavor:
The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavorings were light, fruity (mango), and fresh. These are NOT spicy tacos, but they are delicious. 

Ambiance:
This place is very casual and reminded me of dining shacks on the North Shore in Oahu. Friendly and welcoming. 

Price:
Good bang for your buck. 

Would recommend."}
{"text":"Very, very good fish tacos topped with mangoes, coconut milk coleslaw and all sorts of tasty goodies. You need to order sides (if you want 'em) separately. My 7-year-old digs the fish n' chips from here. Hawaiian decor with surf boards and TVs playing surfing videos. Island music adds to the vibe. Beer and wine available for purchase."}
{"text":"Not bad.

Food is more baja style. The rice they had was surprising in that it was that healthy brown rice stuff instead of a pilaf.  The mahi tacos were great. The calamari were giant. The girl at the register was loud and super excited and happy to be helping people! :D

Lots of kids when we went, so it was noisier.  But it's kind of a not quiet place really.  

The clam chowder had a spin of flavor in it, not your regular clam chowder."}
{"text":"We've always loved the food, but hated the hard bench seat! So, we stopped eating here. Today, we decided to brave the hard benches for fish tacos. To our surprise, the benches were gone and in their place were nice, comfortable chairs! Thank you! We will be eating here more often now. All gone! And delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to try this after reading about the fabulous fish tacos. Nope, not for me. Very mediocre, almost no flavor to them. Taco shell tough. Husband had the shrimp lightly breaded and fries, I think that was a bit better. These two orders +2 beers was almost $40 which I thought was pretty pricey. I had to try it but I won't be back."}
{"text":"20+ visits - all equally solid. Excellent quality, wide variety, clean, and quick. Beers on tap, wines by the glass and adept service. Best of all, an owner, Kim, who's always around actively managing his business and helping staff and customers. 

This is a walk up to the counter, place your order and they bring your food to you kind of place. There is a big and shaded patio with Hawaiian music playing and a large surfboard table-furnished dining room. 

The food is healthy fish taco and similarly inspired dishes. You can get chicken, too. I prefer the Taco Mountain because I like the neatness of eating with a fork, but the same ingredients ride on corn tortillas instead of brown rice on the Fish Tacos and they POUR out of the kitchen, they are so popular. Lots of pairs of women split an order of them, which I understand since I get a to-go box with my meal so I can put half aside at the beginning of the meal! PS (I get a side of Asian Flare) dressing for extra kick. 

Chicken and fish is cut into large chunks.  Also, there are more pedestrian choices like fries, and they're just the right kind of crispy. We've hung around for an hour or more watching people chow, visit, go back for seconds, drink, watch surf videos, and stuff their little ones from the kids' menu. Kim visits with most tables, sweeps the floors when needed, and even provides samples! The young people who work for him are happy and well-trained. One day, at 5:55, we saw the health inspector walk in. Everyone watched Kim escort her to the kitchen, and the staff said, \"no problem - we always do well. Please be patient if it slows the cooks down a minute.\"   It did not, and just a bit later, everything was back to speedy normal and the inspector had given the place a big thumbs up. Nice testimonial."}
{"text":"Great food!  Forgot to take pictures but please try the seafood soup, seafood pasta and fish tacos!  Delish!  I will be back when visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if my pocketbook or accountant would let me. Boo. The point is that it's kind of pricy for tacos and a beer, but the quality explains the price. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their 17 ingredient fish tacos so very much just as they are served, but add a bit of the Tiger Sauce and...heaven. Two come in an order and if I was starving, I might be able to eat them both, but I usually have to take one home. They actually save well in the fridge which is unusual for tacos. They use proper cabbage instead of sogmo lettuce. The coconut shrimp is also amazing. Some of the best I've had. Sauce is very sweet and I sure wish they would come up with a variable. Two sauces would elevate this app to a six. The calamari is not so good. The taco mountain is really good, and the seared ahi salad is usually cooked OK, but always fresh tasting. The iced tea is divine and I LOVE Kona beer. It's so good with the fried stuff. I didn't bother to take pictures because there are already enough to prove the point. They definitely show that Coconuts provides consistent high quality food. Try it! You'll like it!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The fish tacos are large, but I actually prefer the taste of the ones at SoCal Fish Taco Company in downtown Gilbert.  I think this place if overpriced for what you get,"}
{"text":"I take my kids there every Wed. The fish tacos and calamari are a huge hit. Highly recommended- we are a very clean eating family."}
{"text":"Best Fish Tacos ever ! Thank you for bring Maui to Scottsdale! The fish and ingredients are incredibly fresh, the combination of flavor layered on the tacos are so complementing and out of this world. I would like to know if there is a better fish taco out there, but somehow I don't think so."}
{"text":"Expected more, and better. Portions are underwhelming, prices are rather high.
We realize this is a pricey neighborhood to get a fish taco, but value is expected.
Just don't have a reason to return real soon."}
{"text":"Just heard about this place this morning on Fox 10.
We'll be back. I had fish wife had chicken.....excellent!  Also tried the coconut shrimp Perfect!  Service was attentive and very accommodating."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and had a very island feel to it, staff was nice, food was a little disappointing. I got the fish and chips and my husband got the fish tacos. The tacos fell apart and the flavors were lacking and didn't taste very good. I will say that the fish and chips were pretty good though. I got two decent sized fish filets that were seasoned well and lightly breaded. I liked that it wasn't overly breaded and fried like how some other restaurants make it, so I got more fish than batter which was good. I would probably come back for fish and chips but not for the fish tacos."}
{"text":"We love it more every time we go. So glad to see this place doing well. Keep up the excellent food, atmosphere and super friendly staff!. Love the taco mountain and coconut shrimp. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Fun atmosphere! Nice clean extremely well put together. Staff is extremely helpful and friendly! We will definitely be returning. Just not as often as I would like because we live on the other side of town. But I would highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the original Maui location and discovered that they were opening this location in Scottsdale about a month after our trip. We were thrilled. The original owner in Maui actually came out to help open this one. They are identical restaurants except the one in Scottsdale is newer and larger. The food is outstanding! The tacos have 17 gourmet ingredients including mango! My husbands favorite is the original fish tacos and mine is the original taco with veggie meat. Amazing quality and you are very full after 2!!! We have taken many people and everyone enjoys the food including my very picky father. They have Hawaiian beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Can't think of a negative. My wife and I both had the fish taco platter. We also had the Onion Rings and I had the Fish Chowder. Chowder was solid, OR's were some of the best we ever had, and the Tacos were amazing. Fish was fresh, the white corn tortillas are delicious (and didn't break apart-- a bonus), and the mango salsa is phenomenal. We will be back...and back...and back..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! the mahi fish tacos are pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered the fish tacos and the coconut shrimp. Two tacos loaded with fish and diced mangos and cabbage on a corn tortilla. Fantastic flavor! The coconut shrimp were also fantastic! I'm going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My new found favorite place to eat! Had there \"poke\" and it was very flavorful. The fish tacos are top notch. Everything is fresh with lots of flavor. Best of all is the customer service! Everyone working checked to see if we needed anything and where super friendly. It seems a little hefty in price but for what you get well worth it."}
{"text":"If you could get past the pricey menu, the food is pretty good. Liked the Ono fish burger and had nice presentation. The fish tacos are so big that each one could be a meal in itself. The tacos are hard to eat since you can't pick them up or fold them. Good size basket of fries and the fish chowder is pretty tasty. The calamari is the breaded strip style while you would expect the real ring style. The coconut shrimp was good but the sauce that it came with could have been better. Overall it is a welcome break from just burgers while being more healthy."}
{"text":"Ate there for dinner.  Was not impressed.  Ordered calamari.  Got plenty of french fries but not much calamari.  Also they use strips of calamari rather than rings. French fries were good. Food came out fairly quickly and was hot.  While everything was ok, I will not be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for their quality food and service, but my overall sentiments seem to echo that of the other reviews.

The fish tacos are fantastic. You can tell the food good quality, and I really enjoy that the tortillas are doubled so it doesn't tear/fall apart as you eat it. The service has always been great and the employees quite friendly.

That being said, I still think they are a little on the expensive side ($11 for 2 tacos. No drink, no sides). I understand its a more quality meal than 'fast food' and that its made-to-order etc, but still seems to push it. Also, why the tacos are delicious, they are an absolute trainwreck to attempt to eat. Too large and sloppy to wrap up and eat like a normal taco without making an absolute mess of your hands and plate."}
{"text":"As soon as we saw a menu for Mahi Mahi Taco hanging at our front door, we had to give this place a try. This place is always crowded no matter what time of the day you arrive. I ordered a Poki Bowl, mahi taco and the coconut shrimp to go. The Poki Bowl was a bit disappointing. The fish was a bit chewy and doesn't taste fresh. Mahi Taco was delicious, but the coconut shrimp was average. I might come back to try something else again in the future."}
{"text":"We had the best  fish  tacos  ever at Coconuts The entire  experience  was amazing  from the  food to the  decor  and the  ambiance  it was incredible. We will  definitely be going back  many times  AWESOME. GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"Omg the greatest fish tacos ever!!!  Not only was the quality  of the food incredible  the service  and ambiance  was also excellent.  I  am  definitely  going to be a  regular.  FANTASTIC  IN EVERY WAY"}
{"text":"I love going to Coconuts.  The food is consistently delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced in terms of what you are receiving.  I like to get the fish local style, sometimes I will have some fries as well which are also excellent.  I have sampled the fish tacos which are exceptional, and the chowder which is delicious.

The staff here is always friendly, the service is prompt and the line moves quickly if there is one.  It really is a standout in terms of value."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with three others on Sunday afternoon and I'm a little confused as to why this place has such rave reviews. While it's true that the the portions for the fish tacos are surprisingly large, much of what you get is cole slaw and not actual fish. There are chunks of fish to be sure, but it really didn't feel or taste like I was eating fish; it was so meaty and chunky that it had the consistency of chicken. I was also underwhelmed and disappointed at the soup I ordered. For $10 you get a serviceable but not amazing fish chowder with a decent amount of protein. What really bothered me was the bowl, though. If you look at the photos, it really seems like they're trying to make it seem like you're getting more soup than you actually are. I have nothing but positive things to say about the onion rings, though, so kudos on that. Very tasty.

Service was courteous and fine as others have noted, but nothing to write home about. I also wasn't feeling the \"Hawaiian\" look; it all came across as gimmicky. Decent place for fish tacos if it's what you're craving, but I think there are better options for seafood."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. Mahi , Ono fish grilled were very tasty. The beer battered onion rings are very good. I like their coleslaw as it is more rough chopped and not soaked in mayo.  Reasonable price for fresh fish that tastes great in a desert state. Service and staff are top notch.. We will be eating here as regulars.."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Casual spot with surf board tables and modern Hawaiian music. Get the fish tacos! They are enormous and delicious. Grab a bottle of Tiger hot sauce to add even more flavor and a hint of spice! Workers are friendly and service is great!"}
