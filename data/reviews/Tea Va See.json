{"text":"For my first experience here, I found it to be mediocre at best. Shisha itself was good (got kiwi/mint, blueberry/mint, & watermelon/grape), atmosphere was very good, food was ok, and service was poor. The pricing was higher than expected (25$ regular, 30$ milk base). I would recommend this spot but wouldn't be my first suggestion and only if ALL other shisha spots are packed. One experience that really got me upset was when I asked for a glass of water. The waitress said they only had bottled water (which was 2.50$). When I asked for tap water, she replied back with \"no but I can give you a glass and you can get it from the toilet\". Yes, she actually said that to a customer! However by the end of night, we all still had a good time."}
{"text":"Guys, the shisha is highly over priced for no reason - $35 + tax + 15% tip! Cheap pip, the head was loose, service was alright. My double apple wasn't strong or as good compare to other shisha shops like Ali Badsha from downtown, Chill Grill Cafe from Danforth or Habibiz from Scarborough. I've been smoking shisha for over 4yrs now and this is not the place for shisha -  Tea sure why not. I did like the furniture, light music, location and dessert looks delicious even though I have not tried them however I'm sure girls will go crazy over them."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly it's a very nice spot got hot chocolate and crepe very good... my friends liked the Shisha would definitely recommend that place the only -star I gave is I asked for coffee and they don't had it... everything else was good the ambience was so relaxing I think it's a hidden spot for shishas it's not that loud (music)as usually it is in other shisha bars and the interior is not that inviting but anyways what counts is the shisha and they are very good there."}
{"text":"Ok place to have some Persian spice teas, open late and a bit overpriced. We didn't order hookah, however the place seems popular with hookah smoking crowd."}
{"text":"That was the worst service you can imagine. Food is 2 (1-10) . Price is over priced . Menu with miss advertising. Owner please wake up . A lot of potential with the renovation."}
