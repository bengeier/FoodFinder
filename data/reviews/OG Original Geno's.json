{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood!  Came in today for lunch, ordered the steak and mushroom sandwich, as well as the Italian sandwich and cheese fries.  The bread is homemade, tastes delicious.  You can tell they use quality ingredients, worth the price.  The Italian sandwich had plenty of meat, served hot from the oven.  The owners were there today, they were extremely welcoming.  They have a small bar area, numerous TVs throughout.  Can see this place being a regular afternoon or evening hangout for some cold beers and good food."}
{"text":"The service and food was fantastic! Definitely worth the visit.  Oh and make sure you try the margaritas!!"}
{"text":"New chain type pizza joint with Cheese Steaks, Hamburgers, Salads Sandwiches etc.. Pizza with garlic butter crust smells amazing in the box but was quite industrial when it came down to eating it. I say closely compared with Peter Piper crust and toppings. Price was more reasonable and priced for college kids. Great takeout and delivery options but the Original Geno's in Tempe was spelled Gino's and their pizza is completely different and more homemade tasting. If you want real Original Gino's from Tempe you will want to to visit the last of the old chain on South Central Avenue in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I ordered here through UberEats because it was close and offered quick delivery. I am glad I did. Pizza was amazing and the sauce was perfect! Cheese bread with pizza sauce and ranch were amazing. Now that I have tried this place, this will be one of my go to places for pizza!"}
{"text":"The bread is baked fresh the help is nice clean pleasent the store and everything is clean fresh and inviting  bring your appetite the Fry's come with lots of chooses from Philly Fry's to cheese or plain they rock"}
{"text":"The chicken , bacon , ranch on anything is Great! The subs are baked crisp and melted and are the BOMB literally."}
{"text":"OG's Original Geno's is a great neighborhood spot for Pizza and Beer!! The owners are there 80% of the time and my 10 year old is always happy when he leaves.   The bread and pizza is made fresh on site everyday you don't have to worry about it being old.  This place is also a great place to grab a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"Trash and they are so rude. DONT GO HERE. Poor customer service and not worth it. Find better pizza elsewhere. Don't encourage this business."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for 3 pizzas that my team and I all wanted to chip in together for. I received a call within a few minutes to confirm my order. Then I was told that they would not put in my order until we they receive payment. I explained that We were all going in together on the pizza and somebody else was picking them up with cash. She then advised that in order to put in the pizza that they must receive payment 1st. I told her that this is unlike any other pizza place that I have ever gone to.. I asked to speak to the manager. She said I was speaking to her.  She was very rude and did not put in our pizzas in therefore making my employees lunch's go over their limit. Pizza is always good here weird policies though."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, Ordered a small cheese pizza, and a philly cheese steak sandwich. You know if they have good pizza if their cheese pizza is good. You can always mask a pizza by having good toppings. Cheese and sauce is no big deal, actually I thought the cheese tasted bad. Even the pizza dough was no big deal. The sandwich was alright, plenty of meat, and cheese. Not enough of peppers. They did have good fries.  Staff was very friendly, always checked up on us.  Would I come back? Probably not, there are a lot of better options out there."}
{"text":"So...on Fathers Day, after the ballgame me and my family are thinking of what to get for dinner on the way home. I think, \"man, I saw the sign for Geno's on the freeway! That sounds amazing!\" My wife says, \"yep, according to their site they're open.\"  Immediately my mouth starts watering as I begin to crave a delicious cheesesteak. Pull up in front of the restaurant, no lights, no people around, no cars in the parking lot. It was closed. SERIOUSLY??? Guess I'll eat somewhere else tonight"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love getting their pizzas and their phillicheese stakes my only gripe is that their wings aren't the best.  I love this new plaza that is helping to turn around this \"Ghetto\" part of town. They've got plenty of food and a grocery store so I am much closer to get food late at night, I just wish this location had the same hours as the one in Tempe so I could get a nice Pizza after a long day at work. The price is very good for what you get with very delicious pizza and other great snacks. I also love that I can go a few doors down and get some bosa smoothies. Overall this is an amazing pizza place and I still haven't eaten inside just gotten take out, so I don't know about the service, but at the register, they are very polite. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the wings."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  Female representative didn't give me my credit card receipt and didn't tell me that my order was complete.   I waited and then walked up to counter and asked for my order.  I give one chance for my continued business and this place ffff'd up that chance."}
{"text":"This place just opened. The bread for the sandwiches or made fresh on-site. Food comes out hot perfect. I am definitely a new fan of this place. I would describe this place as a mix between an Italian sandwich shop and the sports bar. You got to come try this place out"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to our first time at Geno's. Walked in and had to wait for someone to take our order. Not a big deal but it was not very busy.  Once order was taken ( three cheese steak sandwiches, specialty fries and three drinks). The order was read back to me and came out to almost $60 30 min yes 30 min later. We got our 3 sandwiches and 3 fries. When questioned the employee why it took so long and people who came in after us got their food first. she stated she didn't know what to tell me and that it's quicker to make one item then it is to make ten.  What?  When we got back to the hotel (yes out of towners but here quite often) we found that we got one of our fries were wrong even after the order being read back to us.  What we did get was good but the customer service really let us down."}
{"text":"Stopped by for sandwiches and fries.  The kid at the front counter couldn't wait for us to make up our minds about what to order, so he walked away and came back just before I should of left.  Took the order - 3 sandwiches, one overpriced fries and 3 drinks.  My son ordered his sandwich with no ranch.  When the 3 sandwiches came out 14 minutes later, his was smothered in ranch, sent it back and it took 12 minutes to get the right one.  The other 2 sandwiches (hot Italians) were great in my mind.  Didn't seem to bother anyone the order was wrong.  Lots of Help standing around doing nothing,, just standing.   Will go back to Geno needs to make a better effort and getting some help that don't mind being there."}
{"text":"Came in tonight to order a Philly cheesesteak knowing that they close at 10 I showed up at 9:30pm and was told that the grill was already taken down and that they could make pizza. They seemed like high schoolers and quite frankly I know they were being lazy and that to me is very unprofessional and I will not recommend this place to anyone. Ended up leaving and eating somewhere else, very unhappy."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Staff friendly,  place very clean.  When you first walk in you notice menu board easy to read, next  friendly service.  If you eat in ; your food is brought to you by a staff member.  If you take out, there's no surprise when you get home the sandwiches put together the way it should be.  Now the food: one word wow!!!! I love their sandwiches their house sauces so good,   they have another sauce perfect on sandwiches. All bread are baked in house daily.   It's just a wonderful menu wonderful food you must try this place. I've been there a couple of times and have not been disappointed. Rita"}
{"text":"Wow, I just left this place satisfied!  The managers have big hearts and the staff works as fast as they can.   My family and I ate an XXL extreme cheese & pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni pizza has the real pepperonis, the thicker kind that curls up and has a snap to it and a crisp edge.  The larger, thinner pepperonis are good but they are everywhere now. It's nice to see at least one place does have them. If you are not sure what I mean, think of Peter Piper Pizza \"bold\" pepperonis, but not as spicy.   We also split an Original Genos burger with fries. The burger was just llain fresh abd the fries are so crisp but not too much so.   Atmosphere is a plus. It has high ceilings, about 7 or 8 large screens, soda fountain and a cozy side bar.  The bathrooms were well-lit and clean. Not to mention this whole strip mall is brand new! The share a lot with a spankin new Bosa donuts, Popyes Chicken, water & ice store, El Super and a few others.   I love the convenient location and new the huge parking lot. So, yea, we had a great time."}
{"text":"You can't say you offer New York style pizza or are similar to New York pizza places if you run out of slices and don't make more. IIt's not difficult. Otherwise it's not bad, though their pepperoni does not look/taste like pepperoni, more like salami.   Update: there's no reason someone should have to wait 10+ minutes to pick up an order that's already ready for pickup, when there are 4 employees working. I'm not unsympathetic if it's busy, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"The pizza was actually pretty decent. They messed up our order though and we didn't get our everything sticks. Kinda disappointing the first time you order from a place and your order is wrong. It was way too greasy for my girlfriend so we probably won't be getting it again. Maybe give it a try you never know?"}
