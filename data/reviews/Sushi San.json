{"text":"It's more of a 4.5 stars I would say.  The service in itself is spectacular.  The waitress was very pleasant and would joke around with you.  I'm not sure how common it is here, but they gave a LOT of freebies during the meal.  In all, they gave an extra roll, deep fried veges, miso soup, edamamae, and watermelon to finish things off.  I was stuffed by the end of the meal!  Didn't see that coming!  Of course, don't come to this place expecting so many freebies.  Treat them as special bonuses during your meal.

The sushi itself was above average I would say.  The rolls were stuffed with so many ingredients that I couldn't really enjoy the taste of the fish, but that was my fault for choosing them.  They were tasty for sure though.  The place had a very fishy smell to it when I entered which is very uncharacteristic of a high quality sushi place."}
{"text":"I showed up when Sushi San opened lunch. I made the mistake of ordering 2 sushi rolls. I was not aware of all the other food. They bring out first miso soup that very good. Then a salad, could have used some fresher lettuces. It was browning on the edges. Good dressing. Then rolls came out they were a little large than expected both very good (Crunchy and Tiger Roll). Lastly two small slices of watermelon. Needless to say I was starting on the path to a food coma...lol. I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi place.  The food is always fresh and delicious, and the owner and his wife are wonderfully warm and friendly.  The service is fast and efficient, and after your meal you will be pleased with the beautiful fruit boat, compliments of the chief."}
{"text":"Quality and portion size were great best sushi I've had in the valley, sushi chef knows what he's doing. Not very expensive either."}
{"text":"I don't eat sashimi so I can't comment on their fish quality, but I do like cooked rolls and luckily Sushi San has a wide selection.  All the rolls I've tried are delicious and you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

What stands out the most to me about this restaurant is their amazing customer service.  I usually order to go and sometimes find \"extras\" in my bag, such as miso soup, edamame, or even an entire extra roll!  The staff is super friendly and it's rare these days to find a restaurant with such a stellar level of customer service."}
{"text":"Used to be a five star place. They got greedy and removed all you can eat from the menu... Unfortunately I have found a new sushi place less than a mile away."}
{"text":"I've seen many businesses come and go in this exact location, but I hope Sushi San stays!! I ordered the albacore tuna + scallions roll and the spicy octopus roll off of the happy hour menu, which is only $3.45 per item.  This place is definitely better than Ra, and they have an amazing selection of rolls.  They actually gave me 3 menus because they have so many different things!  The spicy yellowtail and tuna roll were also delicious.  The owner gave us a free dish of tempura, how nice of them! This is a great place to go if you don't like crowded places.  Kind of a hole-in-the-wall feeling, cozy, and comfortable.  There are 2 TVs and a projector, so you can watch different things at once.  I love the random decor- there's a disco ball, lights that change color outside, and a menu that changes colors too, all with an asian feeling.  This place is going to be my next go-to destination for sushi!"}
{"text":"this was not yummy or freshish or really ok. but if you insist on a california roll and happen to be trapped in the illini union at the time, how bad could it be?"}
{"text":"After being a little reluctant to enter (in a strip mall which is pretty much empty except for Goodwill)  We were pleasantly surprised to find this treasure!  The sushi was wonderful (we usually eat at Way Sushi or Taiko) and they were very generous with complimentary food items like edamame, miso soup,  some delicious panko covered salmon with a tasty sesame flavor and watermelon!  The super friendly staff made us feel like we were at a friends house...   We will return again and again .. I hope they stay in business for a long time !!!  Go to Sushi San ,, you will love it!  Did I mention how CLEAN it was?!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The sushi is absolutely delicious and the service is great! We've had a server named June a couple of times and he is always very attentive and nice! By far my favorite sushi restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Found this place because its close to work. I wish I can go here for lunch on a daily basis but my budget wont allow it! Sushi is always fresh and the staff is very friendly. I've had their all you can eat sushi($20) for dinner and managed to eat 3 rolls. Great deal if you ask me because each roll can be around $9-14. They have tons of rolls you can choose from. Also the complimentary fruit is a nice touch and makes you feel special. You will be glad you visited."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my wife and had an extremely positive experience. The sushi rolls were delicious and the service was great. We sat at the bar and were given several free appetizers - a nice perk! I will definitely return to Sushi San the next time I visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the owner is rude. We made reservations and bot stuck in a room in the back alone. We complained and it did no good! ! They have so much business that they do not care about the customer! !!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place in the Chandler Gilbert area. The customer service is remarkable and very efficient on time. The servers are always happy willing to give recommendations and helpful. Alice and June have always been amazing. I truly look forward to coming here when I can and I live in north Phoenix. I make the drive often to eat here!!! Thank you Sushi San crew you guys are great!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was quite an (awful) experience. First of all, we experienced pretty much EVERY problem that other people have written about among various Yelp reviews. For instance, terrible service. No one greeted us when we came in, we had to awkwardly ask the sushi chefs behind the bar if we could seat ourselves. It took a while before either of the two waitresses took turns aimlessly and half-heartedly wandering around the restaurant came to bring us menus. Next, the temperatures of the raw fish that we ordered were quite variable. Some pieces were extremely cold, nearly frozen, and others were warmer than room temperature (eek!). When we asked our waitress why some fish was so cold and others warm, she said \"The fish is cold because it is fresh, don't you want fresh fish?\" I had no idea that frozen fish was the freshest... but apparently that's the case here. This also made us wonder what must have be up with the warm fish, because if she thought that cold meant fresh... Based on previous reviews and the menu posted on their website ($1 nigiri, lots of rolls, etc.), we specifically requested the \"happy hour\" menu, since happy hour is all day on Saturdays! Not so exciting once you actually get the happy hour menu, though, which does NOT match the happy hour menu posted online. The actual happy hour menu had about 6 options for rolls (salmon, tuna, octapus, etc.) only, all just under $4. So, not only do you have to request the happy hour menu (which seemed to be intentionally kept secret), but the prices and selection was weak at best. And maybe it's just me, but I was very unimpressed with the \"Apple or Orange juice\" listed on the specials menu at the sushi bar. I mean, seriously? Although we did get some \"freebies\" (miso soup, small bowl of edamame), these tend to be free at most Japanese restaurants and did not make up for all the other issues WHATSOEVER! This is one of those special sushi restaurants that makes you spend your drive home wondering if/when food poisoning may struck and also makes you hesitate to EVER take another chance on a new sushi restaurant again."}
{"text":"We have gone here several times now. Each time we have enjoyed ourselves. The selection is fabulous the prices are fair. The service has always been great. We love sushi san!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time this past weekend. My boyfriend and I did the all you can eat but were disappointed that it didn't include the sashimi but none the less we stuffed our faces till we were sick. 

Definitely good quality rollls and we just told the chef to have some fun and he definitely made some awesome rolls. 

Will definitely return to try some other things on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Our family loves Sushi San. It is a very nice  room with table, booth, and sushi bar seating. Nice woodwork typical of a sushi bar. The food portions are very generous and they like to provide freebies that they call \"service\". Pricing is very reasonable, you pay for the sushi not some guchi atmosphere. The owners Jane and Chef Eric are super friendly. This is just great conventional sushi! They also have a nice menu of cooked items too like chicken teriyaki. I highly recommend it. Our family eats there 2-3 times a week sometimes."}
{"text":"Very good stuff! Love the Arizona Roll and a triple order of Mesa rolls.  All you can eat Sushi $20.  A very good secret find close to home. Super friendly family."}
{"text":"The Good:
SO and I both ordered Unagi bowls. The unagi itself was good, and that's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one. 
The Bad:
The veggies served with it were not great, and it did not come with miso soup, unlike all of their other \"bowls\". Also, it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals, around fifteen-twenty minutes. This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food. Moreover, he and I watched as the worker (probably also the manager) argued with a customer, saying that she had already received her food, when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item. 

Overall, would not return, especially with Sushi Ichiban so close, and with more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I loved it. Went on a Thursday night, alone, there were several other tables and a few people at the bar. Service was prompt, food was good, I did the AYCE menu. It had a good variety. Pleased with the presentation. I'll go back again, and again and again!"}
{"text":"Great sushi at an affordable price! Been coming here for two years now and it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying, I am a regular here and will not come back after the service I've just experienced. 

Went to Sushi San to show a friend how great this place was and instead... The owner questioned me RUDELY about ordering the all you can eat option. She scolded us for not telling them verbally that we wanted all you can eat, when we clearly ordered from the all you can eat form... (There's two different papers to fill). When I mean scolded, that included her giving us an attitude, rude tone, and being unapologetic. How are you as a customer supposed to react? Especially being a loyal customer? On top of that, they didn't honor our choice for AYCE sushi, and charged us for each plate.... The bill was then corrected but point is... It was a really bad experience. 

The food was awesome. It will always be awesome, but the service here is terrible. They're rude and always question you about your order. They seem to get mad and irritable when you order a lot as well. They are even rude on the phone, so this is a fair warning."}
{"text":"I love to try new sushi places and let me tell you this place wasn't a mistake! The decor is so cute lol I love the feel of the whole place. The sushi is made in front of you which is nice to see. The restaurant is nice and relaxing. The employees were super nice! 

Went there on a girls night and was treated so well! We were given complementary edamame and oranges (don't know if they do that to everyone). My friends and I bought 3 rolls. Shrimp tempura, California roll, and Phoenix roll. Best choice! Not only that the price was reasonable. Usually sushi is a little pricy but at Sushi San the price was right lol

I would recommend this to everyone who likes sushi and I plan on going there again!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrendous. We ordered salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, gyoza, the Phoenix roll, salmon roll, and another one that I didn't even know what it was---looked and smelled like cat pate. We tried one piece of each and all of it was disgusting.

The reason we came to this place was because our favorite, Shimogamo down the street, was busy. Needless to say, if you like this place, you don't know what good, or even decent, sushi is."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Awesome sushi. The lady and I went here and loved every second of it. The Phoenix roll, salmon, and yellowtail were exceptional. 

PS: try the fresh wasabi. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We went on the recommendation of my parents, who love this place. We were pleasantly surprised. My wife ordered the chicken teriyaki and I got the all you can eat sushi- tuna sashimi, dragon roll, and a fried eel roll (don't remember the name)
The food took a little while to come out but they were busy and only had one sushi chef, so it was totally understandable. Our waitress was extra nice and told us she was sorry for the wait and brought out miso soup and edamame while we waited (for free!) Everything tasted great. The sushi was well rolled, the rolls held up like they should and everything that was was supposed to be hot was hot and the cold rolls were cold, as they should be. The fish had great flavor and the non sashimi choices were varied and had a few unique ones on the menu. 
The meal was a good value, for $20 they have all you can eat with the sushi. I was being conservative but I probably could've stuffed another roll in if I had tried. 
After we ate they gave us a sliced up persimmon, it was very good. I have only had the kind that is soft and almost mushy, but this one was crunchy and sweet and refreshing after dinner. We really like this place and will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's really close to me house, so we go here a lot. It's usually quiet, which we love. When we bring our kids, the waitress is always extra sweet to the kids and gets them whatever they need to keep busy while the food is being made.

The food itself, OH MY GOODNESS. The sushi is SO fresh. We also like one of those rotating sushi bar places, but the difference in the freshness of the sushi is night and day. The regular entrees are really good, too. I've had several of their items and we never have any left overs. Try it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at very fair prices, and they have the most AMAZING service. I could repeat what the other reviewers are saying, but will post some photos instead. :-)"}
{"text":"I leave 1 star reviews only when absolutely deserved, and this place deserved it. I have eaten at dozens of sushi places over the years and this was certainly the worst so far. 

Food - 1/5 stars. Ordered salmon, yellowtail, and albacore and a special roll. The salmon was half frozen. The yellowtail had a fishy taste. The albacore I could not finish due to it tasting NOT fresh and it having a strange texture. 


Service - 1/5 stars. Waiter is ok but the sushi chef literally ran off while I was sitting at the bar. I was the ONLY person there. So very awkward. 

Atmosphere - 2/5. Decor is ok but there is a somewhat rotten scent as soon as you walk in. That almost made me turn away but I made the mistake of not doing that"}
{"text":"The sushi was good server was rude male with glasses. My mom, sister in law and brother in law were visiting this was our first visit. Server was rude from beginning from the door to table and condescending especially with the all you can eat which was the reason for the visit.He did not go over portion sizes and when we asked questions and he just smirked that makes sense with a attitude.He said for each roll it's a extra $1 if there is leftovers repeatedly which we understood the first time and did not say anything about the rest of the leftovers costing extra too. We had some fried rice leftover and was charged.This was our daughters birthday and such a awful experience. We didn't even want the picture taken just wanted to leave.Our family is in the restaurant business from chefs to managers to servers we understand service and service was just awful.we can take bad food, but your customer service is key to success which was not shown tonight."}
{"text":"Enjoy the sushi. My wife eats just sushi, & I like to get one of the kitchen items as well."}
{"text":"Wow..got lucky and stumbled upon this place. Dead shopping center but wow.  Seems like a family place as the waiters seemed like teenagers. I had the 911 roll which was a roll that has cucumber as the outside section..it was fantastic!  They brought us some free edamame as well. The miso soup was hot and free....Hmm...Ah yes..The Sapporo was nice and cold.

Prices good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Not a great selection on the AYCE menu and portions are pretty small. Very good sushi tho. But if you're looking for a true AYCE this is not it. But if you want good sushi. This place is great."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get Sushi! You can't beat the quality of the food here or the ambiance. The service is intimate and polite. We have been in a few times and received free sushi! I have had two family birthday parties here. The Saba is the freshest I've had in the desert. 
They have a really good selection for the all you can eat menu. I was challenged however to get back our $20.00 per person cost as the price per roll/ nigiri is so good."}
{"text":"Gotta love the good food here. After our second visit we've decided to become regulars!  Friendly smiling staff and competitive pricing make it a pleasure to do business here. Love the dragon roll but I'm equally anxious to try some of the other more unusual items.  Enjoyed the presentation as well."}
{"text":"Got the $20 all you can eat sushi and figured I would eat $25 with and be done. But since we were in a big group (5), the food was taking a bit long. So they served us some free edemame, then after we got our food the chef made us another 4 rolls. Then gave us watermelon for dessert. Needless to say, they had to roll us out of there. Sushi was excellent too."}
{"text":"Easily the best little Japanese restaurant I've found so far in Gilbert. The food is great and the service is excellent, sure the owners are actually Korean, but that doesn't mean they don't know how to make some mean rolls. The fried rice is delicious, the specialty rolls are unique and very yummy and they always give you goodies like orange or watermelon with the bill.

Oh and the framed phrases in the bathroom are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is great. My guy and I went in on a weeknight around 9:00pm and we had the entire place to ourselves. The staff was very attentive and treated us like kings. The food was very good and inexpensive. They have great prices on drinks and $0.99 sushi. We had the Sake Sushi, Caterpillar Roll and Alaska Roll. Everything was good and presented beautifully. The server brought us complimentary miso soup and edamame. The sushi chef gave us some squid salad on the house. 
The atmosphere is great, I really like the decor. 
We will be regulars..."}
{"text":"I really only eat take-out from Sushi San. The chef is talented and has a sense of style as he puts every sushi box I bring-home together with artistry. NOT slapped together misshapen or falling apart like some other places at the same price point. The combo lunches are OK but I recommend taking the daily special with one of their many specialty rolls."}
{"text":"So good!  Their fish is really  fresh and they have a lot of options for rolls.  The ASU roll is to die for, I think I will be dreaming of this roll for at least few weeks.  We also tried their spicy chicken dinner and was impressed, great flavor and not greasy like we've experienced in the pasted.  The service is awesome, very friendly and they gave us complimentary soup, salad, and gyozas. Can't wait to go back again! Until then ASU roll I'll see you in my dreams :)"}
{"text":"I was really craving sushi one night they were about to close but the lady was nice enough to still make me my pick up order. I love this place great customer service. they prepare it so Nicely."}
{"text":"I've come here two years in a row on my birthday and they have yet to disappoint! The sushi is top-notch and the staff always go above and beyond! If you are looking for a nice place to enjoy some quality sushi. Then you can't beat Sushi San."}
{"text":"They have one of the best Vegas rolls I have ever had! Other rolls are pretty good! Long live Sushi San"}
{"text":"Since Sakana has me sushi smitten I decided to give this place a try. I went here for lunch on Saturday and I was the only customer there the entire time. Thank God there was a TV I would've been annoyed if I had to make small talk the entire time. The waitress and the Sushi chef were very friendly and accommodating- I actually got way more food than I could've imagined. I ordered the Mountain Roll for $13.75 and a Side Salad for $2.75. The waitress also gave me miso soup, watermelon and edamame- Needless to say I was stuffed! The Mountain Roll couldn't not satisfy my sushi craving (it was basically a California roll topped with tuna and salmon dressed in some spicy sauce). I'm not a big fan of California rolls anyways but this was definitely on par with a grocery store so I'm glad it was topped! The sauce made it a little hard to differentiate between the Tuna and the Salmon. I will give this place another try because they are friendly and cheap but I'm not going to get the Mountain Roll again."}
{"text":"This place happens to be right around the corner from my house, so I went for the first time last week. I'll probably be back to give it one more chance because my first experience wasn't anything great. Went on a Friday night just after 6pm, wasn't too busy. Service was pretty fast, and friendly. We ordered two rolls and some fresh sushi, the fresh sushi was pretty good, nothing great, but the rolls were not that great. 75% of the rolls were just rice. They skimped on the toppings and the fillings for sure."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about going here cuz of the last little sushi place I went to being awful. But this place is amazing! I can't even believe how amazing this little place is. I don't even have words for it!! I will add more later but all the food was so authentic and fresh. Unbelievable. I'm gonna be coming here so much they will get sick of me!! I got the lava roll, which was to DIE for. The white yellowtail nigiri, fresh and divine. The sushi go round is just epic. I can't stop ranting about this place plus the free miso soup with your meal! Soooooo good!!! Love love love! If you are a sushi lover like me this place blows all the others out of the water!!!!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh and tasty, and many options are provided. They treat you to great service, wonderful ambiance, and a \"3 course meal\"--miso soup, sushi, and oranges for dessert. We have already been back twice since our first time, and do not regret any of the trips!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS this is my favorite sushi restaurant in the valley 
I work for the airlines and eat sushi all over and I think this is comparable to sushi  near the ocean"}
{"text":"Sushi san is my favorite sushi restaurant! The chef is creative and prepares delicious sushi EVERYTIME. I have been dining there for almost six years now and I have always been glad I chose Sushi San. As a huge Sushi fan, I have been to many different locations to try sushi, and this one is the best for me. Now, to get perspective, I order the SPECIAL rolls. My favorite are the Lion King Roll, The Sushi San Roll, and The Island Roll. Next time you go, try those out, and you'll be able to see this place the way I see it!"}
{"text":"I came here on Valentines with my buddy and the service was very good they were a little busy and kept up with our refills and checked on us frequesntly. We shared Calamari that was okay i would've liked it more if it hadn't looked like fish sticks. I also had the Darwin roll which was actually amazing i love cheese! Then i had a sort of yakisoba noodle chicken plate that was way too salty if it weren't for that i would've gave them 5 stars. They do start you off with free miso soup thats okay and gave us some sliced oranges as a free desert, I liked that a lot its a nice gesture and doesn't cost them much to do.Oh they are also a bit pricier than our usual sushi spot but i will be back for another Darwin Roll!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sushi San 4 times now, and they already know me by name and know what I like to eat! 

The first time I went to Sushi San, I was shopping for costume props at Goodwill and I figured there couldn't really be a good sushi place next door. I decided to take the plunge. I was greeted kindly, service was fast and friendly and the sushi was actually quite delicious.

After the third visit, the owners kindly offered me a free set of nice chopsticks, labeled with my name to keep at the restaurant for when I am there. I have been dieting, so no rice for me lately. Luckily, they have a delicious Spicy Sashimi Salad, which I get with scallops added to it. Complimentary Miso Soup and Watermelon to cleanse the palate, too.

This is exactly the kind of place I love to support. Family owned and operated. Amazingly hospitable service that you aren't likely to see outside of fine dining. Very nice quality sushi(even compared to my favorite Shimigomo). And did I mention they carry Soju! Sake's sweeter, stronger Korean brother!

Go there! Bring friends! This place deserves your business."}
{"text":"Wow! Love this place! We have been regulars for 2.5 years now... nom nom nom... The salmon YUM! Blue Fin, My favorite the spicy Mt. Roll and Tako salad!! ... Gotta wrap this up I'm getting hungry, meet you!! 
Love love love!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for nearly two years now. The owners know how I like my Mountain Roll. It's a great price for rolls! Im extremely picky when it comes to raw fish this is one of the best places in the valley!! I highly recommend the Mountain Roll,  Lion King Roll, and Salmin roll."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about leaving this review.  This place genuinely has the best sushi I have ever eaten in Arizona.  I understand what some of the other reviewers have written about the service being a little hit or miss, as I've experienced that myself, but to me its not that big of a deal, the sushi is great.

Here is my only complaint.  I got food poisoning from the sushi here in July, and it was so bad it lasted for several days.  I do recognize that we are in the middle of the desert where its frequently 110+ degrees so raw fish was probably not the wisest choice on my part.  As good as the sushi is, and as much as I want to support an otherwise great local establishment, I will probably not be back because of this."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here because of some of the bad reviews, but I like to give everyone at least one chance. I thought it was great. My food was perfect and the service was really nice. I was in for lunch so it was pretty quiet, but I was greeted quickly and served. I say give them a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"My teenage sons and I have been going to Sushi San for almost 5 years now. We used to live right by it and even after moving pretty far from it, there is nowhere else we'd rather go for Sushi! Always clean,great service and the absolute best,beautifully served sushi we've ever had! My personal favorite is the ASU roll but, love everything we've ever eaten there. If you are looking for great sushi, it's a must have go to place! We'll be back soon Sushi San,Love you guys!"}
{"text":"I really liked the environment and the food was great. The services has been on and off for the different times I have been there but its run by a family and the kids usually do the serving so got to give them credit for their age. They really seem to have a strong loyal customer base which says a lot for the amount of sushi options there are around here."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I love it! The sushi is airways yummy and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously delicious, fresh, and fantastic! Everything is fresh, they have real wasabi and both classic sushi and inventive rolls. I love it because it is family owned and predominately ran by the husband and wife duo. The husband is an infinitely talented sushi chef and takes pride in his work. The customer service is off the chain wonderful. I could not think of one con to this place and my experience, only pros and a million and a half reasons to go back over and over again! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Impressive! Their sushi selection is huge! Plus free miso soups and edamame! Huge win. The customer service was great! Our server always came to check on our drinks or if we needed anything else. Really impressed with the taste of their food. I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit here, the first time it was great, service was quick and the cold sushi was cold and the hot sushi(Las Vegas roll) was hot and crunchy. But sadly this wasn't the case on our second trip, service was slow, didn't even get a refill on our drinks the whole time and we were 1 of 3 tables that were seated so it wasn't busy, when we ordered our food it did come out in somewhat of a timely manor but the cold sushi wasn't cold, it was almost warm, the Las Vegas roll was cold and soft not hot and crunchy like it should be but that's not why they are getting 1 star, we paid with a $40 gift card we got from a friend and the rest of the bill with my debt card which after tip was $30 even but when the payment posted to my account it was $30.91 which is not what I authorized as payment, 91 cents isn't a lot but its not ethical to change the tip amount from what I signed for so for that i wont be returning and they get one star"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the great service, I would have given no stars.  I visited this place with my wife and we were excited to have discovered a new sushi place so close to home.  The staff received us wonderfully, but that is as good as it got.  Even though we received complimentary fruit and a few pieces of sushi, the food was very disappointing.

The sushi rice was under seasoned and the pieces of yellow tail and salmon that covered the rice were entirely to big for the tiny bit of rice.  The sushi rice was terribly underseasoned, very bland and needed more vinegar, sugar, and salt.  This ruined the sushi for me.

My wife ordered the BBQ Ribs and let me say I have found more meat at a vegan buffet.  The ribs were fat and bone!  Where's the BEEF!

We should have seen the Red Flag, the place was empty on a Friday night.  Before the food arrived my wife and I thought, \"This is great, we have the whole place to ourselves, WE ARE SO LUCKY!\"  Now I know why were were the only souls, except for one guy who wandered in for drinks and noodle soup.

I can say I will not be a regular here."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of sushi, I've given it several tries and I just did not get what my friends loved about it.  This really changed when my fiance took me to Sushi San on Thursday night.  We had the spicy sashimi salad with scallops and the California rolls with baked crab on top.  It was served with some delicious miso soup, edamame, and fresh pineapple for desert.  Oh my the scallops and sashimi on the salad were so fresh!  I couldn't get enough of it!  I went safe with the California rolls and they were very yummy and the baked crab on top was decadent but next time I'm going to try something more adventurous!  The service is great, the atmosphere is very comfortable with great lighting (lighting is very important), we took our time and enjoyed ourselves.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like this place!

The sushi that I had was good - what made me enjoy it even more was that there was so much detail and care into making the rolls. Beautiful presentation! :)

I also ordered the mochi for dessert --- it was so cute how they made it look like a fish! 

As you can tell by now, I love pretty looking food. And what's so great about this place is that they are able to make their food look gorgeous AND delicious!  

Service here was also great :) Even though everyone commented on the extra food they give like the miso soup, fruit, and edamame, I couldn't help but feel so special every time our server brought those items to us. So charming!  Oh, and the fruit display was gorgeous as well :p

I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I'm going to be a butt and say that I couldn't go up to five because the table where we were seated at was a bit dirty. So really, I wish I could mark it as 4 1/2 stars.

But to their defense, I can be pretty picky and anal so ignore that part if you aren't so neurotic k? 

This place is great! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Health nuts (and those looking for lighter fare) will love that the food is free of heavy seasonings. But the portions are tiny and, my God, is the service here slow and rude. Perhaps that's why Sushi San, despite occupying one of the most visible spots in the food court, attracts hardly any customers even during peak hours. Once I asked for rice and vegetables in separate containers (as opposed to one on top of the other in a cramped bowl, making it impossible to enjoy the two together). The server flatout refused without even a trivial apology."}
{"text":"It could have been a two, if it's not because of the great service. Tonight my hubby suddenly craved for Japanese food but our favorite one was closed, so we quickly picked one that I saved from Yelp to try. 

When we first got in, we were warmly greeted and seated by a very friendly lady (since others say it's a family-owned restaurant, so I guess she's the mom?). We looked through the menu and ordered sushi pieces (sea urchin, oysters, tuna, scallop, spicy scallop, white fish, albacore, tamago), tofu and a miso soup. But because they said sea urchin and oysters might not be very fresh at that moment, so we replaced them with toro, and she was so kind to offer two miso soups for us for free. So, we were very happy waiting for our sushi, while drinking the hot tea just served. 

Then I noticed something. The hot tea was salty. Just like those tea that were brewed with tap water instead of drinking water (I'm not a 100% sure if that's the cause but sometimes you could taste that kind of salty tea in some Chinese restaurants in the valley. I think we all know tea shouldn't be salty, right?)

Okay. I thought it's just the tea (and I had to pay for that), but later I found that the miso soup was very salty too, and I just couldn't finish it (even my hubby, who always likes adding a few pinches of salt to almost every meal said it's salty)! 

The sushi came fairly quickly, and I couldn't wait to try my toro (discounted to $11)!! My hubby hasn't tried toro before, so he said it's okay, but for me, I think there're way too many tendons in the fish! Toro should be something that will MELT in your mouth (and with this price!) and the aroma should linger in your mouth (from my better experience)! They also added too much vinegar in the rice so the sourness of the rice covered the taste and aroma of the fish. I'm quite disappointed but I thought I'll wait until I tried out everything to judge. 

Others weren't particularly bad but I won't say they're very fresh (I liked the albacore sushi though).  As for the proportion of the fish and the rice (I know I'm super picky, sorry about that), I think I have to agree with Omar who reviewed before. The size of the fish is way too large compared to the rice. I remember the first time I read Omar's review, I laughed, \"What? Isn't it a good thing to have a bigger piece of fish?\" and \"maybe he haven't tried other Japanese restaurants where they have large pieces of fish on top of the rice!\"...but NOW I know. The fish was cut much larger and thicker than normal, and I just came to realize that it's not necessarily a good thing. Because the balance is lost. It's like placing a piece of sashimi on a tiny bit of rice, and you think you're eating sashimi instead of sushi. (I like sashimi too, but since I ordered sushi...)

Om...and the spicy scallop sushi were super spicy (even my hubby  who can eat comparatively quite spicy food wouldn't want to take the second piece). Thank goodness they gave us some fruit in the end and my tongue felt better (well I can't eat very spicy things in the first place haha, my bad) :p

I hate to criticize like almost everything about the food, since the lady was so very nice!!! I guess if you're not too pampered by fine, authentic sushi before, and you don't care about salty miso soup and stuff, then you might give it a try :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic. My wife and I went on a Friday night. I knew right away when everyone coming in was a regular, that we were in for a treat. This place is right by our house in a non descript shipping center, that we've driven by hundreds of times. We found it on yelp tonight and saw the positive reviews. They deserve it. 

I could tell the owners were Korean, because they spoke it. I believe it's a family restaurant and they are very aware that positive reviews are return customers are driving their business. For a Friday night it wasn't really too busy, when we arrive we were seated right away and had the option of seating. At the risk of writing a positive review and their business improving so much that next time we have to wait. They deserve it.

Beyond the basics they have an Extensive roll menu, some you've heard of and some house rolls.

Food was fantastic. Rice seasons well and didn't fall apart. Fish is FRESH!  Fish to rice ratio was perfect. We too, will soon be those regulars ;)

That's it. Try it or don't, just my opinion ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch. I'll be honest and say I've had better Japanese food before. The sashimi doesn't taste too fresh. The miso soup also tastes quite odd. They do offer cheap lunches, but the quality isn't the best."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi rolls, sashimi, & other dishes! The customer service is excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It use to be good. Walked in today and the placed reeked of old carpet and moldy water. The AYCE menu used to be ok, but now the rolls and nigiri lack presentation and quality. I think the woman chef was making the sushi today. Usually when the man chef makes the sushi he pays careful attention to the details of the sushi. I don't know if I will be back. Hopefully they would deep clean the carpet and pay attention to the details of the quality of sushi served."}
{"text":"The customer service kills the experience for this place. I am very understanding that people have a bad day but you are here to earn a paycheck and earn my tip so leave the negative \"get out of my restaurant\" attitude at home. 

Otherwise it's a nice looking place with good sushi. Normal sushi prices. 

You can buy chopsticks here and eat with them right away. I believe you can eat from an AYCE menu, and outside says it's conveyor belt sushi but I did not see such a thing inside, tho I did not go to the back. 

I would come again but the customer service experience was not one I want to go thru again."}
{"text":"I love Sushi San so much :3
The quality, the taste, the choices, the sake, the service, the atmosphere.
Everything.
The employees are the best :)
I always try something new and I always enjoy it.
The rolls are always nicely presented.
Sushi San is my go to :D
Writing this review makes me want some now"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The service is pleasant and the food is good.  We were not charged for the miso soup we ordered and were brought free edamame and then fruit for dessert.  The rolls (including the happy hour ones) are reasonably priced and yummy.  I also really enjoyed the vegetable tempura.  If I was very hungry one night I would like to try the all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Really love the sushi here. Exceeds all the other places I've tried. The Vegas roll, California roll and spicy tuna are all favorites. It's clearly family owned which I can appreciate. Service has always been fast and polite. Always been comped a bowl of edamame if it's going to be more than a few minutes, and every time I've been there my meal is always followed up with some fresh fruit.  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I always order the same 3 rolls to go. They've never messed up an order and  I always leave happy. The customer service and hospitality is great. They are a smaller sushi restaurant which gives it a very \"homey\" vibe. I haven't been there to dine in but I'm sure when I do, they will exceed my expectation per usual. Try the Tiger Roll & I love Salmon roll, those are my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"Hands down the very best sushi restaurant in Arizona!!! The fish is fresh, rolls are gigantic and the quality of service is impeccable! I have been looking for a place like this since I moved from the east coast!! If you are in the mood for some quality, fantastic sushi, look no further!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Maybe the other yelp reviewers gave me high expectations, but I was very disappointed with this place. My husband and I have eaten at many sushi restaurants, but I've actually enjoyed this one the least. We got the all-you-can-eat sushi and tried about 8 different rolls. First of all, the rice was way too sweet! It was ok the first few rolls, but I ended up dunking my rolls in soy sauce just to take away some of the sweetness. Also, the rice-to-sushi ratio was too much. This place was very obvious about filling you up on rice. Finally, it was so warm in there! My whole family was sweating and even the sushi was warm. Gross. Their sushi isn't terrible (we still finished the plate), but there is definitely better. The main reason for the 3 stars is the service. All of the staff there were super nice and we received great service."}
{"text":"Well here is impressions with this Restaurant. We simply loved it. We went there with a total of about 20 people and they seated us right away. Everyone ordered and the food was amazing. They went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect. It wasn't until after our meal we advised them it was my birthday, they politely asked for proof, and is their policy to give out a free \"specialty roll\" to the one celebrating. in addition to that they took pictures for us and proved copies on the spot, one to keep and 1 to sign to hang on their wall (in their waiting area). This is not something I have not seen anyone do (without it being requested by the customer). We  will be returning, easily  the best sushi spot i have been to."}
{"text":"The sushi was good and I liked that they had a full bar. They were out of miso soup, which isn't the biggest deal but it was a cold, rainy night and a bowl of miso would have been perfect. Unfortunately the miso thing was disappointing and kind of tainted the whole experience for me (I know, dramatic. But it was SO cold!!). 
Overall I'd say it's more of a 3 1/2, but I'll most likely return in the future."}
{"text":"Not a bad thing to say about this place! We love their food and their service. Fish is always fresh and we love their \"service\"....free edamame, tempura, salmon skin...
They really do need to hire another server and sushi chef though. Don't go here if you are in a hurry. It can take upwards of two hours to eat at their busy times, but we really like the laid back atmosphere, so it's not an issue for us!"}
{"text":"I noticed the other night that I gave this restaurant a 4 star rating, but really Sushi San deserves 5 stars.

They treat you like family every time from the first time.  I became a regular from the start.  I bought chopsticks on my second visit there because I knew I would be coming back for more.  And I returned just about every week after that.  And I've taken friends and roommates.

This is a family owned restaurant and the server is really funny and gives me free items once in a while.  I'm not saying to expect free items and I don't want to advertise that, but maybe that will be a perk for you.  It is for me!

Other than the great service and lovely family that owns the restaurant, the sushi is delicious!  The special rolls are really good.  I always end up eating more than I should because it's so good.

Favorites:
Just about all the special rolls
Mountain roll
Spicy tuna hand roll
Miso soup
Edamame"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place to have Sushi!  Plus the owners are fantastic, and the food is top notch.   I always get the Spicy Sashimi Salad with Scallops."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sushi and had great service. The boards behind the bar advertise their specials. They offer an all-you-can-eat menu, but I have found that I prefer ordering directly off the menu because not all the rolls I want are featured on the all-you-can-eat menu.  Frequent customers have a pair of personal chopsticks kept at the restaurant, but I have yet to figure out how to get one of those."}
{"text":"Came to this place late Saturday night. They were open till midnight which worked for us. It was my son and I out for a little late night bite. The decor is classic Japanese. 

The wait staff greeted us and was very friendly. We asked for a recommendation on a sushi and it was top notch. The price was great, service was great. They even gave us potstickers on the house. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone. The price is good and the fish is spectacular."}
{"text":"Turned to Yelp for help on Super Bowl Sunday when the restaurant we went to was unexpectedly closed.  What a great accident!  Service was great, sushi was so fresh.  And they had a big screen TV with the game on, so the boyfriend was happy!  LOVED the squid salad.  Great variety for a very good price.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! It's all about the \"service\". Don't be in a hurry, kickback have some drinks and enjoy yourselves!"}
{"text":"The sushi I ordered was warm. I prefer raw fish to be at least cool which then had me paranoid I was going to get sick from eating it. The service was prompt. There was a young child running around behind the sushi bar (maybe the owners child) which can't be sanitary. The place smelled gross (my husband wanted to leave immediately because of the smell but I wanted to try it out) so that messed with my appetite. Free potstickers for an appetizer and oranges at the end was a nice treat and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"First time for lunch and big surprise. Delicious sushi and rolls. We had ASU  special roll and DECEMBER roll...very good. They served us a Miso soup and Edamane which we thanked very much.
Very attentive service. When in Chandler / Gilbert a place to dine."}
{"text":"this is my favorite place for sushi.. 20 bucks all you can eat sushi.. well worth the price..  the staff is very friendly.."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my parents.  What a fun place.  The sushi is great, clean and the server was very attentive to our needs.  We got to sit where ever we wanted and was greeted with a smile. My dad and I ordered the all you can eat sushi, of which I ordered way too much of course. I wouldn't say the sushi is THE best sushi I've ever had, but I would go to this place over Kona or Ra in a heartbeat.  The prices are great and they don't really mind if you share a bit of your \"all you can eat\" with someone else at your table.  You can actually reserve your own set of chopsticks if you are a regular.  Happy hour prices are reasonable with a great selection of sake.  Only Sakana has my favorite though.  They gave me moochi for my birthday, which I love! They take your picture, let you write something on your photo and put it on their wall when you walk it.  Pretty cool and fun experience.  The only thing I didn't like was the Spurs winning game 5 that day.  
On a side note, I accidently left my sunglasses there, didn't realize it for a couple days and they hung on to them until I was able to pick them up almost a week later.  That was a really spetacular thing they did."}
{"text":"sashimi salad. amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  We were actually kind of blown away with rude service.  Went there with my girlfriend and a friend of mine last night.  Everything seemed great.  They ordered drinks and the waiter (Young guy, glasses, presumably an owner's kid) asked for ID.  Totally normal.  After watching my friend struggle to remove his license from those lovely plastic wallet holders and present it to the waiter he replied \"why do people always have to take it out I just need to see it\".  I responded he could have mentioned that while watching my friend remove his ID in the first place, to which he argued back that \"all he asked was to see the ID\".  Okay.  He comes back finally to take order, looks at our order sheet, and was apparently disappointed when only one person ordered Sushi.  He looked at the order sheet, smirked, and said \"yeah, sushi restaurant right\" and walked away.  I live around the corner, and the interior is actually very nice.  However I will not return and will not recommend the place to anyone based on the service.  I felt completely unwelcome.  1 Star."}
{"text":"The food is great, service is at times slow, and the place has an older feel. Service will be slower when it's rush hour/busy. So far the sushi has been very good every time I've been here. It's true that when you first walk in there is a musty smell but once you go to your table you don't notice it at all. It's a mom and pop place and their wait staff is limited so be forewarned. On this particular visit, my partner and I arrived at 4:30pm when they first opened for their evening shift. We were seated promptly and our orders were taken right away. Our sushi boat arrived at our table about 20 mins later (I timed it) and we had complimentary miso soup as well as a seaweed salad prior to that. The sushi boat was worth the $45 because you get a lot of sushi (good for 3 people...we ended up with leftovers) and we spend a bit more than that when we order rolls or a la carte. We were even provided with a free complimentary order of edamame (not usual). Everything was delicious and both our server and a woman who is either the owner or manager stopped by to check on us. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Sushi San is the first sushi restaurant we've been to since moving out here from Connecticut and we were interested to see how it's done in a landlocked state. We decided to do the all you can eat option and the waitress informed us how it worked: you can't take home leftovers, it only encompassed certain rolls, good up to seven rolls each and we were good with all of that. 

The sushi wasn't anything to write home about but when the waitress asked us if we were finished and we said yes she kind of groaned at the sight of a few extra pieces of sushi left and then advised us that they charge $1 per piece that's left but she would give us a deal and only charge $5. What??? We had less than a roll left, rolls that are larger than I've ever seen except they're packed rather heavy on rice and short on fish. Some had about a fingernail's worth of actual non-rice mixture in it.  We didn't keep ordering food; we placed one order of six rolls and couldn't finish what we ordered. And we had to pay extra for not cleaning our plates.  Except the price per person encompassed seven rolls automatically (hence the limit) so despite the fact that the price included a charge for seven rolls per person and we only ordered 6 between the two of us and ate just over five we were still charged a penalty fee for not finishing our food.  I get it: waste not, want not but it usually helps to tell people UP FRONT that they charge extra for waste, not at the end when they're backed into the corner.  I should have smuggled the sushi to the bathroom in my purse and flushed it just based on principle.  I've never been charged arbitrary fees at a restaurant before.

On top of that the bill came and the all you can eat charge was $47.90 before taxes. So I asked about it and was told it's $2 or $3 more on the weekend. WHAT???  The signs they have out front all read $19.99 and the all you can eat option isn't priced on the menu, not to mention it's a vague amount more on the weekends, price to be charged at will.  There was absolutely no caveat mentioned for weekend pricing. What kind of restaurant has hidden fees?  So what we expected to be a $50 lunch turned into nearly $70 because my dumb self left only a 10% tip (I usually leave 20%) because the waitress was nice and attentive otherwise. 

On top of all of that we arrived home and I was immediately sick. What an awful, awful first Arizona sushi experience. Underhanded business practices, hidden fees and sushi that gets me sick? Never again at this place. Just an FYI I had the Murphy Roll, Apache Roll and Phoenix Roll. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Some of the best sushi I've had in the east valley, and it's right up the street from my house!"}
{"text":"This rating is for the delicious sushi and sashimi! As others have already mentioned, it tasted fresh, and the rice was cooked right (not soggy nor too dry). 

Hubby and I found Sushi San simply by driving around one Friday night, and went in at around 9:30. By the way, they're open til midnight. So that's good to know especially if you're hungry after getting off work late. 

There was just the two of us at that time. The service was prompt, and I can't speak to the service had there been a full room of guests. I read about the rude service but our experience was really good.

I loved the Small Sashimi plate, which consisted of about 20 cuts of fresh fish. We also ordered a few rolls and they were all delicious. Sorry I didn't jot down their names. I also didn't think to take pictures as I was exhausted and hungry and dealing with some things (I know I digress) related to our very ill guinea pig being hospitalized that night. 

I think they're well-worth giving a chance. This is a surprisingly good find in the area."}
{"text":"Great lunch special, two rolls, soup & salad for under $9. Can't beat that with a stick. Setting is pretty authentic looking. They have their own chopsticks for sale. I think you can leave them there for when you eat."}
{"text":"This Place is good. Will I come back, sure. Often? Probably not. I have a loyalty to Taiko. Sorry.  The service and food were good here but its a little pricey.  I love when places have a good deal.  I will give them another shot one of these days when I'm down for some all you can eat. As much as I would love to try their signature dishes I feel like I would burn through my wallet real fast.

Their deep fried rolls had something off about the taste not sure if it was the batter or what but it tasted different and not in a good way, but nothing I couldn't handle. Just off."}
{"text":"Freshest fish I've had in Arizona since I moved! Loved it! Service was great and super nice. First time there and won't be the last."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our wedding anniversary because we love sushi and our regular sushi restaurant disappointed us the last time we were there. But this place is amazing. The service is fantastic, the food is delicious and very reasonably priced, they have a great bar selection and there are specials on food for any time of the day. And I must mention how incredibly fresh everything was; the vegetables in the veggie tempura, the cucumber in the sushi rolls, and even the fruit they gave us for dessert. Sushi San will definitely be our new regular and I am confident they will not disappoint us!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! It's clean, service was super friendly, and food was good. Can't get any better than that! They have an all you can eat sushi deal going on. My boyfriend loves the sushi. I ordered the udon and it was delicious. Broth was fish based. Might be our new sushi place. Will come again."}
{"text":"SSSSSSSSSSSSSSsssssushi San is so Yummy! if your in the area check it out, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, and great tasting sushi!"}
{"text":"Holy Crap portion! Lol so if your a portion sushi eater, u been to authentic japanese place left angry and hungry, this place is more suited for u!  Chinese owned so I wouldn't say authentic japanese dishes but sushi is good sashimi special for 16$ it's a bag for the bucks! Wow portion ! Quality is okay actually , due to them being all u can eat menu I think turn around for fish is good.

Japanese warm dish is so so but omg their Chinese dish! So yummy ! And even the japanese dish like kAtsu portion is just unbelievable !  You won't leave here hungry ppl!  3 star japanese but 4 star for portion and chinese menu"}
{"text":"There is nothing about this place I don't love. The owners are such a wonderful family whom over the past 8 or 9 months that we have been coming here, I have come to just adore. Our favorite sushi place no doubt in Arizona. The 'I love Salmon' 'Mountain Roll' '911 Roll' are among the staples that I get there. Along with white yellow tail sashimi and of course various other pieces the fish is always fresh and the service is always friendly. They have all you can eat sushi specials plus a revolving bar now days. You can't go wrong here, best in the valley in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great service, extremely friendly staff. Good food, very fresh :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that a part of me wishes I did not come her for the All You Can Eat, because my score might have been a lot better.  However, AYCE is what I will rate this place on, and our experience was a dishonest disaster.  In a nutshell, an AYCE it is not.  Once we sat down and ordered it for $20 per person, we were informed that the AYCE is limited to 5! orders of nigiri per person and the rest can only be rolls.  Bad.  Next we were told that AYCE only included \"things in bold boxes\".  The selection was laughable - the only nigiri that counted was salmon, tuna, whitefish, crab, and smelt roe. Roll selection was slightly better.  Seriously?  We were informed for about 5 minutes about the \"rules\" they had - leave 1 piece of roll, pay $1, leave a kitchen item, pay 1/2 price, leave a nigiri rice, pay full price.  These \"rules\" are also all over the bar area.   By the time the fish was brought out, I was pretty annoyed.  It didn't help that the nigiri had the biggest pieces of rice and the smallest pieces of fish I had ever seen.  When I commented to the waitress that the AYCN was actually not AYCN, I got a lecture that their fish is so good that they have to limit it.  Funny.  I got the impression that the owners were extremely cheap and someone told them to do AYCE for marketing but they really, really, really don't want you to get it and if you do, they treat you like you are trying to steal from them.  A real pity, since the fish quality was quite good and they had some rare specials on the menu like abalone, blue fin, and monk fish liver.  So 1 star for tasty fish, 1 star for everything else.  If you are looking for AYCN for now, look elsewhere like Orient Sushi or Takamatsu within a 1-2 mile radius.  Hopefully the owners read some of these reviews of AYCE and change their ways or even get rid of the fake AYCE altogether."}
{"text":"I have been here twice already and each time the service and the food have been great! The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is very clean. Many, many, many menu options. Beautiful presentation of the sushi and they bring you fresh cut fruit for desert. They offer all you can eat sushi for $20 per person, and if you join the chopstick club you will receive 10% off on all your future visits. I will definitely be making this my regular sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend walked in at 11:10 pm and they told us they were closed. The sign on their door clearly states that they were open on Friday's until midnight. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok. Not great. The service however, was awful. Our waiter seemed annoyed to have to serve us. One of us ordered from the all you can eat menu, and the waiter was just rude about reading the rules. To make matters worse, when giving the order, he then asked \"are you sure you can eat all of that?\"  

I will never go back. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food and it can be quite difficult to find a good sushi place where the fish is very good and more importantly very fresh. 
However, everything here at Sushi San was delicious as well as fresh. My husband, my sister in law and I got the Sushi Boat and shared it. We got an assortment of sushi as well as rolls, which where all amazing.
I love the fact that it is a family business and the whole family is working there, they even offered us some rolls and tuna sushi (which was delicious by the way) 
It was my first time and I will definitely be back! It's nice to have a good sushi place in town."}
{"text":"You haven't had Sushi till you visit Sushi San (especially in AZ) and let Jane and Eric take care of you.
Best food, service and excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was the first sushi restaurant I have visited in years, and the very first one I've visited in Arizona.  The friend I went with said it was the best sushi restaurant in the east valley (some poll or other said so), thus we decided to take a stab at it.  And, to be honest, I mainly wanted to taste miso soup again (one of my favorite soups on the planet).

We walked in and it looked like any typical asian restaurant.  To one side was a long bar, where you can sit and eat, or sit and drink saki or beer.  To the other side was a long row of booths.  We decided to booth it up.  We sat down and shrugged... seemed fine so far.  The decor looked a little cheap, but the more hole-in-the-wall a place is, the more likely I will like it.

So, we both order a Japanese beer, take out the sushi list, and just go to town.  We order just about one of everything, including bowls of miso soup.  I was surprised that the sushi came out one at a time.  We'd dig into one, and once we were almost done and forming our opinions about it, another one would come out.  That was kinda fun.  Every kind we decided to get was exquisite, and reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in Minneapolis, Kikugawa (and believe you me - I've tried EVERY sushi restaurant in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metro area).

Not only was the sushi tasty but it was *beautiful*.  They must have really talented sushi chefs working for them, because it was wonderful.  This was also the first time I got \"deep fried\" sushi.  If you haven't tried it... DO IT!  We got a deep fried roll that had crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, and rice... wow.  Mind blown (can you tell I really love certain things??).

If I can find other friends who would like to go out to a sushi restaurant in the east valley, this restaurant will definitely be revisited by me!  (Plus, surprise, they gave us free dessert!  Yay watermelon!)"}
{"text":"Since we were down in Chandler, we decided to try to find a sushi restaurant. Looked at YELP and found this restaurant which was a couple of miles away and located on the way home.
When we first walked in, there was this musty odor that slowed my pace into the restaurant. My wife said it's coming from the carpet.
When we sat down, the server came over and took our order. I told him I wanted Chirashi and he gave me a quizzical look. So, I had to point to the item in the menu.
My wife  ordered a couple of sushi rolls. He brought us two bowls of miso soup which was okay.
It took a while for the entrées to come out 'cause there is only one sushi chef. When the food came out, I noticed that the raw fish was not cut in the traditional way. It was like strips of French fries, but the fish was fresh and the Chirashi was pleasantly different with a wide variety of ingredients.
The one thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't pickup the soup bowls and we had to ask for plates to put our sushi on. However, for a Japanese restaurant, the price is very reasonable. 
They also offered sliced oranges at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very fresh and well made sushi. I brought my entire family here and they were very polite and welcoming."}
{"text":"What a great place! Great service even better food!

Been to all the big name sushi places and this one is up there.

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi is really good and they've been giving us complementary soup, dumplings, and fruit for the past couple of visits.  The first couple of ties we tried Sushi Sam I was a little unsure, but I'm glad we continued to go. My honey LOVES their spicy chicken.  There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been pointed out by fellow yelpers.    One thing though......make sure that you ask for the Happy Hour menu.  The waitress won't mention it unless you specifically ask for it."}
{"text":"We had a party of five and ordered 2 sushi boats. SO worth it. We left full and happy. Make sure you try their salmon nigiri, it's their best."}
{"text":"This place sure is yummy. I was introduced here by a regular and was informed that I should be ready to eat some good sushi. My friend sure did not disappoint!
The place has a neat idea in which you \"buy\" a set of chopsticks and everytime you go in, you get a discount.
My memory isn't so great with all of the names on the menu but basically they have an AYCE menu which isn't too shabby. Eat like you've never eaten before!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and I will be going back!

Prices:
The prices for sushi rolls are anywhere between $3.45 - $13 I believe, which seems to be the price range for most Japanese restaurants nowadays. They have an ALL DAY happy hour sushi list for $3.45 and an all you can eat sushi for approx. $20/ person.
 
Service:
Their service was great! Each of us got a bowl of Miso soup, a complimentary bowl of edamame, and at the end of the meal we received a nice artisitc plate of fresh fruits. The waitress attentive and the food didn't take too long either.

Taste:
The fish was fresh and the sushi rolls were done nicely. No thick layer of rice and messy plating (for once I can taste the ingredients not just a huge lump of rice)....thank goodness!

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone, especially to those that enjoys a nice ambiance, delicious sushi, and great service."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's day.  The sushi rolls were excellent.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm really excited for this place. They're really close to my house, and they have really good sushi. Looks like they get some good specials in every once in awhile, as well. I came in for lunch one day and had a very tasty meal. They had anago on the specials board, but they were already out of it by the time I came in. Ah well- next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great wait staff. They are so attentive and the presentation of the rolls are so pretty. The fish is very fresh not dried out like some of the other places here in the valley."}
{"text":"This place has AYCE, it has happy hour, it has a free birthday special!! 
Awesome right? They have it advertised on a little sidewalk sign! Great!
Lets go in and see what these specials are all about :)
Place was empty, no joke there was one other table the whole time we were there, granted it was a monday night, but still, that is not good sign, still they have specials!!! 
So we stayed, We received a menu and the standard piece of paper to check what you want.

So I wondered where the AYCE menu was, or the happy hour info was, something that resembled the specials listed on the board! It wasn't my bday, so didn't look at that.
There were some \"instructions\" on a board behind the sushi bar about the bday thing, bring a guest and make a reservation... too complicated to try and figure out. 
Since I was hungry, I just ordered some nigiri sushi and one roll that was $12 called the crazy horse. This totaled to about 26 dlls... and I questioned my decision to eat here. Yes, I am being cheap, but I know a guy named Pancho not too far from here that has better sushi... and better prices and better music but with crappier service if you don't sit at the bar. 

Crazy Horse roll, you may have gone on the biggest looser challenge and won, because you looked a lot smaller than the picture on the menu and boy did you have a lot less types of fish inside of you. You did taste good, but I think you need an updated picture.

Service was friendly, but not fast. They gave us complimentary tempura veggies, which was a nice touch.  My son had their chicken fried rice, because he is a teenager, and well, you know, he is negative nancy lately. He didn't care for this dish, and even though he's a teenager, I can't blame him, it was gross.

Will I come back? Only if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"We came kinda late on a Sunday, this place is really great and the sushi was very fresh and so tasty! we were very happy with the service. From the miso soup to all the little things that were no charge. We were extremely happy. New favorite place to go!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food, dining in an un-rushed and comfortable atmosphere and owners that truly care about your experience, it's hard to beat Sushi-San. Not only are the rolls marvelous and their sashimi divine, but they also have a host of appetizers and side dishes that will knock your socks off. Love this place."}
{"text":"Pretty average sushi.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the mesa roll.  Friendly and fast service...I think it might be family-owned and operated.  I wasn't blown out of the water, but the food is decent and ill probably be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Server treated us like celebrities, bringing little extras to impress us throughout the meal. The sushi is great--served at the right temperature and tastes very fresh. Miso soup could use a little more tofu, but it's still great. Side salad's not my favorite, but I just have a thing against iceberg, so not their fault. ;) Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) is pretty good, and their edamame is fresh and bright."}
{"text":"If five pieces is all you can eat for 19.95 then you are good. However with a limited selection for all you can eat and a smaller section of rolls this is not what is advertised. $1 charge for left over pieces too. Must be a tough market."}
{"text":"This place is awesome best sushi around the Gilbert area, it is a bit pricey but they do have all you can eat sushi for $20! And they are really friendly ppl!"}
{"text":"It's definitely hole in the wall restaurant. I live nearby so I've seen the sign a few times. My fav was definitely the mountain roll. I love that they serve us watermelon after dinner...it's like cleaning our paletes. We didn't go during happy hour so it was a little pricey. The service was great. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This is my currently my favorite sushi place (and I've been to a lot of sushi places). The sushi rice is very flavorful, and the quality of their fish is top notch. Do yourself a favor and order some sushi pieces with salmon. The salmon is tender and just melts in your mouth!

Their all-you-can eat special over lunch time is also quite incredible. About half of their sushi menu is available, even some of the more expensive rolls! The all-you-can-eat price quickly pays for itself.

Some of my favorite items here:
- Salmon nigiri sushi pieces (with salmon that melts in your mouth)
- The Sushi San roll (like a rainbow roll with a citrus blast twist)
- The Lion King roll (a baked roll that simply has to be tried to be believed)
- The Mountain roll (a bed of California rolls with a big pile of various chunks of fish on top of it)
- special kizami wasabi (chopped/pickled wasabi)

If you want to be a \"VIP\" here, you can buy your own set of custom chopsticks, which they will keep in reserve just for you every time you visit!

One of my other favorite things about this place is the owners and how friendly and generous they are. They will often bring our table complimentary miso soup, tempura fried veggies, salted edamame, and fruit at the end of the meal, at no extra charge. Our group always appreciates that gesture, even when we are so full from sushi that we can hardly eat another bite."}
{"text":"Food is average, service is not great.
As soon as we ask about the \"all you can eat\" the waiter changed his behavior to the point that we almost got up and left.

It's almost like he did not want us to order the \"all you can eat\", and he started treating us like we are some sort of second class customer.

He's a deal, if you don't want to serve \"all you can eat\" don't put it in the menu!"}
{"text":"Do you wanna roll?  If you answered, yes, c'mon over and roll with Sushi San! 

Rolls go for about $10 and some of the better ones go for about $14. One thing I appreciate about this place is how fresh the fish tastes. My party of four ordered five rolls.

Notable Rolls included: 
Mountain Roll
Caterpillar Roll

Mountain Roll was one of my favorites since its sushi piled with raw tuna and salmon on top. Its spicy, its sweet, and the taste makes you want to come and eat more. 

I'd say any of the rolls do taste deelish. Next time, I'd opt for getting a sushi boat just to see how all the different ones tastes like! Service is nice, but be warned, sushi isn't cheap, but it is one of the better sushi places around the Phoenix area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant look small from outside but inside was pretty spacious. We tried some nigiri sushi, sashimi, rolls and fresh oysters. All the fish we ate were pretty fresh but Chef's knife skill wasn't up to par. He butchered the fish for our nigiri sushi. They were all different sizes,  thickness and shape. Taste was fine but did not look appetizing. Like any other typical sushi places in the Valley they specialize in rolls. Mountain roll we had was pretty good and very spicy the way I like it. Best of the evening was fresh oysters. They were fresh and tasty. We'll be back for the fresh oysters for sure."}
{"text":"Good sushi but the \"all you can eat\" option has draconian rules. If there's a single piece left on your plate it costs a dollar extra(1 for maki, 2 for sushi). They'll actually watch over you like a hawk to see you eat it. Their menu is confusing to where it can cost you far too much for what you get if you're not careful."}
{"text":"Since moving to Arizona, I have not found a Sushi place that compares to Sushi San. I absolutely love their service. I talk this place up like you will crap gold nuggets after eating! You will have to eat there to see if it is true :)
Sushi is fresh,  the service is beyond spectacular and friendly. If I do not eat here at least once a month, I crave it. Sushi San is the best place to eat!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place! The service was awesome and the sushi was delicious! We ordered take out and they threw in two miso soups and an extra california roll. This our new sushi place for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went here for Father's Day with my parents and it was delicious!!!! Sushi and seaweed salad and everything was so good! They have mochi ice cream too and iced matcha green tea!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!!! This family owned business is the best sushi joint I have even been to. They not only take care of their customers but if you are a regular customer and build a relationship with them they will give you house special for free like dumplings, wonton and or miso soup, squid salad for free, and sometime the occasional special rolls that normally cost $15 will be discounted to $10. They truly know how to make a customer feel like family."}
{"text":"Really delicious sushi. We were seated before a large party and our order took a little longer to arrive. We didn't mind but the waitress brought us a complimentary dessert for our troubles which was really sweet of her."}
{"text":"Normally I go to another Sushi place off of Gilbert but I saw this had such good reviews and I was nearby I thought I would try it out.  Overall I thought it was nice.  First off I will say that I wasn't that into the decor of the place.  It just didn't feel Japanese to me with the T shirts, TV, and Budweiser sign. Nonetheless the people who work here make up for that quickly with great service.  The menu was a little strange to read because it's not really a lunch menu, and it's a little hard to read.  I had read about the spicy sashimi salad on here so I asked about it and sure enough you could order it but it's not easy to find on the menu.  Anyway I ordered the Green tea which was really good and I highly recommend it.  It's very much like what you get in Japan.  The miso soup which is complementary is also really good even with the tiny amount of tofu, it just tasted very flavorful.  The salad itself was very good and filling and the sushi chef was nice to ask if I like scallops which I do and so he included that in the dish.  What was unique about the salad was the fish are coated in a spicy sauce that has no mayo in it (thanks) and it's quite spicy (thanks).  There wasn't a lot of greens but that was made up with a lot of fish on top.  It was probably the largest amount of fish I've had ever had on a sushi salad.  Some of the fish was better than others but it all tasted good.  One minor complaint was the fish was quite cold like it had been refrigerated and I thought the fish would have tasted better more room temp. I also got rice and I thought it was a little dry for my taste, but otherwise a great place to try and very reasonably priced for the quality here. Note this place sits in a kind of lonely shopping center with many vacancies so typical of AZ so no problem with the parking or getting a seat if you just show up:)"}
{"text":"Came here last night based on the Yelp reviews and upon arrival, it looked promising at first glance. The restaurant was clean, staff was friendly, and it was nearly a full house. We grabbed a seat at the sushi bar. Took a few minutes for us to get menus and our drink orders taken but nothing to get worked up about. They had roll specials on the conveyor belt but we opted to order off of the menu. We ordered the following:

1. Tuna jalapeño poppers: although the batter was light on these, it was a bit rubbery, wasn't hot when it came out, and was a bit bland.
2. Hamachi Kama: was cooked a solid 10 minutes to long and was super tough by the time it hit our table. The ponzu that came with it was also watered down and too acidic and no daikon?
3. McQueen roll - fish seemed fresh enough but the roll was bland
4. Spicy scallop gunkan (sushi)- surprisingly fresh and tasty!! The rice had a nice chew and the nori stayed crispy! Would order this again.
5. Salmon skin hand roll-generous hand roll, fish was fresh, and again, pleased with the texture of the rice and nori!!

The service and food was slow but the wait staff was friendly. Not sure if I would come back again but maybe in a pinch we will!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and both visits have been great. The first time I brought my whole family (4 adults, 2 kids and 1 baby). All the food was yummy, except I wasn't a big fan of the curry, but bland for me so depends on your taste.

The second time I ordered take out and they threw in an extra order of Cali rolls for free! I LOVE the baked Scallop Cali roll. The keiten (revolving sushi) section is kind of small so be prepared if you're looking for that. Otherwise, cute little find!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I eat here at least once a week. Beef yakisoba, short ribs, mountain roll, are just some of our faves."}
{"text":"Nice looking place and staff were friendly. We had 3 rolls and some nigiri. Fish seemed fresh, but the seaweed they use is the most powerful tasting I've ever eaten. It over powered the overall flavor which is why the low rating. All 3 rolls we ordered all had a sweetness for some reason. My wife and I love spicy, and all 3 rolls were supposed to be spicy. We won't go back, but you may like it."}
{"text":"Sushi San is a small Japanese restaurant located at the same plaza as Restoran Malaysia.

Sushi San is decorated in the theme of traditional sushi bar with wooden chairs and tables. It has seatings for around 25 people.

I was there for lunch. This place is close to a high school that's why there are a lot of younger people eating here during lunch time. I don't blame them. Where can you get a good decent meal for $5.99 that includes soup, salad and chicken/beef teriyaki with rice? and you are served with free hot green tea?

The lunch specials: Perfect Lunch for $5.99 and Premium Lunch for $7.99 which all comes with soup and salad. I ordered the sushi combo lunch that includes 6 pieces ofr sushi and 6 pieces of California rolls. The sushi were all freshly made. The portion of rice to fish is really good too. I love the black seasame on my California rolls..

The good thing about eating lunch here is they have a loyality program of buying 5 lunches you will get 1 free! I was given one of those stamp cards to keep track of my eating.. This gives me incentive to come and eat again!

BTW, Sushi San also has daily specials for $3.99! 

As with places with a lot of young people, Sushi San does get noisy during lunch time, so come in a little later if you want a quiet lunch.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Really good Sushi!  I went for lunch, and was happy that it was a very chill vibe in the place.  They have a very long sushi bar, and plenty of booths and tables.  It was a lot bigger than I expected.

The menu had a lot of variety.  I liked that they had tamago.  I had that with smoked salmon nigiri, and a spicy yellowtail roll.  Probably one of the best spicy yellowtail rolls I've had.  The tamago was a tad dry, and I think I prefer Sushiya's, but I'm always happy to see it on a menu.

The waiter also brought out some miso soup and a salad for me while I waited.  The salad could have used some kind of dressing.  Maybe they forgot, but either way it was a nice thought.

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"environment is not very good since it's in food court, but I think the sushi is ok, except for a little expensive"}
{"text":"Food= 100% Service =100% my favorite spot whenever I am craving Sushi or Sake, Eric is amazing at rolling sushi, the quality of the food is perfect and the quantity is very generous for its price. They take care of you as if you have been family for years and the fruits at the end of each meal is a great compliment to the great meal served."}
{"text":"First food smells good and taste good....customer service here....HORRIBLE. like we came and it was empty like you'd they would be happy to get some business but the male kid with glasses??? Rude AF! I honestly can say for the first time I wanted to just grab him and slam him from the negative attitude he had. Last time here just because of him!!!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Nicest server ever, Jun!   Great sushi. The December roll was our favorite so far...and we will be back.  The atmosphere was perfect for what we wanted tonight. Drink specials were awesome....."}
{"text":"Sushiiiiiii!!!! =)

So I've been to this Sushi place maybe twice now. Came here yesterday because my friend was craving Sushi. Both times I've been there it's been a pretty quiet night. Not really busy at all.

I thought the service was really slow, especially since we were the only ones there. Plus the Sushi was also a bit pricey for my taste. Especially since it wasn't the best Sushi I've ever had. We spent almost $70 for the 5-6 rolls that we got! I got the Philly roll which was good as well as the Baked Scallop California roll. I loveeeee baked scallop so I had to try it out. I thought the rolls were a bit over priced for mediocre Sushi. Although, they do have a happy hour menu. We didn't really see anything that caught our attention though. BUT they do have specials on beer and Sake if that floats your boat. =) Also, they have all you can eat Sushi for $19.95. 

On a brighter note, we got pot stickers and watermelon on the house since it took a while for us to get our order of Sushi. Another plus was that it was down the street from my house. Which is always good in my book. =)"}
{"text":"Split a sushi boat with 3 others. Good variety and quality for the price. For $45, you get 4 full rolls (cali, shrimp tempura, las vegas, and spicy tuna) and an assortment of sashimi. We originally came here to try out the AYCE but our lack of appetites and the limited choices of the AYCE changed our minds. I like the ambiance and the big wipes they provide. I wasn't in love with the TV programming.  Cartoon network has super weird stuff nowadays

They provided free miso soup before the meal and watermelon afterward!"}
{"text":"We love it so much we go there almost every weekend.  They are super friendly and the sushi is so good!  They always give us something for free, usually miso soup and watermelon, sometimes dumplings or an extra roll as well."}
{"text":"Good not great. I choose the all you can eat.  Great deal but when you go that route they make the pieces very large with a ton of  rice to fill you up.  Big Thick slices of fish , and rice overstuffed hand rolls are not the makings of tasty sushi.

 Also, I felt like I was being watched over like a hawk and anytime I ordered more sushi I felt like they were upset.  Wow you eat more? was one comment I heard them say to me.  I'm a big guy (6'4 \") and can eat my fair share but I assure you I didn't eat that much that  they should have been giving me the evil eye. 

Overall if you want cheap prices and average quality this place fits the bill.  If you can afford to pay for quality go elsewhere."}

{"text":"We ended up here just before close. The food was amazing and the service just as great. Their sushi was perfect. They even brought out miso soup, edamame and an artistically cut orange. We have definitely found a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Disgusting place !!
I was craving sushi and all the reviews were pretty good so I gave it a try.
The whole place smelled so freaking bad !!!  I was gagging half of the time .
Our waitress seated us then disappeared for 25 mins . 
My sushi was crap. The rolls all fell apart . They tasted horrible . Nothing tasted fresh . 
After my first roll I got this horrible pain in my stomach and I just stopped eating . 
Horrible experience . I ordered 5 different rolls . I tasted  each one . 
The fish is definitely not fresh here people . I do not know what the awful odor in the restaurant was but it was very bad . Bad food . Bad smell . Bad service .. if your looking for a good sushi place scratch this place off the list"}
{"text":"For some reason most of the sushi places in gilbert close for a couple hours in the afternoon, not sure why. Since we didn't know about this quirk of Gilberts we tried two places before ending up here. I even double checked their archaic website to make sure they were open. They haven't bothered to update their hours though so they were closed when we arrived but opened 15minutes later, so we decided to stick around. 

We were given drinks and menus by the kid who sat us and then we didn't see a waitress for at least 15 minutes. We decided to go with the all you can eat option even though it only has rolls (no appetizers/desserts) and doesn't include their \"specialty rolls.\"  We ordered a rainbow roll, a salmon roll, a shrimp tempura roll and a las vegas roll. It was another 20 minutes before we got our food (we almost left, clearly we should have), meanwhile a couple that had come in a few minutes after us had gotten all their food was getting ready to leave. 

Both the raw rolls were WARM, and frankly disgusting! We couldn't finish either of them. The fried rolls were decent, the tempura shrimp was overcooked. After they'd given us our rolls another waitress pops up and asks if we were given our miso, which we hadn't been, of course. So we got that partway through our meal. Then the waitress just disappears again and there's no one around that we can flag down for refills.  Their Soy sauce is nasty, it's strangely sweet and very watery, we're actually curious if they didn't accidentally put in some other sauce. We've never tasted any soy sauce that's remotely similar to that. 

When our dour faced waitress finally showed up again we explained how the raw rolls were gross and asked if we could instead be charged for the rolls separately instead of the all you can eat (saying we'd pay for the bad rolls as well), since after that crap we really weren't in the mood for more sushi and hadn't ordered nearly $40 worth of food. She very rudely refused to do that, and told us we'd have to pay for the rolls we didn't eat regardless of whether we liked them or not. We also asked for refills (our first in the hour+ we'd been stuck there) and she actually had the nerve to say \"half glass?\" Total cheapskates.

In my annoyance as she was walking away I said \"1 star\" quite a bit more loudly than I had intended. Which she obviously heard because she came back (smiling for the first time) and said since we were new customers they wouldn't charge us for the uneaten rolls. She then proceeded to rave about the watermelon slices, like those alone could give them a good review. They were, however, delicious and because my hubby's allergic I got to eat all 6 slices! lol I really can't give them credit for good watermelon though.

We definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona! They are not cheap with the sushi pieces and everything is very flavorful. We had the all u can eat for $24 and it was so worth it!!! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Yum! Went there today for the first time for lunch.  We ordered a few different rolls and some seaweed salad and 
everything was soooo good. 

The all you can eat deal is a really good deal, will be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday. It was pretty good! The fish was tasty and it was a nice atmosphere. Looks like a nice place to go with a group to watch a game and have some drinks too!  I didn't have sashimi on this trip but I will be back to try!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  We were the ONLY people in the place at a normally rush our lunch time.  That made me a bit concerned.  It didnt seem like their air was really working luckily they had fans and it was cool inside still.  I also heard a DOG in the back by kitchen which was a bit concerning.  We almost left but decided to give it a try.  The ASU roll is what I ordered and it was pretty tasty.  Not sure if I will be back."}
