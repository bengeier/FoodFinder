{"text":"Recommend General Tso and sushi. Best in the 'burg! Great service, nice atmosphere. A must try!"}
{"text":"I liked this place much better when it was John's and before that Pho Kim. We will not be back. I had a bento box which was so bad I should have sent it back. The sushi was no better then Giant Eagle sushi. The General Tso chicken was okay as was the tofu General Tso but only so so. The pot of green tea had a bad taste too. Don't know how that could have been messed up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for their milk bubble tea & iced coffee from their juice bar. Incredibly gracious owners/employees. Will be back for food when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that this restaurant has closed.  I wish the former owners well.   From the banner on the deck, It looks like it will now be converted into a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Service and food was great.  We opted for some of Vietnamese dishes - the summer rolls were great, with the authentic tastes and ingredients we often don't find nearby.  Our other favorite was the bubble tea.  Perfectly executed and a relief on a hot summer day.  We went for lunch on a Saturday, and it was quiet, but the ingredients were fresh and flavors spot-on."}
{"text":"Food is meh. Staff is lovely, attentive, and actually care very personally about their customers.
Food gets 3 stars, but the staff deserve 10."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly family running this place.  

The food is pan-Asian with an American taste profile.  Therefore, everyone you bring here will find something they will like.  LBB features a great selection of the most popular Asian foods South Hills peeps like to eat, including some creative sushi-roll options so you can get your craving for Asian - with anyone (not just your food snob friends)

The more approachable and pan-cultural menu Laughing Buddha Bar offers enables me to enjoy Asian food with my family more often since our family of four has become \"country specific\" with our Asian food.  I am more Vietnamese/Thai,  my husband is more Am/Chinese and my kids thrive on Japanese cuisine, so we can all be accommodated without any arguments.  I really like the the family that runs this place.  I don't know them personally, but you can feel the happiness they extend to everyone.  

The Chef's specials do use the extremely spicy little red peppers and are worth a try.  My husband enjoyed the salt and pepper calamari.  I was able to steal several of the nice, small, expertly sliced Vietnames peppers for my beef salad, which I prefer to the Jalapenos."}
{"text":"We really did luck out when searching for a restaurant, not a chain, in the South hills. Little Buddah Bar....a little gem! Such happy wait staff. Interesting ambience. Great menu. And...wait for it.....wait for it...bubble tea! There were 6 of us for lunch. They have a wide variety of lunch choices from various Asian destinations, we had salt & pepper tofu (my favorite, but wasn't my ordered dish). Chicken -n- broccoli, Thai curry chicken, sushi rolls, and Thai basil curry. We really liked everything.. The sushi was basic and good. The Thai curry and basil curry were very similar. The differences pointed to a few different vegetables and the basil seemed less spicy. Good size portions! 
And, something I have not seen in any other restaurant...a smoking Dragon circling the dining area. Yes, you read that right. Oh a,d 4 of us had bubble tea. It was more expensive than most bubble tea stops but very good. All-in-all a great experience...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised. Excellent sushi, interesting decor, and friendly service make this an easy 5 stars! Possibly the best sushi in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my daughter & it was very good! It's a mix of Asain food, but mostly Japanese & Chinese. There was pho and some Thai dishes though. I got a bento box with chicken & broccoli, and my daughter had crispy dumplings (appetizer). It was a bit pricey, but it really was a TON of food, and everything was very, very tasty. Choice of soup (I had the best egg drop soup I've ever had) 2 crab rangoon, 2 crispy dumplings, salad, 8 good-sized pieces of California roll, and my main dish. I wish there would be better-priced lunch specials, but it was very, very good."}
{"text":"This place has earned my new favorite sushi spot. It is fresh and creative. They also will try to accommodate what you like. The owner is wonderful, very hospitable. I am happy I live close to this new gem. Also, BYOB."}
{"text":"Food is incredible and the service is phenomenal! The staff is very attentive. We had them select our entire course and every single item was delicious! The Vietnamese ice coffee is definitely #1 that I've ever had. Spotlessly clean, presentation is photo ready always!"}
{"text":"Tried several different items and they were all very flavourful! Staff was attentive anf friendly. More expensive than other Asian places but the flavor and large portions were worth it! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with an amazing cover deck. My wife and I have eaten here twice. The first time service was super slow. I don't even remember what I ate as I was distracted by the slow service. 

We gave it a second chance and it was so good today. They made up on the service. Our waitress was on top of it and the sushi we ordered came out fast. 
We ordered the Lady In Red Roll. Very good, with a slight perfect touch of spice. The Philly Roll had a great smoked Salmon on it. It added a nice touch to the roll. Seaweed salad was great. I thought about getting a second one. 
I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good theme. The hot and sour soup was the only thing I liked. Won't visit again! The sushi was unusually big. Had a headache eating it."}
{"text":"The food was great the service was Excellent, I just found my new favorite restrain!
  The portions where very generous!"}
{"text":"The Laughing Buddha Bar is fairly new to South Hills, replacing John's but just because they're new - don't let that scare you. They have remolded the interior, giving it a fresh new look. They also replaced the menu with new and delicious items. I had the General Tso's chicken and wonton soup - both were delicious. I would definitely recommend you check this place out!"}
