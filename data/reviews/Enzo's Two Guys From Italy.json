{"text":"Overpriced, nothing special, still looking for a decent pizza joint in the area. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was not. The pizza was the same quality as any fast food joint I.e pizza pizza except with a higher price tag. I am disappointed. I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday night. It wasn't too busy. It was quiet and the ambience is very cute. The temperature of the dining room was really hot. A few of the people I was with also felt hot.  The bruschetta was amazing! I also tried the shrimp and scallop fettucine alfredo. It was just okay. It lacked something.. maybe seasoning. It was just too plain. The best thing I tried was the deep dish pizza! Everyone at my table who had it also agreed it was amazing. The bread is really good so even those who are not crust fans, you will be when you try this.  Prices are decent. The appetizers came out quickly. However our main dishes took some time. I was in a group of 10.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"went there for lunch, tried their pizza, even it was not as good as Chicago, they are pretty decent. Will come back try other dishes."}
{"text":"I had the deep dish pizza with spicy sausage bacon and oignons. My wife had the chicken parmesan. Both dishes were a bit disappointing. My pizza had the same sort of toppings that I would get from dominos. Nothing special there. The pizza tasted very doughy. For a deep dish was expecting more toppings. My wife's chicken tasted a bit overdone. Quite average really.  I had a Caesar salad to start which was good. My wife liked her French oignon soup. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Enzo's has been always my favorite place in streetsville. Staff are always friendly and food are always delicious. We walked in on last Wednesday and realized they had promo - half price on Pizza. Ordered the pepperoni pizza and the seafood pasta, so good. The medium pizza is like a large pizza somewhere else, two of us have to pack half of the pizza to go. Enzo, we will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Now this is a hidden gem if I ever saw one!  I don't recall seeing this place advertised before but when I found out about it I had to go!  The deep dish pizza is phenomenal, not too much dough or cheese, but plenty of fresh toppings.  The pasta was also delicious, definitely a place I will be visiting more often!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  The restaurant decor is old school and a bit tired but what it lacks in atmosphere it makes up for in service and great food.  Charlie has been here for years and is an excellent waiter.  Always attentive and friendly.  The food is authentic, homemade and delicious.  The  Caesar salad is fresh & light but not too garlicky.  For the first time, tonight, I tried the French Onion Soup and I was pleasantly surprised...soooooo good.  If you're looking for good food, a casual atmosphere and great prices, look no further.  There's a reason this place has been around for over 30 years."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Mississauga for Deep Dish Pizza. Great taste and presentation. Will be back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good....pizza and panzos are a sure win with my family.   I typically get their salad with house greens and grilled chicken because I was dieting for almost a year due to fitness competitions I was involved in.  Service is pretty good as well.   Ambiance is as retro as it can get!  Super old school looking place with consistently good eats:)"}
{"text":"When I first walked in I thought I'd found my go-to cozy neighbourhood restaurant. But this place was such a disappointment. Mostly because of our server. He was rude, cold, flippant, snarky. The food wasn't much better though. The tomato sauce was perhaps from a can and just tasteless. No bread is served with the meal which is unusual for an Italian restaurant. There weren't many people there when we were there but we couldn't have the empty table we asked for, even though we called ahead and made a reservation, instead were seated at some half booth/half table, while the booth we asked for sat empty, the whole time we were there. Was still empty when we were leaving. The prices are a bit high and in general the entrees could be described as 'no frills', nothing special. Pizza was just ok. The veal wasn't bad, but expensive for the little amount of food on the plate. There are so many other nice Italian restaurants around. Won't waste our time or money returning."}
{"text":"Food: So far I've only tried the deep dish pizza.  I would like to explore the menu...but it's just so darn good.  I'm a pizza lover.  I'll eat the crappy $5 mediums, and I savour the artisanal authentics like Goodfellas or the creatives like Mickey's.  Enzo's deep dish is something I've yearned for.  The homemade dough and tomato sauce are too good.  If you like bread, you'll love this crust.  I don't know if they're just keeping it simple or doing something different, but I don't crave any other pizza now.  I've tried it with pepperoni, mushroom and spicy sausage.  Ambience: The place is divided in two sections: the dining area and the bar.  The dining area is very warm and charming with it's original 1980's style.  Being 33 years old, the bar area is closed off by a glass wall for the old smoking days, but thank god they've kept it that way.  The bar was a bit day and night from the dining area.  It was mostly much older drunk regulars babbling generic Toronto sports chatter.  Otherwise I love the look.  The dining area is much quieter, with nice music and candlelights.  Service:  The owners have served me each time and they're friendly down to earth people.  You feel like you're at your uncle's local eatery."}
{"text":"Charlie was a great server and made great recommendations. We ordered the deep dish pizza and it was excellent.  The other items on the menu looked amazing.  We also had a Caesar salad which was excellent. Would definitely return here."}
{"text":"It was very good. But it's no Chicago's authentic deep dish.  Nice quiet place, perfect for date nights."}
{"text":"If you love fresh homemade style pizza, this is a great place in Streetsville. Yes they have a  full italian menu but I come here for their pizza. It's probably their best menu item and its a refreshing change from all the chain pizza stores in this area. Has been around for years and I seldom see them advertising as they have a large loyal clientele. They also have a stocked bar as well as some draft beers on tap.  There are a couple of italian restaurants in Streetsville, but if you are craving a fresh flavourful pizza, this is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Charlie has been serving us here for years. Hard to find as it's tucked in a plaza in an otherwise foot traffic area. Prices are decent and offers the full Italian menu. Caesar is the best as is the pizza which is a refreshing change from usual take out pizza. Worth the drive to Streetsville."}
{"text":"Really rude waitress. Garlic cheese bread was greasy. Alfredo sauce was thin, runny, sweet, and disgusting.  The spaghetti was bland, tasted like Ragu or Prego or something out of a jar. I complained about the alfredo, but I was told it was not that it was not good, it was my personal taste.  Never again."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid, and I totally understand why. Service is amazing, the dining area is really nice, and the food is phenomenal! Dining room in the candlelight is super beautiful as well - would definitely recommend this little Streetsville gem!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I didn't know what to eat so we went on Yelp to check find something to eat. I guess he chose Italian and this place had good reviews and deep dish pizza so picked this. Enzo's beside a convenience shop in this large plaza in Streetsville so finding parking is no issue here. The restaurant is fairly big but very outdated in style. We came on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy but it took us a while to get seated.   We sorta knew what we wanted to get looking on the menu online before arriving. We ordered: french onion soup, deep dish pizza + 2 toppings (additional $) and a grilled chicken Caesar salad.   French onion soup: large portion, flavourful, more on the salty side, cheese was hella thick. Was good after a while, the salt and cheese got overwhelming so I didn't finish this.  Chicken caesar salad: huge portion but nothing too special for this.  Deep dish pizza: you pick a size and each additional topping costs $1.30 or 1.70 depending on what size you order. I did not like this at all. The cheese was like the cheese in the french onion soup so it was super thick on the pizza. I've had deep dish pizza in Chicago and the stuffing was full of meat and sauce. This did not have any of that. It was like a pie with no stuffing lol.   3* for food. 4* for service."}
