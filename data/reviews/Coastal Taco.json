{"text":"Decided to try this place last Sunday. We had a 1-1.5 hour wait, however it was absolutely beautiful outside and the environment was great. The restaurant patio is nice and it was perfect to sit with a margarita and enjoy the sun. I would not go to this place on a rainy or cloudy day however. The food was subpar. I enjoyed 1 of my 2 tacos, and the tacos are pretty tiny along with the serving of guacamole. That aside, they have happy hour everyday 3-6 (not sure of exact time), and around 4:30 that day they were out of 3/5 happy hour drinks. All in all, you are paying for a fantastic view. I would recommend this place for happy hour and an afternoon or evening to enjoy a margarita in the sun."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and concept. Loved the decor and theme of the restaurant and the food was good. You MUST try the desert - the fried ice cream was absolutely incredible! I ate there during a work trip to the RNC, over a month ago, and just remembered that I never wrote a review. The service was good."}
{"text":"fun place. went there with a friend who was home from college for drinks. sadly, 2 long islands were 24 dollars! Small plastic cups! Stick to beer and avoid this place for drinks"}
{"text":"I would've given this restaurant 5 stars but I had to take away 2.  Here is the great thing about them............their TACOS! I learned there is a difference in the way Americans eat tacos in comparison to Mexican tacos and trust me that was a surprise and an education that was delicious. Their chips were homemade and fresh and with the cheese they served it was different but tasty. I had a hamburger and it was not bad. I love cheddar cheese and there was no cheddar in the place to be had so that was a disappointment for me. I only want cheddar on my burger.  Here's where they went wrong. I had a server who kept getting our orders wrong even though they hand you a sheet of paper with selections and you must check them off. It was maddening how ALL of us kept telling her we didn't get what we ordered! I never did receive the dip I wanted (my friend let me share hers) but by the time she finally realize TWO people ordered the cheese dip it was time for us to go and I wasn't sending her back yet AGAIN. She did not refill our drinks until I sent someone to fetch her to tell her we needed water and more of the drinks we ordered. Being our first time there, we had no idea it was a family style type of service and we had not a clue which taco was which and it was soooo freaking confusing! They even put the chips I ordered on the plate of another person order of beans. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSE TO KNOW THIS???   AFTER THAT HONEST EXPERIENCE SHARING, I want to tell you it is located on the east bank of the flats in Cleveland on the water with a nice view. Their whole theme is coastal so it was the appropriate place and the outdoor patio was enjoyable. It was cute and fun to see an outdoor table tennis set up (or ping pong) and a giant lawn chess set ready for players. They have good to GREAT food, they have a restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside and a fireplace, they have the great location but their confusing service and their family style taco thing is what took them down. All in all I WOULD RETURN once more and this is what i will change. NEVER have that particular server, talk to them about letting us know whose taco is whose because I want my own chips and dip over to the side. I strongly suggest that they should ask to see if you are a newbie, and if so, the server should explain it is family style before you are on a fishing expedition of which one is my taco?! We were there this past Saturday 17 2016 for a late lunch around 2:30 on a Cleveland foodie tour that my friends and I will have every month in the city of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. My wife and I have been coming here since they opened in May when we travel to Cleveland and would never miss the opportunity to grab some of their tacos. They are the best and reasonably priced. I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area of traveling to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday get together . Trendy location , nice views , architecture was very well designed . Our waitress checked on us (table of 9) approx 2 times in our 2 hour stay . We ordered a carafe of margaritas and when it arrived it was enough for about two 8 ounces margaritas , they tasted like garbage , had flies in it , and they wanted to charge us $49.00 ..... Absolute disgrace . The waitress told us the tacos were about 3-4 bites .... Maybe for a new born baby . They're little 1/4 size tacos that cost $3 a piece(bowl looked better). The guac was fabulous . Took us 20 minutes to get our check and another 15 to pay it and they would only split it equally 9 ways. I'm someone who rarely writes reviews . This place is a joke , staff walks around with no sense of urgency . And whoever would charge $49 for two well tequila margaritas should be forced to close. Damn shame. Go next door to the beer place or punch bowl ."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but music was very strange. Please hire a DJ that plays normal, relaxing music for a Sunday afternoon (AKA not stressful and nauseating club music/techno). A better option would probably be anything other than techno or club music. Even overplayed top 40 would be better.   The beautiful scenery could use a companion of relaxing music."}
{"text":"The setting is the best thing about this place, next the service, very attentive, the tacos, well guess I'm just not used to such small ones. They are small!  Husband got a steak bowl, I tried it, all I could tast was black beans.  Not anxious to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this spot if you're looking to get drinks on a patio with a beautiful view of the river. The atmosphere is amazing, especially for happy hour. The food on the other hand is a little underwhelming. I feel that it didn't have much flavor to it and the portion size was rather small. Hopefully they will improve their food quality because it possesses a lot of potential with its scenery and patio."}
{"text":"Coastal Taco is one of my favorite places to dine and chill. We always have a great time. I just love it! The service is great."}
{"text":"Call it Crappy Taco. That pretty much sums up the experience you are going to get.   Unlike others, I actually thought the tacos were pretty good. But on this busy Sunday, everything else was unpleasant. Other than the view, there is absolutely no reason to visit this place, unless you have a fetish for outdoor Jenga and lousy service. And you can find views just as good as this in Cleveland where your experience will actually be pleasurable.  This was our second time visiting here, and both times were unpleasant. On this visit:  1. The outdoor hostess greeted us with contempt. She may as well have said, \"Oh. You.\" when she took our name. A smile and a hello seemed a foreign concept to her.  2. Since there was a wait, we sat at the bar. We may as well have been ghosts. The bartender looked past us three times while he waited on other patrons who it seemed were his old pals from high school. Finally, another bartender came and helped. Good, right? Wrong...  3.  I got the house margarita, and I think it may have been the only time in my life that I sent a drink back. It was like drinking salted lime water. I had both my wife and friend taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy, but they concurred: It was nothing short of awful.   4.  Our server was kind, but she seemed to really be struggling. I am not sure if this was her fault or the inept and unfriendly bar, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our drinks. In fact, our appetizers came out before our drinks! And when the apps did arrive, we were missing our guacamole. In fact, our main entrees arrived before our guacamole...which arrived before we had more chips with which to eat them. And so on...  Nothing is all bad. The tacos were actually pretty tasty. Paying our bill was quick. But I found the whole experience condescending. What I mean by that is that Coastal Taco seems to exist on the premise that, because of their prime riverfront location, the employees don't have to do anything other than show up and act surly, as if we should be thrilled that we graced them with our presence. No, that is not the way it is supposed to work.  Given the embarrassment of riches when it comes to Cleveland's dining scene, we deserve and should expect better."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer service. Proceeded to tell my aunt and uncle that they only had a 35 min wait, after 1 hr still not seated then proceeds to tell them another 40 mins! The manager didn't offer anything for the inconvenience and they ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I had awful service my first time here, which was during their first two weeks of being open. I decided to give them another chance today, but somehow the service got worse. We sat at our table for 25 minutes and no one came to take our orders so we eventually had to ask for a waiter. The tacos are still extremely small. The only thing they have going for them is their location. If you want tacos, go to Barrio. Much better service and food than Coastal Taco."}
{"text":"Visited Tuesday evening, 10 minutes for a table inside, longer wait for outside (next time).  The atmosphere is great, great location; Margaritas tasty as were their starters.  We enjoyed the salsa sampler and the poblano/goat cheese guacamole and plantain and malanga chips.   Their tacos...not so much.  We tried 5 different options and they all lacked flavor - nothing about the tacos would have us craving them again.  We would go back for drinks, apps and atmosphere.  Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"You cant survive on a good location alone.  twenty minute wait for a table and yet there are 20 plus tables empty.  I get trying to create the image of demand, but the place is wide open and we have eyes.  Sat at the bar for a little, got the cheese and chorizo fundido.  That was tasty, but the 3 chips that came with it were less than half of what it needed.  The bar wasn't super busy, but the bartenders certainly were challenged to serve us and again we were sitting at the bar.  Wish I would have had the chance to order more food, but I didn't have the patience to keep asking for service, because they seemed so bothered when I would.  At least I can say I was there once."}
{"text":"So disappointing.  Very cool place with a great patio.  However the service is horrible and the food is not much better.  On top of that they were out of half of the beers on the menu and the mixed drinks remind me of the poorly made, overly sweet drinks one would find in a college bar."}
{"text":"I had been to Coastal Taco several times to enjoy drinks and the patio atmosphere on the water, which were both excellent.  However, I had been hesitant to try the food because I had heard several bad reviews from friends.    I went back on Saturday and decided to give the taco's a try.  They were fantastic.  I got the steak, pork and chicken and they were all very good.  I was a little curious as to why I had heard bad things so I asked the waitress.  She mentioned that they had had similar feedback on their \"take\" on taco's.  She said their chef decided to completely revamp the menu and their taco's.    I am definitely glad I asked and that I decided to try them for myself.  Now not only will you get great drinks and a great atmosphere, but it will also be one of my favorite places to eat on the East Bank."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Not great for easy tacos. The waiter had absolutely no interest in entertaining a 4-person bachelorette party (a good looking one at that!). He was easy on the eyes, though. They also ran out of portobello mushrooms and their sub was tomatoes... pretty unimpressive for a vegetarian. The Cavo was great! Will be back for free drinks from single men."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  The food was nothing special.  We didn't care for any of the seafood tacos that we ordered, guac was good but you get about a half of an avocado worth, steak and pork tacos were ok.   I did love the hot sauce on the table, It was probably the best item we tried.  The place is beautiful and a nice location, but that is what you are paying for.  There are too many other good taco places around to consider coming back here.  The service was not very good.  Food was over priced for what it was.  I would rather go to Bold food and drink across the street or Crop Rocks.  I'm glad I tried it but I probably would not go back.  Cleveland has a great food scene, this place doesn't keep up."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were great. Steak were average at best. Margaritas were good. After dinner I went to the outdoor deck on the water and I had asked the waitress if I can smoke out there and she said yes. Then security made me put out my cigar. Get your employees on the same page. Waste of money. Waste of a good cigar. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The street corn was delicious.  The tacos were underwhelming- tiny and lacking flavor.  Staff seems unorganized.  You order by marking your selections on a paper menu, yet the server came back to ask me what I ordered because he threw away the paper after putting in our order, but did not put in my drink order.  Overall long wait for our server to get to us for anything.   Not worth going out of your way to try this place."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks with 4 others on Sat pm 7/30. Worst bar service in Cleveland. So many bartenders but yet so slow and fumbling around. At one point the bartender asked me what I wanted I said 5 Jamesons ( they didn't have Fireball..what bar doesn't have Fireball?) . He then started taking other orders and left me standing there. He continued to take other orders. I yelled \" hey, where are my shots\". He laughed. One of the other bartenders then stepped in and took care of my order after I was visibility upset. We were talking to a group of 14 people on the patio that were in Cle for a tournament ( from Chi) and they ended up leaving to go somewhere else because they simply could not get drinks. If Coastal Taco keeps this up the restaurant will be closing their doors.  I gave it two stars for the patio/view, which is beautiful."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Flats for over a dozen years.  It never really died, it's probably just that you stopped coming around (or your parents told you to stay anyway). But now that \"the Flats are back\" we have places again to hang out at and relax on the water.  One of those places is Costal Taco, and now that it is open for lunch I texted a friend and walked over to check it out.  There was a modest crowd during lunch, unlike weekends where it seems to be packed.  The atmosphere was a unique mix of a sea side restaurant and country club.  The patio is amazing, and immediately brought back memories of spending afternoons at Fadó.  Each table has an umbrella, so despite the fact that it was overcast for most of the lunch hour when the sun did poke out we were covered.  The menu is fairly straight forward.  They have tacos, sides, and a bowl or two.  You pick what you want, fill out the form with your name and the count of each item you want and they cook it.  They say they serve \"family style\" but this isn't like an Italian dinner.  It just means they merge everyone's order onto a single plate and you have to hunt for what you ordered once it arrives.  The actual tacos were good, but small.  3 steak tacos cost over $10 and were half the size of a taco you could get elsewhere, which is ok because I could stand to lose a few pounds but if you are really craving tacos you may not want to rule out a run for the border (or your favorite local taco joint)  Aside from this there were a few activities to keep you busy while waiting for food or mingling with the opposite sex.  Table tennis, cornhole and giant jenga were just a few of the games I saw about.  Overall, I liked.  Portions small, atmosphere excellent, great to finally sit back out on a patio in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was a huge let down. Do NOT waste your money here. Great views for one drink but that's it. The wait was an hour for terrible food I would not eat again. The waitress took 30 minutes to bring our drinks, she brought out the appetizers WITH the food another 20 minutes later and messed up the order plus forgot one appetizer, the salsa is super bland (seriously no flavor, garbage, you can make better at home), the serving size for the salsa and guacamole appetizers is for a small child, the tacos are tiny unflavored discs of blah, and then the waitress took 15 more minutes to bring the check. This place has so much potential. Need a new restaurant with better staff for this great location."}
{"text":"A better name for this place would be Turtle Taco as that best described their speed of service. If someone would have said that Saturday, July 15, 2017 was their first day in business that would've been believable. One would've expected their \"A\" team would be working on a busy Saturday night.  With long wait lines that resembled a trip to the post office or BMV that didn't appear to be the case. Far from being efficient, wait times averaged a solid 15 minutes. They had 4 bartenders behind bar and one was slower than the next.  It didn't look like they even broke a sweat. If it was a charity event, with volunteer bartenders, that would be understandable and more acceptable. Instead, there were unclear service paths and extremely slow service.  Customers formed their own lines 3 and 4 people deep, cash in hand and surrounding the bar. If your going to charge $9 for a margarita, poured from a tap, at least show some hustle behind the bar. High drink prices are more palatable if the service is fast and accurate.   But it wasn't all bad as once a food order could actually be placed the runner actually brought it out fairly quickly. That is for one out of two orders that my group placed. We ordered a steak and chicken bowl and thought they were pretty good for a decent price.  Another couple with us ordered two steak bowls and they came out staggered. One was forgotten and brought out a half hour later. Once the missing item was pointed out the server did bring it out shortly thereafter.  But, not sure how you bring only one bowl out when you know the order called for two. A whole bowl was eaten before that second even came out.   Finally, on a busy night like Saturday why would you waste space by leaving corn hole boards out on the front patio? People were lined up like cattle for the quicker order, takeout window and space could have better utilized for standing patrons. Corn hole, much like karaoke, is better served for a slow night when an establishment is struggling to bring in and keep patrons (i.e. Monday or Tuesday). Besides, it is a Mexican themed establishment so are drinking games really necessary?  In conclusion, not very impressed with this place and the service definitely did not have us yearning to come back for more. If these were not the slowest bartenders in Cleveland they are certainly in the top 5!"}
{"text":"So I came for the NBA Finals Game 7 watch party, not exactly a normal evening for them. But they did a great job keeping up with the crowd at the bar. Bartenders were circling around and filling drink orders as fast as they could.   I tried 3 different tacos. Carnitas and short rib tacos were pretty good, but the chicken tacos were definitely the best. The lime crema was just awesome.   Drink selection was decent. Would have been nice to have some more local craft beers. House margarita was good, not amazing, and not as strong as I like my margaritas.   Don't know that I'd go for a full sit-down dinner, but a great option for lunch or drinks with some decent food."}
{"text":"This is a great place to drink & socialize.The outside patio is fabulous  They have ping pong, corn hole, Jenga, life size chess. You can dine outside as well as drink & play games. They have a DJ playing appropriate music & not to loud. As far as dining the food is average. Nothing special with the 3 salsa selections. The one thing lacking is their customer service. Slow & no one appears to be happy to assist you (at the bar). You have to make it known you would like their attention.  Felt like we were bothering them. I can only say that about the service at the bar. The people at the hostess stand were very welcoming & friendly. Will definitely go back there for the outside patio. Perhaps happier people will be behind the bar the next time."}
{"text":"We went here after the worst experience ever at Punch Bowl Social. It was a beautiful day and the Indians were playing. What attracted us was the outdoor space. It really makes this place worth going to. They had games (corn hole, Jenga, etc) and a deck that over-looked the river. It's located in the flats right next to the water taxi. We just had basic drinks (not too expensive) and played games. Looks of places to sit still even though the game was on. The only off putting thing was the bartender wasn't very friendly. I will definitely be back to check out the menu!"}
{"text":"I rated Coastal Taco before and definitely count myself a fan. Saturday night during a busy Cleveland festival, we were told they ran out of food- funny, yes, but unheard of- no. I wanted to take a minute to re-rate this venue because even during a stressful situation and on a busy night, everyone was still so polite and conciliatory, I felt they warranted another pop in. The patio and views from Coastal Taco are incredible. The skyline at night and the sounds of the water, the lights hanging- beautiful! The tacos are small but great, and there are a ton of options! The drinks are always well made and the staff is always great!"}
{"text":"Like most of the other reviews on here, my husband and I had the same experience with the hostess. She took our name on a busy Saturday night, but hardly made eye contact. When we asked how long the wait was, she rolled her eyes and said \"I don't know.\" We almost didn't come back, if it wasn't for the view of the centennial parade on the water going on that night.   Overall our drinks were good. The server struggled a bit, but was nice. The view was great. The chips and salsa were not our favorite.  The DJ played literally 10 feet from our table so loud that we couldn't hear ourselves talk. I would go back with a group of friends to go dancing or something, but it was too loud to enjoy anyone's company. It was just too complicated with the level of noise and people pushing past each other."}
{"text":"Good restaurant.  Had a 45 minute wait and once seated we waited about 10 minutes for our waitress to come and get our drinks.  They were busy but you can tell they need more staff.  The waitress hurried off and eventually came back with our drinks.  Our appetizer of house guacamole was perfect with fried tortillas that you break off to use as chips.  My steak taco and Mahi Mahi taco were delicious.  My husband has the Mahi Mahi bowl and said the quality was similar to chipotle.  The food was good but they need more staff to meet the quantity of customers.  I love the feel of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly and sociable. He sat down to take our orders to make sure he heard everything correctly. He described menu items that were unfamiliar to us without a problem. I ordered a Coastal Breeze for my adult beverage.  For my munchies I ordered  queso fundido & chorizo, street corn-on-a-stick, and Spanish rice. My Coastal Breeze would put you in the mind of a Caribbean juice. It was delicious and had a fruity taste. My rice came out before my corn and queso so I nibbled on rice for a minute. When the rest of my food came out I was happy and enjoyed it. The waiter thanked me for being patient and went out of his way to make us satisfied."}
{"text":"The server was very responsive and food was good but the quantity for the price was poor. I ordered 3 tacos at $3 each and they were like taco \"sliders\".  We ordered chips and salsa, but the chips were just a couple of toasted shells that you had to break into pieces to dip.  The beer selection minimal and nothing on draft."}
{"text":"I visited coastal taco before attending a concert at the Q. When we arrived, the employees did not know the information regarding the parking lot across the street. Once we sat down, we alerted our server that one of the people I was dining with had a gluten allergy. The server did not know about the gluten items on the menu, and had to get the chef to come speak with us about it. Even when he came out, he kept telling us that \"90% of our menu items are gluten free.\" After he left, we were still unaware of the 10% of the menu that contained gluten! In addition, the menu sheet they make you order from is very disorganized. They do not leave you any room to pick your taco choice (corn or flour) or for substitutions or modifications. When I visited, they were out of a few tacos and one of the tacos I ordered was prepared fried even though the menu does not describe it as a fried fish. Overall, not a great experience and we will most likely not be returning."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and water keeps this place alive! This is my third trip and while I understand it it still new, there seems to be no training of the wait staff and bartenders. They could not even say what came on a chop salad for another patron. CLE is also a beer city and there is NO draft beer. NONE. Food is good but a bit high in price when Barrio is so close. While the weather and locale will help them through the summer, lack of service will hurt them when the weather changes."}
{"text":"Well, if you get Bria for your server then you don't gotta worry.. She's super friendly, has great recommendations, good energy and accommodating! She's the eye of this hurricane here !"}
{"text":"The braised short rib taco is to die for!  My husband, young adult son and myself visited  on Monday July 3rd. The weather was perfect, it was a holiday weekend and the place was packed.  Our service was fine , considering. They were behind in dishwashing glasses though and my margarita was served in a clear Solo cup. Upon ordering the waiter forewarned me and asked if that  was okay which I appreciated. The folks at the table next to us were drinking Miller Lite in cans -- this is a casual              unpretentious place and that's fine. The prices are very reasonable and I think this may be the most reasonably priced place in the flats.  Among the three of us we ordered a variety of tacos. We all agreed we liked the short rib taco the best."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food.   The laughably small $9 margaritas were served in tiny, plastic cups and tasted mostly like sugar. Even though we listed all the items we wanted on the sheet provided, the server forgot to bring the side even after reminding her THREE times.   Don't get the tacos. You can eat one in two bites. They should be $1. The manager came up at one point and told us the tacos are really appetizers and not a main dish. Thanks for the late notice.   It's a nice scenery but certainly not worth the money. Avoid at all costs.   Look at other bad reviews with the same complaints. This place will be closed within a year."}
{"text":"We decided to give Coastal Taco another try this weekend for our group to celebrate a special occasion because the location on the water is so great. It's a bummer! The food and service were worse than I remember and it wasn't even crowded (Sunday evening). All of our meals arrived at different times which might have been OK if it tasted better. I agree - if you want good tacos go to Barrio. If you want to sit and have drinks on the water, go to Coastal Taco."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was only so-so. I ignored poor reviews from friends to try it out anyway. Such a shame since Costal Taco is next to so many great places in the flats and the view from the patio is spectacular. They won't be in business for long, unfortunately."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO. Went there on a Saturday night and the service was terrible.  The bouncer let multiple people cut in front of line and did not show any consideration. We waited over 35 minutes and was never able to get a drink from the bar. ABSOLUTELY NOT worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a place for a drink before dinner last Saturday evening. We decided to try Coastal Taco as we visited there last year and had a pleasant experience. The place looked pretty empty with several open tables. The bar was empty as well.  We walked up to the bar and had a seat. There were at least 10 employees behind the bar. Not one of them made eye contact with us. One employee was sipping on water directly in front of us and refused to look at our way. The others just stood around.   After sitting at the bar for five minutes without a greeting, we decided to leave. We will never return to this place. It appears to be going down the tubes."}
{"text":"The only good thing is the view. Been here twice. Terrible service. Tacos come out late and cold. Drinks (we ordered budlights) came out wrong. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Go to AlleyCat, it's 1 million times better"}
{"text":"Have been here twice for weekend lunch. The atmosphere is amazing. The views are stunning. The food is hit or miss. I recommend the seafood tacos and the corn. The chips and guacamole is good but too small. The meat tacos are just so so. The first visit it took forever to be seated although the place was not packed. The second time we were seated right away but we where ignored when we asked for shade. There were many shaded areas available. We noted the couple next to us had the same issue. The service on the last trip was terrible. 10 minutes until the server stopped by and another 15 for a margarita.  Salads came out quick then another 20 minutes + for part of our dinner. We were offered apologies and s round on the house. By the time the drinks came we were completely done eating so we did not consume them. We just asked for the check.  We did not get an itemized receipt so we needed to ad up the bill from memory. It was accurate. I love the space, I love the concept they only need to polish the service and they would have a home run."}
{"text":"Let me count the ways, like a united flight bouncing a pregnant woman holding 3 kids kinda awful, 75th hunger games \"may the odds be ever in your favor\" kinda awful, good luck getting a taco, we closed, because fuck 'em kinda awful, wish a mother fucker would kinda awful."}
{"text":"The fact this is a new restaurant is evident. The staff have no idea how to estimate wait times. We were told it would be an hour and a half wait for a party of two - bad, but not too bad considering the area and the fact it was a nice night. After 2 hours, there were still 21 parties in front of us... but, the restaurant was empty... tons of open tables!! We tried to question the staff, and they had some sort of excuse of why there were at least 15 tables and still had a waiting list... after an hour and a half, we found seats at the bar... we ordered a beverage then decided to ask for a food menu to just eat at the bar... after 20 minutes, still no menu. We cashed out and left. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The outside seating is nice, I had a good service, the waitress was really nice. It is not Mexican at all, the tacos are really small, I had coastal margarita, (really small for the price)it was OK, I couldn't finish it, because of the margarita mix (you can tasted A LOT)I order a Pacifico(Mexican beer) it was great, a little bit overpriced. Our water bottle was dirty, the bathroom was dirty, toilet paper every where. The restaurant was full, we saw a table that had to wait a lot to get served, my waitress end it up serving them because no body was taking care of them."}
{"text":"A group of us were excited to try a new place and, with the nice weather, thought Coastal Taco would be the right fit. We were wrong.   Though the location is cool, everything at the restaurant seems amateur. The tacos are so small for what they charge, as is the guacamole. One would think with tacos that tiny, the ticket times from the kitchen would be 5 minutes....try 95 minutes and they screwed up our order.   Our server was polite and friendly, but was quickly overwhelmed by having tables spread out across the outdoor dining area. We asked for our guacamole 4 times before it showed up, and got frustrated after 45 minutes without our order. Our table didn't eat at the same time, and upon trying to discuss the issues with our server, she couldn't control the tears and disappeared for awhile. (mind you: a Wednesday night, no sporting events, just nice weather in Cleveland to bring out the customers.)  Once one of our party located a manager to address what was going on -- and to me this is the most disgusting part of the entire experience - - the manager threw our server under the bus blaming her for ticket mistakes, wrong table numbers, etc. Be a manager! Protect your team! Solve the problems and deal with the staff later.   Oh, and the food we waited so long for - the micro tacos - they had no flavor.   Barrio for life."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was so amazing. Tacos are small so I suggest ordering 1 more than you think. But the service is so random. I got my drink after I ate my meal. Cool outside place area though"}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends went here last month. I hope the service, food, and drinks have gotten better since then, but I'm honestly not too hopeful about that.  We waited an hour for a server to come over. The restaurant, at the time we first got there, was not busy at all. First, I ordered two drinks - the coastal breeze and the strawberry caipirinha. The coastal breeze was forgettable and the strawberry caipirinha was probably the worst drink I've ever had.  When the server finally got around to working her way back to our table, I ordered a chicken tinga bol. I ordered it without black beans and asked for pineapple salsa on the side because I wanted to try it. Clearly, this was a big mistake. I suppose my order was just a bit too complicated.   The food got to our table after an extremely long wait (again). The first bol I got had black beans on it. My friend's meal was also incorrect. We both sent our bols back. Once everyone else had finished eating, we got the second round of bols. Both were wrong again. I've been to a lot of restaurants before and can honestly say I have never had my order come out incorrect twice. I wish I could say the bol was amazing and made up for it coming out totally wrong, but it was just average and rather cold.  The only reason my review is 2 stars and not 1 is because the manager came over to apologize to us and take care of our meals.   I sincerely hope they get their act together here, but will not be returning to give it another chance as I feel it will be a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The food is probably great, but I wouldn't know, as I've only been sitting at a table here for a little over an hour.  I have already chewed my straw as much as possible and I fear I will start to pick the green tomatoes off a nearby plant as the little remaining hope I have that I will ever be served is dwindling.  Send help."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to have your hair turn gray....which is complementary, unlike the extra chips for the mediocre queso and chorizo. Cool view but sad I'll be reduced to using a walker for what is left of my life after the 20 minute wait for every single thing I ordered."}
{"text":"My whole family went for my sisters birthday. This was one of the worst experiences ever. The service is awful. TERRIBLE. Don't expect to get food or drinks within an hour. The food is awful. You cannot even pick what is on your tacos. If you want this type of experience, go to Barrios in lakewood. If I could rate this a zero I would. I cannot say how strongly this restaurant sucks. Dont waste your money or time. We ordered a Margarita, it was 49 dollars!! And it had flies in it. Had to return it and they made an issue about it. Finally, got ready to pay and they wouldnt split the bills. The only thing they can do is split it by the number of people in your party. So, they just said everyone owes this amount. Basically, whatever you ate or drank was split by all people there. Worst experience ever. Do not go."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like you aren't in Cleveland once inside.  It has a very nice seaside town feel to it.  As much as I'd like to give it 5 stars the tacos themselves lack what some of the other top places in Cleveland have, flavor and size.  It has improved somewhat on the menu.  I can't complain about the drinks here they do know how to make a great cocktail.  It is still a nice place to hang out during the summer."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a 4-star review because the ambience and view are off the hook. But the service is another matter ...not the best in town but not the worst either. It's a new spot so they need about a year to work out the kinks. The food is very good for the price. The rice bowls are great but way too salty! Watch the sodium...I will be back because their patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"We had to try this place out opening week for a Wednesday dinner.  Coastal Taco in a brand new waterfront building along the East Bank of the Flats.  The location is stellar, the patio is large, and it has a cool weathered beach house feel.  Ping pong and cornhole are set up next to the patio.  We put our phone number in and waited 25 minutes for an outdoor high-top. Service was really friendly throughout the experience.  The menu is a paper you check-what-you-want and food arrives as it's ready.  The Mojito and Margarita were both excellent although came slow.  The Margaritas tasted fresh and nothing like triple sec unlike some other Mexican joints in town.  Goat cheese guacamole with three huge tortillas and some plantain chips was a smaller portion shareable for two.  The tacos are the real focus of the menu.  Options are either $2.50 or $3.50 and are each served on a single corn tortilla.   Each taco has a main protein paired with a couple other ingredients.  I found the cod and mahi mahi tasty and good values while the chicken and pork were a little dry.  The hot sauce on the table had the perfect amount of heat.  For dessert we had the fried ice cream.  It's covered in cornflakes and cinnamon, deep fried, and delcious.  Overall Coastal Taco was a great experience.  There are definitely more authentic and organic places but the price is right and the location can't be beat."}
{"text":"Awesome Grouper Tacos. Great chips, salsa and guacamole. Seating on the water make for great view and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just a garbage restaurant. Service was horrible and so was the portions. Server told us the tacos were huge and they are literal little mini tacos that are way over priced. That's scratching the surface. It's a shame because it really is a beautiful restaurant. I was so excited when I first walked in. I even told myself this is my new tacos spot just based off the atmosphere and all around look. I walked out saying I'll never step foot in this dump again. Never in my entire life have I had such a horrible experience as I did here. Will not go back and will let everyone I know not to go."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for happy hour and for an afternoon at the patio sipping on some delicious margaritas, although my favorite was de Tito's with Acai Liquor?... it was amazing.  The tacos are too tinny, but I though the portobello taco was pretty tasty. The biggest disappointment are the chips. They are trying to provide \"homemade style\" chips and they end up goving you a tinny portion of not so tasty chips with salsas or guacamole. I wouldn't mine paying for chips and salsa as long as you provide decent chips and salsa. Just look at the pictures, the chips are just too sad.  The other bad thing was the sitting/waiting logistics. We were a family of 5 and a baby and ended up waiting 35 minutes for a table that was open since we got there. Excuse was that we had 5 people ahead of us... 5 couples that were sitted in tables for 2 so there was no need to leave us waiting that long. Not sure what the protocol is with the app but it is definitely not optimize to deal with different group sizes.  The best part... the service. I was so impressed with our awesome waiter  (the guy with the dreadlocks). Friendly and attentive... I am unfortunately not used to great service like that around downtown so I couldn't believe it. Great job hiring that kid. I was also impressed with the bartender that wa so accomodating with our non-alcoholic friend and made her an awesome virgin mojito.   It is a hard place to review. Food is not to the level of other mexican places in Cleveland but the atmosphere and the service (except for the app logistics and inexperienced sitting staff)... will make me go back for more drinks (no guacamole and no chips) and some portobello tacos."}
{"text":"Epically bad service! I can't even begin to explain how bad it was. They brought me the wrong tacos twice. Then when I got tired of waiting and asked for the bill to cash out they brought the whole bill. The bar tender never apologized or even tried to fix the issue. Just here's you your bill... peace. Save yourself the headache and go to Bakersfield on 25th the service is way better and the food is the better. The host staff wasn't very nice either at costal. Nothing better than getting a dirty look when you walk in the door. Sorry, I guess I mistook this for an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone is hating so much on Coastal Taco. I went there last night, and I had a lovely time. Yes, the service was slow, but our food came out in a timely manner. The only thing that took a little long was getting our checks at the end of the night, which was fine because I was still enjoying my delicious (and strong) blueberry margarita and the lovely night. I went with 2 of my friends for our monthly dinner somewhere we have never eaten before. It so happens that we chose to eat at Coastal Taco on Taco Tuesday night, which means that tacos were $2 instead of $3 - not a big difference, but dollar is a dollar. Select mixed drinks were also $5 (instead of $9), which is why I got the blueberry margarita. We started off with the salsa duo, which I was a little disappointed with because in the menu online, it said it is a trio. I did not think a duo of salsa was worth $6 - a trio, yes. The chips were good - you could tell they were homemade. I got the chicken, crispy shrimp and steak tacos. The chicken one was pretty stuffed, while the other 2 weren't as full. They were still all good though. Three tacos was a good number for me. Our table split some of the street corn, which was also good. Lastly, I made sure to save room for dessert. I was split between the fried ice cream and the s'mores cup. I went with the s'mores cup because I figured that I can get friend ice cream at any Mexican restaurant. It was really good, but super sweet so I could only finish about half of it (plus I got to be super full). A+++ for the s'mores cup though. I was a little bummed though about it because they brought our tacos (main entree out), and then when they forgot the street corn, they brought the s'mores cup out with the street corn. Well we were still eating our tacos and had to hurry to eat the corn before it cooled down, and then the s'mores. The corn should have come out with the tacos and the s'mores could have been brought out later."}
{"text":"The patio earns this place its third star.  They have great, comfortable seating, fire pits, and lots of games (ping pong, chess, jenga, corn hole).  The games and the cups with lids and BENDY straws I saw at the next table would make this a great place to take young children, although I don't recall if they had an actual kids' menu or changing tables in the restroom.  The food tasted fine.  Nothing was bad, but it was also not particularly memorable.  The value is bad, though. We came on Tuesday, so tacos were only $2, but even that was probably double their worth.  A quick glance at the menu is misleading, with many options for $3, $4,or $6.  You should still plan to order about $15 worth of food for a full (restaurant-size) meal.  The small portions would definitely go down better if they had complimentary chips and salsa.  The weirdest thing for me was the decor inside.  Did anyone else notice the Abercrombie/ Hollister-esque photos on the walls (think lots of fit white people frolicking on the beach)?  Seeing these photos all over the walls really drew my attention to the contrast between the happy people on the walls and the sweaty workers hustling about.  Maybe this doesn't matter, but it gets my brain spinning in a direction that is not conducive to fun and relaxation.  Not to mention reminding me that I am not actually on a beach vacation (bummer), and that a second margarita is not doing my body any favors (check, please)."}
{"text":"Beautiful beachy decor and able to sit right out on the water.  The food and drinks are VERY reasonable for the Flats area.  The tacos are very small so know that when you are ordering.  There was a wait for a table so we just sat at the bar to drink and have dinner.  Our bartenders were very friendly and helpful.  The food came quickly.  Someone brought their dog out on the patio so you must be able to bring your pooch if you want."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute disaster. We came out for a bachelorette party (9 people) on a Saturday night. We were told that the wait was an hour and a half. We were finally seated 2 hours and 10 minutes later. We waited another 5 before a server came by and then again to get a round of drinks. Our server was friendly but seemed to be stretched extremely thin. When our food finally arrived it was cold and the rice was hard. In short, we arrived at 6:30pm, we finally got our food at 10pm and were out the door by 10:45pm. All around this was a terrible experience for what was supposed to be a great night. I will never be back and I will tell everyone and anyone who asks to do the same."}
{"text":"Had the grouper taco and shrimp taco. Really good. I also really like the atmosphere and the location on the river makes it special."}
{"text":"If I could give his place ZERO stars, I would.  I made the mistake of going on a NBA Finals game night. Boy was I in for a treat!  It was very crowded, but not on the deck, on the bar area. Here is what happened..  1. Took 10 minutes to get a waiter. 2. Took 30 minutes to order just our drinks. 3. 40 minutes JUST to get our waters to the table. 4. 50 minutes to get drinks and SOME of our food, which was cold.  6. 65 minutes to get the rest of our food. We didn't get all of our tacos. (At this point we just wanted to leave).  It took another 10 minutes to get our check.  It was just awful. I never ever want to go here again and would NEVER recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We came to this place on memorial day. The place was packed and we have to wait almost one hour. The waitress and manager came couple of times to say sorry about being late. The food was good i order taco bowl and my family ordered different kinds of tacos. Each taco was $4 and my taco bowl was $10.  Location is beautiful you can sit outside or inside with a lot of friendly staff."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Took my daughter for her birthday. From  warm beer to service that was horrible. food was the worst I have ever eaten. This place needs to go out of business or change hands."}
{"text":"Poor customer service seems to be a systemic issue at Coastal Taco. I visited the restaurant 3 times since it opened in 2016. On my first visit I chalked up the bad service, order errors, and subpar food to being a new restaurant that still had kinks to work out. I returned a few months later to the same issues. This weekend was my last and final visit to Coastal Taco. In all three of my visits the host(ess) stand has been inhospitable. In my opinion, the host(ess) should greet guests and make them feel welcome. This is not the case at Coastal Taco. Instead the hosts and hostesses act inconvenienced at people entering the establishment. To me, this is a culture issue that flows from the top. Second, their seems to be a disconnect between the front of the house and the kitchen. In all of my experiences at Coastal Taco there have been order errors and food not at the right temperatures. Lastly, there seems to be a lack of proper management. Each time I've been there it seems to be disorganized and chaotic. Having worked in the service industry for 10+ years I tend to be very forgiving, but with no signs of improved hospitality or food quality after a year of being in business I'm starting to question if management even cares. Problems only get solved with solutions and my solution is to not frequent this restaurant anymore. If you want great food and service at Flats East Bank I highly recommend Collision Bend Brewery, BeerHead, Alley Cat Oyster Bar or East End instead."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. Sure, they're not as big as barrios, but you will not be disappointed with the flavor. Location is great as well, right off the river in the flats. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of friends and we all agreed this place only gets 3 stars. The food just wasn't that great.  The tacos are tiny and at $4 each I expected them to be a little more tasteful.  Chips and salsa are not complimentary which was strange to me so we of course ordered some and were immediately disappointed.  The \"chips\" just come out as big flat tortillas so we had to break them up ourselves (no big deal but a little weird) and the mild and spicy salsa it comes with was flavorless and simply not appetizing. I ordered a side of Mexican rice for 2.50 and immediately regretted it.  It was extremely hard! It tasted horrible as well. Luckily the waitress was very understanding and took it off my bill. For dessert we ordered churros...again a bust. They were skinny and served with a bland chocolate sauce.  A friend ordered the carmel apple empanada with cinnamon ice cream and was very pleased with this so I'd suggest that for dessert!   Now for the redeeming qualities of this place: location location location! The outdoor patio is just beautiful. It's right on the water and it's a great atmosphere.  There's also yard games to play outside! The music they were playing was a lot of fun too. Lots of 90s hits which kept the group happy.  I'll probably come back just for the location and not for the food! If only a place like barrio could buy this spot out it'd be golden."}
{"text":"Great location. Average food. A terrible system for processing orders which makes potentially good servers look bad. C'mon Coastal Taco. There are better restaurants that should occupy a space as good as yours."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 20 times, I'd say that 15 out of those 20 times the order has been wrong. The service is friendly but there is s disconnect in what is ordered and what shows up. Maybe they are too busy to listen."}
{"text":"Like others have said, it's a beautiful BEAUTIFUL location. You're on the water relaxing with some friends, playing some blast from the past games and then your food comes and everything fun and wonderful about this place gets lost. The guac had no taste but the queso wasn't bad. You'll likely need extra chips. If you're in a big group and order tacos separately, all of the tacos will come out on one tray. Not very fun sorting out tacos after drinking. Seems kind of lazy on the management's part. The tacos are small and come on a cold corn tortilla, which overpowers the small amount of meat it houses. My rec is to eat beforehand and then go for or something to relax and enjoy the environment."}
{"text":"I would say zero but the views are beautiful and our server was great but it was all ruined by the food. Our tacos were VERY small and mean like 2 bites and gone small. I order 3-4 at Barrio and that's plenty but here you need 8+. Our \"goat cheese\" guac was a tiny 3oz ramekin with a piece of goat cheese on top for $6. My swordfish taco was drier than a cotton ball. I also wasn't thrilled that we were given a choice between flour or corn tortillas. There's some people who specifically like one or the other. I'm upset that I wasted coming here for my anniversary when I'm married to a chef who could make better at home with his eyes shut.  I don't understand why there's an ordering form where you write down your name and specify what you want because everything is served together on a large tray. The person who brings out your food yells out what is what and leaves. I guess this is okay for couples but what about a large group of people? I know that won't fly and will cause a confusion.  Now don't get me wrong, my food wasn't horrible BUT it was not good.   Save your time (the waits are long) and your money and go to Barrio."}
{"text":"Coastal Taco is a great expaterience!  Sitting on the river in the Flats, you've  got fire, water, tons of outdoor seating and great food!  Most of the food comes in smaller portions so that you can try several things....unless ofcourse you order the Popi burger which is incredible. Nothing small about this!  You can order your meal off a checklist, sit back in an adirondack  chair and order up a drink, relax and enjoy the evening with the passing boats and vessels."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about the atmosphere and location - the restaurant is airy and spacious with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a perfect view of the river.  I love the outdoor games too- jenga, ping pong, and cornhole.  Coastal Taco truly lives up to its name and gives you a genuine beachy vibe.  The food and drinks, however, lack flavor, especially for Mexican food.  Everything was fine, not that memorable, especially for the price.  Overall, the vibe is totally worth coming back for but the actual menu items probably are not."}
{"text":"All 3 in our party enjoyed our lunch here. Tacos were all excellent. Service was fast.  Nice views of the river are a bonus."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other reviews. Great atmosphere, views, etc but the food was bland (hard to make a bland, tasteless taco, I mean a TRUE challenge lol) drinks were so/so. Chips and salsa were okay. The corn was very good. Our server did a great job. Another annoyance is that the menus on the table just list the items, for example Chicken Tinga, not what that entails. So we would pull out our phone, look at the menu online for the description. Won't go back until they get their food up to snuff. Too many great places on the East Bank."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting mediocre reviews. Every time I come here it's great. Food is good and the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"Location, Location, Location  Great service, delicious food and very reasonable prices.  The tuna tacos are a must.  Fun ambiance, great music and chill atmosphere.  Shout out to our waiter Idris, he's awesome"}
{"text":"I've been away from home for 2 years and just got back into town for the holidays. We wanted to eat somewhere and decided on coastal taco. Now I've had barrio (which is pretty good) and I would say these are just as good. I had the grilled steak, mahi mahi, and al pastor. The al pastor wasn't authentic but still had a great fresh flavor. I would come back, but make sure to get corn instead of flour that was my first mistake. I loved the layout out of the building, it felt very coastal  and beach theme which I loved. In the corner they had a fire place, and on the side where we were sitting they had corner hole. It was great, we played a game while we waited for our food. It was alot of fun. They didn't have alot of people 12pm on a Saturday so if you want to experience this for yourself stop at that time. Love the place, keep it going"}
{"text":"Have been to coastal taco twice. Both times have been awful. First experience our dinner took three hours and we only received half of our order and everything was cold. Decided to give it another chance since it recently opened, and the hostesses were very rude telling us the wait list was full and to try back in 20 minutes. Each time we tried back to put our names down they were ruder and ruder. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Would give negative stars if possible"}
{"text":"Where do I start. Service started good, the server was attentive and nice. After we got our drinks, that's when things went south, QUICK!. The Mojito was great, one of the best I've had, the food however, was cold, and bland. Also, our server brought us the wrong food. Most of what we ordered was on the tray, but there was a bunch of other food we didn't order on there also. Then our server just disappeared for like 30 mins after bringing us the wrong food. She didn't bring my wife her black beans, and she didn't bring my son his fish tacos. Decided to order another Mojito, and it ended up being the WORST mojito I've ever had. I guess a different bartender made that mojito.  The place has potential. Good atmosphere, good look, great location. The food, service, and consistency is bad though. Need to get Bar rescue in there"}
{"text":"Quality food but not good value at all. Service was very poor. Prices would be okay if servings were respectably sized, but they're not. Great location and lots of potential, but poorly managed, based on kitchen-waitperson confusion also described in other comments here. Love Cleveland! Do better by the Flats."}
{"text":"Absolutely loving this place. The patio is fabulous for relaxing. The drinks are light and refreshing. Our server, Maryann, couldn't be any nicer and helpful. The place is understandably slammed because it's new, so don't expect to get in and out of here quickly.   The food has also been great. We tried the chopped salad - light and bright dressing with cotija cheese. The chicken tinga bowl was very flavorful and a good portion size. Also, absolutely get the street corn. If you've never tried it before, it's a don't miss. Margaritas are also fabulous! Check it out on a sunny day and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised to see such low ratings. Sure it's hard to be up to barrio standards, but I thought this place did a pretty fair job.  I asked for a margarita that was spicy, which seemed to be lacking on drink menu, and our waiter knew just want to order for me (thanks Aaron!) I enjoyed my tacos as well and the goat cheese Guac was delicious. A friend ordered the queso which they were a little disappointed with as it wasn't \"the same as barrio\" but that's a tough one to compete with!   Overall I would definitely come back, and a great place for drinks later at night even if you aren't looking for a meal. It was cold and we ate outside but they have a great locations and some outside games (life size chess anyone?)"}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air for Cleveland. On a cold winter night we felt like summer was within reach.  The decor is fun and colorful. The food was great and the variety pleased all of us.  The service was wonderful, also.  We plan to return soon."}
{"text":"It was bound to happen! Ash and I went to a bad restaurant together. Im thankful for food and great dining experiences. I'm a foodie, chef and did I mention I love food! I know they are tying to build up the the city with the major restaurant expansion in the east bank of the flats. But I don't suggest going to costal taco unless you want rocks in your food. +Mediocre food and drinks. The staff was nice for the most part the view was nice. We had old guys  crowding our table, while we were trying to eat. That is all. The manager took about half off our bill. I think the meal should of been free for some food redemption. Bad experience sad day bad job costal taco you don't do tacos well ."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was the worst service I've ever experienced. We came here for my boyfriends birthday thinking it would be the perfect spot for a patio drinks and good food. When we FINALLY got the food ( three out of five orders completely wrong) we were so hungry we ate anyways so we could build up the energy to let the manager know how horrible the entire experience was. She not only made it worse she over charged all of us twice making the checking out process take AN HOUR. We will never be back the food is soggy, drinks are weak, and the manager is a troll. We did tip our server because she clearly was not trained by said manager and was being tortured along with us. BARIO FOR LYFE."}
{"text":"This place is just a bar with a good view if you can snag one if the few tables on the water.  The food was less than mediocre with the tacos being two bite sized.  But the service was the worst.  Could not get water refills, our waitress went MIA halfway through our dinner.  After 2 hours we still had dirty plates on our table.  Once in a while someone would walk by and take a plate or two, never saying a word or asking if we wanted anything else.  Inexcusable for a place where you fill out your own order to hand to the waitress.  Waitress finally showed up with the check and STILL did not remove any of the dirty plates.  There are too many other options in the area for a really pleasant dining experience.  Upgraded to two stars only because of the location."}
{"text":"Nice location. Menu looked good. Ordered a couple of beers and some food. The beers and cups of water were promptly delivered. The food took over 40 minutes to come out and it was the wrong order. We chose to keep it since sending it back would put us back another 30-40 minutes. The manager asked us how things were going and we did share our issues. They had tired staff who worked back to back long shifts. Anyway, the food was ok, service not so great, atmosphere nice. I'll give them 1 more chance I guess. They were very apologetic."}
{"text":"The views from the restaurant are really amazing. The location also can't be beat. The food, however, does not match the views. The tacos are small, but worse than being small, most of the food was bland - guacamole, bol, tacos, etc.. Don't be afraid to add some serious flavor. If the portions are going to be little, the flavor has to be big.   On a side note. They may want to reconsider how they serve their tacos. Serving them family style is odd. The display is far more odd. It looks like a child placed a soft taco shell on a tin lid and then tossed on some toppings. There is nothing pretty about the display. Please consider a better way to do this."}
{"text":"Great location on the east bank of the flats. Fun, helpful and efficient bartenders, Chris & Ryan. Delicious guac and salsas as well bean & rice bowls. Loved my Mahi bowl.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Coastal Taco twice, my first experience was much better than my second. I went late on a Saturday night (7/22/17) with a large group of friends (about 9 of us) - we were sat right away to our surprise as it was very busy. Once we sat down we were greeted by our server (Steven). At first it seemed as if we were going to have a great experience. Steve was friendly and immediately struck up a conversation with one of the members of our group. He said he would go get us water and would be back to take our orders. He came back with 3 large bottles of water, but no glasses for us. After 10 more minutes he finally came back with the glasses and then disappeared for another 10 minutes or so. When he came back he told us he was slammed and made us feel extremely rushed while ordering, so rushed that a member of our group did not even order food as he said \"if you aren't ready I can leave and come back later\" as she was going to tell him what she wanted while reading straight from the menu. He also made rude hand gestures and rolled his eyes while this was going on. Everyone at the table eventually ordered and he disappeared once again. About 20 minutes after placing our order we still did not have our drinks (most of the group only ordered drinks) and another friend had joined us at this point - she had tried to get Steve's attention but he walked past 3 times and ignored her every time. At this point her and I went to the bar to get drinks, as this was becoming ridiculous. The bartender was very helpful and nice and the drinks provided directly from him were very good. Once her and I returned to the table we noticed everyone had gotten their food, but still no drinks. After about 10 more minutes our drinks were finally delivered to our table (one drink short too!) - the drinks were watered down as I am sure they had been sitting at the bar for an extremely long time. The friend who was last to join tried to order with Steve who proceeded to roll his eyes at her when she was reviewing the menu telling him what she had wanted. We also told him he was a drink short and he tried to argue with us. After this incident he stormed away from the table. About 10 minutes later he returned to the table with the missing drink, slammed it in front of me and walked away without a word. At this point I believed it was time to contact the manager. I found another server who had the manager sent over. The manager and this other helpful server (Whose name I believe is Mike) apologized and resolved the situation. We got Mike as a new server (he was amazing) and the manager compensated us for the horrible service/drinks we had received because of our original server (which was very nice as we were not expecting much). Although this situation was not ideal - as I am not one to complain at restaurants - I would still return to give it another shot based on the manager and the server we had during the second half of our experience."}
{"text":"Visited last night. Most of these reviews are accurate. Breaking it down , five stars for Patio and ambiance , 4 stars for service which was fine , but the food... Just not that good. Tried 4 tacos, pork, shrimp, mahi mahi and short rib... Very little flavor in any and mostly dry. Mojito was fine , goat cheese guacamole  was good and the Mexican street corn was okay. Hope they will step up their game with their food , because the ambience alone will have people coming here like crazy! For that reason , we will try it again , and try a menu item besides tacos for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to coastal taco and I was there with 10 other people celebrating my birthday. Let me start out by saying the vibe of the restaurant is fantastic and the food is amazing! The tacos taste perfect and I wouldn't change anything on that end- I would give atmosphere and food a 5 star.   Now with that being said- the service and organization of the restaurant needs help and if they do not fix things they will never make it past year one of being open. Last night we were at dinner for 3 1/2 hours total. That is insane. We each ordered 2-4 tacos which were brought out on one huge plate. The server told me quickly which was which but with having 20 tacos on the plate I had no idea how to tell which was which. Our food should be brought out on our own plates or have labeling.   Then when it came to getting our bill it took over an hour and a half- an hour and a half!!!! It even got to the point where I went behind the counter to talk to my server and I believe the manager. I apologized and did not want to seem rude but it was my birthday evening and being at a restaurant for over 3 1/2 hours was not what I wanted to do. When we got our bills everything was wrong. Our server was so nice and so friendly and I do not think any of it was his fault. I just think the whole restaurant needs major assistance in organization. The manager personally came over to apologize and gave us each gift cards to apologize. I am very thankful they made an effort to apologize but there is so much work that needs to happen before I come back.   The main point of this review is for the owners, managers or someone to see that their restaurant needs major help if they want to last! I'll be coming back but for the food but if the organization of the place stays the same, it will be my list visit.   Please work hard to fix everything! You have the potential of being a huge staple in the east bank flats!!!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Below average tacos, bad mixed drinks, and worse service. The decor is cute and being on the water is great. There were about 10 young kids there and they took up the lawn games the entire time we were there (it was around 9pm in a weekend). We weren't upset, but it would have been nice to play.  Our waitress was pretty useless. She gave us water and took our order then we never saw her again. Someone else brought us our food, got refills, and then we had to ask another waiter for our check. It wasn't that busy to I was confused.  Now I know this isn't the restaurants fault, but to top off the bad night we sat next to a group of people who talked about sex the entire time. Very graphic, really distrusting and demeaning. The one guy started hitting on me and came and sat next to me. Later at the bar I was hit on by another drunk man. It just seemed like the kind of place those kinda people hang out at and I want no part of that.   I won't be returning here. It looked promising but I was disappointed. Hopefully someone is reading these reviews and hires a new staff, maybe they'll have a chance."}
{"text":"My first visit here was very disappointing - 6 of us went for lunch during the week and our waitress was horrible - she was super slow and could not figure out how to give us 6 separate checks after asking for them 3x - she ended up splitting the bill 6 ways!  She disappeared for long periods and kept forgetting things we asked for.  As far as the food goes I could have gotten past the small tacos, but they just did not have a lot of flavor to them at all.  The queso-chorizo dip was amazing though.   My second trip here was last night (07/28/16)  - a group of 12 of us went at 4pm for drinks at apps for a going away party for a coworker and Melissa was our waitress and WOW she was amazing!!  One of the best waitresses I've had anywhere in a while - she was very attentive, gave us plenty of water, extra glasses of ice, extra napkins, etc all without having to ask.  She was very on top of our drink orders and came over immediately any time a new person arrived, she was super friendly also.  Very happy to see that they have gotten some better waitress because the place is absolutely gorgeous - the decor is beautiful and it is the only place on the East Bank that is directly on the water.  I will be back for sure and am hopeful that they will work out all the kinks out and become one of the best places to go in the new Flats."}
{"text":"I just recently moved back to CLE within the last 6 months, so the revitalization of The Flats is fairly new to me. My boyfriend and I really wanted to eat dinner outside by the water, and chose this place.  We had a little bit of a wait for a seat outside (on a Monday evening) but it passed quickly. I can only imagine how busy this place gets on the weekends.   So while you wait they've got loads of stuff on the patio to do: take in the river view in Adirondack chairs, giant jenga, and corn hole.   The food is served tapas-style, so order more than 1 taco! They're super tasty and I usually like tacos. *gasp*   I love the atmosphere of the place- totally relaxed, beachy vibe without getting tacky and one hell of a view of the river. Don't let the beach vibe and kick butt patio fool you into thinking it's just a \"summer spot.\" This inside of this place is absolutely massive, decked out with a giant wood-burning fireplace. It's super cozy, I'll definitely come during the colder months!   If I loved the place soooooo much, why'd I give it 3 stars? It took probably 20 min to be greeted by the server. After she took our drink order, it took another 10/15 min for her to come back with our drinks (refills weren't any quicker, I seriously thought she forgot about us lol!). Point is, service was very slow. It was a beautiful night, so we didn't really mind, but any other time it would have seriously bothered me.   Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"I just so happen to pass through this place over the Memorial Day weekend during the \"taste of Cleveland\" event, we had ordered the chorizo nachos for a starter, it is actually pretty good full of cheese and picked veggies such as onions and tomato with a huge lump of sour cream on top, I had ordered 3 tacos, shrimp taco, pulled pork with the pineapple and chicken, they were all pretty tasty with the taco sauce they provided on the table. My girl ordered the shrimp bowl, she did not like it whatsoever and I tried to finish it for her but I neither could stomach it, so much rice and beans and like 3 pieces of shrimp. The service was good our waitress was pretty attentive to us and what we needed and the atmosphere is really good, so if you want some tacos looking over the pier where the big boats pass then this is a really nice spot."}
{"text":"Hostess and manager are not pleasant. Food is subpar. It has a nice view.   Needs immediate new management or this bldg will go back to the landlord."}
{"text":"Island vibe in the heart of Cleveland. Fresh squeezed juices, 180 degree view of the waterfront, big ole wood burning fireplace inside, ping pong, corn hole, jenga on the street side. Food is largely tacos or bowls (bols) + tamales and a coupla soups/salads/salsas. Portion sizes are on the small side but well priced. Vibe is relaxed and family friendly, the latter being a big win for the Flats IMO, the former bleeding over a little into service quality."}
{"text":"So, I was looking for a place that offered views of the water for my poor (land-locked) mid-western wife.  The views were exceptional!  So, let's get on to the review:  Pros: If you want flavorful seafood and land-lubber tacos, this is the place.  The tacos are small (think tapas), so order a variety.  My wife ordered one of their \"bols\" (naked burritos) and liked it very much.  But she kept tasting my tacos!  Seriously - one of the pluses of this place is the ability to order a \"flight\" of tacos and not be over-stuffed.  I ordered four different flavors and was not at all disappointed.  I'd tell you the flavors, but I think you should create your own flight.  I did not order any, but, they have a number of reasonably priced sides to add to your entree if you desire - especially if you are splitting entrees.  Neutral:  The music was loud, so you have to like loud music.  That said, it was not so loud that my wife and I couldn't have a conversation during dinner, and the playlist was fun for the setting.  Con: The service was not as slow as some reviews with one caveat:  They place napkins and tableware (forks) in a mason jar on the table.  Our table was out of tableware.  Our waiter and our server couldn't be bothered to bring my wife tableware - they both blamed it on the bus-staff!  Luckily, a neighboring table gave my wife a fork from their jar.  It is clear that real management is so caught up in the back-of-the-house operations that they are oblivious to the front-of-the-house operations.  Either oversight will eventually doom a restaurant, which the owners seem to not understand, or they simply don't care because liquor sales from this beautiful locale offset the lack of attention to detail."}
{"text":"They were out of everything, they force you to open a tab immediately and keep your credit card until the end, food portion is small and average tasting, my friend and I were sick all night into the next day from something we ate there..."}
{"text":"This has to be the best view in all of Cleveland. Not only that but the food is a good value for the location and the happy hour prices on drinks is amazing. If you come try to get served by Melissa she is the best!"}
{"text":"Visited Coastal Taco today for the second time.  The location is perfect for enjoying the newly renovated Flats East Bank.  They have ping pong tables, corn hole, a giant jenga set and other activities to keep you busy while you wait for your table or just to enjoy before or after your meal.  Based on my two visits, I would say the food is good, not great.  The tacos are very small and, although I already knew that from my last visit, I appreciated that our server, Colby, pointed this out to us.  My friend and I both ordered a \"bol\" and we were happy with our selections.  We also shared an order of the guacamole which was also good but didn't come with enough chips. Other Yelpers have complained about the service.  We had no problems with service today although it was not at all crowded at lunch.  My first visit was later in the day and the service was somewhat slow.  All in all, Coastal Taco is worth a try if for the fantastic location."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible.  Love the location so I was excited to try it out.  The architecture is amazing, and it makes you feel like you are in a beach town.  But the service is one you would not expect.  I love Mexican food and of course margaritas, but both were mediocre.  A Mexican restaurant with only one choice in Margarita is fine if it's actually a good margarita.  and $12 for the smallest margarita ever with minimal tequila is borderline criminal.  The tacos were tiny, unfilling, and had limited taste.  Not to mention when going as a pair they don't split up the taco, making it difficult to tell who's is who's.  The chips and salsa flight were underwhelming with not enough chips to finish the salsa, which only 1 of the 3 salsas had any kick or flavor.  Service was slow, and it seemed like they only came when we started to look around the restaurant for them.  For the price it is a horrible decision, you're better off going to Nuevo on East 9th street or one of the many amazing Mexican restaurants in the suburbs.    I will say I went a second time for a beer and to sit on the deck on a Saturday night and it was a fun time, service was still slow, but a heck of a view."}
{"text":"this place sucks!! customer service is totally negative! takes so long to order a drink at the bar! they seem like they dont need customers! feel like im being discriminated the way they talk especially the security dude and those bartenders!! i wont let them ruin my fun night out... lol! wont come back that is a sure thing!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Coastal Tacos! Why?  - It's open late - Coolest patio CLE has to offer, you literally feel like you're on vacay. - Delicious tacos. The steak & shrimp are my go-to. $2 tacos on Taco Tuesday, chya! - My friend had the burger last night and she said it was phenomenal. - Cute bartenders. ;-) - Giant Jenga! - Ping Pong Tables. - On Sundays they have steel drums...and they play some damn good tunes. - $5 tasty cocktails during happy hour. - The bar wraps around inside & out. - The decor is badass and the servers seem pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible.   Tried to have dinner here twice with three other people. The seating area vs the size of the kitchen (yep, I looked) is pathetic. There is no way a kitchen that small can carry such a large seating area. We walked with out being served.   Go here to drink (they make more $$$ that way) as apposed to eating."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  Great service.  Mahi Mahi bol was really good.  My boys had chicken, steak, and Mahi Mahi tacos and all gave excellent reviews of the food.  Chips and salsa as a starter did not disappoint.  Shocked there are 1 star reviews on this place.  We'll definitely come back.  Thank you Richelle for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Visited Coastal Taco for dinner last night. I'll break it down! The pros: -really beautiful patio with decent amount of seating. Pretty view of the river, neat decor  -tacos were really good - pork, chicken tinga so yummy! I'd skip the fried Avocado taco next time. -pineapple salsa is delicious, guacamole just 'okay'  The cons: -such SLOW service. Waitress (Lauren) was nice, but disappeared for long periods of time. -messed up my drinks. First marg I ordered with salt - came out with no salt. Second marg was SPILLED on my lap/legs and had a TINY sliver of salt (see attached photo). My friend ordered salt on his as well and got no salt... I know accidents happen, but for an $8 marg... this was really disappointing. And not worth the cost.  -waters weren't refilled a single time our entire time there  Overall... the 3 stars are for the tacos. Not impressed with the service and overall, the experience was meh. :/"}
{"text":"Underwhelming compared to barrio. Smaller portions, more expensive, can't customize order, every little thing is an additional cost, and cant substitute. has a great view of the flats/the river, a nice patio and fun games to play"}
{"text":"Service isn't good and tacos are expensive for how small & lack of quality. I was chewing on a piece of steak for like 5 minutes..."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out because it was maybe a week or two after they had opened. We decided to check it out on a Saturday evening which I was afraid of the long wait... And boy was I right... It was nearly an hour wait to seat three, but luckily they had a bar overlooking the lake which was pretty spectacular!! Just waiting to order a drink felt like I was waiting in line to get on a roller coaster. That long!! The bartender was nice enough to point to another bar area off to the side which was not noticeable unless you were told so... Yikes! Drinks we ordered were pretty delicious and refreshing! We finally get seated outside and it was kind of wet from the rain but the view made up for that! Our order was taken and we waited over 30 minutes and were told they lost our tickets and were out of a specific taco. The nice server that helped us near the bar asked for us and they actually had it. I was disappointed that the restaurant seemed so disorganized and left us still hungry. So we decided to grab taco's in Lakewood instead. I am glad we tried this place. The taco's were flavorful but not something I will be drooling over anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sitting by the wood burning fireplace in the winter is not only cozy but the perfect spot to relax and have a drink!! Feels like I'm at the lodge of a ski resort.  Burning river taco and chicken nachos are my fave. Nothing beats this view on the water either...rain or shine (or snow) looks good any time of year."}
{"text":"I recently visited Coastal Taco for the first time, and we will definitely be back. Our waiter was awesome, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He was honest about the size of the tacos, recommending we definitely get more than one.   We started with chicken nachos and they were delicious! I got three tacos, mahi-mahi (pretty spicy FYI), chicken, and shrimp. They are pretty small, but I left very full. The bill came to about $15 before tip, which isn't far off from any other taco joint in my opinion. Very cool atmosphere!   This restaurant, in my opinion, is very different from Barrio. I see a lot of people comparing the two, and this place simply doesn't have the huge list of add-ons, which I was aware of. If you're looking for a place with tons of options and different varieties, maybe save Coastal for later. I will definitely be back, though!   (I didn't get pico on my tacos, but that comes on a few of them if looking at the picture)"}
{"text":"Food isn't that good, service is worse. Only good thing here is the view. Overpriced tacos with a great location..."}
{"text":"Great views     Good service.     I recommend drinks and corn-hole  or some ping pong .      Great new place in the flats"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is the only thing Coastal Taco has going for it. Tacos are tiny and overpriced for their size. Mixed drinks are horrible and the service is the slowest I've ever experienced. Definitely disappointing for such a great location and atmosphere. I MUCH prefer Barrio!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite specialty taco places in Cleveland. Love the decor, the food, and the service. We went at a off time, got to choose to sit by the wood fireplace and were served immediately."}
{"text":"I visited Coastal Taco on a Tuesday night. The place was HOPPIN'. I mean, very few seats in the place at all, so we grabbed a lounge/bar table and a margarita ($5 on Tuesdays) at the bar and sat down. The margaritas were wonderful - strong but not overpowering tequila-wise with a margarita mix that was not overly sweet.  We each ordered several tacos ($2 on Tuesday special) as well. I was delighted by the flavors. I had the portabello mushroom, mahi-mahi, and shrimp taco, and each had great flavor that really popped. I forget which taco, but one had cilantro, which I generally hate, but it was not overpowering and I ended up enjoying the overall taco as well as the flavor of the cilantro because of their restraint with it.   The two truly charming things about this restaurant are its location, overlooking the river with a beautiful view, and the odd selection of games they have. They have a couple of giant Jenga sets and that game a can't remember the name of where you throw the bean bag into the holes on the wooden board.  As far as service went, our server was lovely. A mistake was made in the kitchen (a few wrong tacos were brought out), and she left the extras for us to eat at no charge. That's the way to solidify your customer base and make up for an error!  Overall, I loved this place, and I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Hard to beat the atmosphere/views here in Cleveland, for that alone I will return and give their SERVICE another shot. The bartenders were no better than average, yes the place was crowded this day but really no excuse for the poor service. Ever hear of a bar MANAGER that keeps everyone honest and in check as to who needs a drink, and in what order, when its slammed?? Pay one, do yourself a favor.  Tacos were decent, the bowl was better IMO."}
{"text":"Good Luck trying to get a table in this place. I really don't think the hostess knows what she's doing. We were told that the wait for a outside table was 2 hours, so we decided to just go out there and have a couple beers only to see multiple empty tables out there that were taking a very long time to get people seated at them. Hopefully the next time we stop there things have been fixed."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality of this place is the amazing patio and view. The food was mediocre - not bad, but nothing memorable and generally on the bland side. The waitress was inattentive. Apparently getting a second glass of iced tea or water is asking too much. Avoid this place and go to Alley cat oyster bar, with an equally great view and amazing food."}
{"text":"Great service and the tacos are really good too. Sit by the fireplace for a toasty lunch or dinner. Good place to visit. Park in the unattended lot across the street. It's only $7.00 on the weekend and it's credit card only. The manned lot is $10 and cash only."}
{"text":"I am from Phildelphia and haven't had such great seafood in a long time! I had the grouper, crispy shrimp and baja cod tacos. I highly recommend the cod. The other two were not too bad but were lower in flavor. I had the corn on the stick and it was INCREDIBLE! Great ambience and the seating outdoor by the waters is icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Crowded layout.  Too many workers all looking lost. Sub par food. Nothing special about the margaritas. Had to share a plate when we ordered separate tacos. Oh, and we had to share the one napkin at the table in pre put together \"silverware cups\". Will not return."}
{"text":"Sorry to pile on, but the location is 5 stars and the décor is a Coastal Living magazine cover come to life. Those two things deserve much better food, drinks and service.  The service was - the best description is - confused. I brought an out of town friend here, and while we enjoyed sitting by the river, watching the busy water traffic, we saw 5 different servers and no one seemed to know where various other parts of our orders were. The pick your parts menu is not self-explanatory and our server's instructions of - 'just mark what you want' did not explain how many of certain items were in a serving, how big the bowls were, etc. When she came back, she pointed to bowls and taco trays on other tables to explain the servings of each item. This is not a good sign.  We decided to try some of the tacos and each ordered one of each of 3 flavors. They arrived - and our first words were -- those are SMALL. They were teeny, tiny tacos. So, we tried each flavor, ordered a two more of the one we both liked and by then it was happy hour, so we ordered another drink and enjoyed the view. Then we went somewhere else for an actual dinner about an hour later.  There are other places with better tacos and better drinks. Again, the view deserves far better food, drinks and service. I hope they can get those things worked out - because every time I go by, I WANT to go in and sit at one of those riverside tables."}
{"text":"Couldn't get a drink for an hour, bartenders were ignoring some guests and giving other gusted their second drink when I could get one. And their staff was very rude!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but sadly the food and service is lacking. I got two tacos & veggie tamale. Both tacos were fair...the fish was dry & the shrimp taco didn't have much to it. The veggie tamale is good! The service needs improvement. Our server disappeared and we were looking for him a couple of times. We had asked for more water & then 10 minutes later when he appeared we had to ask again. It also seemed the servers didn't know their table numbers. Servers were waking in circles with our food. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Came for some late night food around 1230, we were told due to seasonal weather they ran out and stopped serving food. Despite the one bad interaction we had with the one bartender the manager and other staff were very nice, even offered us food after we were told by the bartender that was impossible. I had a taco earlier in the night and it was good so I'm willing to give it another try especially since the manager was so accommodating....ps we only wanted something easy chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Beautiful view....drinks are Terrible...like really terrible, not strong not weak but rancid like something has gone bad, water taste as if it's from Lake Erie itself food is small and mediocre...please get this place together...it really is a gem"}
{"text":"The scenery is great.  What a great place to put a restaurant.  I hear they have food and drink, but can't prove it.  An hour and counting and not a morsel in sight...  I'll update if and when I get something to review."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say four stars because the current overall of 2.5 is not warranted. Probably a 3.5, but anyway...  Clevelanders have been spoiled by Barrio, and if you go in with Barrio expectations you're going to be disappointed. However, if you take it for what it is then I think it's pretty good.  Great location! Right on the river, with tasteful beach decor. The service was fast and friendly, and I really like that you give your phone number and they text you when your table is ready, it gives you a chance to take a walk on the boardwalk while you wait.  I ordered the a shrimp and chicken taco, both pretty simple, but good. Here is where the Barrio factor comes in, the tacos are about the same price, but significantly smaller.  We also ordered the chips and salsa (yes they are extra unlike Barrio), with the roasted tomato and pineapple salsas, both good. The roasted tomato was hotter than I expected.  Lastly, I ordered a house margarita, good size, strength, and taste.  All in all, if you wanna try a new place and enjoy the river view then this place is a good choice, but if you are looking for a Barrio competitor then you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delcious tacos, quality ingredients. Drinks are pretty good. Newer place so alot of people trying to get a drink. But worth it"}
{"text":"Tried CT again at the Cleveland Taco Fest over the weekend. The head chef was super friendly, and all the tacos I tried were phenomenal! There's this really bomb vegetarian lentil taco that really blew me away. I actually found it far tastier than the other two absolutely delicious tacos I tried (braided beef and the carnitas). Give them a try! Also, their hot sauce is house made and SO TASTY!"}
{"text":"Even though it's only April and us Clevelanders want it to be warm already, eating a meal at a restaurant on the riverfront is the closest thing we can get. Although it was chilly in the indoor patio area, I am sure it is really nice in the warmer summer months.  We started with the Chips and Salsa (tomatillo and pineapple salsa). The pineapple salsa was chunkier than excepted, not something that I would get next time. I liked how the chips were sprinkled with sea salt and cilantro, it gave a fresh feel to the plate.   My friend and I were pretty hungry, so we ordered the Taco Ten Pack. We had 5 chicken tinga tacos and 5 grilled steak tacos. The chicken tacos were good, but the grilled steak tacos were a bit overcooked and dry.   Overall, I thought it was a bit pricey for the quality of food and mediocre service we received. I can think of other taco places in Cleveland where the money we spent here, could buy us a lot more food and better service at other places."}
{"text":"I've been to Coastal Taco about five times now, and they have so much work to do. Both the food and the service need a lot of work.   The first time I came to Coastal Taco, I was super stoked. I wanted to find a place to eat tacos and have a margarita while I watched the Indians game. At first, they couldn't seat me close to a tv, even though there was plenty of available seating that wasn't reserved. I ordered one of their margaritas, and it wasn't memorable. I also ordered (3) tacos. At $3 each, the value just isn't there. With no customization options, I can't advise the tacos. I also wanted the smores dessert, but alas, they were out.   With that being said, service wasn't awful. It could be better. Coastal taco still has a lot to work on. The only thing they have going for them is the view of the water."}
{"text":"Did I go to the same place as everyone else?  I walked into Coastal fearing bad service and bland food. I was pleasantly surprised to find bangin' margaritas, delicious tacos, and a fun -am I still in Cleveland??- atmosphere.   Probably my new favorite place in the Flats! I'll be back"}
{"text":"AWEFUL! AWEFUL!  AWEFUL!  Mid-afternoon July 16, 2017. Great scenery, but it absolutely ends there!! Appetizer: Hostess stand had several (around 4) employees, not continuously, but dare near almost. So, just a bunch of workers standing around regularly.  Busing: Prior to being seated was in theme with lackluster performance that was forthcoming. Dirty \"plates\", which were somewhat cool little aluminum trays, that are standard on a \"clean table\", were stacked under two clean ones at a four top.  Seated: Albeit directly in the sun, which is par for the course. However, we were not greeted by a waitress for 20 minutes. Yes, 20 minutes. Maybe, it was poor management logistics where they assigned a server to both inside and outside tables, but this is an inefficient service model.  Waitress: Eventually upon arrival, was nice, but awfully inefficient.  We (2 adults, 1 teen) placed our order immediately. 3 drinks and nachos.  We told her that there were no napkins and about the dirty plates and her response was \"no worries\".  REALLY, are we here entertaining the waitress? Delivery:  The nachos came in 3 minutes, honestly, and the drinks were 7 minutes later. Execution:  I truly think that our nachos may have been left overs from another table because the other table near us had a plater twice the size of ours that was topped, unlike our nachos, with salsa and towered over our sadly display of an appetizer. Exit: a shivering pit stop in the men's room left me with the experience with an employee that left the only stall in the restroom, straight past the sink, and out the door. Seriously! Maybe he'll wash his hand in the kitchen. Poor service, dirty and clueless! Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Nice place great patio and view of the river food was good water for s table about 30 minutes service was not good waitress never came to see if we needed anything or refills on our drinks then they took for ever to bring us our bill"}
{"text":"So it would seem my initial review somehow disappeared but some of the photos I took are still online so let me reiterate the facts.  1. Terrible service, the bar tender asked if I was going to buy a drink I said no on 3 different occasions. He then stated he would make me something anyway. I did not drink the beverage bc I was the DD but I was surely charged for it. Shame on you! 2. Our tacos arrived & things got tough bc we were unable to identify one taco from another. They arrived on one long tray for more than one person so we didn't know what we were eating! They were bit sized and nothing like what I expected. 3. I am saving this review so if it goes missing again I will simply repost it!"}
{"text":"I would never recommend anyone to this restaurant. The service was awful, the margarita was awful, the food was mediocre and came with hair... barfffff!!   The manager apologized and gave a discount but I will not be returning. I had to give the manager advice of how to coach her employees"}
{"text":"Nice spot in the Flats to enjoy the river view and chill outside by the water, especially in the summer. I didn't try any of the food, but my friends and I came here to kick back, grab a few drinks, and play some of their outdoor yard games like cornhole/giant jenga/ping pong. It was a fun way to spend an hour or two! Unfortunately there aren't any beers on tap (only margs), but there's a decent selection of canned and bottled beers here, as well as some wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment. Best view I'm all of Cleveland. A really cool concept on every level the snack shack, fire pit and games. Everyone was nice and easy to talk to even security."}
{"text":"Costal taco is beautifully decorated and has an incredible patio! It definitely makes you feel like you're at the beach. They have cornhole and Jenga, which are a nice addition to the patio.   I was so excited for this place to open because I love tacos! I've been here three times now since they opened and the food is just OK. The tacos are super small, don't have much stuffed in them and are just missing something! Maybe more sauces/ spices would help?! I know this is more fancy, but there's no comparison to my love of barrios super stuffed flavorful tacos! The salsas on the \"salsa fight\" are very delicious but you don't get enough chips to finish them and they charge $2 for more chips. The guac is very fresh and was a decent portion. The drinks a little pricey, but they are strong  I noticed they changed their ordering slips and added more items the last time I was there. I really want to love this place, but so far the food is just missing something. Service is lacking too, as it takes a long time for anything and everything.  I hope they keep improving their menu and hope the service will get better too as the summer goes on. The patio alone will keep me coming back again!"}
{"text":"I had great expectations because of the atmosphere & beautiful river view. What a letdown! The bar service was horrible. The bartenders never checked up on you after they served you an initial drink. They took my charge card, charged me for the drink that the person sitting next to me had & I had to try to get the attention of someone so I could get my card back & be seated. The tacos were $3.50 apiece & were literally three bites each. They were not very flavorful & dry. I was very disappointed & realizing that they haven't been open long, I hope they work the kinks out, but I won't go there again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service on the other hand was poor. Didn't get our appetizer, sat around for 20 minutes waiting for drinks. Gave it a second chance, same weak service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Really good chips and salsa. Great chicken nachos. Beautiful view on the river. Our bartender Aaron was WONDERFUL. The only downside was that their bathrooms were not really up to par and I hate drinking cocktails out of a plastic cup."}
{"text":"Really 2.5/5  This place has a long way to go.  3rd time here (9/4/16), still no different.  Lets start with the good  -Good Location, great views - Nice Patio, lots of gas heaters for cooler nights, plenty of chairs, good place to mingle -Corn-hole, Jenga, ping pong and chess are the games you can play outside -Decent drink prices, pretty good happy hour  The Bad Service, Service, Service, this alone makes up for 2.5 of this rating.  Waiting 10 mins for  a drink.  One shorter guy (little older) straight up ignored a few of us guys and only served women, well, good job because now I don't tip you, and because of your terrible service, the rest of the bartenders suffer.  Its so bad, that I actually ordered 3 beers at once so that I would not have to deal with the turtle speed service.  If the service doesn't improve, I can see this place closing like the other 2 restaurants that have already closed in the Flats.  Hey Coastal, how about reading these Yelp reviews, seems like I am not the only one complaining about it."}
{"text":"Very good flavor on everything I tried! Chicken bowl, Shrimp bowl, Mahi taco, jalapeño slaw and tomotillo salsa. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We came for my friend's Bachelorette Party and it was such a disaster. Upon arrival, we were told it would be an hour and a half wait. We had 8 people, so that was fine. Cut to two hours and fifteen minutes later and we still aren't seated. Two of the girls in my group finally went up to the hostess stand and complained. We finally got seated and ordered our food. When the food finally came out (it was 10:00 at this point and we had arrived at the restaurant at 6:30) it was cold. We were all so hungry that we didn't even care. We complained to management about waiting so long only to eat cold food but they didn't seem to care. We got our appetizers for free and 15% off our bill, but that was it. This place needs to get its act together, and get a bigger bathroom. The women's room only had 3 stalls! I don't live in Cleveland, but I wouldn't come back here even if I did."}
{"text":"I was in town with some colleagues from work and this place was right across from the hotel. When we first walked in we loved the atmosphere and vibe of restaurant. However I was under impressed with the service which overshadowed the mediocre food. Our server was in over her head and was very slow, by the time she came around we were ready to place our drink, app, and food order. One of our apps arrived before our margz and the other we had to ask for 20 minutes later (she obv didn't put it in). The margz were flavored water and not drinkable. The server had to explain before she gave us our drinks that it was the end of the mixer and that's why they were a lighter color compared to one of the other drinks at the table. When the food finally arrived it was nothing special. My colleague even found a hair in her food. The manager did comp our drinks and her meal, however if I'm ever in town I will not be stopping by this place."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed coming here with my girlfriend practically all summer long. It's a unique and in my opinion, much needed feel for Cleveland. It's almost like being on vacation while at home. The patio is probably what tops the experience off. This is a fantastic addition to the new East Bank Development. I would reccomend the \"Fried Icecream\"."}
{"text":"I came here with extremely high expectations due to everything that I've heard about this place. So me and a group of friends came and ordered almost everything on the menu to try it all out. My friend and her boyfriend both ordered 2 different kinds of fish tacos each, and my friend Kait and I decided to both get a different bowl and a chicken or steak taco. We all chipped in on appetizers for street corn, guac, and queso. The queso and guac tasted like it should, and the corn was ok. We expected the tacos to be a lot bigger than what they were. They were bite size tacos. But the worse part was that everything was bland, including the bowls. I eat healthy, and there are multiple ways to get flavor into a dish, and they just did not have any. The bowl was like eating rice and black beans straight up, and same went for the tacos. We are definitely not going back any time soon. It's a great location on the water. But the food is not worth a visit back at all."}
{"text":"I work in the service industry and have never experience service or food this bad. I have been here four times and each time gets worse. The food has zero flavor, you would be better off going to Taco Bell. The servers are incompetent and it took them FOURTY FIVE minutes to bring them our checks when asked. I ordered a steak taco that came out with onions and no steak, and when I told the server, it took thirty minutes to get me a new order. The atmosphere is amazing but it won't save this place."}
{"text":"Went last night and got the Bol ! prices were reasonable and the view was amazing and restaurant was modern, will be returning"}
{"text":"First time here... I got three tacos because I wasn't too hungry. The tacos are fairly small so I wouldn't have been satisfied if it was my meal. The fried oyster taco was soggy, so I'd pass on that. The crunchy shrimp and carnitas tacos were great, though. The sauces on the table added extra flair. The green is more savory and flavorful; the red is spicier, but not \"ruin my palate\" hot. My companions got a mix: a burger, a Sammy, a bowl and everyone was happy. Each of them got a taco in addition to their main course and it seemed to be the perfect amount of food. All in, I was happy, but I'm not dying to return. It's a good spot on the river for an unusually warm October night, so the views can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place ! Great service, fabulous food and such a fun atmosphere!!! If you haven't been here , what are you waiting for!!!!???"}
{"text":"Couldn't get near this place on the weekend so came on a Wednesday.  Still an hour wait to sit outside so we opted to sit inside which was so hot.  The portions are VERY small for price.  Chips are different and not in a good way. They tasted very stale.  Guacamole was below average.  Street corn was decent. Short rib meat was dry.  The only thing that would have made it worse was actually waiting for a table and then being this disappointed. If you must try, get a taco at the carry out counter."}
{"text":"Horrible service.Waited hours  ended up going to Alley Cat.Was thete on Labor Day weekend and they had a skelton crew working"}
{"text":"Great place for a Sunday afternoon. Mature crowd with kids. Fast efficient service and Lauren was amazing.Beauriful views on the patio. Jenna corn hole and ping ping games are available. Outside bar can't ask for more than this."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere absolutely terrible food and inexperienced service.  No tap beer, no blended drinks for a decent margaritas and out of steak for tacos.  We had a party of 8 and they forgot to call us to our table to start with.  We ordered taco, tamales, chips and salsa and two burgers.  The waitress was sweet but very shy and inexperienced.  The food order came out all wrong. They let us keep the wrong food but it took a long time to get the correct food delivered,  The tacos are ridiculously small and the chips and salsa are a joke!   We all felt they should be ashamed to call themselves Mexican food!   They would greatly benefit from a trip to Southern California to learn a little something about good Mexican food, the kind that keeps people coming back for more.  Sadly, I don't see this place lasting past the warm  months."}
{"text":"The scenery is definitely the strongest part of coastal taco-- and the 2 hot sauces.  Otherwise the tacos, margarita and service were sub par.  Thought it was just when it was new so I didnt leave a review but it hasnt gotten better"}
{"text":"now c'mon. salsa and guac aren't THAT HARD to get right! yours are awful. terrible! get someone to fix that right away. please? otherwise you'll never get any respect. location is great but the food needs work. make it happen."}
{"text":"Bar service was slow (20 mins+ for drinks), tacos were far below average, and service was awkward. Waitress moved our seat and the hostess came over and yelled at us.   The street corn and guac were good. Stop there if you're unfortunate enough to find yourself here."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. Great ambiance amd view right on the water. Fun games to play like a giant chess set and heatlamps for cool evenings. One time I had amazing service and the 2nd time my order was messed up twice. If they can get the orders right in the kitchen this place would be awesome :)"}
{"text":"Horrible staff especially security. They threatened many customers \"I will knock you the f*** out\" for going in the wrong door by accident. Minimum wage security, napoleon complex"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and view. It sits right on the water and if you can stand the heat I would recommend sitting outside.   Unfortunately the view is the best part of the experience and the food doesn't match. The tacos were decent but not great. They were pretty soggy and didn't have a lot of taste although they were packed with meat.   The service was also lacking. Even though the staff was nice it took a long time to get our food. Several tables were seated after us and ate and left before we got our food. Our waitress even came and asked us if we wanted dessert and we told her we still had not received our food.   You have to weigh what's important. If you just want the great view and atmosphere this is a good place. If you're looking for the best tacos, you won't find them here."}
{"text":"Great service, our server was extremely nice and helpful. The food came out fast and was delicious! The CT margarita was delicious and got the job done. The patio was the cherry on top, gorgeous view. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The food is AMAZING!!!! We got the grouper taco, chicken, shrimp and short rib and these were by far the best tacos we've ever had. Better then any place in pittsburgh! Great atmosphere, service and clean!!!!"}
{"text":"Food quality could improve a bit but this is still a great spot to have lunch or an early dinner . Beautiful spot on the water . Tropical feel with outside seating and outside bar .   The tacos we average.  Whole chicken looked really good . Next time I will order the chicken and ask for some tortillas and avocado  and make my own tacos.  The house margarita was very nice . I 'll be back soon for the drinks and a game of bags outside ."}
{"text":"The patio and location is what give it 2 stars. As far as the food it was not my cup a tea the tacos are super small, not fulfilling and expensive for no reason.  The service took forever and the wait was long for the table also.  Will I ever go back? Probably not"}
{"text":"Had an old friend back in town so we figured give Coastal Taco a try.  Got there about 12:30pm on a Tuesday, pretty good lunch crowd and happy to see that on Tuesday they have a selection of tacos for $2 each until 8pm.  The decor is very nice, with lots of white and a bit more upscale then I would expect from the outside of the building.  Seated out on the patio with a great view of the river and the West Bank, hard to beat the view.  Ordering is interesting since you have a check sheet for the whole table, but unlike Barrio or Happy Dog, you don't have the option to customize each item.  We ended up ordering one of each of the $2 tacos plus a couple of sides.  Service was good, but nothing special with a casual vibe.  We started with the side of chips with the roasted tomato salsa; a bit surprising that the chips are 5 good sized fried corn tortillas and a small portion of the salsa.  The good news is that the tortillas are tasty and the salsa was excellent with a bit of acidity and a nice punch of heat.  The side portion of black beans was better sized and very tasty with a good body and a very satisfying amount of umami.  The tacos come out all on a single tray, they are pretty little gems, well composed with quality ingredients.  All of the tacos come on a small soft corn tortilla, the size is such that you get 3-4 bites for each taco.  The mahi mahi taco was a nice balance with small pieces of fish mixed with the corn salsa.  The portabella taco was packed with well cooked mushrooms with the other items in the taco not making much of an impact.  My friend liked his chicken tinga and carnitas tacos.  We both were a bit disappointed with the crispy shrimp tacos; the batter was a bit too thick and overwhelmed the shrimp, the best part of the tacos was the cucumber slaw.    If you are going to Coastal tacos, expect well prepared high quality food, with rather small portions delivered in one of the most scenic locations in the city.  If you can get there on a Tuesday before 8pm, you can try some of the tacos at a more affordable price.  If you are looking for cheap food or to customize your tacos, this is probably not the place, you will do better at Barrio.  What Coastal Taco does provide is a fun and reasonably priced option with a great view.  Go with reasonable expectations and you should have a good time."}
{"text":"OMG, the food is horrible!! Terrible renditions of tacos. We tried one of each taco. The meat is overcooked, especially the short rib  (supposedly the best taco on the menu) and the crispy shrimp was a joke. Like one piece of shrimp breaded and fried into tiny morsels of overcooked nothingness. All the tacos are the same - like 1-2 oz of over cooked meat topped with cole slaw. Then, the guac and sals a and chips - do not order! Ours the guac was brown (oxidizing ) and the salsa trio all tasted the same. Shame on the Coastal taco to call their food tacos. Just nasty all around! On the positive side, the staff is super wonderful and the view/ location amazing. We live in the Flats. Really bad food concept that may make it on location alone. If you are craving tacos, order carry out from Bakersfield in Ohio City or Barrios in downtown or Tremont, then hang out and catch the amazing view sitting on the East Bank of the Flats, for free; without having to pay to sit at Coastal Taco's patio. This place is a joke. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"I went to Coastal Taco for lunch yesterday with some coworkers and I have to say I was impressed! We ordered the traditional guac and guac with goat cheese to share and then I ordered the crispy shrimp bowl and we also ordered a few ears of corn. Everything I got was great! The corn was probably the best with the seasonings they had on it. I also loved the decor of the place. Just be warned, if you order tacos they are SMALL. Some of my coworkers ordered these and they weren't kidding when they said it only takes 2-3 bites to eat one.  It is decorated in a Cape Cod/cottage style which I love. A touch that I loved is they have a giant fire pit that overlooks the river and the chairs have blankets tied to them in case it's cold. Such detail!  I can't wait to come back for a dinner or happy hour and sit on the patio and play the games they have and try the drinks."}
{"text":"Great drinks and tacos love bill!!! Just got a new menu with some great nachos and a fantastic new black walnut old fashioned"}
{"text":"Poor bar service. Very poor. Apparently the bartenders have \"zones\". Which means even if they are standing there leaning against the wall, and you don't have a drink they won't wait on you!! Food is over priced and under-portioned. Go to Chipotle!!"}
{"text":"Okay the service here is never great--there are always a bunch of people standing around, but no one taking your order. But for a $3 taco the food is always fresh, well-seasoned, and delicious. I am always satisfied and they have a fantastic patio and happy hour. I recommend the seafood tacos for sure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is awesome!! I would go back just for that reason. I've only been here once and I had the Cuban Pulled Pork sandwich. I thought it was pretty good and it was definitely filling. My friends ordered the tacos which were $3 each and the smallest...tacos...ever. This is no exaggeration. Our waiter was very good though...friendly, smiling, and knowledgeable.  The ONLY negative I can say about him was that he served me my beer in a can....no glass on the side....just a can. I don't even drink beer from a can at home, so this was very odd. Also, the prices are higher than I'd like to pay."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Amazing place to drink on a summer day. But do not not eat here. The food tastes subpar no matter what you get.   Once again, great place to drink on a summer day!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and ordered several tacos. All were amazing!  We had the Grouper, Short Rib , and Pork Al Pastor taco.  My wife loved the Grouper and I loved the Short rib tacos.    We also order s desert (apple empanada) was wonderful and a great end to our meal.  The cocktails are also tasty.   The space overlooks the river and has a nice atmosphere.    Our server, Lauren, was attentive and fun to talk with.  We're coming back tomorrow with friends."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and bar scene. They do have some awesome bartenders. They make the place worth your vist over the food. Tacos are small (smaller than Barrios) and not that tastey. The salsa and chips are pretty good...the portion size of the salsa could be slightl larger. I would come back for drinks and the atmosphere...just not the food."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. Mostly because of the free money they keep giving me to try it again. It's like a terrible date. You keep going cause he's pretty but when you go you remember he's only pretty but has no personality. That's what coastal taco is a beautiful atmosphere and fun games to play with terrible food and service. Stick to a drink their coastal breeze is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place ... great location,  nice food,  awesome atmosphere and its affordable. It's good for a soft kick it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a half star because of their horrible bar service. I have yet to try the food, but because my BF and I like to sit and eat at the bar, I doubt I will be returning. It seems like the waitstaff is great, but damn, hopefully they fix their bar staff soon. They pretty much only serve to girls wearing scandalous outfits - you're not Studio 54, get over yourself and make me that mediocre margarita."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Memorial Day 2018 after a cruise on the \"Goodtime III\" and it was wonderful. It was a beautiful (holi)day around 5:30pm so it was a little bit busy but the hostess got us seated almost immediately. The river views are awesome but choose to sit in the \"semi-outside\" area because it was super hot and sunny out but I didn't see a bad table anywhere in the place. Extremely friendly staff; several employees even aside from our attentive server stopped over even after our drink/food orders were in just to make sure everything was going okay at the table - it was really good service. I tend to be a bit of a picky eater but the food was delicious.... We all pretty much inhaled everything on our plates in 2 minutes lol...The tacos tasted more authentic and different (in a good way) over what you get at most of the Mexican restaurants; even ordered some to go.... Beautiful building and views, casual/laid back atmosphere, very friendly and fast staff, great food, and COLD beer!!! I would definitely recommend stopping in and I usually hate everything lol ;) Very positive experience here and seems very well run; props to the staff for doing such a great job on such a busy holiday - we hope to come back soon. Thanks again guys!!! :)"}
{"text":"If you are there now, STOP and RUN to Barrio. You are honestly just paying for the location. Everything else is blah!   I apologize in advance for the dramatics but it is totally called for. We had such high expectations because we heard the food was good and we were so let down! I really can't remember a time when I've had such bad service. First, We went on a Saturday night and expected to wait but because we heard the food was so good we thought it would be worth it. We ended up waiting about an hour and a half which wasn't so bad because there was a beer fest going on outside so we got drinks and walked around as we waited. When we got our table we ordered chips and salsa which aren't complimentary--at a Mexican restaurant I thought that was insane. Then we got drinks. I got a margarita which was worth 2 stars alone. Everyone else ordered beers. Then we ordered our tacos. I ordered a shrimp and steak taco. The rest of the table tried the chicken, mahi-mahi, and cod. Here's the crazy part: we waited an hour and a half for our food to come!!!! The table of 5 next to us came, ate their burrito bowls, paid and left all in the time it took us to get our food!!!!!!  And the worst part was when the manager came to the table to tell us she was sorry and tacos take longer than burrito bowls to make. Really??? It's the same damn ingredients, just in a different form!! I feel like they could have brought more chips and salsa while we waited, at least! But who cares about good service, right?! Finally when our tacos came, they were missing a few (mine included). I mean if you're going to take THAT LONG, at least make sure it's right when it comes out!!  When I got my taco, it was literally 2-3 bites per taco. They were so small and really only ok in taste! I decided to not order any more because I was ordering churros. I hadn't had any in so long and they are one of my favorite foods! So I ordered the churros and wait. Eventually our checks come about 20 min later and the churros aren't on there. I asked the server if she put the order in, and big shocker SHE DIDN'T. It was heartbreaking. I asked her how long it would take if she put them in now for takeout and she came back and said there were some orders before me. That didn't seem fair because I HAD ordered a while back! And at that point, I was done.  Final notes: the only comped us 20% for our meal from that fiasco. I would give them 0 stars if I could. The only redeeming qualities were the chips and the cool location.   Seriously, stick with Barrio!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service. Will never return. Food is mediocre and the fact that service outweighs the beautiful views and atmosphere means we will never come back."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio for lunch today--the atmosphere at this place is awesome, and I have nothing but positive things to say about it: our waiter, Dan, was extremely fun and friendly--and also came right out to our table with waters (which was wonderful as it was VERY hot outside).  I highly recommend getting the Corn on a Stick as an appetizer (having a toothpick or floss with you is encouraged), but the mayo aioli and spices are both messy and amazing!  I was weary about trying this place after reading the reviews (perhaps they were all for dinner/happy hour which I cannot vouch for), but contrary to what I read, our food was fast, silverware and napkins are located at the table, and yes, you can split a check--each order form has 4 columns, one for each person--and you can use more forms if you need them, so I was confused when someone's review said it wasn't allowed here?  Dan had no problem splitting ours exactly as we requested.  I will be back to try more! (the steak bowl was delicious, by the way, and we split the S'more in a Glass for dessert :)  )  Overall, Great Location, Great Atmosphere, Great Service, and Great Food!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ( my husband and I ) were so excited to try Coastal Taco in the Flats of Cleveland. We waited almost a month to see if the poor reviews we had read previously on Yelp could be just beginning business glitches. But oh no they were not! First, we arrived at 6:00pm on a Tuesday evening and asked to be seated on the beautiful patio outside since the weather was amazing. We were told it would be an hour wait to be on the patio. So we sat right away inside. While we were waiting  to be greeted by a waitress (took a while) ...I walked outside on the patio to just see it and appreciate the beautiful views...While doing this, I counted 8+ empty tables. I came back inside to ask the hostess were those tables all reserved. I was told that they did not take reservations except for large parties. I asked her why we could not sit on the patio...I was told that they needed to wait a while between seating guests on the patio because the staff needed time to catch up! Are you kidding? You build a beautiful coastal themed restaurant on the water in Cleveland and you don't staff it well enough so any guest who wishes to sit on it is able to do so?! ...Well, once we got over that big disappointment, we ordered our food and drinks. The next big disappointment came with the food and service. Our waitress took  our drink orders and we never got them until AFTER we ate our food!  The marguaritas ($9 each when not on special) were very small glasses and on the rocks. No frozen variety offered. The tacos are extremely small as well and look more like appetizers instead of entrees. You have to order at least three to make a meal. We ordered chips and salsa since it is not offered like most Mexican style restaurants. When they came, the chips were two tostado shells  that one has to crumble up to dip in the small container of salsa. When we asked for a few more, we were charged extra to get two more tostado shells. Yikes!! Towards the end of the meal, I asked for an ice tea. When I got it, I requested a lemon slice. My waitress brought a slice on a napkin and it looked like it has been sitting in the sun for a while. I never used it in my tea. My final thought about Coastal Taco is I am sure people will keep going there for the views, but my husband and I will not return. We will be heading to Tremont to visit our favorite restaurant Barrio. I am a coastal girl, but I could not have been more disappointed by our visit to Coastal Taco. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Really like the variety of tacos my wife and I tried. We really liked the Coastal margaritas. Haven't tried the main menu to review everything. Regardless, the atmosphere on the patio is as good as you will find in Cleveland. Do not miss."}
{"text":"What a beautiful view of the West Flats and Lake Erie. East Bank is always busy and parking is ridiculous.   The have so much activity if you ever get a turn to play. Patio is always fully packed and loud. We got our food with an hour and it was alright. For being a Taco place i was surprised they werent better but they are only $4. The  enviroment is energetic, fun and drinks were delicious but pricey.  They do have a place in front that is dog friendly too. I will be returning but probably for the view."}
{"text":"We rode our bikes here on a beautiful Thursday night around happy hour. The place was very steady busy. We were seated very quickly in the bar area outside and had two great servers (One was in training and the other was helping train him). They were both helpful and had a great sense of humor. Patio area is awesome.  Our mojitos were amazing (and great happy hour price). We got 6 tacos between the two of us and tried 6 different tacos (steak, maji, carnitas, portabello, short rib and I actually forget the 6th but it was a fish one). All 6 were great. The tacos are nice and on the smaller side. I called them \"two-bite tacos\" as you can probably get two large bites out of them. They are made with solid quality and fresh ingredients. I feel the need to write a good review because I feel people are slamming this place on yelp because they are visiting during insanely busy times (i.e. Cavs finals) and just tearing this place up. They just opened and I'm sure they are working out some kinks. I had a great experience and hope that others will give another chance. The food is delicious and the drinks were too. I plan on visiting on a Tuesday for the $1 taco specials.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"It's hilarious that this place is as busy as it is after reading all the bad reviews and realizing I should have listened beforehand, saved myself some time and effort and gone to chipotle or barrio or just about anywhere else.   Warm beer. Warm. Beer. Forget about everything else as this alone is a mortal sin. And then after a complaint to the bartender who with a chuckle offered a cup of ice ? [ice-I shit you not] unreal.  Our server saved herself by continually apologizing for the kitchen and bar staff but it also seems that this place is incredibly understaffed.  Water tastes like it came from the river outside.  Food was in a word- forgettable.  The second star is for the second tray of tacos that came out after we cashed out which only goes to show how much the staff aren't on top of their game. They were offered to us for free since they couldn't track down who they belonged to.  Coastal taco needs to step their game up and be worthy of the location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"- Great experience here.  - Got steak tacos and carnitas tamale -- both were excellent.  - Guacamole could have been a little larger but definitely tasted good. - When the weather is nice, this is a great spot to sit outside and enjoy being by the water."}
{"text":"When a restaurant's names includes two of my favorite things, I have to try it. Unfortunately, the restaurant itself will not be one of my favorite things.   PROS ~~Patio for days~~ This may be one of the best patios in downtown CLE. Right on the river, you can catch a beautiful sunset sky at one of their outdoor tables on a comfy couch, drink in hand. And it's pretty spacious, too, so don't be shy about inviting your friends to join you.  ~~Get your drank on~~ The margarita I had here was one of the best I've had in awhile. Strong and tasty.   CONS ~~Tiny, tasteless tacos~~ I was most looking forward to the tacos and unfortunately, was most disappointed by the tacos. We were warned about the size before ordering, but I was still surprised by it when they actually came out. I ordered the tuna ($3.50), shrimp ($3.50) and chicken ($2.50) and was really underwhelmed with the flavor and the size.  Unlike Barrio, you don't create-your-own tacos, so whatever comes on it is what you get. Considering this, the better value and more custom taco is at Barrio.  ~~Service was a little shady~~ We used the NoWait app to put our name on the list before walking over. Pretty clutch. When we put our name on the list, the wait time was 20-30 minutes. We ended up waiting close to 45 minutes. The hostess came over to ask how our wait time compared to what was estimated and we told her that information. A few minutes later, we look at the app and the history of our reservation disappeared, as if we never used the app. Our thought is that they get dinged by the app company if they can't stick to their estimated wait times. Something smells fishy, and no it's not the tacos.  ~~Where's my chips and salsa?!~~ So this one I'm not 100% sure about, BUT, we had to order chips and salsa rather than getting complimentary chips and salsa. We ordered the flight of salsas, which was okay, but I think that chips and salsa should be complimentary and immediately served when sitting down at all Mexican restaurants, but that's just me :)  BOTTOM LINE ~~This is a solid place for a happy hour, but don't stay for dinner~~"}
{"text":"Long wait, staff was not well trained, portions are EXTREMELY small. The tacos are bite size. Drinks over-priced and come in a mini plastic cup, and they charge for 'chips'."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland I never expected to find good tacos. I found great ones!  Along with the cod and carnitas tacos I'd orders, chef George Motos insisted I try the oyster taco. Fantastic. I live on the west coast, I travel Mexico extensively and these (small) street tacos with fresh homemade tortillas and salsas are as good as anywhere."}
{"text":"Food drinks and atmosphere are always the best here!! Summer and winter. Guac with goat cheese is so good! Prices are good for everyone."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to try the food. We were told there would be a 45 minute wait. After 45 I checked in at the desk. They told me it was still 45 minutes and I was 6th on the list. 20 minutes later i, it was still 45 and I had somehow slid to 7th on the list. Finally after an hour and a half of wait time I went  to check in again. A woman at the desk complained that she and her party of 5 were waiting for an hour; they were seated before us. The staff was unprofessional and rude. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service (waitress took 15-20 to bring by water, salsa, and napkins ALL at different times), food wasn't great (brought us the wrong tacos twice), and the waitress brought us our check for $47 and then swiped our card for $57 and didn't bring us back an updated itemized receipt. While the manager fixed the check, what should've been an hour dinner turned into a two and half hour visit of just waiting for water and messed up orders.   Also I'm from Nashville and this restaurant is just a much crappier rip off of Bar Taco. (Literally Coastal Taco tried to copy them on everything)  https://bartaco.com"}
{"text":"Unfortunate waste of an absolutely beautiful location. Visited on the first week of being opened and spent about 3 hours of waiting for service, drinks, and food, half of which never arrived, and the other half of which was cold. Decided to give it another try about a month later hoping the first time was just a struggle at the beginning. There was a 2 hour wait to get a table, however they wouldn't even take our name because the waiting list was \"full\" and was advised to check back every 20 minutes to check. While waiting at the bar just to get on the waiting list to eat, we witnessed at least 10 empty tables. Extremely frustrating experience."}
{"text":"I will say they have improved since they first opened....only in the food department though as the service still leaves a LOT to be desired. Our waitress took over 10 minutes to greet us on a Wednesday night when they were not crowded. I had to ask for my drink twice and still waited almost a 1/2 hour to get it. (It was only a Diet Coke). I wanted to order a cocktail after my meal but she never came back until it was time to give us our checks. The food has improved. My short ribs taco was fantastic but my crispy shrimp with jicama slaw was cold and tasteless. Glad they changed to flour tortillas from corn. My chorizo queso was great. This place is lucky it is so well decorated and has such a great patio because as far as the food and service is concerned I can get much better elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Service is poor. Lots of servers and bartenders milling about but no urgency to serve customers. Ordered soft shell crabs which were sodium laden! No spices. Just salt. Chef came to the table to apologize and said he would make them without all of the salt.....still insanely salty. Server placed dirty dishes from next table on ours as she was clearing it (throws up in hand). Just not a good dining experience. Drinks are hit or miss. Great view, poor service and marginal food. Street corn used to be great, but you can see the shortcuts they're taking since opening. And you have to pay parking to boot. AVOID"}
{"text":"I came in with my friends last night. We were a larger group so we called ahead. We had Marrisa, she was very kind and super attentive to us as a large group. We got some chips and guacamole; wasn't impressed with the portion sizes, chips or guacamole. Your street corn was super good with some hot sauce on it and your carne Asada tacos were the bomb. I could have done without the Burning river or Chicken tinga tacos and been happy with another corn or steak taco. Churros made up for some, but not sure if I'll be back! Kind of out of the way for me, for subpar tacos and guac."}
{"text":"Yuck- this is by far the worst margarita I've ever had. I even splurged for their premium margarita and it tasted like straight sugar water mixed with grocery store pre-made mix. Like a lot of the spots down at the flats, quality is just not their game. I would much rather prefer a Bakersfield or other high quality spot and sacrifice the view on the lake."}
{"text":"Disgusting all around. The RUDEST waitress ever who actually stopped coming to the table after bringing everyone the wrong drinks, we actually had to flag someone down who then ended up be our server. When we got the correct drinks they were disgusting. How hard is it to make your signature margarita??!?! We got some of the food we ordered and some of other tables orders. Whatever, it was edible... Barely. THEN the table next to us had someone so drunk that they literally threw up 5 feet away from me. I get it, not the restaurants fault but you would think someone would clean it up. WRONG! 10 min went by in which we told about 17 people and no one did shit!!! But don't worry they had time to give us our $30 bill.... Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This place opened 7 weeks ago. As of today, they have worked out the kinks and it's fantastic!!! The atmosphere is super cool and I felt like I was on vacation! Our waiter, Kevin, was super nice and fun. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"The most beautiful place to eat tacos! However, that's where the positives stop.  Each taco was $2.50-$3.50 each and the size of my forefinger.  The flavors were a mixed bag (I ordered the Chicken, Mahi Mahi, Pastor, and Blue Cod)....some were better than others, but overall I think they were on the bland side. Also, for the $10 I spent on the 4 mini tacos, I was still really hungry.  I really wanted to like this place, but the only reason I would come back is to enjoy a cocktail while taking in the view of the river.  If Coastal Taco really wants to compete in the neighborhood, they're going to have to step up their taco game...If Barrio were next door, Coastal Taco might have a difficult time staying in business."}
{"text":"One star is based off of service alone. Unfortunately we didn't stay long enough to taste the food. We went to the bar to order 3 drinks. Service was quick but quality was terrible. The house margarita tasted awful. We didn't mind waiting for a table. We sat out side and enjoyed the views. We noticed that there were multiple empty tables. People started seating themselves but were asked to leave the table. After 25 minutes of the tables still unoccupied, we left. It really wasn't even that busy...."}
{"text":"This was a fun spot to end up with friends after a day of drinking in the flats. The house margarita was good and reasonably priced. There were about a dozen $4 tacos to pick from; we each picked three and were fairly satisfied, though next time I'll probably add on some sort of side dish to complete the meal. The barramundi good a great review and my favorite was the short ribs. It was loud but it fit the energy and mood that we were in!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Drinks are super expensive and not even good. And the food was meh. Not super impressed with the overall experience."}
{"text":"If tacos are your thing, pass on Costal Taco. I can't help but compare most tacos in Cleveland to Barrio, and unfortunately these do not come close. They small and unsatisfying for the price.   However, this silver lining to Costal Taco is their location. The outdoor patio overlooks the Flats and is great for a nice summer/fall night of drinking. I came for a friend's birthday and we had a great time playing with their outdoor jumbo Jenga sets!   My advice: if you're coming to Costal Taco, eat before and just enjoy drinks and a beautiful view of the Cuyahoga river!"}
{"text":"Everyone in our group agreed at the end of dinner that we might as well have gone to Taco Bell. I gave Costal Taco 2 stars because of the atmosphere and the potential the restaurant has! We got to Costal Taco around 6 on a Saturday and there was a 45 minute wait, no big deal. We got drinks from the bar and we're able to hang out by the water and it was great! We got set at our table and ordered our dinner and the goat cheese guacamole for a appetizer. I am not exaggerating when I say it took 45 minutes to receive our guacamole. Our waitress told us multiple times she was going to check on the guacamole and we finally received it after the third time asking. Our dinner came out about 20 minutes later (1 hour wait for tacos) and it was average and room temperature. One person in our party didn't receive the side she ordered but she decided she didn't even want it because who knows how long that would have taken. Overall, the food was just average and didn't make up for the slow service."}
{"text":"Will I ever get to eat here? Probably not - & at this point, I probably don't even want to. I've tried to go to Coastal Taco three times now, at varying times of day, & each time, we've been told that their waiting list is \"maxed out\" & that they stop taking names when it reaches a certain point. The hostesses recommend you come back in 20 minutes just to see if you can then be put on the forever-long waiting list. But respectfully... who the hell wants to wait 20 minutes just to see if they will then have the privilege of continuing to wait another God-knows-how-long minutes? Just to eat $3 tacos? Yeah, bye.   This place is supposed to be great, & I'm super-interested in eating here - or I was, until this happened multiple times. I understand that it's a hot new spot & that The Flats are bumpin' these days, but this is just one in a string of a few strikes against all these hot new restaurants in the area, all of which seem to be a little too big for their britches right out of the gate - & this particular policy is just so pompous & absurd that I can't even wrap my head around it. Doubt I'll try again."}
{"text":"Literally the worst margarita I have ever had. I went with two other people, we ordered a round of margaritas and the dinner ended there. The margaritas were so bad we paid and left without finishing our drinks. It is a great location, great energy but after that I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here last week for their Taco Tuesday. Obviously, this place has a great view and location. Despite the negative reviews, we were open to giving it a try and we were pleasantly surprised. The service was good and prompt. Everything came out warm. The food was delicious. We had a good time and would come back again. Only downside was not being able to customize the tacos and the ordering menu was a bit confusing. Definitely give this one a try!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, amazing drinks and a view of our gorgeous city-- what could be better than that!?  We popped in with a party of 10 last night for a birthday celebration. I was worried about them being able to accommodate such a big party with no reservations (they don't have reservations) but we lucked out with a great, long table right next to the water. Our server was awesome- very helpful and always there when we needed something. Drinks were AMAZING-- I had the Coastal Breeze and loved it while my husband tried the CT margarita and was happy with it. Our friends got chips and a variety of salsas, I tried the chicken & rice soup (thumbs up!) and all in all, it was an awesome experience. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"You have to know what to expect when you go to Coastal Taco. You're not really going for the food... sure their tacos are okay but I would expect better for a place that has the word \"tacos\" in its name. You're going for the vibe and the patio. Honestly the coolest patio in all of cleveland. It's so relaxing. It's right on the water and there is cornhole boards and giant Jenga. It's really awesome. There isn't anything else like that in cleveland (that I know of). Food is served late too so that's cool. Bartenders were busy so service was just eh. Drinks are definitely overpriced, but it could be worth it to have a few and spend some time out on the patio!"}
{"text":"I don't understand this place's low rating....it did take a long time to get seated, but that's because there were so many people who wanted to eat TACOS!! Once we were seated our server was really cool and fast and working her @ss off running around. From the time we ordered and got our chips & dip app it was lightning fast. Food followed not far behind. We went on a Saturday late night. Are the tacos the best I've ever had? Nope, but they were pretty d@mn good and I got to devour them while looking at beautiful views in a place with a good chill party vibe. The patio was packed but the fire was going and seats w tons of pillows comfortable or space to dance to the DJ playing R&B throwback hits. It was a fun night, we'd go back for lunch or late night tacos again."}
{"text":"Waited 13 minutes to get a drink at an empty bar because the bartender was too busy texting. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy"}
{"text":"Came here on July 4th and the place was packed as expected...found 2 seats at inside bar and decided to stay there for most of night...bartender was busy and took him a bit to make our drinks but not too bad of a wait...after 30 minutes of waiting for a table and not getting one we opted to eat at the bar...taco menu wasn't huge and we tried about 8 different kinds...none of them stand out to me and thats the reason for the three stars...service was what i expected...food was average...nothing wowed us...if were in the flats and want tacos we will probably go back....but wont go out of our way...."}
{"text":"I would give a 0/5 star rating if I could. Abysmal at best.  Gross food. Horrible service. At least the environment is decent."}
{"text":"Terrible tacos, guac and salsa are OK. Margaritas are good, but small. Very overpriced. Terrible service. Would not go here to eat again, the only thing going for it is the location."}
{"text":"Not so sure why everyone hates on this place. Great food - fast service - cool atmosphere. Always packed when we have been here. Food is consistently good and very fresh. Drinks don't disappoint either. Staff is well trained and very mindful of the fact that service counts."}
{"text":"Two stars for the location and scenery.  Go here if you want a drink right on the water but this place has some serious issues that need to be worked out or it will not be around for long.  We went on the second day of a three day weekend.  We put our name in and were told the wait would be 45 minutes,  Almost an hour later, we checked in to find out they had removed our reservation accidentally.  Not a big deal as they found us a table and were very nice.  And I will point out the servers are very very nice.  However, there were eight of us and every order was messed up in some way.  They were out of several items on the menu (again, second day of a three day weekend - you would think they were prepared for that).  Food came out so sporadically that some of us were done eating 30 minutes before others got food. The food itself was pretty awful.  I had to go to the kitchen to get condiments for the table because we asked for them but they never arrived.  It also took an hour to get our check and it was wrong.  The view and locale is amazing but if this place doesn't get its act together quickly, it is not going to make it.  Cleveland is not known for its beautiful weather and I would never recommend or go to this place for just the food."}
{"text":"Coastal has one of the best views and patios in Cleveland. It's a great place to relax, sit back and enjoy a margarita... Which cost $9 but thankfully are strong!  I don't recommend coming for dinner. With $3 for one taco-I would expect them to be larger and more flavorful. The salsas and guac come with only 3 large chips which you break up - and then they charge you $2 for more when you run out and still have most of your dip left.  Curious to see what happens in the winter time when the view is snow and the patio can't be used anymore."}
{"text":"It was awesome! I ordered a bols and needed silverware that was not available on the table so asked the server and he never came back but our neighboring table had plenty so we got a fork from them. The view on the deck was awesome! The food and price for Tuesday was a welcoming bonus! Half price on certain things on the menu! We are going home to the central Midwest and will attempt to recreate our tacos and bols we devoured! Kid friendly menu and very fast service! If I come back I would definitely dine again!"}
{"text":"Love any establishment on the water in my city. Patio is awesome here! Service staff is very helpful and friendly (Monica in particular). Even the busters are engaging. The menu is unique for a Cleveland restaurant and flavor is there, however the tacos are on the small side. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I live at the Flats East Bank apartments across the street from Coastal Taco.  I've given them 5 tries to make good.  Every experience was its own brand of awful.    Summarization:    horrible service  (even though there are more employees at CT than any other bar around except maybe punch bowl) and horrible attitudes from the servers ( I've heard on multiple occasions the servers/bartenders openly and rudely talking publicly about their guests or talking the same way about their fellow workers. Loud. Obnoxious. Middle school like complaining),   food quality is horrible  (tiny tasteless portions for big tasteless bill)... There are much better places to eat than CT in the east bank flats area,   drinks are pricey except a few specials on Tuesday,   they have messed up my check twice  (wrong food items or wrong prices... If you do brave this place. Double check your check),  Good view of the river. I recommend eating and drinking somewhere else and then enjoying the boardwalk if you want to be by the river.  I tried my best to get behind this place, especially wanting to see the area flourish, but they need A LOT of work and I really hope that they read these reviews and make radical changes because they are running themselves into the ground and we don't need poorly operated businesses around this area."}
{"text":"As reported by others- poor food, great view! Sullen servers and bland flavorless food (salsa like ketchup, guacamole did not taste fresh). Shrimp tacos were terrible. Mahi mahi tacos were passable. The decor is nice, and the view is great. Had so much fun watching paddle boarders, crewers, boaters and ferries going under the big blue bridge on a 75 degree night."}
{"text":"Best place to go downtown for a great Margarita and some fresh Mexican food. You are really paying for the great atmosphere. You feel like you are on vacation when you are there. They are on the CLEseats app so I was able to save 15% on the whole bill. We had a large group and saved $20. Those Margarita's do add up!"}
{"text":"Nice setting and fun outdoor area, but the food was just bad. Generic, cheap flavors, bad ingredients, uninspired tacos. Nothing tasted fresh or different.  Maybe a good place just to grab a drink, but I'd skip the food.   Additionally, the service was terrible. Got a lot of our order wrong and took forever for everything."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the hotel across the street and made our way to this GREAT restaurant! Let me tell you, get the Coastal Margarita! You could easily drink a whole pitcher of those! We had a great server named Bria and she gave us some amazing recommendations for dinner. We have tried different restaurants in the area, and my wife and I both said that she has given us the BEST service of all the restaurants we've dined in. Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"With any new restaurants, this one had a few hiccups after opening so I was hesitant to go based on the reviews. However, we had a great time. The patio was still open in November on a warm day, and the place was busy. We ordered margaritas which were only $5 during their happy hour (which is longer than most) and tried tacos and a rice bowl. The margaritas were delicious and strong, and the food was good, as well. The decor is amazing, and you feel like you are sitting outside when you are in the restaurant. There is so much natural lighting! They spared no expense when they opened. The outdoor games are great for groups, or families with kids. I've tried to go before, but twice there was an hour and a half wait! Reservations recommended during nights, especially if you want to sit outside. Definitely give this place a try, or go back if your first experience wasn't great!"}
{"text":"Definitely good but not as good as other local options like barrio or Camino. Our server (Carlos) was fantastic and the churros were phenomenal, but the tacos and the tortilla chips were just meh and more expensive than the aforementioned alternatives. Not on my must go back to list, although I'd be willing to try it again to see what else their menu has to offer."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience at Coastal Taco. The servers were tentative (even for how busy they were), cheap good food, and a great mojito. Music was great! All around awesome experience - I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"So my first experience was not that great. The server I had was very nice but not attentive I had to grab other servers to cater to our table. The second time I came was absolutely a blast! The food was really good and the server, Erica (I think it was) was a lot of fun! She was very personable, way more attentive then the last server I had and she was very knowledgable about the menu. Most servers nowadays just take your order and give you your food but this girl was working her butt off to make our experience a better one. She would take the time to actually have a conversation with our table, made us laugh and got us to try (just about) everything on the menu(ahi tuna tacos are me favorite). Now I'm not sure if it was the better experience that made the food better or what but I love the atmosphere and the location and the prices were decent. I will definitely come back and recommend Erica as your waitress!"}
{"text":"Most of the bartenders were uninterested in providing service, despite not being very busy. Served me the wrong beer, took it back and then they told me they were out of it. Didn't try the food, only drinks. The wonderful location next to the water is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. Really chill and relaxin!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a hot Friday afternoon before happy hour. Beautiful decor and view on the patio. I could sit on the patio til sunset, it was so relaxing.   Barrio type menu.  We only ordered chips, salsa, queso, and guacamole along with beer and wine.  The chorizo queso was delicious and had a substantial amount of choizo so that each chipful contained just enough. I enjoyed the guacamole as well. I did not try the goat chees quac since. I hate goat cheese, but I hear it's great too.  Specialty drinks are expensive, but wine and beer are more reasonable.  This would be a great place for a date, a group, an afternoon lunch, happy hour stop...whatever you feel like!  But you MUST sit on the deck and enjoy the view!  I do recommend coming at off peak hours to secure a good seat!"}
{"text":"You can't feel more apart of the city than on the waterfront here. The positive vibes, beautiful views and aesthetically pleasing decor makes you feel right at home whether you are in the soft seating, at the bar inside or in the beach chairs facing the water. Cleveland comes alive here.  Around the perimeter adjacent to Bier Head are corn hole boards, ping pong tables and jinga to partake in when you think you're ready to compete or attempt to after a few drinks from their diverse menus.  Regarding service, it was very slow and it is hard to tell whether it is from opening recently or the bells and whistles are not all in place, but be patient. Everyone is new at the beginning! Look past and check out the views or have a drink.  I did not have food, but only a drink, which this place is great for coming to before going out or just for a Sunday night. Ladies, the restroom is in the back right corner and the hook to hang your purse is not on the door, but blends in with the wall too!"}
{"text":"Ross provided quick service of our appetizer, drinks and tacos. The tacos were on the smaller side without a variety of toppings but very delicious. The main draw to coastal taco is the location- sitting outside overlooking the river is incredible in the evening."}
{"text":"Coastal Taco puts out some pretty good food.  On a recent Friday evening visit, I had some drinks and ordered the Cuban sandwich (Cubano).  While I've had more authentic Cubanos, this one wasn't bad.  It was actually a pulled pork sandwich with nothing other than pork and bread in common with a traditional Cubano, but it was good.    The pork was tender, smoky, and juicy.  The side of chips were crunchy, but somewhat tasteless.  The side of cole slaw was spicy as if it had some fresh ginger in it, but didn't taste like cole slaw.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal.  Those in our group who ordered tacos had to figure out which tacos were theirs because they were all served on one tray.  So lets say each person orders three different tacos and there are six people in your group.  That's 18 tacos.  When the tacos are delivered, they're all on one tray.  They all look alike and they're small - the smalled tacos I've seen, in fact.  Now your server is pointing and squinting at the tacos trying to discern which flavor is which.  You're puzzled because you have no idea which taco is which.  This brilliant scheme needs to be removed and each order needs to be made individually and served on a dedicated tray.  Silliness, I say!  Haven't the owners/chefs been to Bomba's Tacos & Rum in Rocky River where they do this taco thing correctly?  Bomba's tacos are twice the size and served to you on a discrete tray.  I think the people in my group that ordered tacos would only give one or two stars to Coastal Taco, but since I yelp, I knew to avoid that fiasco based on the bad reviews. I was nearly done eating by the time the figured out which taco went where.  Plus all those hands touching your food before you get to grab your tacos from the tray?  No thanks!  Great location, slow, but friendly service on busy nights.  Maybe stop in for a drink and an appetizer when it's slammed, ya?"}
{"text":"Wanted to like the place because it's a great location. Didn't get even a water for 25 minutes after we were sat. Food came out quickly but didn't get our starter until after the tacos. Food was lackluster at best. Lacked flavor and at the size of the tacos they should be $1 each, not $3. Also missed part of our order but decided to cut our losses and run rather than have it corrected. The cocktails may have been strong but the flavor mix was bitter rather than enjoyable. Overall, save yourself the money and disappointment."}
{"text":"Five stars for the outside patio and the view.. Coastal Tacos on a sunny day is just absolutely gorgeous. They have lots of outdoor seating-tables with umbrellas, chairs, ping pong, cornhole, jenga, and just a great place to sit outside on a nice day.  The food itself though? Meh. I think there are much better options in CLE like momocho, barrio, and la plaza.   Came here with my foodie girlfriends- all three of us were unimpressed and thought it was overpriced (probably bc we're used to the quality and food in the above noted places).  -Cocktails: meh, not very good.  -Guacamole: for $6, it's kind of a ripoff. They give you a tiny little bowl of guac (and it's nothing like momocho's guac), with four flat medium size tortilla chips. That's it. When you ask for more chips, they say \"oh that'll be $2 more\". Huh? What kind of place charges for more chips, my girlfriend exclaimed.  - Tacos: we tried the angry ahi tuna (prob only two tiny bites of tuna, not that flavorful), BBQ carnitas (nothing great), and the tinga (not the spicy flavorful chicken I'm used to for tinga). My girlfriends were also not impressed. Also, the tortillas were not great quality either.  So, if you just want a nice view and don't care about the quality of the food, check out coastal tacos. But if you're looking for quality of food, there are many more places on the west side of CLE that are loads better."}
{"text":"This review is only based on the service we got to find a seat...which was unpleasant.  We walked into Costal Tacos and were greeted by two hostesses watching a video on their cell phones. We were told to go outside to get a seat and out the back door. So we went outside and looked for help and walked around awkwardly.  We found a waitress who stared at us, asked us what we were doing here, and snapped at us that there was a wait and we need to go back to the front.   Overall everyone just seemed to be pushing us out of the way. Maybe they were just having a bad day, but it sure didn't want to make us stay. We ran away from this restaurant after that."}
{"text":"The architecture with its distressed white walls, open space, and hints of blue throughout give the place a sense of coziness and welcome. It's too bad any resemblance of invitation stops there.   Given there are dozens of people on the payroll, no one seems to be working.  The wait staff scramble around like they are blindfolded.   If you can somehow get seated, don't expect a waiter to come to your table and don't expect anyone to acknowledge you or look you in the eye.  There is clearly no table / wait staff coordination. I blame this on management.  Once the wait staff get beyond the surprise that you're really not invisible and are there to eat, they are quite friendly...albeit scattered.   In the off chance you get to actually order anything, expect to be disappointed.   I know that making tacos is not cooking:   It's assembly.  However, some places like Barrio do a fine job.  This place is like more like high school cafeteria on taco day.  Don't let the low price fool you:  you need to eat about 20 tacos to fill you up and it would be one sad one after another.   The margaritas are sugary, will hurt your teeth, and will leave you gasping for some Cuyahoga River water.    I would like this place to succeed. However, when you can't execute the simplest food concept ever I'm not sure it will."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did.  But unfortunately the service and food leave little to be desired.  The best thing on the menu is the goat cheese guacamole and the margaritas are delicious.  The tacos, salsa and rice bowls are very lack luster.  I ordered a mahi mahi rice bowl and asked for brown rice, I got white rice, and the fish was rubbery.  There was no flavor to the bowl at all.  The tacos are the size of your palm if not smaller.  The salsa is watered down and you don't get chips with it, you have to pay for chips separately.    The margaritas, however, are delicious. And the patio is amazing.  The views of the river and the Flats are unbeatable.  The atmosphere is great, this is a place to day drink and party, not to eat."}
{"text":"This place was vile. Food tasted like something you'd get in a middle school cafeteria in a bad school district. Should have gone to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Audi was great, tacos were amazing!! Pork al pastor was the best!!! I got the chicken tinga and the steak. Party of 4 and we got a few crafts of margs.. drinks are a little pricey, but everything was wonderful! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Coastal Taco has been bookmarked since it opened and for one reason or another, I kept skipping over it. No more. Restaurant Week drew me in... as it usually does. The offer from Coastal Taco seemed like a great value- guacamole, 2 salsas, a taco ten-pack and dessert for $30? That's more than enough to feed 2 people!  So the bf and I invited our friend Matt (who can throw down some chow) and we popped over to Coastal Taco on a Tuesday night. The flats were kind of quiet, obviously, but it was easy to get to and find parking. So many people are intimidated about coming downtown or the flats- please don't be!  A hostess greeted and sat us right away. First response- this place is so fun. It has an eclectic, whimsy but chic beach vibe. Casual chairs, exposed Edison bulbs, wicker light fixtures (sounds weirder than it is). Our server was fabulous. She was friendly, served us super quickly and made sure to clear dishes away.  We decided to order 2 specials, which I was certain was going to be too much food, but seriously, the guys can eat. This is MORE than enough food for normal people! The chips served are not thin and delicately crispy chips you get in your neighborhood Mexican restaurant. These are full tortillas, deep fried until golden and nice and crispy and sturdy. They'd need to be, to hold all the delicious guacamole and salsa!  I tried both the traditional and the goat cheese guacamole. I liked both, but there's something about the salty, creamy bits of cheese that enhance the avocado.  When it comes to salsas, I'm a pretty standard chick. But these three salsas were all so unique and delicious, I still can't decide which one was my favorite. I was afraid the roasted tomato one would be too hot, but it wasn't. A perfect blend of heat, smokiness and tomato goodness. The tomatillo was kind of sweet and tangy. The pineapple, which was sure I wouldn't like, was nice and chunky and had lots of sweet juicy fruit in it.  For the tacos, we decided to get a combo of everything except the Spanish lentil. The boys didn't share so I missed out on the mahi mahi, but everything else was very good. Chicken Tinga was nice and juicy- lots of sauce and flavor and very hearty. The cod was a slightly over-fried so it was crispy, but still delicious. I just love cole slaw on a taco. The pork was a crowd favorite. More fruity juiciness and a perfect balance of savory and sweet. The steak was my least favorite. I don't know if there was a topping or seasoning I didn't care for, but it tasted a little dry and earthy. Maybe overcooked?   The tacos were small, but not tiny. I ate 3  1/2 tacos and I was quite full. Somehow though, our table ate all 20 tacos.   Dessert came and I was insistent I wasn't going to try any. It only took a few moments to give in- the fried ice cream was to die for. What a perfect combination of warm and cold, all sweet and creamy wrapped up in a warm blanket of goodness. The apple dessert was good too.  My favorite part, surprisingly, was the margarita. I find many restaurants make a weak or too strong margarita. Maybe I'm picky. But these margs were going down so easy. Delicious, simple and classic. BF tried the Coastal Breeze and it was fabulous. Not too sweet but definitely satisfyingly fruity. Do yourself a favor and start with the traditional margarita, then move on to the Coastal Breeze.  I can't wait to go back when I can take advantage of the gorgeous patio. What an awesome meal and a great value! Not just at Restaurant Week!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Our bartender, Ethan went above and beyond to please my picky taste in beer! Definitely will return ASAP!"}
{"text":"Tacos are okay. I had the trio: cod, chicken and a third fish one. The most memorable is the cod for some reason. The tacos are huge. They came with a chicken and rice soup which was bland with no chicken.   The wait was around 25 mins for lunch take out, so they offered to deliver them which is nice but it took over an hour to get them. We didn't eat lunch until around 2. If you don't normally deliver, I would say, don't offer it just to be nice. I don't know if the wait was really 25 mins or if they were further behind and therefore offered delivery? Who knows."}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place.  I would definitely go back if I ever had the chance. We I sat at the bar where all the action was.  Our bar tenders were great. We got the margaritas which were just alright to me.  Between my boyfriend and I, we got three tacos and split them.  We got the shrimp taco, the short rib  taco, and fish taco. We even had the chorizo white queso which was pretty good.  The short  rib taco was the best to me. This place is right off of the water which was really nice."}
{"text":"I'm going to start unusually, by setting expectations.... First, if you're looking for cheap tacos, you shouldn't be going here.  Second, if your looking for normal ground beef tacos, again, you shouldn't be going here.   Remember, this place has to survive 7 months of frozen popsicle, so I don't expect cheap during the 4 nice months.  Now, on with the review!  Really nice setup, bar opens up to the inside and outside, small under-cover area by the bar with heaters for moderate days, but today was s balmy 85, so pion the deck!  Great view of Shooters/Music Box across the river, steel drums playing, it was great.  Tried 3 tacos, shrimp, steak, chicken, all were good, and yes, they are small and $3 apiece, but let's not go back there!  Nachos and salsas were very different, but good!  If you're hungry, you'll need 5 tacos, or maybe get a Bol instead.  All-in-all, I give them 5 stars for location, ambiance, and taking a chance on Cleveland.   I give them 4 on food, and a 3 on the silly steel pans they serve on (restaurants, can we please go back to basics and have plates?!).  Well-rounded 4 stars, too bad there are now so many other places to go around the flats, if might take me a while to get back!!"}
{"text":"Oh my. I like the beachy decor and year-round summer vibe, but unfortunately all the great planning did not make up for the food.   I like tiny tacos, but these were tiny AND lackluster. I tried a baja fish and short rib taco - very little going on here and looked like they were prepared by someone who did not care. The meat was dry and you get one tiny fish stick size piece of fish. Also they used flour tortillas...ugh, should've been corn.   The guacamole and chips were also a disappointment. The guac tasted like it was from a package and the chips were stale and not warm. The tomatillo salsa had to be from a jar, the pineapple salsa definitely suffered from lazy prep work - with oversized jagged diced pieces of pineapple and hardly any heat or other flavor. I've made better salsa  and guac at home - this is not how you want to feel when at a restaurant paying for your meal.  The only highlight was the drink - I had the 'Coastal Breeze' - it was good. Also our waitress was friendly and service was quick (not too many people there at the time we went)."}
{"text":"Came here for taco tuesday because I called ahead to make sure it was taco tuesday but when i got there around 9 the server told me that it ends at 8:00 pm! I ordered the hot salsa and pineapple salsa. The salsa itself didn't have much flavor but the chips which is round and flat was very delicious. Next i ordered chicken steak and ahi tuna tacos and also a chicken bowl. They are all served family style which means big tray with all the tacos. The tacos itself was very small. Regular tacos are medium flour tortillas but their flour tortillas are rather small. The ahi tuna tacos were my favorite but the others one were just okay and plain. The chicken bowl is small and not too much flavor in it as well. If i ever come back here it would be for the chips and some ahi tuna tacos and maybe thats all."}
{"text":"Great views right on the water, excellent patio. Wait staff is friendly and efficient. Food offerings might be considered limited by some but we thought it was perfect (and Gauc w/goat cheese, why hadn't I thought of that). Perfect price point and its great for either families with kids or just the adults."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, great patio. Very busy night. Sitting here 30 minutes after ordering food. Received our black beans first not our salsa. Beans are sitting here getting cold with nothing to eat them with. Bar is overwhelmed. Didn't take our card then asked once drinks were ready. I'm sitting at the table behind the bar and the customers at the bar are tapping me to get my order at the bar now?? Where is the table service. I'll go back to eating my beans with my straw now."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Server kept telling us how it was his first day and how he didn't know anything. Very professional. All the tacos are bite sized with little to no flavor. The drink that I got was so watered down that I forgot that I had an alcoholic drink and not water. At least there's games outside."}
{"text":"We came in w our 3 year old after a long day on the road from Chicago. Place was beautiful, right on the water and looked brand new. It's was about 8 pm and only a couple tables in the restaurant with guest. The hostess was nice she accommodated us as we asked to be in corner alone. So our child didn't bother anyone. She explained the menu and the way of ordering. I assumed she was our server. So was asked about kids menu and she said there were chicken tacos. We ordered that for our child. I also ordered a margarita. Shortly there after a young lady, for get her name, comes by and say hi I'll b your server. She was a young short Caucasian female w dark like no hair. She explained our food had been ordered. But for me it had already been a while. Took a few to get my margarita and took a few longer to get chips and guacamole. She then just disappeared. I needed assistance and had to go to bartender. No one else was even in eye sight. The bartender was eating at the bar w a guest I assume. I asked for my server and he after finishing his bite of food very nonchalant says what did she look like. I saw her pass by. So I go to the table. Bartender acted as if he could care less I needed my server. We then got our meal it was just ok. Shrimp tacos had TWO shrimp on each. Steak tacos were horrible. Chicken tacos were very good. I needed another drink. She was no where to be found. So once again I got up hostess saw me and then she comes out. By this time I was a lil aggravated. We ordered mango sorbet. It took forever. My kid started screaming because he was also tired of waiting. So I got up went to the line and told hostess to cancel my sorbet. She tells kitchen and I could hear cooks giving her a hard time. Especially the tattooed female. Then the chef. I assume. We asked for our check. Sorbet was still on the check. My wife paid as I had to leave w my screaming kid. For the sorbet. Food would have not been an issue if service was half way decent. I don't like giving bad reviews but the owners or managers need to know about this particular situation."}
{"text":"Great location, beautiful decor, service was good - but food was ok. Nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Really surprised at how good the food was. Best nachos I've ever had. Wonderful decor and location."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, all had a smile. Our waiter Aaron was helpful and very cordial. The Coastal burger was better than average. 10 degrees warmer and I'm sure we would have loved eating on the riverside deck."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place too- great patio- restaurant is stunning- food and service- a totally different story.  My first time there I tried the guacamole and a few of the tacos.  No flavor- really bland.  Service that afternoon was good- sat at bar- great bartender.  Went back last night to try again; I like to give a place a few tries especially if it is new.  Wow...got a seat at the bar- okay- never acknowledged- asked a bus boy if he could send a bartender our way- felt they were too busy- are you kidding me???  Finally got a bartender- never a nice hey sorry for your wait my name is.... nothing- asked us what we wanted to drink- I had to ask for a menu- it was like an inconvenience.  Reviewed and placed order- got the Cuban pulled pork- when I got my food it tasted like it had been reheated or microwaved- boring taste- pork was tough- their chips are still not good.  No one asked how the meal was- can I help...people this is customer service and you have a small window of opportunity before the snow flies and your restaurant is dead.  Totally disappointed and will steer clear of taking any clients to this place.  East Bank looks great- but these restaurants need to really up their game in customer service."}
{"text":"Not a place to come for \"dinner\". It was more of a bar that offered low quality food. We came in very hungry and left highly disappointed. The staff was very friendly, but certainly overwhelmed.  The view was phenomenal. We even commented how close we were to the water and were not being attacked by bugs.  I can't comment on the drinks as I only had water but it appeared they offered a nice selection and possibly a happy hour that people were celebrating nearby. The games looked like a lot of being were enjoying themselves - giant jenga board was highly distracting to try and hold a conversation nearby while people played and lost. The tacos were the size of the palm of my hand and for $3 I could get a more filling and better seasoned taco at another Cleveland favorite. Our server suggested 4 tacos for the guys. However, we each decided to get a taco and a bowl. The bowl lacked flavor as well and thankfully came with a lime to enhance the overly cooked mush that was rice. The salsa were mediocre. The red salsa tastes more like marinara, verde was ok nothing special and the pineapple was good but again nothing special.  I do hope the kitchen improves with time as it did seem like it could be a great place to enjoy on the water. Hopefully I will be able to had another star in the future."}
{"text":"Paying for location, not food. The tacos were mediocre, you are better going up the street to Barrio's. Very expensive for a baby taco. I can get the same taco in Los Angeles for a dollar and better quality......"}
{"text":"I drove down hoping it would be a nice place to grab some carry-out with my friend for my last night visiting in Cleveland... Well to try to expedite things, went online to the website to order carry-out. The page and option are there, but non-functional so I called and asked if I can put in a carry-out order.... The person answering said that they can't take orders over the phone and I would have to go to the bar for that. So we drove down, found parking, and went in to the bar. Just inside the main door there is a counter that says take-out orders with a woman behind a cashier. I asked if I could place an order, again she says she can't do that and I have to go to the bar. (Ok what is she being paid to do then!?) Went to the bar, waited 15 minutes before I could flag down a bartender to take my food order instead of other people's drinks. Bartender said it would take at least 15 minutes for a Bol order and there wasn't even a chair to sit down on. It's just not worth all this for a taco bowl!!   Now that I actually took the time to yelp this place. I should have expected a not-so-easy experience from the other reviews. Oh well! Teaches me to yelp a place first next time!!   Logistics - 2 stars Food - ??? stars"}
{"text":"Went to this place with very high hopes only to be disappointed.  The service was very rude and got the feeling i was just on their way by ordering my meal.  Once I actually got my food it was mediocre at best.  They did have a good desert.  Def better to go to Barrio up the street."}
{"text":"This is a hard place to rate. The view is amazing. The vibe is wonderful. I could spend hours on this patio enjoying the breeze, scenery, drinks, etc. There are Adirondack chairs, fire elements, and a great set up of white tables and blue cushions and pillows that make for a great \"bar + chill\" atmosphere. There are also games like corn hole, ping pong and jenga available for free. The patio really is award winning. 5 stars.  That aside, this place is one of my worst service experiences to date. It took long to be recognized at the bar and even longer to close out the tab. It took long to have a waiter show up at our table and it took an hour for 10 small tacos to come out. Not enough staff is not the issue either.   The taco order forms, which were initially missing from our table, have name lines so you can put the order for multiple people on one sheet. There were two people at my table and we each made our separate selections. The tacos came on two separate trays, but were not divided based on our order making that part of the form pointless.   The tacos were small. Seven of them are $2.50 and some $3.50. On Taco Tuesday the $2.50 ones are five for five dollars which is a great deal. The pork and chicken tacos I found to be too be dried out / over cooked. The fish tacos (specifically the mahi mahi and the swordfish) were the best out of all the ones I tried. The other problem was that all the tacos, after taking so long to come out, were not very hot temperature wise.   Overall, a disappointing experience. I'll keep this place in mind for drinks, but don't come if you are in a hurry or starving."}
{"text":"Super overrated, overpriced, basic tacos. It was just alright. Nothing fancy , nothing specific to even call you in or even attract you. I went in because I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt of what people say about it, but now I know why. I experienced it. But our server was great to add that good note. So they get points for good customer service. I just thought the rest about the food."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars, but only because of the outdoor area. Outside, they have a great patio area where you can play cornhole, yard Jenga, and other outdoor games. That in itself is the best part about this place.   The food is mediocre. With so much taco competition in the Cleveland area, I expect more out of the restaurants boasting tacos in their name. The tacos are small, and the flavors are... fine I guess. I'm a taco fanatic, and I love a good taco... but I honestly wasn't that impressed.   I also wasn't impressed with the service. The service was poor-- our server barely talked to us after trying to rush us into ordering. We also waited longer than we should have had to for our food.   Honestly, if you're looking for a view or for some outside fun you can come here. If you're looking for good food, go to barrio."}
{"text":"This place is a cool spot right by the water. They have ping pong tables, life sized jenga, and corn hole. The food is decent but there wasn't a wow factor for me. The restaurant is fairly new and still needs to work through some kinks. Not all the staff know the table numbers and therefore food was going to the wrong tables. Our waiter disappeared for almost a half hour because I think he had too many tables to wait on and was swamped. Prices are pretty decent though and I'd check it out again to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"Tacos are $3 a piece and tiny (3 bites per taco). We also ordered the goat cheese guacamole and it was not special and the chips are tasteless. Service was not very good as they forgot to bring the appetizer and brought main dish before the appetizer, which they eventually took of told the bill. Service was slow. Atmosphere was cool but not worth going back."}
{"text":"Went to grab dinner on a Saturday  nite with a buddy and his wife and expected  a wait which was fine . Had a great view to take in and chit chat while we waited . We ordered chips and salsa for appetizer and it came out when we were just finishing our meal and asked our server why that happened he say so many tickets going to kitchen that they get mixed up . Like this is a common thing . I was warned  about terrible  service and small tacos but had to try out . Tacos are very tiny but delicious  . Asked for cheese on all tacos I ordered and was told that I can only have cheese on the  ones that already have it included on them . Pretty strange . I would go back to have a drink if I was hanging  in flats but would definitely  not recommend  anyone to set a dinner date at this place. This place will probably  last but just because of location and the view."}
{"text":"The tacos are super small for what you pay for. If you think of the size of a tea cup plate, that is the size of pita bread. Also the fish was not hot at all. The tacos were lukewarm. The only positive is the alcohol that got me drunk to forget how much I spent on these dinky tacos"}
{"text":"LOVE their street corn, salsa sliders!!! So good and great environment! Bartenders are great! Tacos are ok but it's really about the environment, location on the water and their street corn!!!!"}
{"text":"Service poor.  Food and drinks overpriced. And food average at best.  You will spend $25 for a drink and a few tacos and you'll be disappointed by the lack of flavor.  I don't know how a new restaurant could be this bad but it is.  Only good part is environment but we won't be back even though we live next door."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the chill atmosphere here! The location on the east bank of the Flats is great & the outdoor eating area is fucking awesome! It is RIGHT on the Cuyahoga River so you can sit & watch boats, and the world, go by.  The service was good & the tacos were ok. Would like to go back and try something else.  The setting is what makes this place cool.  And, it's right beside a free water taxi that takes people to the west bank of the Flats and back."}
{"text":"It's 83 degrees out today and outside patio dining is on my mind! Tacos and margs sound good so head to the flats. Got a table outside but unfortunately no umbrella on this blazing day. Maybe 3 total umbrellas on this fairly large patio. But what is more upsetting are the heat lamps that are on. When asked to turn off, response is owner doesn't want to. Huh? Food...meh...marg...don't order the batch and upgrade....chips and salsa are no tortilla chips but a full tortilla. Not my thing. All in all, just ok. Bummer."}
{"text":"Lovely & lively atmosphere on the river, delicious chicken nachos & sangria, prompt & friendly service - loved it!"}
{"text":"3rd time is a charm let me tell you. Try to give this place a THIRD chance and bring a friend along. She ends up getting the portabella bol because she wanted to try something new. What she ended up getting was charcoal with some Spanish rice. After her trying to shove it down her theoat she finally threw the towel in to say it was the worst meal she has ever had. The residue of the charcoaled mushroom left the worst after taste that you wouldn't believe. This was the worst item for her to order for her first time being there. But the waitress that helped us out was very helpful throughout the whole process and even took the our meals off the bill. Can not believe that this was yet again another horrible experience."}
{"text":"The view and patio is absolutely amazing. Comfortable outdoor seating with great views of the river. Unfortunately the service, or lack thereof, made us leave without trying any food or drinks. We were promptly sat by the hostess at a great table outside. 15 minutes later, no one had greeted us or delivered menus. Finally, we flagged down a waitress who apologized we hadn't been served and said she would send our server over immediately. 10 minutes later, waters were delivered by a hostess, but still no server. We asked the table next to us to borrow their menu and they told us they had to walk up to the bar in order to get any service. The table on the other side of us was complaining about not being greeted as well. We decided to leave before wasting our money and any more of our time at this place."}
{"text":"One of the three hostesses immediately sat us a table directly in the middle of the patio. After 15 minutes and several attempts to flag down a server, one finally approached and said no one knew who was supposed to serve us. Five minutes later, we finally had water. The reluctant server asked how to make one of our drinks. This place is awful."}
{"text":"I always go to coastal with an open mind, but every single time leave extremely disappointed.   Here's my laundry list of issues I have with this place:  1. You can expect horrible service. No one seems to know what is actually going on In this place. It's like they are all walking around with their heads up their butts.   2. When you finally get your food, the server 9 times outta 10 can't name which tacos are what. Which is extremely helpful when you are with a large group.   3. Speaking of food- it's the most mediocre food on the planet. Tacos are small, queso with chorizo is disappointing & they make you 2.50 for extra chips! Which btw the chips are almost always stale.   4. For a taco and tequila place, the margaritas are way below par. Way too much mix & never enough tequila.   While the atmosphere is pretty it's never worth the wrinkles and grey hairs you will get dealing with their staff."}
{"text":"In a word HORRIBLE. The tacos were the worse we ever had! I had the shrimp. It tasted like the shrimp implanted in my taco was scraped, discarded, from the patrons plates the night before. My wife's steak taco was conceived the same way since it was served stone cold. Let me put it this way. I kid you not... TACO BELL is 10 times better than this place!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review, but because of the horrible service and bad food at Coastal Taco, I felt it was necessary. Saturday at 5:30, the place was packed. Very lively, great crowd, amazing views, great patio to sit on and chat with friends. That's where the positive ends.   I know the place is new, but I still think there should be more of an effort put into it. The place is chaotic and not at all organized. The hostesses blend in with patrons, so you have to just look for a confused girl with an iPad if you want a table. The wait is long, but that is expected. Service was absolutely awful. Our \"server\" was useless, unfriendly, and borderline rude....it was as if this was her first serving job, and it should be her last. No help with explanations of food items, and she was definitely acting as if waiting on tables was an inconvenience to her. Looked at our checklist order sheet and was bitchy when she couldn't read the markings. Not one nice thing to say about her. Someone else brought our food, she stopped back once and you could tell it was killing her to ask how we were doing. Being a server myself, I know that service can make or break a place. A restaurant like this COULD be lucrative for servers, but not the ones we observed. We finally had to find the server and give her money so we could leave. Over-tipped her, because I'm sure it would take forever to get change. Hopefully that tip motivated her to maybe attempt being even SOMEWHAT pleasant?  The food was not good. Tiny tacos thrown together. Meat was chewy, food was flavorless... I would not order food here again. My friend got one of the bowls, and it was okay, but nothing special at all.   Bussers walked around the patio a couple of times to clean up empty glasses and trash. However, it wasn't enough. Lots of stuff that needed picked up, but not enough clearing of seats/tables. I saw a ton of employees, none that seemed particularly rushed or enthusiastic. Maybe pay a few HARD workers who like money, instead of a bunch of lazy people who like slacking?  The bartenders work their asses off so they are one of the few positives. Again, the place is chaotic and disorganized, but they hustle. Drinks are fine, prices are pretty much on point with the area.   The patio and view at Coastal Taco is amazing, but the food, and especially the service, is horrible (pretty much a theme with the reviews). Because of this, I would go back only to hang out and have a drink or two with friends before moving on to a better establishment."}
{"text":"Had a great time here and sat outside during a beautiful day! The drinks were great and the tacos were fresh and delicious. Good for big or small groups. Will definitely go back when I'm in the flats!"}
{"text":"No flavor in the food, weak drinks, unhappy servers.      Over all don't waste your time coming here, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Just went there for a late lunch in the warm water. Service was incredibly slow, like painfully slow. We ordered everything at once and received our tacos first. We had finished our meals before we got our salsa and drinks! One person in our party ordered a beer and we had to remind them multiple times and finally got it after we were done.  Food is just meh nothin great but not the worst. Very small portions for the high prices.  Overall would not recommend."}
{"text":"I only gave two stars because this restaurant has a great location near the river.  Food was tiny and bland.  We got approximately 6 chips with our salsa and quickly ran out with salsa to spare.  A carafe of margarita was 52$!!!  Service was slow.  Waiter screwed up our bill.    I Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, and a great time.   Costal Taco is amazing! My first trip was a night out with friends and their drinks were great and the atmosphere was fun. They have a great view, fun games, and a nice outdoor lounging area. My second trip was a lunch out with work friends and the food was delicious and the seating was great for a big group and everyone in the group was pleased with our meals. They also have great french press coffee and desserts.   But it was the third and most recent experience that blew me away the most. I reached out to Costal Taco to see if we could cater a fundraising event through them. Their staff was super friendly. They were very helpful and walked me through the whole process.They came into our office to set up a taco bar for our \"taco Tuesday\" event and we had more than half the office join us for lunch (and most went back for seconds). They set up the lunch room, served the tacos, answered any questions we had, cleaned up, left us some swag and most of all were such a pleasure to work with. I didn't have to lift a finger and it was 100% stress free, which is amazing if you're the planner of the event.  Thanks to Costal Taco we were able to surpass our fundraising goal for our Walk to End Alzheimers team and we could not be more thankful.  Needless to say, Costal Taco has a new #1 fan!! There will be many more trips to come! :)"}
{"text":"The quality of the atmosphere is great, however the quality of the food was very disappointing. I ordered three different meat tacos on soft tortillas and first off, there was very little meat in each one. Secondly, there was no flavor! It was as if they used no seasoning! I also ordered chips with a flight of salsa. The chips were incredibly bland and so were all three salsas! The salsa literally tasted like water. The only saving grace of my experience was that the margaritas were solid and the atmosphere was fun and inviting on a nice sunny day. I live in San Francisco but commute to Cleveland every week for a consulting project. Maybe I'm spoiled having access to so many authentic taquerias in SF but come on guys! Tacos and chips/salsa are such easy things to get right and if you do them right, you will have a gold mine on your hands with incredible repeat business. Check out either \"Tacolicious\" or \"Tacko\" in San Francisco for inspiration. You really need it!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and view with terrible service and the most un flavorful Mexican food I've ever tasted. We sat at the bar and waited for about 10 mins without anyone acknowledging our presence. I then waved and yelled \"excuse me\" to one of the bar backs who then told us he would grab a bar tender, in the meantime the couple sitting next to us said they had been waiting to order drinks for about 20 mins prior to us sitting down. We ordered our drinks which were pretty good minus the fact that they don't carry staple liquor and beer options (i.e. patron, corona, etc.) We also ordered the tacos, queso and a burrito bowl. After I realized that 40 mins had gone by and we still hadn't gotten our food or been asked if we would like our empty drinks refilled I noticed that the food that had been sitting on the corner of the bar for the past 15 mins looked like  what we had ordered. I once again had to get one of the bartenders attention and was then told that it was in fact our food. I then told them that it had been sitting there for about 20 mins at that point and asked if they could just heat it up or something but he said they \"don't have microwaves\" and said he would put it in again. We weren't waiting another hour so I said no and that he could just remove it from our bill and give it to me. So I guess the bright side was that we ended up getting our cold flavorless food for free."}
{"text":"Feelin' like a relaxing day is what your mind, soul and stomach needs?  Coastal Taco will glide you right into that kind of vibe and then provide you with the element of surprise, too!  I've been during the warmer months where you can sit outside and stare into and across the water while the sun beams down on your hair making you feel warm and alive, just waiting for that taco to arrive and take your taste buds on a wild ride.  I've also just recently been during the colder season where I sat inside and enjoyed the very fun Nautical themed decor and the beautiful glimmer of their bar.  Nothing shabby about staring into the deep abyss of tequila varieties and sparkling cocktail glasses.  I'm a pretty standard lady with a fairly basic set of taste buds at times.  That's not to say I can't enjoy some crazy pairings, and I certainly do, but generally my mind gravitates towards the simple.  Because of this, I've had the Chicken Tinga taco quite a few times.  Well seasoned and marinated chicken hits the spot - the quesa fresco and smooth lime crema adds just what I need.  I usually take a little of their red salsa in the center of the table, which has just the kick to spice things up a smidge!  Do it, I triple dog dare you!  I've also tried the quesadilla, the nachos, the bowls.  Pow!  You can't go wrong.  You CERTAINLY get the bang for your buck when it comes to the bowls.  Mucho impressivo.  This last time I tried the Burning River taco and I would DEFINITELY do that again.  It had a nice spicy \"ancho\" ranch, buffalo inspired hot sauce over marinated chicken, tasty shredded cheese, in a perfect sink-your-teeth-into soft tortilla.  The margaritas were also delicious - not too sweet, not too sour - just right.  The strength was there but not overpowering.  A job well done!  I would certainly pass through Coastal again - or should I say - I plan to coast on in to Coastal soon.  That's definitely how you feel your experience here unravels.  Just coasting along without any effort... a smooth ride!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a restaurant in the flats that can handle a group. However, I was underwhelmed by the food. Tacos were good, not great (I'm comparing to Barrio/Bakersfield). What really disappointed me was the margaritas. The house margaritas are made in batches, which were very inconsistent depending on who made the batch. The batch I was served had so much mix in it that it was sour - I sent it back and ordered a beer."}
{"text":"Go here for the scenery, nice outdoor seating, and there are outdoor games and bar. This is the only reason they don't get 2 stars...Not that into the tacos.  Drinks I found to be over priced.   Tacos are yummy but very small. I think they should cost less. They're approximately 2.5$ and can be consumed in 2 legit man bites.   Guacamole was nothing special, would not buy twice.  Also, you cannot get separate checks."}
{"text":"Taco was just ok.  Came for an alumni event after work. The atmosphere is great! Especially when the weather is sunny and warm! I was excited to try the street corn and I was a little disappointed . It wasn't sweet enough like the street corn I usually get. The tacos were just okay. Needed more flavor!"}
{"text":"Lunch Service was pretty spotty, just like I experienced when it first opened.  Took too long to get seated, too long for food considering the crowd, too long to be checked on.  The menu is pretty limited and it's not particuarly inventive.  Great social atmosphere and decor, but I'm in no rush to go back. : Chips with salsa, spicy roasted tomato salsa, and guac. Pineapple salsa was super plain. : Chopped salad.  Decent portion and taste, no meat : Chicken bowl with black beans and mexican rice.  Decent portion size, tasted fine.  Enjoyed more once I added hot sauce : 2 chicken and 1 steak.  None of which are worth writing home about.  Apparently the steak just flat out wasn't good.  Overall....meh"}
{"text":"Was a perfect day to walk around the Flats and finally check out Coastal Taco. I love the beach, vacation theme. It was about 2PM on a Friday so not real crowded, but a steady flow of people at the bar.   I got a mojito and my daughter ordered a margarita. Both drinks were heavy on the sugar. The chicken nachos were good, but when we were served no one gave us utensils, napkins or plates---really?!  There were plenty of bartenders, but we felt neglected. We had to ask for water twice before we actually got it and I went to the service cart myself to get set ups.   In conclusion, it has a nice sort of vibe, but service could definitely be improved. I would return to try the tacos and perhaps a not-so-sweet drink. I would only hope customer service is better then.  Since we sat at the bar, it would be nice if they provided purse hooks."}
{"text":"This could be a great place to eat. It has a nice patio and the food is acceptable. The food was not outstanding but perhaps you are paying for the location and not great food. The food was good, the selections were good, just not great.  You are paying watch boats go by and judging by the service, you will see many boats go by. We had six in our party and the wait was about 45 minutes, not too bad considering it was a late Saturday afternoon.  But that was just the beginning of the wait. After the waiter took our drink order, it was a very long 15 minutes before they arrived. Did the waiter take our food order when he brought the drinks? No. Another 15-20 minute wait on that. We asked for drink refills when we ordered food. Another long wait for those. The food took about 30 minutes to arrive.  The day was hot, about 95 and we were thirsty.  After the food was gone, another long wait to get the check and about ten minutes to get the receipt to sign. Maybe because they just opened up and don't know how many people to staff a Saturday night but being in the business, you would think they would just know how many people should be working. Either they are understaffed or just don't know (or care), is anyone's guess. It was two hours from when we sat down to when we left. Awful service, food is too pricey for the horrible service. Next time I am in that area, I'll go to Crop Rocks."}
{"text":"Great view...... can't say much for the customer service. Bartender was rude and condescending. Manager was too lazy to open the outside patio. Said \"looks like rain\".  Yeah, not so much as we ended up drying off the chairs ourselves and enjoying the sunshine #costaltacoonasunnyday"}
{"text":"I love tacos and had high hopes for this place but I was very disappointed. The service was terrible. Very slow with everything. We didn't even get a menu until about 15 minutes after sitting down.   It took about 15 minutes to get beers and they were warm. Like just came out of the box and never hit the freezer warm. We told the bartender and he laughed and said \"we don't have anything cold right now\" and gave us a cup of ice. A cup of ice for beer!? Gross.   We got the salsa sampler, which was pretty decent, but you only get about 4 chips with 3 salsas. We got extra chips, which again was like 4 more, and they never told us there was a charge for them. $2.50 for an extra 4 chips. Ridiculous. The food came out randomly and wasn't even that warm. The tacos are tiny and not that good.   Maybe once the craziness of this place dies down it could be better but I won't be back."}
