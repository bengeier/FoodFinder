{"text":"Food is always delicious! Our server was Maryann and she was absolutely delightful. She made a great experience even better! Love this place and would highly recommend the crispy chicken platter"}
{"text":"I have been to J. Alexander's three times and my meals were all amazing!  You can't go wrong with their chicken salad sandwich and macaroni and cheese - yum!"}
{"text":"Weird experience here. Kitchen is open and the manager on duty yelled continuously at the staff -- so loud it ruined our dinner. Food is good if overpriced but I don't think I want to listen to that yelling again."}
{"text":"We ate here Tuesday, there were 5 of us.  The food was great and it didn't disappoint again.  Our server Carla was awesome, the service is always great, but she was perfect, friendly, warm and attentive.

They have the best Caesar salad; the Macaroni and Cheese is awesome, gooey and warm on the the inside and a nice crust on top, I had the chicken strips which are so moist.  Others had fish tacos, steak, prime rib and burger - all were cooked just right.
My pear martini was yummy and had great flavor.

We finished with Carrot Cake, which is the best I have ever had; no matter how full I am, I always get this.

I gave 5 stars because I can't believe this is a chain (we all know how they usually are) and we have never had a problem with anything ever here.  The food is consistently excellent, particularly for the price."}
{"text":"Dinner last night for 6.  Reservations got us seated quickly and all staff were very friendly.  We ordered about 15 minutes after being seated, nothing complicated and did not get served our food for almost 45 minutes.  Drinks were also slow getting to the table and then my drink wasn't quite right.  The manager and our server were very accommodating and helpful to rectify and get us served.  Food was terrific!  Steak burger, old fashioned cheeseburger very tasty.  One of us got a steak dinner with mashed potatoes that was raved over.    Will return."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of J Alexander's for a very long time but i have to admit my visit last night with my sister, who had never dined there,  was a little disconcerting.  I have a disease which affects my digestion and as such cannot eat a lot of protein and very few fruits and vegetables.  I was overjoyed to see that the vegetable plate had tomatoes, zucchini, carrots and broccoli. Well I can't eat broccoli but I figured I would just get extra carrots, no problem right?  WRONG!!  To my dismay the waiter told me I couldn't substitute another vegetable for the broccoli because the vegetable plate is pre-portioned!?! WTH??  Do they portion out the vegetables on a plate early on and when you order they microwave them?  I don't understand.  Then he tells me that if I don't WANT what comes on the vegetable plate I can pay an EXTRA $4 and get what I want plus the portions would be a little larger.  I again tried to explain i just can't eat broccoli can I do extra carrots or even get one side items off the menu.  Again blah, blah, blah pre-portioned blah, blah. Then he tells me \"Or if you want to substitute one of the sides for the broccoli you can do that.\"  What?  That's all I wanted to do in the first place, but guess what?  I was still charged the extra $4 in the end!!!!  The moral of the story?  J Alexander's will only accommodate people with dietary issues for a price!! The whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths, literally.  The zucchini tasted very charred and was extremely salty and my sister's salad was also overly salty.  Our waiter in response said, \"For some people the chargrilled taste is too much. Sorry about that.\"  In reading past reviews the saltiness has been a previous issue which clearly has gone unchecked.  After last night I can't say that I will be singing the praises of J Alexander's anytime soon, which is disappointing."}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 to celebrate a birthday. Just to start this off--we had 6:30 reservations(all arrived prior to that time) and left after 9:00. As soon as we sat down, the order was placed and after the drinks arrived it was at least 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. That should have told us something. When our dinners finally arrived, the 4 baked potatoes arrived cold. Those were replaced but took awhile. Also the 2 prime rib dinners arrived & the prime ribs were also cold. We sent those back. It took almost 20 minutes to get replacement dinners. By that time, everyone was finished with there dinners but the 2 \"prime\"diners. The manager came by twice but did not seem to apologetic. The waitress offered everyone a free dessert for our inconvenience. When the check came, dessert was free but there was absolutely no compensation for the 2 botched prime rib dinners. Because I didn't want to ruin the evening for the birthday guest, I didn't want to cause a seen. But, the evening was a disaster. One that J.Alexanders really didn't care or understand our position. Also, another table was dissatisfied with their cold meals. Won't be back again!"}
{"text":"It was recommended to try this place when u came through Cleveland. Boy, was that a good choice. 
I went with the Prime Rib, and was overly satisfied with the dinner. 
Their lemonade is something different, some may like it done won't. It is not the normal lemons and sugar, but had a mixture of Sprite ame a few other things.  People thought I was nuts that it seemed like it was carbonated.  Not much to notice the bubbles, but the taste was there. The Sprite gave it that carbonated kick making it really good."}
{"text":"The introduction was great specially with greeting stuff then the appetizer and serf ace was on time and delicious the Cesar salad was having taste of garlic which I did not like much as it give spicy.
The surface was so fast I'm which our entree arrive before we are done with our soup and the appetizer .
The entree was perfect portion even we share some of it and finish our plate totally.
It is clean nice atmosphere with perfect light and nice quite restaurant with reasonable price that match perfectly the variety and all teats"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Cleveland!!! The food is fresh and delicious.  They serve a full meal - meat/fish, vegetable and potato - at a reasonable price.   Their house salad is the best.   I love their friendly and attentive food staff. You can't beat their week night specials and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything is great and all the food is made fresh from scratch. The filet is better than Hyde park or Morton's at a much cheaper price. The mac n cheese is absolutely dynamite. Service and atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great calamari, great ambience, food was awesome, would have been better if the sauce wasn't spilled all over our sandwich but I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Convenient for business people but not really a place you would call a \"restaurant destination.\"

Beautiful interior; friendly service; delicious entrees, but downgraded because of price.  A homemade veggie burger (which is mostly rice) on a big bun with some small shoestring potatoes is over $10!

Oh, and be careful with your check, there is a waitress there who can't count and will give you \"approximate\" change--she made a mistake by confusing my bill and payment with another at my table, and came back with her version of a correction.  When asked if it was all taken care of, she replied \"well, it's about right.\"

OMG!

PS I would say, a saving grace for them is there carrot cake.  By far, the best on the planet."}
{"text":"Overpriced pedestrian food. $40 for two small crab cakes and ice cold French fries. Maui ribeye was slathered in too sweet sauce. Almost inedible because of the sweetness. The loaded baked potato was microwaved and not hot. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I have loved this restaurant in the past.  Tonight's Asian Tuna Dinner salad was very disappointing!  The most boring dinner priced salad ever!  Field greens, onion pieces, wonton strips and tuna that had steak seasoning.  There were only 4 soft chunks of tuna which is less than the server stated.  The dressing offered was cilantro lime.  I've never had ahi tuna without sesame seeds and will never eat it here again."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I've ever had.   I have them often.    Good service.   Good price.  Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I hope I'm spelling it right, but our waitress Azarian, was absolutely amazing. I felt like royalty as she was checking on me (and my girlfriend) close to every 5 minutes or so. My girlfriend had some issues with the prime rib she ordered (twice), but the burger she was offered more than made up for it. Doug, the manager, went to very great lengths to make sure we were completely satisfied...and we are!! We are definitely coming back here again. Prices are decent, but the atmosphere and great food make the prices worth it."}
{"text":"The Spinach Queso Is A MUST.  Its a dark restaurant FYI."}
{"text":"Whenever i go here I always order the bayou which is a seafood pasta dish, it is ALWAYS excellent. It's literally the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I always get the cilantro shrimp and switch out my slaw for broccoli. When a place can make plain broccoli taste amazing with out adding things likr cheese, it is a winner in my book. I also love the pilaf rice, BBQ flat bread and queso dip. My boyfriend loves the Mac and cheese and the breaded cilantro shrimp and shrimp tacos. to sum it up EVERYTHING is good. to people who say this place is just like applebees or fridays...you need to stop smoking whatever it is your smoking. Ive never had candle lit dinner at an applebees or friday with jazz music playing."}
{"text":"More upscale than average. Fantastic house salad! Ribeye steak was a little mushy/grainy textured. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Meh, not worth it.  I ordered the City Club salad and when I asked for chicken on it our server asked me if I wanted grilled chicken strips (that she said were precooked and served cold) or if I wanted chicken breast.  First of all, I have to say this is PRECISELY WHY I do not like chain reataurants.  It is all about freezer-to-fryer and precooked everything.  For the price I expected the food to be better than it was.  Overrated.  Mediocre quality.  There are so many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP! Every-time I go here I get the roast beef. MMMM-MMMM-MMM GOOD! That's right I like to scream! Med-rare is the only way to go. Our server was wonderful. She was very polite, very talkative and didn't write anything down, very impressive. She did seem to be around our table a lot. Some people might hate it, I enjoyed it. At the end of the evening, we had a few to to boxes, she stuffed them with crescent rolls. Have you had their crescent rolls? No? Then you haven't lived! 

Save some cash for about 2-3 weeks and then have a great dinner with great rolls!"}
{"text":"This is a very reliable, higher end chain restaurant - Never a bad meal in any location. Hands down they have the best veggie burger and carrot cake. The service at this location is adequate. It's typically full on Fridays and Saturdays, so be sure to make a recommendation. If you're in from out of town, grab a seat at the bar. I've had several bar meals at various chains and never a bad experience. Wine list is good, although they recently removed my fave Willamette Valley Pinot Noir from their by the glass menu - at least there is one available by the bottle."}
{"text":"Excellent service from greeting to bill. Our waiter was extremely attentive and was an added pleasure to the evening.

I had the pasta that was considered \"hot\" (look for it on the specials menu) and my partner found a crispy chicken salad to be the choice for the evening.

We were rewarded with a fantastic time to table as well as a pleasant follow-up.

The decor of the restaurant fit the name perfectly. Everything about the place screamed grill, from the wood accents to the dark romantic lighting. We felt very comfortable in our window booth, with not too much isolation but still enough privacy.

I noticed the place was very busy, even at the end of the evening (9pm)...this by itself is a strong indication of how well the establishment is known in the area. Most were couples, no families.

Will be there again!"}
{"text":"Lyndhurst grill is probably the closest I've ever come to giving a restaurant 5 stars. From when I walk in the front door to when I walk out, they've always treated me like a regular and an old friend. The entire staff goes out of their way to make sure I have an unforgettable experience. The crowds seem pretty unpredictable, so we always call ahead to make sure we don't wait long. I've tried a variety of menu items including chicken and steak and there's nothing on the menu I wouldn't recommend. Our favorite appetizer is the steak rolls. They're basically egg rolls with steak in them served with some kind of delicious sauce. Make sure you get a salad... not necessarily because of the salad, but because of what comes with it. On the side of every salad plate is a warm, flaky croissant with some sort of sweet glaze that can't possibly be healthy and probably builds up leading to eventual death. Regardless of that, I recommend ordering a whole basket of them. Believe me when I say, just one won't be enough. Be sure to get a side of the mashed potatoes as well. Overall, great food, great service and really fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and was seated right away. I feel that they can do a better menu selection but over all my experience was great. The atmosphere was dim and a good customer service. I had the lunch pasta and tortilla soup (the soup was too cheesy for me) - I should not complain that the portion is too large for lunch because maybe that's just me but because of this portion, It didn't leave me room for dessert and had to pack almost half of my meal. I would recommend if you were in the area."}
{"text":"Went back today with my family.  For the first time I had the cole slaw with my veggie burger.  When my wife tried it, she said that it was the best cole slaw she has even eaten.  That's high praise from her- believe me.

Also got the smashed potatoes for our son to eat.  Although he wouldn't eat them, we did and they were great.

This place is hard to have kids eat at though- no juice and whatnot."}
{"text":"I came from canton to have dinner with family 1st time it was a very nice experience. Food was delicious. Will go again"}
{"text":"Overall poor experience.  Didn't have our reservation....but they sat us anyway.  Ordered no tomatoes on the salad...came with tomatoes.  Ordered medium well steak. Came well done. Twice baked potato has heavy cayane pepper. Very hot. Hated them. Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"The best thing that I love to go for is the Mac and cheese. I can't live without it and I suggest that u try it when u go. Fairly on the pricey side but u won't be disappointed. Atmosphere is nice kinda dim and its not in my top 3 but like I said I'm addicted to the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Not your traditional steak house, as they had some twists to the menu. But if you order an entrée you get a LARGE salad with freshly fried croutons (YUM), a honey drizzled croissant , and the dressing of your choice! The salad was pretty filling so when my prime rib arrived I wasn't very hungry to tell you the truth. 

Fun fact: order prime rib medium or well. Otherwise it appears too rare. 

Very dimly lit and romantic atmosphere even though I was there on a business dinner.  It would be a great place for a NYE, mother's/Father's Day, or romantic date. Seemed to have a 30+ crowd. 

Also it is a littttle pricey- wine + prime rib + tip  was over $50 but nothing outrageous."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last month and it was great. This was my second time going and I actually forgot aboutout this place. The portions were huge and the steak was cooked to perfection. The server was okay and I didn't care for the chocolate cake.  However,I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience as our first time dining at J. Alexander's in Lyndhurst.  The food was plentiful and delicious. Our waiter, \"Chill\" was fantastic, fun and very attentive. He made our experience even more delightful.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Be sure to make reservations. It was packed!"}
{"text":"Not really sure whats taken place since January! But last night this by far was a terrible experience. Not one single item was served as ordered. Wrong appetizers wrong drinks, entrees for the five of us came out staggered even one plate ten minutes after the rest of table got theirs. Then the server was short and rarely available yet the place was not even half full. They hacked up the original menu down to barley anything, increased the prices while decreasing the portions. Not sure this will be our monthly dine out place anymore, if ever period. Definitely a diner beware status."}
{"text":"Really great meal and reasonably priced too. I love the feeling when you walk in with the dark wood, open kitchen and the fact the tables aren't on top of one another is huge! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the cheeseburgers for lunch. They cook them correctly every time. (Medium rare... A good veterinarian should be able to resuscitate at any time.) Carrot cake is joygasmic. I get irritated by the hostess chatting us up on the way to the table, but hey...that's me."}
{"text":"Great cheese dip and my lunch was great!Love the atmosphere and the service was amazing! I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. Love it!"}
{"text":"Typically go here for lunch.  The food is good and service is fine.  I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner at Lyndhurst Grill.  We loved J Alexander's and this version has a different menu but the food we ordered was good.  I had the Southern Salad, a large salad with avocados, cheese, delicious croutons and crunchy chicken.  It was served with a honey drizzled croissant.  It was very good!  My husband had a hamburger which he also enjoyed.  The service was very good and the place is beautifully decorated -- at least I think it is!  It was shockingly dark in the restaurant!  There was a light immediately over our table so we could see our food but the brightness of the light made the darkness of the restaurant even more pronounced.  In fact, every time our waitress came to the table it was like she emerged from the dark and appeared out of nowhere!  I kept wondering if we knew anyone else eating dinner but couldn't see them.  But don't let the darkness deter you from giving the Lyndhurst Grill a try.  Maybe just bring a flashlight with you!"}
{"text":"Second time here for lunch and it didn't disappoint. Service was friendly and efficient. Had the Spinach Queso dip appetizer and the deviled eggs. Both were very good and plenty for 2 to share. Can't get enough of the Chicken Pasta soup, one of my favorite soups anywhere! Salads are a good size and the croissants served with them are delicious! I just wish there was a location on the west side as it takes almost an hour to get to this one so we don't make it here often."}
{"text":"In an ironic twist, I absolutely love this place. No, J Alexander's is not one of Cleveland's hip independently-owned gems. However, the food is always flavorful and well-presented. Many would classify this as a \"fancy restaurant.\" Given its low lighting, dark wooden accents, and smooth jazz tunes playing in the background, I would agree. Despite being somewhat fancy, though, the food prices are exceptionally reasonable. (I personally love coming for lunch an ordering the Hyde Park chicken sandwich, an great meal for only $11.)

The bar is also nice. Though I haven't spent any time at it, I did notice that it sported neat alcohols like Avion tequila (think HBO's Entourage) and Reyka vodka (Icelandic vodka!).

Grade: A"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. I called two days ahead to inquire about seating for a party of 12 after my father's funeral. At first they said they didn't take reservations but they'd try to seat us near each other I said that we wanted to all sit together and if they couldn't accommodate us that was fine, I would go somewhere else. They assured me that they could put us all at one table as long as they were sure we were coming. They suggested I call before we left. I called from the funeral home about 30 minutes before arriving and they said everything would be set up.  Surprise.  They had four separate tables. I asked to speak to Emily who promised me she would have us all at one table and the woman said \"I am Emily.\"  She went on to say that they couldn't push any tables together. Mind you this was a Tuesday evening at 8 PM, which is not exactly a super busy time.  They watched our large party politely walk out, without saying anything to try to keep us there. It was really amazing. They truly didn't give a crap that 12 well-dressed people were walking out of the restaurant because they were unwilling to move some tables around.  Amazing. Suffice it to say, we will not be going back.  Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"The  food was good, portion  size small, some of the  drinks were more potent without ice (tasted watery with) They had several specials of the day not included on menu have  to inquire also some regular entree aren't on the menu either. The calamari  is crispy and overcooked tough to chew!"}
{"text":"I have visited J. Alexander's numerous times, but never posted a review.  The menu had changed a bit from my last visit, but still pretty decent choices overall.  I opted for the Prime Rib Sandwich with fries and it was pretty good.  The prime rib was cooked medium well, as I requested, the bread was fresh and tasty.  The portion was huge and the side of au jus was perfect.  I also ordered dessert, which in the past had disappointed just a little bit.  Not this time.  I ordered the Key Lime Pie and it was awesome.  Great graham cracker crust, tangy lime filling and generous portion.  I not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but J. Alexander's is worthy of an occasional visit.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been to many locations in many cities of this upscale chain. This one is fine. Not amazing but no huge concerns. The upper level booths by windows are always are uncomfortably drafty. I have had experience one more than one occasion with  annoying hostesses that made my party wait to be seated in the lower level because it was freezing (even my dad who has never complained of ever being cold complained). On one of those occasions there were all but two tables EMPTY in entire large restaurant.... 
but the warm carrot cake almost makes up for it ;)"}
{"text":"They seem to be getting better of late... went there 3 times, including Valentine's Day, and every meal was exceptional.  The burgers are delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times in the past. But this week I had a former Cleveland native friend in town so decided to re-visit this old haunt. We opted for an early lunch. J Alexander was just as I have always remembered. Service was impeccable. Food was high quality. And ambiance was nice. I ordered the ahi tuna salad which was excellent for lunch, tuna was served as indicated on the menu seared and rare..... my favorite way to have tuna! Salad had mixed greens, a light wasabi vinaigrette and a nice amount of shredded wonton noodles. I was pleased. My compadre ordered the hyde park sandwich with orzo as a side and the alex's salad. She was equally pleased. We happened to just be out on a leisurely lunch but service was quick and efficient so you could easily visit during a lunch hour and arrive back to work in reasonable time. Overall J Alexander is a solid can't miss for great food and service. Every time I come here I wonder why I don't come here more often."}
{"text":"I post the key lime pie because thats what I enjoyed. 
The prime rib was ordered medium rare or rare and tossed on grill for char... it came out well done. 
Tried it again, well done.  They asked me if I wanted to try it again... why? Same daggone overdone cut of beef, isn't it?  

I edit my review because they quietly made my experience correct by removing my prime rib from the bill.  Good job! 

But i did eat my damn pie!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place.  I ate there recently and I ordered the veggie plate including zucchini, broccoli, tomatoes and some rice with orzo.  I don't know if my mouth has recovered from the pure amount of salt in my food. 

Not to mention the fact that when you order a veggie plate, you still won't be able to eat healthy with all the oil and butter loaded on.

The burgers, sandwiches and soups are great. Seems that they are over-salting a lot of stuff now."}
{"text":"This location is close to my office and a great place for a late lunch. I always order their lunch fillet. Medium please. It is always served perfectly cooked to my taste and complemented with some great fresh veggies. Healthy enough that I can indulge in at least one of the offered croissants they serve up front!

Love the lunch prices, great cooking, and fresh taste."}
{"text":"Just a tad dark...the lighting is dim...five star everything...we will be back like always"}
{"text":"Consistently good! Delicious! Great place for a date or special occasion, always good steak. I had a side of the butternut squash and it was AWESOME! I also got the very best chocolate cake for my birthday dessert! (Not free or comp'd just in case you thought they do free desserts for birthdays)"}
{"text":"I have been going to J Alexander's for many years.  I discovered one when I lived in San Antonio, TX and then was SO glad that there is one close by since we moved to Ohio.  The food is exceptional and I have never had a bad experience here.  For a chain, I am always surprised at how much I love it & keep coming back.  The staff is always courteous and helpful.  The wait can be quite long if you visit on a weekend night, but normally it isn't too long (5-10).  If you come for lunch, there isn't usually a wait at all.  This place is a bit upscale/trendy and very cozy.  Great for a romantic dinner, but casual enough to take the whole family.

Dishes I suggest:  Their Filet is the best!!  I try to get it almost every time I eat here.  They also have a Half Filet (1/2 the price, 1/2 the size,but just as satisfying). The Chips with Cheese Spinach Dip/Salsa are great for a starter.  They also have great pasta dishes. Salads are fresh and large."}
{"text":"I went to the Lyndhurst Grill on Monday April 2, 2018, for lunch and had a horrible experience. I asked our waitress Teneya if they had a children's menu and she asked was a child be joining us and I said no. I showed her a medical card that stated that I needed children portions. She then took the card to the manager Doug Richmond and came back and told me I could order from the children's menu, but she said he told me that I had to up-charge me because I was an adult. I then stated to her that I would not eat. I have eaten at different restaurants through out America, and I have never had a restaurant tell me that I could order from the children's menu, but they have to up-charge. This restaurant was recommended for having great food and great service, however if you have a medical disability then this is not the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the one issue I have with this place is who does carryout but makes you come in to order, doesn't that defeat the whole purpose, I want my food to be ready when I get there not wait forever on the slow service."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my meal. I had the Mauhi Steak. It was supposed to be a ribeye but it looked and tasted like sirloin. I asked for medium well and it was over done. It also had a freezer taste. The salad, potatoes and croissant was good. My friend had the Salmon and Mac and cheese and it was enjoyed. Thexe house Merlot was also good."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant I visited while on vacation. I haven't been here in nearly 15 years. The menu has completely changed, probably for the better. The decor is casual with some intimacy. I think all the seating is mostly booths. Our food was excellent as well as the service. The calamari was exceptional as well as the rainbow trout. My side dish was the sauteed green beans and grilled zucchini, both good. Our bill was cheaper here than at that god awful Olive Garden. I'm still trying to figure out what we ate for $60 for two people there. I would rank them right up there with Glenwillow Grille."}
{"text":"We sometimes go to lunch here as it is very close to work. My co-worker and I went today and both ordered the French dip sandwich made with prime rib, baguette  and horseradish sauce on the side. Thank goodness for that sauce because 'Holy Saltiness!!\" it helped mask the flavor of wayyyy toooo much seasoning. I've noticed that they regularly over salt their food, but I can't even tell you how bad it was. You couldn't catch a break with the fries because they were salted as well-not to the extreme as was the meat, but it just added to it. I felt like I would collapse as I left from my kidney's failing. We drank lots and lots of their delicious, ice cold water. Mind you we had plenty of opportunities to complain as hostess, server and even a chef came by to ask how everything was. Being on our lunch hour with little time to spare, we kept it to ourselves...which we shouldn't have. We noticed that the chef went around to many tables...perhaps someone did complain? The last two bites of my sandwich were edible, while my co-worker's last two bites were the saltiest yet. Ehh...don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. It's a shame as the meat was butter tender, nice crusty roll, great horseradish sauce....booh"}
{"text":"Our experience was perfect.  The wait staff was attentive and nice.  The food was quick, and delicious.  My prime rib was cooked perfectly.  Additionally, we got the calamari, and it was one of the best I have ever had...we finished it before it even cooled!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Not terribly expensive, but would be nice for a special occasion moreso than an everyday dinner out. Lovely decor, lots of dark wood, open fire, friendly service. Portions are huge, big enough to share - my salad was almost a food across, but with everything chopped up small and bite size, just the way I like it.

There is never much of a wait, but they also don't take reservations so it's not the best place to come for a business lunch or to bring a large group. Good enough food to forget you're a stone's throw from 271."}
{"text":"My go to for a quick meal. I anyways order the Maui Ribeye or the chicken fingers. Who knew chicken fingers could be so perfect. The mac and cheese is great and the Israeli cous cous  is amazing. Would never order another burger or prime rib from here again. The burger was full of gristles and the prime rib couldn't have been slow roasted."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top in my list of places to eat. All the food is always spot on. Amazing Mac and cheese. We go so often they call us by name now. Amazing filet always cooked perfectly as well as the fresh made burgers. Service is what to be expected from a five star restaurant but only pay fairly. P.s ask for Amanda to be your waitress great girl best server ever!"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Tanesha was extremely nice although she added bacon and I said no bacon, it wasn't her fault, they had to make it again.  I think it was very nice they split it for me to take home. Picture reflects split."}
{"text":"Elegant bistro fine dining. Creative cocktails and selective wine list. The food here is always outstanding. I recommend the Cajun trout, signature salad (add chicken at no charge), flatbread pizzas.  The calamari and beef rolls are a must for starters. The atmosphere is dark and intimate with high back booths perfect for date night.  Save room for the carrot cake or chocolate cake. Both are worth breaking your diet for. Our visit for dinner tonight included a wonderful server, Haley. She has a smile that brightens the table and was very knowledgeable about the menu items. She was efficient and attentive and made us feel welcome. Great service is rare these days. I hope they hang on to her."}
{"text":"Had a really yummy birthday dinner last night. It was super busy being a Friday evening coming up on the holidays and the drinks took some time coming out of the bar, our waitress worked hard to keep us informed of the delay and made sure to have the manager stop by to check in. The food was great and and it was a special treat to have a traditional prime rib prepared perfectly with mashed potatoes and yummy salad! Karla, our waitress, made sure it all ran smoothly and that we had the best choices for our celebration! Fun night!"}
{"text":"It's an amazing place that I go to weekly! Awesome food, great variety, tremendous service, quality food, great price! Whether lunch or dinner that I've been, it's always awesome. Great for family gathering, friends and date. Great appetizers and amazing deserts especially the carrot cake."}
{"text":"The worst. They do not know how to prepare a steak. Have been here many times.  We are sick of gift certificates for another meal.  They are just bad bad bad. Avoid this unless you want a salad or a sandwich or a dessert."}
{"text":"My party and I went on a Friday evening so it was quite busy. Unfortunately it still took longer than it should have for our server to take our order. I ordered the Bayou pasta dish which was delicious with a side order Alex salad that was also quite good. We all had plenty of bread with our meals and the server was quite prompt with picking up our checks. I will be returning."}
{"text":"J Alexander's is fair IMO. The service is good, the menu is pretty nice for this class of chain, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food I've experienced lately has been adequate.  That said, I am one of the folks who came here back in the day when memories of a particular dish, or even side dish, prompted frequent return visits.

Not so much any more, although I've heard dessert favorites like the carrot cake have endured.  BTW what has two thumbs and doesn't like carrot cake...  But this spot is way too out of the way to be a \"go to\" for dessert. And with a price point higher than an Applebee's, Friday's, or Carraba's, and food less impressive than your similarly priced, favorite steak, seafood or Italian spot, experienced diners, I feel, will feel short changed by the experience.

Now with many options, I did pick this place to go on my birthday this year. But I think it was the nostalgia and the hope that things had changed once again...for the better. Yeahhh, no."}
{"text":"Excellent chain restaurant with good food and great service.  Rarely, have I felt as welcome, as I do here.  Menu is basic and there are no gourmet items.  The Thai Kai Salad is one of my favorites.  Today, our server gladly had it made into two portions, each of which was ample."}
{"text":"Party of Seven - that's right - 7 people.  Well, we started with *  Deviled Eggs - Finished with sugar-cured bacon and homemade pickle relish.  Nothing to write home about.  They were a little dry.  

*  Smoked Salmon Dip.  Smoked in-house.  Excellent dish.  Dried toast broke easily - making it a little messy, but worth it.

Soup was very good - both types: a chicken spicy and chicken with snap peas.  No vegetarian soup available.

Two bottles of wine - over six beer's (small glasses) but we figured that was for class not quantity.  Tall mixed drink glasses used - not beer mugs.  Several mixed drinks - water and pop.

Two of our dinners came with salad.  Lots of stuff in the salad - not much lettuce.

*  Bayou Pasta was Shrimp, scallops and crabmeat sautéed in a spicy cream sauce with green onions and red peppers.  Excellent.  My 21 year old ate the bread that came with my salad and another plate of \"extra\" bread we ordered.  It looked like a good portion but he needed more.

My 19 year old son had Steak 'N' Fries with a side loaded baked potato and another side plate of \"extra\" bread we ordered.  A French Brasserie style steak with garlic, served with french fries.  Ordered Rare and got medium rare.

Our 24 year old Vegetarian had the Veggie Burger with Fries.  Made in-house, topped with Monterey Jack.  He took ¼ of it home.  The only one at the table that didn't eat bread.


My brother had the Rotisserie Chicken - One-half chicken roasted and seasoned with our special herb blend. Served with mashed potatoes.  He had a bowl of soup and was looking for bread also.  The mashed potato's were very very salty.  He was going to send them back; but did not want to upset me.
Both my husband and I had the  Filet Mignon with Béarnaise.  Center cut, baked potato.  Steak was cooked to perfection and loaded baked potato's were dry - more butter (which we found on the bread plates.

Water was kept full and waitress was at hand when needed.  

Finished with dessert - one of each:  Carrot Cake (very good), Served warm with cream cheese icing.  Very Best Chocolate Cake (also very good) - Served with vanilla ice cream.  And  Key Lime Pie - Classic recipe in a graham cracker pecan crust.  NO NO NO.  My brother asked the waitress how many Key Limes were used in the pie.... She said 53 - I don't know if she made that number up; just guessed or what...  The key lime pie had NO NO NO lime taste.

Expensive but we were celebrating my husband 56th birthday.  Several servers and personal wished him Happy Birthday."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere; waitress seemed disinterested or hurried which on a Tuesday evening that was not busy is disappointing. My husband and I shared a house salad which had more cabbage in it than lettuce. I had the French dip which was awesome and Mark had a bacon cheese burger which too was good. The French fries are more like potatoes sticks but very tasty. Prices were a bit on the high side $19 for the French dip and $15 for the burger. We were overall pleased with the experience. Would recommend to friends that don't mind spending a little more for a weekday dinner."}
{"text":"Love it! The burgers are fantastic!! They make their own patties fresh, and even grind their own beef. My son and I got the \"steak\" burger, which is ground ribeye and (something else I forget... haha). When you bite into it, it's like bitting into butter... It almost literally melts in your mouth. Fantastic!! The fries are OK... Nothing great.

My wife ordered the turkey burger, which she said was great!!

My other son ordered the veggie burger (which I am impressed to say that they also make themselves!!). He loved it!

Overall, this place has some of the best burgers I've ever had!! Can't say much about the other food... haha!!"}
{"text":"I went with my husband for dinner here. To be honest when we drove by it I did not expect it to look as amazing as it did on the inside. By amazing I mean that the place was cozy, decorated well and I enjoyed the fact that it was a big spot so you did not feel crowded or congested. The food was delicious and we had plenty to bring home as well. Great and friendly staff as well as a clean bathroom which is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"j alexanders is delicous if you ever get seated. we were told we had a 25 minute wait. 50 minutes later there were no tables in sight and we bailed. much better experience in chicago than cleveland. won't go back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't have much of a review other than I sat at the bar, which was not crowded (5 people and 2 bartenders). I waited 5 minutes and my presence was not even acknowledged. Even though I was positioned right in front of the register that one of the bartenders was working on. After watching the bartender directly approach someone that came in after me, I got up and walked out. Had the bar been busy or there only a single bartender, I would understand. That was not the case here and there are plenty of other places to spend my money. Average food with world class customer service is what it takes for me to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Jelena!! Our party of 6 was seated fairly promptly (less than 5 min) on an early Sunday evening or late afternoon. 

Appetizers- Deviled eggs and calamari
Salads-Alex's and Caesar 
Entrees- Brasserie Chicken, Steak and Fries, Richmond Ribeye w/ Gruyere Mac and Cheese; Goat cheese Flatbread
Dessert-Carrot cake 
Libations-Sparkling Rose, Jack and Coke, Manhattan, Mojito

Everything was excellent. Service was present, but not overwhelming. Water glasses stayed filled. Silverware was traded out, clean, and on the ready for each phase of the meal. We couldn't have asked for a better evening with great company and exceptional service. 

I hope all the J. Alexander's keep the same standard. The bar has been set."}
{"text":"Came on a random evening and sat at the bar. The service was excellent and so was the queso. I was not very impressed by the filet mignon that I got and by the fact that the bar is situated right by the door. Kills the ambiance a bit and the bar setup is really not that nice."}
{"text":"I like the food a lot, but it's really high priced for lunch.  When I'm using the corporate card, it's a good choice for business, but I wouldn't pay my own money."}
{"text":"Impeccable service and high quality food!!!  Our server Dominic was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The Cilantro shrimp dish is made with this freshest ingredients that explode on your taste buds. Love the flat bread pizzas and the best calamari anywhere bar none!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood place.  The Thai Kai salad is super.  The service continues to be excellent and the managers \"hover\" to make sure everything is acceptable. It is a place that welcomes your business and will see me often."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Decent food. Server put my order in incorrectly twice. Most of my party was done eating by the time I received my food incorrectly for the second time so I just kept it.  Service matters.  Hard to recommend or return to a place that did not seem to care."}
{"text":"I forgot this place was here, until recently. I know it's a chain, but I think it deserves a good review after our experiences. We've gone a few times and the food is great, but what really makes stand out is the service. We've had WONDERFUL servers. They're friendly, informative, quick, helpful and funny. We've continued going back because the service is so great and it makes a quick family dinner out to eat really enjoyable. And again, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and tonight was FLAWLESS. My husband and MIL share a birthday and we were celebrating. I brought assorted cupcakes purchased elsewhere and asked for them to be brought to the table with candles. Carrot cake one for her and he would enjoy any flavor. Our WONDERFUL, attentive server, Carla could not have executed the presentation better. My in-laws can be rather demanding dining companions (ok there have been times I've wanted to shrink under the table). They both expressed how impressed they were with the whole dinner. Thank you to Lyndhurst Grille and to Carla for making my husband and my MIL's birthday a memorable one! You rock!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years and find that the food is pretty basic an ordinary in its preparation. Don't expect culinary wizardry . To their credit the portion sizes are on the large side for those who are hungry. The service staff it's generally very good and attentive to your needs."}
{"text":"Favorite -- for yrs. Prefer over Cedar Creek, Bravo, Brio for all factors, especially staff. I can't recall an error on an order either. Such high standards that they don't do take-out."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. I have been going to j's since I was a little kid and they have never disappointed. As a child, I loved the chicken fingers and shoestring fries. As a adult, I love the salmon, baby back ribs, the prime rib, and the pork tenderloin with the bang bang sauce. The chicken pasta soup and the spinach quest dip are fantastic appetizers. The drinks are good, the service is always good, and the time I have here is always enjoyable. Can't go wrong with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Average, at best. It is another Applebee's or Champps. More chain junk."}
{"text":"Hostess not customer friendly. We booked a reservation for 5 at 6pm and were seated at a small round table in the bar. When I asked politely if we could be seated at a regular table in the main dining room, my request was denied and we were told that the unoccupied tables were for larger parties of six or more. I mentioned that we were a party of five with a reservation to no avail. 

No big deal, plenty of other restaurants to go to in the future."}
{"text":"So, we have a J. Alexander's in my home town of Tampa, which I have only frequented for lunch.  I must say, I was impressed with dinner.  I went for the Steak n' Fries, but I substituted the fries for a loaded baked potatoe (let's call it Steak n'Loaded Baked Potato).  The steak was cooked deliciously and the potato was quite tasty, as well.  I started with a salad with the signature champagne vinaigrette, which did not disappoint.  I washed all of this down with 2 glasses of the Filus Malbec.

I must say, I was skeptical before coming here in a city that I'm not from, as it is a chain and I like to support local businesses.  This place really did feel like a treat, though.  The service was great and the atmosphere was classy.  The brick walls and dark entire (mixed with the red wine) was great for a cold Cleveland night."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child. I love the old J Alexanders and wish it didn't change. That being said the interior and exterior are the same and the food tonight was also. I love the food here, especially the butter croissants. Their shoestring fries are great, as well as the salads. I've never had bad service here. It's a very comfortable atmosphere. A little pricey, but like I said the food is great! 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Always excellent.  Roti chicken w/mashers and gravy, rattlesnake pasta, fish entrees and most everything else is good.  Much, much better than a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend took me to lunch here recently.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  The service was impeccable.  Honestly, this is some of the best service I've had in a while.

The fish tacos were delicious!  I would prefer a little more fish on them, but overall they were tasty, fresh, and filling.

I am looking forward to dinner here soon.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my boyfriend and future in-laws to celebrate his cousin's graduation. I was a fan of the decor and general layout of the place. Seeing the kitchen and the chefs running around reminded me of Hell's Kitchen (sans Gordon Ramsay yelling at everyone). It was dim and had a romantic atmosphere, each table boasting a lit candle. Service was generally good as the waitstaff was attentive, though our waiter wasn't the friendliest. It was a busy evening and he was probably tired, so I can't necessarily blame him for not being talkative. I'm really fond of restaurants that give you a jug of water for your table instead of the waiter constantly refilling it with a pitcher. Our jug was shaped like an old fashioned glass milk bottle, which I found amusing.

 I ordered the rotisserie chicken with a side of mashed potatoes. The meat was rather tender and the broth you're given on the side really does a wonderful job at making it super juicy. I also appreciated that it wasn't fatty and dark. However, I found the skin to be rather peppery. My boyfriend got the steak (the one he got in particular escapes me), french fries, and a croissant. When I sampled each item from his plate, my feelings were mixed. The steak tasted more like a ham, the french fries were reminiscent of the frozen shoestring fries I'd bake at home, and the croissant oddly enough tasted like a doughnut. Now, I'm no expert in French cuisine but I've always imagined a croissant being more akin to a dinner roll than a breakfast pastry. Yet again, maybe I've just been eating croissants wrong my whole life. On a similar note, I also sampled his Alex's side salad. I was turned off by the amount of shredded carrots and the like and the fact that the ranch dressing was at the bottom of the salad, and I found the croutons to also taste like some sort of sweet fried dough. Yet again, I like my salads plain and covered in cheese so who am I to judge? 

Overall, I wasn't too terribly disappointed with J. Alexander's. I couldn't say that I was a fan of every food I tried nor the borderline obscene prices, but it's not a bad place for a special occasion. I'd come back if I had the money and the means to come back to the Lyndhurst area, but it's not on my priority list."}
{"text":"It's been nearly a decade since I last set foot in J's.  Since that time I've grown to hate chain restaurants and attempt to avoid them as much as possible (J's is a corporate chain if you're not aware).  In fact, if it was not for a guests birthday dinner, I would have not even bothered to try it again.  But nevertheless, I ended up there last night for dinner.

I'll start with the good.

The ambiance is nice; dark wood, dark lighting, modern open kitchen, and rustic elements such as the timber wood ceiling provide a nice atmosphere.  I was surprised that even though the place has been around for more than ten years, the decor does not look dated even though it is exactly as I remember it years ago.

The other good... the fact that they have Orin Swift Cellars, The Prisoner, by the glass.  The Prisoner is a Napa Valley meritage red that is fantastic.  To find it on the menu by the glass is rare and an excellent selection.

Now to the bad

First is service.  Service was adequate until the point in which our entrees were brought out, which was a complete cluster-F.  Four different people brought out five entrees at different times over a period of a couple of minutes, and then everyone just disappeared!  The birthday guest of honor was missing bread, I was missing requested butter for the baked potato, and my wife was missing a fork.  We had to flag down a floor manager twice to get any of our missing items.  The waitress was completely MIA.  She never came back to ask how everything was, never took additional order for drinks, and she was still MIA when the entire table finished their meals and we had to flag down another manager to ask what is going on.  Then the waitress suddenly appeared to ask for dessert and hand us our check.  I understand that at J's other waitresses and waiters bring out guests entrees when busy, but for our main waitress never to check the table after all entrees were received is unacceptable.

Second is the food.  I general, the five guests at the table enjoyed their food, but nothing exceptional or memorable.  I had the filet with broccoli and baked potato and was disappointed by the dryness of the filet.  Had the service been exception, I may have overlooked the dryness; but combine a $28 filet, that is overcooked, and terrible service, I left scratching my head wondering what I just paid so much for.

After spending $28 for a filet, and $26 on two glasses of The Prisoner, I left the restaurant unsatisfied (price not including entree's ordered by others at my table).  There are just so many other excellent restaurants in that price range; why tolerate this?  Hell, I live in Hudson and I could have hit One Red Door, Rosewood Grill, or Northend Wine Market and had even a better meal and excellent service for the same price range for only a short five minute drive from my house.  Better yet, for $10-$20 more, I could have gone to Downtown 140 and had a five star experience.

Unless you are selecting sandwiches, or some lower cost menu options, entrees end up being near upscale food prices, but with crappy casual restaurant service and food prepared by a bunch of line cooks.

My advice, look beyond J's and seek out other establishments, preferably one that is independently owned with a culinary trained head chef that is actually present and is involved making every dish and checks quality.  It is so much easier to do better in the same price range or for even less money.

Anyone raking this place five stars must have burned out taste buds and very low expectations.  

I would have given it one star, but for having The Prisoner by the glass, J's got two."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I forgot to review J Alexander's the last time we were in town. It's the favorite restaurant of my fiance's aunt and uncle, so we're guaranteed to eat there at least once when we come to visit Cleveland. They love it because, being the picky eaters that they are, the chefs will modify any dish to your specifications.

The first time I dined at J Alexander's, I had the Ahi Tuna Salad which comes with field greens, a wasabi vinaigrette, and crispy noodles on top. The tuna portion, although perfectly seared, was pathetically small despite the large size of the salad itself. Having learned my lesson the first time, I realized that ordering an entree was the only way to make sure I get a good portion of protein with my meal. 

When we went more recently to J Alexanders, I ordered the Ahi Tuna Steak (haha, I know, SOOOO different), and asked that it be VERY rare (I hate cooked tuna), no wasabi mayo, and to substitute the mashed potatoes for steamed broccoli. When my dish came, the tuna was cooked perfectly but it was over seasoned and really salty, which meant that I avoided the toro dipping sauce (soy sauce based) completely. Also, the broccoli was NOT steamed (grr), but I was too hungry to care much about that, or about the fact that the plate was missing the tomatoes mentioned on the menu! The tuna steak was HUGE, and I couldn't eat the whole thing, which was fine because most of what I left on the plate was unfortunately kind of gristly with fat strands and impossible to cut. 

The staff was very nice and helpful - they moved us from our first table since it was too close to the doors and we were freezing. And they were very attentive, asking how our food was and frequently refilling water, which was quite necessary in my salty situation. Since I know I'll be back again (and again...and again...), I'll have to try something else so I can update this review."}
{"text":"Had a nice Father's Day dinner last Sunday. Had reservations for 7 and we were promptly seated. Service was wonderful, waitress was friendly and our drinks and food arrived quickly for a busy day. 

I tried the goat cheese/bacon/onion flatbread and a house salad - both were great, portions were large, took half of both dishes home even after sharing a few pieces of the flatbread avec mon pere. My dad ordered the prime rib which was the reason he wanted to come here, we've had dinner here several times over the years and he said his meal was just as good as he remembered. 

They have a nice wine list and pretty limited beer list, I had a Sofie from Goose Island, one of my favorites back in Chi, don't always see it on menus here. A+

Overall, this is a nice place for a classic, simple, hearty meal. I think the interior is so cozy and the booths are COMFY - love that. Definitely recommend for dinner when in the area - it can be overlooked due to the corporate office park location, but it's just down the street from all the shopping in Beachwood. Also - great value for the portions and nice meal - not as pricey as other places in area."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday evening for a birthday celebration with my family. I made reservation for 5 which I had no problem making. The hostess sat us at our table when we got there. The atmosphere is dark but fancy like vibe to it . It was actually really nice. This is my first time here and didn't really know what to get . I started with calamari and fries for appetizers. The calamari was really delicious and so were the fries . It all came out crispy and warm. For my entree I got the rattlesnake pasta and boy am I glad I did! It had a lot of flavor it to it. I would defiantly get this dish again. My family also enjoyed their meals as well. Overall the server was friendly , the atmosphere is nice but it can get pricy !"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for an amazing French dip sandwich! The sliced prime rib is stacked high on the bread and served about medium rare, and I could drink the au jus. Perfect with their fries! I miss the basket of croissants they used to serve drizzled with honey, but you can still get one when you order a salad."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while looking for a good place for desert with my little brother. We were pleasantly surprised, service was quick and polite and the food was delicious! The portion sizes were great for the price and as for the desert, my mouth is still watering over the carrot cake!! It will for sure be a place I visit on my next visit home!"}
{"text":"I'm really between a 3 and a 4 on this one. My expectations were not met, but maybe there were too high. 

First the good. The food. That is what is most important after all I guess. I ordered the Filet Kabobs and was very pleased. Be aware the steak is served well done as a default which is rather strange, and the waitress did not prompt to ask how I wanted it cooked. So be sure you mention it if you don't want well; I chose medium and ended up quite happy. The steak is served off the skewer with large chunks of grilled vegetables (i.e., onions, green peppers, etc). That all comes served on Louisiana rice or whatever side you want. 

I also enjoyed the ambiance and found it very classy and comfortable.

Now for the odd. I was expecting J. Alexander to behave as a higher class chain. Our waitress wasn't the best though. She would refrain from interacting with us for long periods of time even walking past the table, but not stopping by. When she did stop to check on the food - which we had begun to eat already - she asked how the food - looked - not how it tasted and then said something like it will taste even better. Just odd. 

At the conclusion of the meal we were never offered dessert. We asked for coffees when she cleared the dinner plates away, which would have been a logical time to offer dessert, but she did not. 

People love the place though, there was a lobby full of people waiting for a seat. Definitely use OpenTable if you want to eat here. 

I will try it again sometime. I think with a different server my rating might increase."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff. Jelena was our server I'd ask for her again!  We got the old fashion hamburger it was absolutely phenomenal, the French dip awesome and topped off with hot carrot cake.  Yahoo"}
{"text":"This spot used to be as close to a five star as I would give a restaurant.  The food, the value, the service was spectacular.  I am concerned w. the way the quality has been trending in the recent months.  Everything on the menu used to be outstanding.  Now, even though prices haven't changed, many of the items on the now even more limited menu seems to be less and less impressive.   The best burger in town has changed to what my wife calls the \"mediocreburger\".  Tonight we took out a few items, and the Roasted Chicken and Kale salad was extremely underwhelming, especially for $17.  On a positive note, my daughter LOVES the mac and cheese, and will get it EVERY time she goes there.  It is quite decadent.  I will continue to use this spot as a take out spot from time to time, but not as a weekly option like I once was in the habit of."}
{"text":"I decided to treat my mother and my friend to dinner. For my friend it was a late birthday present. The ambiance is warm and romantic and relaxing in there. I always order the Maui Steak and Gouda mac and cheese. I bragged to my mom about the steak, my friend always orders it to as its her favorite. I have been to a few J. Alexanders in different cities, but the first thing that I noticed on this menu that I never had at other restaurants were the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. They were simply delicious. Grade A steak blanketed by creamy cheese with a crisp outside layer. The chimichurri sauce that they put on the plate sealed the deal!!  As much as I love my Maui steak, I could've ordered 2 orders of these rolls, a a salad and I would've been in paradise. I really enjoyed the beautiful salad that they bring out which is huge with the honey croissant. My steak and mac and cheese were awesome as usual. My mom enjoyed her steak but she said that she wasn't Wowwed by it whatever that means, she was expected a better cut of meat I guess. My friend completely sent hers back and said its not like the other J. Alexander's in Columbus. I have never been to the one in Columbus So I cant speak to that. What I will say is that I totally enjoyed my meal and had a great time with my girls. I will definitely be back for those eggrolls...I dream about them, definitely something to slap my momma about lol!!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dessert. The desserts are huge. Choices were to-die-for carrot cake, real key lime pie, and too-big-to-eat chocolate layer cake. Four of us had only two....carrot cake and key lime pie. That was plenty and was savory delicious.   Our waiter was wonderful. We sat at a booth in the bar. Nice venue."}
{"text":"Place has been around for a while now. The food is pretty good with a couple excellent menu items such as chicken pasta soup, Hyde Park, rotisserie chicken to name a few. I would give it 5 stars if they let you place a takeout order over the phone. It's very annoying and inconvenient that you have to place a takeout order at the restaurant and sit and wait for it like a bum sitting at the bar by yourself. Please correct this insane issue."}
{"text":"For the overall all experience, J Alexander is a 5 star rating considering the decor and price point.   This is a very classy, intimate, dark restaraunt.  They have a well diverse menu, a great all american  upscale bar and grill.  

For appetizers - try the fried calamari, its seasoned with a hit of spice and great marinara sauce umm.  

also try the famous Alex Salad!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the best salad I have every tasted.  Its made with an array of chopped green leaves, cumbers, bacon, carrots, cheese, ect tossed very well.  i ordered ranch dressing and they well mix it in for you!  you will keep coming just for the salad, and crossiant roll. 

I ordered a steak maui.  One of the finest piece of steaks I have had.  It's marinated in a great seasoning and is grill to perfection.  if your tired of the same tasting steak topped with butter, the mauli sauce takes your palatte to another place.  lastly they have great mac&cheese and great mash potato to die for! 

apple martini is to die for- they actually slice a green apple and into your martini lol.  

This is a must try restaraunt."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, fresh food. I tried the goat cheese flatbread and it was so good!!! Their southern chicken salad was great too."}
