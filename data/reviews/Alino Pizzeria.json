{"text":"I love this place.  Me and a buddy have had literally every pizza on the menu.  We go for lunch and split a pizza, get water to drink, we're out for $9 each.  You really cannot go wrong, and half of the pizza (the normal size, not the personal size they introduced a month ago) is usually too much food.  What we usually do now is get the spicy salami (...i think it was salami) as an added item on 1 of the pizzas.  I then add sauce and a mix of parmesan and pepper flakes.  My friend doesn't add the sauce.  They also have those little spicy peppers from Italy you can add yourself, I eat 3-4 of these and love it.  But they are spicy, be warned. Last time we went they just started offering salads, and the manager just came and gave us 2 salads!  We don't know them, are not in the family, but they are just really nice.  Service here is always super fast, which is what you want at lunch.  I can't usually afford more than 45 minutes or so, including drive time, and this place fits the bill with an 8+ minute drive.  Now this place is authentic, so don't come expecting Dominos or Pizza Hut style pizza.  This is for people who want to enjoy some of the best of Italian ingredients and methods. Of course it is true that Americans are usually disappointed by Italian pizza, I had a typical tourist pie in Rome once (with the anchovy) and was not impressed.  A pizza I had in Perugia was somewhat better, but in general I stuck to pasta the rest of my time on those visits.  Alino's pizza is how I always wanted authentic Italian pizza to be - authentic ingredients prepared well, not leaving hungry."}
{"text":"Im from Jersey and this is thee best pizza in Charlotte and their customer service beats DaVinccis by far!"}
{"text":"This pizza. Is one of the bests I've had. Its amazingly delicious! The cheese is like a string that keeps going. Love it and definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza made with the freshest ingredients and is the most authentic Italian pizza you can get here in America. The ingredients are imported from Italy from the flour to the sauce. The owner is a really nice guy and makes sure the customers are satisfied with their order. They have extra toppings to put on your salad or pizza. My favorite is the Parmesan cheese and freshly minced garlic to top on my pizza. The deserts are exceptional Italian deserts and the restrooms are kept clean."}
{"text":"One of the very few pizza shops who know the balance of cheese and flavors. Pizza base is simply amazing and we have stopped traveling to uptown for good pizza. Ingredients are fresh and you can get marinera sauce on the side which is good. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and very fresh salads. Best place for pizza in the area although it's a bit pricey. Super fast and clean restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I like that place. Good Food, clean, nice people always. I will say best pizza also we love the location in Mooresville. Hope soon they will open a location in South Charlotte"}
{"text":"We have been to Italy many times and this place has as good of a traditional napoletana pizza as you can get outside of Italy. Fantastic! So glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in NC! Their salads and homemade dressing are awesome too. Dont forget the gelato...yum!  Very kid friendly and super fast service!"}
{"text":"The pizza, gelato and cannoli were incredible. I've never seen my kids eat so much pizza."}
{"text":"I am a picky eater. The food is great. The service up to par. Great pizza. Cannolis made european  style ( not very sweet)."}
{"text":"Now that's some good wood fired pizza! My son loves it and he's very picky about his pizza. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.   We asked if we could have pepperoni on only one half of our pizza and they refused--this doesn't seem like a ridiculously difficult or scandalous request.  They obviously don't aim to please their customers.   With all the pizza places around, you'd think they would be willing to be a little flexible.   It's just a matter of time until this location changes again."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Charlotte.  Wood fired ovens, fresh ingredients and great service and setting.  Beer, wine and pretty decent cannoli (a little picky having grown up with a 100% Italian mom).  If you haven't tried Alino - go now!"}
{"text":"everything is sooo fresh and so good. one of the cooks saw me get crushed red pepper and was sweet enough to make me my own little spicy marinara sauce !! so sweet, love this place"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent. Salad was fresh & big.  Good selection of beer & wine.  Great gelato selection!! Served quickly & friendly!  Will definitely come again.  Only negative is a little bright!!"}
{"text":"We were in Naples in June of 2016. Just ate at Alino Pizzeria in December 2016. Absolutely authentic and delicious pizza. The ingredients except for the produce are imported from Italy. All the food except for the cakes and cupcakes are made in house. We will be back. I just wish there was olive oil on the table to dip my crust in. Other than that, perfetto!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Neapolitan style pizza! The crust was very thin, as it should be, and delicious. Loved the cheese and fresh toppings. The space Is very large and they have an assortment of gelato and cannoli which looked delicious but we did not try this time. I had the 10\"  sorrento and my husband had the 10\" Leonardo. He did not care for the sweet peppers on his, but the pizza itself was very delicious! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim. Employees were so nice and the pizza was amazing. Reminds me of the pizza we had in Italy. I will be back for a glass of wine and slice of pizza for sure."}
{"text":"I'll come here every time I'm in concord mills!!!   It's located inside the mall. I almost missed it, but with my curious nature, I checked it out while shopping and walking by. The place is gigantic with wood burning stoves and a picnic like atmosphere that you order at the counter and they bring it out to you. They offer beer and wine as well as sodas and other beverages. They also have self serve cups and you can help yourself to free water.    Margarita pizza w/ extra mozzarella cheese-  Delicious!!!   I can't wait to try the gelato and the pasta next time!!"}
{"text":"As a frequent patron at the Mooresville Alino's I was THRILLED to see that Concord Mills opened a new location! BEST new addition to the area. Alino's has the best pizza in the Charlotte area. The pizza ovens have been flown in from Italy, and are top notch. The pizza is served fresh and hot, but not too hot that you immediately burn your mouth or have to wait agonizingly for your fresh pizza to cool before you eat it. It comes out at the most perfect temperature. The Roman salad is my family's personal favorite - served at both locations. All salads are big enough to share! One pizza is big enough for three people to share. Save some room for the house-made gelato and desserts. The gelato flavors are so vibrant in flavor, that you can taste the colors of Italy life in each bite. If you're looking for a great decadent chocolate cake, they have it! The coconut pineapple cake is light as feather! The seating is meant to be shared, and when you walk in you'll quickly realize you're in a very cool place that you'll want to visit time and time again."}
{"text":"The pizza is stone fired and nice and crispy. Exactly how I like my pizza. If you don't , then this isn't the place for you.  The owner came over and chatted and decided to bring us a cannoli. These are the size of a baby arm, so be sure to save room if you do one.   The wine is delicious and well priced, same for the pizza.  When you walk in, it's quite overwhelming because it doesn't look like it will be as big as it is in there. It's HUGE."}
{"text":"Great pizza, cheap beer and now even a mall location?  Awesome.  I really can't expand too much on what everyone else has to say, though."}
{"text":"I love ot when you taste that \"back in the day in Brooklyn\" kind of mozzarella, that stays stuck and you have to keep tugging to pull it off. This Buffalo mozz' was somewhat close to that. The pizza is not overly thick or overly filling, and the sauce is quite good. Love the atmosphere, the setup and feel. The price is more than fine in my opinion. I'll definitely be back.  No complaints, only compliments! Keep it up, Ali√±o!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The pizza is so good that we come at least once a week to eat here. The environment is very clean, spacious, nicely decorated and inviting. The menu is straight to the point. It's posted in big bold letters, which makes reading it easy. They also have menus you can hold in your hand. The pizza is freshly made to order. The wood biting stoves gives the pizza a perfect toast. The ingredients are all fresh. Even the Garlic is freshly pressed. (I was looking for powered Garlic) My favorite pizza is the Margarita. It's made with Buffalo Mozzarella cheeses and has some Basil leaves on it to add a little extra flavor. You can also put your condiments into little cups while you wait for your pizza. Such as Garlic, Spicy Peppers, etc."}
{"text":"Fantastic real Italian pizza place! We needed one in the area; don't expect to be able to substitute ingredients or do halfs, this is a real Italian place but a phenomenal flavor, if that's not what you are looking for, Sbarro's is in the food court. Highly recommend this place, again, the real deal! Great atmosphere, open space!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Mooresville a few years back. So happy they made it into the Charlotte area. Love this place. Really love the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I've had in a long, long time!  I stopped by for a pie after work to carry home for dinner. I was SO tempted to eat a slice in the car! I ordered the Margarita pizza with extra cheese and it was delicious. This pizza is made with quality ingredients and baked in a wood burning stove. The crust is crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. The staff is super friendly as well. The desserts looked wonderfully delicious too. Next time you're at Concord Mills, forget eating at the food court and stop in for the best tasting pie  in this area!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the MIlls, large space with limited menu of pizzas. Pizza's are descent value at $16 bucks or so but come as described on the menu, don't ask for half this or half that. Service was quick (maybe to quick) as our pizza was at the table within a few minutes. Pizza's come out so fast that your toppings don't always warm through all the way and the bottom of the crust can be doughy.  I would suggest you request the pizza crispy so it stays in the oven a bit longer. This is our second experience with Alino after visiting both locations and having the same experience with under cooked pizza.  I would also suggest that if you like this style of pizza that you should visit Novanta 90 at Langtree, broader menu and honesty a better pizza (sorry Alino)."}
{"text":"Am I really eating pizza this good inside of a mall? Surely not. But the sign outside did say Concord Mills. Incredible.  When I walked into Alino's, the first thing I noticed was the space. You could fly a model airplane around the room, it's huge. It was open, bright and inviting.  Next is the seating. Long picnic style tables filled the floor. I was dining alone so I appreciated being able to sit right in front of their many huge flat screens. If you look through the menu, you'll see all the great varieties of pizza that you have to choose from. I can't imagine any of them being anything other than delicious but I went with the sausage variety and it was awesome. Great, thin crust with just the right amount of sauce. They also have a self service bar for parm, marinara, crushed red pepper and the like. They offer several bottled beers and a few wines to choose from. Whatever, at Alino's it's all about that Pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza not to mention the size of these things. A large is around $17-18. Not bad for the amount of pizza your getting. They also have fresh homemade gelato that is pretty amazing. There are lots of flavors too!"}
{"text":"Ok pizza, delivered really fast.  Been here several times, service is always good, menu is very limited and pricey.  I'll go back but not more than a couple of times a year."}
{"text":"Ok I'm going to be honest, when I first past by this play in Concord Mills I wasn't impressed. I was so happy to be proven wrong. This place is awesome. The pizza is so good. The pizza is cooked in wood fire ovens from Italy. The authentic sauce, with the fresh cheese just make it one of the best pizzas in Charlotte area.  So far I've only had the pepperoni pizza but I can't not wait to try the others. When you're in Concord Mills make sure you stop by and grab a pizza."}
{"text":"have tried different Pizza elsewhere, NY... and now found the BEST Authentic Pizza in town. Outstanding thin crust recipe and with one-of-a- kind flavorful concoction actually, found what we have been looking for that sounds and feels like real Italian taste in Pizza."}
{"text":"Cold Pizza !! OK I am attaching the receipt for the order for verification. I ate here with my wife today afternoon. We ordered two 10 inch pizzas and the order took about 15 minutes. When the order finally arrived, one of the pizza -Leonardo was cold. instead of one big tray carrying two small pizzas, there were two different people with each pizza and for some reason the lady was confused to find out one of the pizza was tied to the Order #6 and she has been circling the place trying to find the order it was tied to. So in short their whole system of assigning pizza to a particular order is broken down. When I bought this up with Jose R who took my order, he kind of shrugged asking me if I want another pizza. No Apologies, nothing for the pizza being cold. Terrible service and Cold Pizza !! NO Thanks !!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around.  High quality ingredients and amazingly fast.... literally your pizza is made fresh to order and delivered to your table in less than 5 mins.  Deserts and salads are equally great."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome! Very clean and staff were nice as well. Only negative....they do not have tea!...soft drinks/wine/beer and water. Also wish they had a smaller pizza but overall very satisfied! Will be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area. Very authentic it's not your typical pizzeria parlor don't go there looking for big pizzas that are thick lotta sauce overly burdened with different toppings. This is about as authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! It is a bit disappointing that it is a hike! But it is a must try. It is good, it is fast and unique. I did learn they opened another one in Concord (still a hike). The only reason why it gets 4 stars from me is because they won't modify a pie w your own toppings."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and very nice staff.  I live in Concord but it is worth the 20 trip.  Best pizza around."}
{"text":"Ever since they open, I've been eyeballing this place! The inside is so nice y'all! It's very spacious & I like how they stack pizza boxes on the sides so you can just grab a Togo box for your leftover pizza whenever your done(: You would order at the front then they will give you a #, you could take a seat wherever and they'll bring the pizza straight out to ya! We ordered the margarita pizza, the pizzas here are pretty pricy so beware lol! The pizza came out really fast- like REALLY fast. (idk if that's a good or bad thing lol) I love how thin the crust was but the pizza was a bit droopy. Overall I like how it the pizza tasted fresh, like they use quality ingredients but it wasn't the best I've had, honestly I thought it was going to taste aloooot better (like there would be more flavors, it was a little bland) because of all the high reviews. But overall- fresh ingredients + spacious/clean restaurant + big pizza to share. However I heard their homemade gelato is also really good, so can't wait to come back to try that!"}
{"text":"Authentic sauce, great cheese, & pepperoni is amazing.  Best pizza in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"First visit. One of the \"salad of the day\" options was mixed greens with blueberries, walnuts and a nice light sweet dressing. DELICIOUS. We had a pizza with Italian sausage, onions and tomatoes. Nice flavor but very light on the  toppings. I'll probably go again to get a take-out salad, but I'll skip the pizza. There is no ambiance. My son said it was like eating in his school cafeteria."}
{"text":"First thing you will notice when arriving is the atmosphere, it's a small piece of Italy.  The pizza far exceeded any local chain pizza restaurant as far as taste and quality.  4 stars only due to a very limited menu, maybe 4-5 pizzas to choose from, and at $16 a pizza it's pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Place is neat, open and clean. They use great fresh ingredients. We had the Caprese salad, which was very good, and ordered a well done Margherita Pizza.   While the taste was good, most disappointed with the crust. The only part well done was the outer crust. The rest of the pie was limp and droopy. A thin crisp well done pie clearly doesn't droop. When you bite into it should be a crunch. While the pie was thin Neapolitan style, it clearly came up short. There was no one in the place so we can't blame the crowd for the undercooked pie. I should have sent the pie back.  A for effort F for execution on what they are supposed to do best. \" The Pizza\".  Will try it one more time."}
{"text":"I went out with coworkers for Lunch on Friday 5/25 at 1100. As I'm from Wisconsin, this was my first time to Alino Pizzeria. What an awesome place! Very spacious and I like the large picnic tables. The wood fired pizza ovens were pretty cool too. The service was very pleasant and friendly. The pizzas are large and priced well. I'm not one for a lot of sauce on the pizza and they had the perfect amount! Our group of 8 ordered a large mozzarella and pepperoni, a large mozzarella and sausage, and a large mozzarella and ham. Enough for each of us to have a large slice of each pizza. The cannolis are light and tasty.  Awesome pizza and highly recommend going to Alino's if you want a great pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza with authentic Italian ingredients!  The pizzas come out quickly and are always delicious.  This location (at Concord Mills) just opened and is almost never crowded.  Leaves for a very personalized experience.  The other night my husband and I were eating here and what I assumed was the manager brought us each a cannoli - free of charge!  We must've just come at the right time."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place in Concord that does it right!!  The pizza was incredible!!   Fresh toppings and cheeses!!   My wife said it was the \"best pizza she has ever had!\"   I travel and try pizza all over.   This was one of the best!   The crust is so thin and crispy!  The Caputo flour does the trick.  We loved the free marinara sauce that you can help yourself to.  Also all the extras available: basil, oregano, fresh garlic, olive oil and of course red peppers and Parmesan cheese!!  We will be coming back here on a regular basis for sure!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim after doing the aquarium. Wow I'm so glad we did and we will definitely make an effort to come back. The pizza is the best we have had in a while. When they brought it out, they gave our kids free canolis which were also really great. Next time we can't wait to try the gelato."}
{"text":"Fresh pies no fuss! Great ingredients mixed with a friendly staff and great location make for a pleasant experience for everyone! Prices reasonably and soo tasty!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pistachio cannoli but the very thin pizza didn't do anything for me. I like the overall look of the place very unique atmosphere but nothing special with the pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing.  Quite possibly the best in Charlotte.  It's very authentic (not NY style) and made in a wood fired oven.  This is the perfect lunch or dinner spot for people located in north Charlotte.  It only takes them about 90 seconds to make a pizza."}
{"text":"Alino is definitely a place to visit, but it is not for you if you want Dominos or Papa Johns - this is something completely different. Just look over the counter and you will realize that you have an entirely different experience. Walk inside and you should realize that you are in an entirely different world.  Yes, it is attached to the mall (which is a bit unfortunate), but it is awesome. The place is huge. I mean gigantic. The inside is simply open with all sorts of tables, and if they should ever be packed, you may need to share with others, but even during the holiday season, that does not seem likely. Perhaps no one has noticed they have opened.  Regardless, the staff is incredible - from the moment you walk in, to ordering your pie, to delivery and even after where they keep your table clean and sometimes even pop over with a bonus cannoli, they are wonderful.  When it comes to the pies, they are probably not what you are used to (unless you have been eating at Inizio). These are thin, but not too thin. They are cooked in a minute or two in a high-temperature oven, with tomatoes and cheese from Italy. They are not covered with cheese so you cannot even taste the other ingredients. You can get extra toppings, but you won't need them. try some of the specials and enjoy."}
{"text":"Usually, one wants to post on and on about 5 stars. And I do not give them out liberally... with that said, THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA IN THE ENTIRE STATE!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"100% amazing!! The best pizza around! We use to drive 40 minutes for this almost every weekend!! Now we live 20 minutes from here! All ingredients are imported from Italy and what a difference!! The staff is absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Alinos at Concord Mills is the epitome of an enigma.  The atmosphere is reminiscent to that of a cafeteria (not sure if this is the style of dining in Italy), but the food isn't priced to match the environment. When you look at the menu, you would think you're eating at a fancy restaurant, but that's not the case. Now, don't misconstrue my words because I do think the food is good, but some prices are questionable because of the portion sizes. I appreciate fresh ingredients but was a bit confused when they charged 9 dollars for a small bowl of greens with a ball of fresh mozzarella, and it wasn't even tossed in the balsamic vinegar like most caprese salads are. All in all, I will probably be back here again because I would like to try the different styles of pizza they have. I am also a fan of their cranberry gelato!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in the area. Super close to where I live as well. It tastes very authentic."}
{"text":"Alino's is step up from your everyday pizza restaurant.  They only offer counter service and use long picnic tables instead of tables and booths for seating.  Their pizza style is traditional wood fired Neapolitan pizza and comes in one size mostly.  They did began offering select pizzas in individual sizes recently.  They do not have just a plain kid friendly cheese pizza on their menu.  The closest thing they offer would be their four cheese pizza.  I was kind of surprised by that.  When my sister asked about it we kind of got the \"we don't make any customizations\" vibe from the guy at the register.  All of their pizza ingredients are imported from Italy and can be bought at their Mooresville location (not sure about the mall one).  The pizza is served on large metal trays for you to share with your party.  Paper plates, towels and plastic silverware are available.  They make gelato on the premises and it is delicious!  Again, they don't have a kid friendly option as vanilla gelato is not offered.  The closest thing is the dulce de leche.  The good thing is that they will let you sample the gelatos before you buy for those of you with picky eaters.  They offer classic Italian desserts like cheesecake, cannolis and tiramisu, but those are brought in from Queen City Pastries.  I can't speak to their taste as I have never tried any of them, but they look amazing.  All in all Alino's is great pizza, just be sure your kid's have mature taste buds and are willing to try different things."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the State.. I've eaten a lot of different pizza in Charlotte, By far best sauce..cheese...overall Best Flavor. Can't go wrong ordering these Giant Slices of Heaven. Customer Service was Fantastic..Give complementary soft drink for your wait..Which the wait is about 5-10 mins. This brick oven made pizza can take on any pizza."}
{"text":"Really yummy Neapolitan style pizza.  We usually get the cheese ones, but the sausage  one is also great. The salads are huge and perfect for 2 people to share.  They have hot marinara by the register that is great to dip your crust in.  The pizza is really filling, baked hot and fresh.  I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Alinos provides a convenient take on authentic Italian pizza. Think 5 guys meets pizza. They make their own dough and craft their pizzas fresh. This is not a convection oven style joint. We are talking hot coals in a brick oven. Fresh basil and sauce hit the taste buds just the right way. If you are looking for Papa John's midnight diarrea then you won't want to enjoy this wonderful 'za. Ciao."}
{"text":"Another great pizza gone away The Italian feel and taste is no longer at the Concord Mills location"}
{"text":"My wife and I were doing some shopping on Sunday afternoon and decided to go get some pizza at Alinos. We had always walked passed the place and thought it would be nice to experience it. So we went into the place and ordered our pizza as well as one cannoli. Than as we were leaving the place a gentleman at the counter asked us what he can help us with and I mentioned to him that we bought a cannoli and we were coming by to pick it up and to also buy another one as well. I told him I already through away the receipt and he said to not worry about it. After explaining to him that I wanted to purchase another one he just said \"don't worry about it\" and gave us another cannoli for nothing. This place had the best service and you could really tell that they enjoyed taking care of the customer. Also, both my wife and I felt that the pizza was the most authentic we have had in a while.   Please do your self a favor and visit this place. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had in a long long time.  Add your own fresh garlic, parmesan, san marzano sauce and hot peppers at the counter.  All fresh all amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love the pizza. Just wish they could get it crispy when requested.  I absolutely hate the turn and tip machine.  Love the outside area but wish they could so something about the flies. We had about 25 or so swarming us so much we had to go inside to finish. Love the idea of a spot to take the pup. Love love love the blueberry salad. It almost makes me forgo the pizza"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had since moving from NY. Always made to order with the freshest ingredients."}
{"text":"Wry good pizza fresh out of the oven. Sales were fresh and tasty.  Desserts were to die for. Fresh Gelato and pastries"}
{"text":"Everything you would come to expect as far as ambience and toppings are also present at this Alino in addition to their original location.   The Pizza is some of the best you will get in the state and is definitely Neapolitan authentic.   I will say that they didnt char the pies as good as this one as I get at the original location so maybe the cooks just need a bit more practice."}
