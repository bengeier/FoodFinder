{"text":"This place is a hit and miss some times the food is really great and flavourful and other times I have ordered food that was over salted or just bland. 

Service has been okay. Portions are a hit and miss for some things. I don't think I will be going back after my last visit though."}
{"text":"Great brunch, great atmosphere. I enjoy the steak and frites with peppercorn sauce really delicious and price is good. The back patio in the summer is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove from Rochester to celebrate our 12-12-12 anniversary in Toronto.  We chose Le Select for dinner, though we had not dined there since they left their previous location on Queen.  

We were impressed, from the beginning, with their \"new\" location, and very appreciative of our comfortable and semi-secluded table.  Our server won us over immediately with his great warm and welcoming smile and offer to provide some \"tips\" on the menu.  His tips on the menu, and his assistance in selecting a wine were greatly appreciated, and did not appear to be directing our attention to the more expensive items available, though I should add that he was very firm in his opinion that the frites are the best!

We were most appreciative that our server responded to our indecision by suggesting that we share a house salad.  A great idea that worked perfectly.  

My wife's steak was outstanding.  An impressive presentation and cooked precisely to her liking.  Neither of us could quarrel with the server's assessment of the frites.

My Boullibaise was excellent.

The shared creme brulee topped off a wonderful dinner that seemed a terrific tribute to the many years we've spent together.

The Le Select staff, and especially, our server, contributed to a memorable evening for two old-timers who have tasted the Best of Toronto over the past 37 years.  On our next trip to Toronto, we will drive to Le Select rather than watch the clock running in a cab while stuck in the traffic on Spadina."}
{"text":"We had our wedding here in the jardin and rented out the back portion of the restaurant. The food was AMAZING. The service was AMAZING. The event coordinator was..well, you get the idea.. Everything was top notch.  If you're just coming here for dinner, I don't think there is anything on the menu that would disappoint. I recommend the VOL-AU-VENT D'ESCARGOTS for an app.  Our guests are still talking about what a fantastic venue this was. Everything from the ambiance, the drink list, to the food. Highly recommended for private functions as well. The pics don't do this place justice in the evening."}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch on a long weekend with 5 other people. We had reservations and were seated in the back patio area. Really nice. You get light and feel like you are outside but it is covered so you don't have to worry too much about sun or weather.

Got the Kefir Pancake off the Brunch menu ($12.95). Delicious! Came with some poached pears and cherries and strawberries, stuffed with some berries. A great portion (1 big pancake). The kefir gives it density but it's still light. Friends got the French Toast, Croque-Madame, Eggs Benedict...all said their dishes were tasty.

The service was....touch and go. The hostess got us to our seat quickly but our waitress had some attitude after she messed up two orders. It got a bit tense and awkward. Usually I give waitresses slack but in this case, she was in the wrong. Also didn't refill our waters regularly, took away a dish without asking the person if they were done and put things on the bill that I didn't get. 

But otherwise, the brunch itself was good! The menu overall is a bit pricy for entrees depending on your budget but it seems the quality is worth it. Would come back for the food and venue (what the rating is based on). The service, with this particular waitress, was...weird..."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a few friends. There was hardly any food on the plate (tiny portions) and the prices were in the stratosphere. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and food are always top-notch. The atmosphere is French-influenced, and is very nicely decorated. It is very friendly and offers classic French brasserie type foods. If the weather is nice, the outside patio is lovely.

The menu has many universal restaurant fare (i.e. steak, salmon, etc.) as well as authentic French classics. All are well prepared. The steak is well cooked, onion soup is traditional and delicious, and the salmon is superb. The kids menu, if I may add, is one of the best I've seen! The desserts are well proportioned and great for sharing at the end of a filling meal. 

Le Select has a refined, Parisian feel to it and for French food in Toronto, it is quite a noteworthy spot. Service is usually good although I had had a few less than great experiences."}
{"text":"Amazing night. The service was excellent. Top notch.  The restaurant is cozy... Classy but not pretentious. The food is good. Loved the duck confit and boeuf Bourguignon. The creme brûlée is the best I have ever had.   We literally did not want to leave."}
{"text":"It was completely unexpected...a colleague suggested lunch; I thought about my pad thai leftovers from Spring Rolls in the fridge and thought, 'Why not?\".  And I'm glad I did.  He introduced me to Le Select Bistro and I fell in love...with the restaurant, not him!

It was just lunch, just casual, but I can see the broad appeal - wonderful patio where one can enjoy Sunday brunch, fabulous seating at the bar where one can sip a cocktail solo, ample seating with a real Parisian feel.

And the food?  I had the squash risotto and an espresso...not a great amount of food to judge from, but from what I ate, I was hooked.

I shall return...for lunch again...and for brunch and dinner too.

Vive la France!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and cuisine. This is quite a busy restaurant so expect to wait but the wait and experience is worth it."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. The duck was falling from the bone. Highly recommend the place and this dish."}
{"text":"Best Steak Frites Ever!

I went to Select Bistro after a friend's recommendation and reading up on Yelp and it did not disappoint.

Me and my mom both got steak frites and enjoyed a glass of beer. It was Friday evening (around 9:30pm, because they were booked solid earlier).

The only thing I have against this place was that it was a little TOO dim and a little too loud."}
{"text":"Exquisite food. Great Staff. Pricey, sure, but you've got to live!"}
{"text":"Good service but the food was \"OK\"... My husband liked his omelette. My salad was too salty I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try Le Select Bistro because we had read in a post by BlogTO that they have the best steak frites in the city. 

Upon arrival, our table was not yet ready, although we were a little late and we had made a reservation. When we sat down, we noticed that we were a little younger than the rest of the crowd in the restaurant (both 22), and felt that our waitress was a little cold with us. We decided we were both going to do the Prix Fixe menu ($35) but additionally share the foie gras ($18) to start.To drink, we both started with a French75 and then ordered a bottle of Merlot to share. Both were great, the French75 was excellent (and put us both in a great mood), and the Merlot didn't disappoint. 

The foie gras was one of the better ones I've had in the city, probably top 3 - so I'd 100% recommend it. For the Prix Fixe portion of the meal, we both ordered soup of the day to start, steak frites (medium rare), but then opted for one of each dessert (obvi), which were creme brulee and chocolate mousse.

The soup was ok, a pork-centric concoction, it tasted good but wasn't entirely memorable. The main course was really nice, the portion size was perfect for me; 4oz steak and LOTS of fries. (NOTE: because we were sharing the foie gras to start, our waitress suggested we go for half fries, half salad rather than the full fries serving). Steak was cooked perfectly and fries were seasoned really well. The house salad was, well, a salad, and when served next to the fries, was nice, but its still a salad. The desserts were both really yummy, although I did note that the creme brulee was a rather small serving size, while the chocolate mousse was fairly large.

Overall, Le Select offered us a great meal, I'd go back to get the steak frites, or just to have the foie gras and a French75 again. I've also heard they have a good brunch, which definitely piqued my interest. Considering how much we ordered, the value of the meal was fair, and reasonable compared to other restaurants in the area. The service could have been better, but realistically, after a couple glasses of wine, I stopped noticing."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bistros in the city. Very lovely ambience in a quiet neighbourhood. The patio is nicely shaded in the summertime but the back room is also a gem year round. 

Extensive wine list from the old world. Their house sauvignon blanc is quite nice and my go-to starter drink. 

I mostly come here for lunch on business or for when celebrating something while being able to staying nearby where I work. 

Service is always good and you'll feel well taken care of. Food is consistently good, their canard confit and steak frites have proven my favourites."}
{"text":"My go-to place downtown for great food, wine and ambience. Ive been with friends, family, colleagues and clients and every time we leave happy. 

My favourites include steak tartare and frites, salade frisée lardons, bavette, chocolate mousse, lemon tart and the list goes on... 

I always find an excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Intimate dining. Fine french cuisine. Great food! I'm sure some people can appreciate the bone marrow dish but that Is one that I do not recommend. Too rich in taste for me."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here for brunch. Atmosphere is nice and food is good. However, service was absolutely terrible.

We arrived at around 11:10am, there were some customers but not full house. We waited a bit more than 10 mins before waitress came by to take our drinks order. And after we ordered, we waited for over 45 mins for our food. We ordered regular breakfast items from the menu so it should not have taken this long. So i would not recommend anyone who is really hungry and in a rush to come to this place."}
{"text":"I had a delicious brunch with my SO at Le Select to celebrate an anniversary today. I am a big fan of brunch foods, and have been meaning to try out Le Select for quite a while now.

Reservations:
I visited their website to check ot their brunch menu, and realized that I could make a reservation online. Score! It wad a super smooth an easy process, and I had no difficulty getting the time I wanted.

Fresh impressions:
On arrival, we made ourselves known and were shown to our table in short order. I love the little bistro tables and tinned ceiling effect, and the floor tiles. It is not suuuuper fancy or pretentious, but elegant and has quite a warm ambience. The servers were sufficiently quick and friendly.

The food:
I always judge a brunch menu by their eggs benedict, and this one did not disappoint. The crusty croissant beneath shaved ham and two perfectly poached, runny eggs was the ideal in richness and portion. The side of mushrooms and asparagus were a nice interlude, but nothing exceptional. I'm less of a fan of English muffins Itendency to be dry), and usually this dish delivers too many carbs for my liking. The single croissant was a brilliant take, in my opinion.
My SO had the madame-style brisket sandwich with french kimchi, and also enjoyed his meal. I really liked the bbq-y sauce used, and would have been content with either dishes.
We both had fresh OJ, and the SO avers that they used oranges from California.

For two dishes and juices, our bill came to $45+tip.

I'd like to return for dinner, so Le Select remains on my to-try list.

Overall, an enjoyable experience that I'd recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday brunch with co-workers in early March and I was quite impressed with this place. I ordered the ravioli with vegetables and when my plate came out it was full of vegetables with a small piece of ravioli. The colours were beautiful but I was not impressed in that initial moment. Then I took a bite and it was probably one of the best meals that I have ever had. I then had the dark chocolate mousse with a cappuchino and the dark chocolate tasted so dark and smooth and creamy. This was a great meal and the decor of the place really added to the whole experience. I will definately be coming back here for brunch :)"}
{"text":"My second visit to Le Select was for brunch. We called to make a reservation and was told they only had 10:30 available (the time they open on Sundays), however throughout our entire visit there, I didn't find it to be particularly busy. Oh well..

I started with the freshly squeezed OJ ($4.50), which was served in a small champagne glass. I can never resist fresh OJ!

I started with a freshly baked croissant ($1.95). Although it was decent, it certainly wasn't anything to write home about. For a great croissant, I'd recommend Pain Perdu, which in my opinion, makes some of the best croissants in the city!

For my main, I decided to go with the Croque-madame - the classic gratinéed sandwich with ham and cheese, served with frites ($14.95). They also had a Croque-monsieur, so I inquired with the server as to the difference between the two, and he informed me the madame ($1 more) came with a sunny side egg on top. Of course I had to go with the madame. Everything tastes better with a fried egg on top! The dish was pretty heavy (particularly cholesterol-heavy) and when it was first served to me, it was glistening with the oil from the melted cheese on top. The dish was essentially a ham sandwich, with melted cheese on top, all topped with a fried egg. The dish was really delicious, but I only managed to eat about half of it, due to the heaviness of the dish and the fact that it was served with a large side of frites (also really good - crispy and well seasoned). 

My boyfriend ordered the Pain doré aux pommes -French toast stuffed with apples and cranberries served with Canadian Maple syrup ($11.95). The French toast was made with a two-inch thick piece of brioche. The toast itself was really delicious, but I wasn't a huge fan of the filling (since I don't really like cranberries). 

The other couple we were dining with ordered the Omelette au chèvre et aux champignons - seasoned goat cheese omelette with fine herbs, served with a mushroom medley and young bok choy ($13.95) and Oeufs et saucisses fermières - two eggs any style with house-made breakfast sausages and rosti potatoes ($13.95), which they both really enjoyed!

I love the french-bistro feel of this place and the service was great. A fantastic brunch experience!"}
{"text":"This would be 5 stars if the service had been friendlier.  They seemed pretty pissy that we weren't drinking alcohol at 11 AM (I was with my parents!).  As someone who almost always orders Eggs Benedict I veered away from the tried and true and opted for RISOTTO DE MILLET À LA BETTERAVE which had roasted beets, turnips, mushrooms, and was topped with a poached egg.  The risotto was cheesy and delicious and I was in heaven!"}
{"text":"Love the patio in the summer! Felt very old school euro and chic. The steak frites were perfectly done. The only advice I'd give is for the servers to be a little quicker off the mark to get that first drink order in. I don't mind lingering over a menu as long as there's vino in my glass!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my fellow co-worker, so I decided to give this place a try with my gf as we do not brunch much. As we walked in, it was quite busy and the seating is nice for couples with the 'U' shape booth. 

We got their two apps, and two mains.

SALADE DE BETTERAVE AU CHÈVRE CHAUD 
warm Québec goat cheese on frisée lettuce 
with walnut and a mixed beets salad 12.95

- Nice and tasty. Portion is decent size for app. Frisee lettuce is a nice salad.

SOUPE À L'OIGNON GRATINÉE 13.95 (French Onion Soup)

- This is highly recommended to try. The soup is very very CHEESY!!! And the toast bread inside the soup is still crunchy and not soggy which is a big diff. 
- Considering this price, I would say it is pricey, but this one stands out, so its worth it.

Honestly, just the salad and soup, I could of been full, but wanted to try more.

Mains: SAUMON GRILLÉ HOLLANDAISE grilled steelhead salmon with Hollandaise sauce, asparagus, baby bok-choy, and rösti potato 17.95 

- Portion is appropriate again. I enjoyed the salmon and rosti potatos. The veggies was bland to me.

two poached eggs on a croissant with ham and Hollandaise, 
served with mushroom & asparagus 15.95 (Gravlax substitution, add $1)

- Normal breakfast stuff... Gravlax is a something we don't eat everyday which is thin carpacchio thin salmon.

Overall, this place service is non-intrusive, they really let you sit and enjoy your meal. The booth are nice and the food seems to be good. I would come back again for their soup and try other stuff in the future. But it isn't cheap, nor is it too expensive, but definitely a once a month or every other week visit for dates and such."}
{"text":"Everybody mention Le Select as a brunch place. We went there for dinner and here what we've ordered: cheese plate and steak were good but the mussels (must admit that Le Select was recommended by BlogTO as a place to have them) were oversalted, sause was weird and mussels should be served in a big metal bowl not in a plate. And fries...well, strange. So we had quite a controversial experience. Atmosphere was lovely but I consider this place is way too overpriced."}
{"text":"One of the best drench places in Toronto.... The only one that offer great traditional dishes and not the tipical \" french dish\".... And the desert are the best in Toronto..."}
{"text":"While good, not up to standards of a 4 star Yelp review. Mostly surprised by bland prime rib, too much salt, and undercooked risotto."}
{"text":"WARNING: NO HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE restroom. None, absolutely no provision for a handicapped person. (We had a reservation, but were not forewarned, one in our group uses a wheelchair. We had to leave for another restaurant in the area - A REAL BUMMER)

But, we've been there several times previously; The food is great, truly French cooking at its best. The dish of the day is best value for the money. 

The service is competent.

Well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My aged steak was overcooked (asked for rare and was served a medium) and very chewy.  Wine ( 2009 Bordeaux ) was just terrible.
Can not complain about the service though."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night without a reservation we got a great spot on the patio, the service was just attentive enough, not overbearing and not pushy, but the server was available when we needed him, also the food was well timed.   The bone marrow was a delicacy we tried, we did not like it, but perhaps our taste pallette is not superior enough, the tuna was amazing and so was the kale salad, duck confit was delicious as well. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. It was not a lot of food, for a lot of money. If you're going to serve small portions then it had better be super tasty. I was quite excited to eat here. Bummer."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. Delicious, fresh food. Great value for a great meal.  kronenbourg on tap and a nice quiet patio.  Always a good call, 2 thumb up!"}
{"text":"Ever since I actually got to spend a goodly amount of time working in Paris, living like a local and enjoying all the French cooking I could shove in my face, I've despaired of ever finding something back here at home that compares.  

Well, while Le Sélect Bistro does deliver, in atmosphere, and a great selection of authentic French specialities that are impeccably prepared ... unfortunately the service is nothing like the rude, wanton disregard, and snippy, stare-down-the-nose attitude that brings back cherished memories of the Parisian Restaurant experience.  

In it's place, Le Sélect has unwisely chosen to staff their gorgeous establishment with warm, funny, knowledgeable servers who know the menu backwards and forwards and have an almost frightening grasp of the wine list ... all of which totally destroys the \"I'm in Paris!\" illusion that would have completed the experience perfectly.  As it was, I had to settle for the excellent food, and I'll have to continue to search (in vain) for the the elusive French uppity waiters who are obviously far too busy with something else to possibly bring you your silly-ass english-speaking food...  I'll let you know when I've found it!  In the meantime, enjoy Le Sélect Bistro!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy everything about this place!  I 've been here numerous times and everyone in our party has always loved it. That's a pretty tough feat since my friends all have very different tastes. The service has always been excellent! The atmosphere is very nice. We always order tons of different menu items and everyone shares. I have honestly never tried anything I didn't like. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love everything at Le Select, the food is amazing, it is always exactly what I want. Their eggs Bennie are the best in the city, and their foie gras is just too good. 

The wine list is pretty good, even their quick selections are delicious. And I admit we have spent some time sitting at the bar trying different wines and sparkling! 

The service is top notch, though sometimes their servers are a bit snooty, which is typically French, so it's ok.

This is one my favourites!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Toronto to take my mother to brunch, because you can make reservations, the service is consistently good, and the quality of the food has never disappointed. I find their dishes a bit rich, so I don't go here very often. But every time I do, it feels like a treat. Fantastic duck confit."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch over Thanksgiving long weekend. The food was delicious! For my starter, I had the French Onion Soup that is arguably the best in Toronto. A perfect balance of melted cheese, onions, broth and small pieces of toast. 

For my entree I had a medium rare (only way to do it) tenderloin topped with a fried egg and surrounded by perfectly seasoned frites. Would not change a thing about what was in front of me. Frites were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and the tenderloin was simply mouth watering. I'd love to know where they get their meat from. 

Our only problem with the meal was the terrible server! She had ZERO patience, wasn't warm or friendly at all. We all agreed that she didn't crack a single smile. Also our plates, cups, mugs etc. were never cleared until we paid and were on our way out. I hope she was just hungover!!!"}
{"text":"Great Parisian bistro. Excellent wine selection. Good kids menu. Good service. Delicious salmon tartar. Beef was prepared well and good fries. Selection for everyone. Bison tartar very good. First Ile flottant dessert that we have found in Toronto. Would definitely go back. Free parking in back."}
{"text":"I love the steak frites, the wine and the atmosphere here. During the summer they have a great little terrace at the front. The brunch menu is also very good - highly recommend the stuffed French toast."}
{"text":"So so so so disappointed, in light of all the good Yelp reviews here and also reviews from my boss. 

To start off, my partner and I were each given one bread roll. The bread roll was ridiculously stale -- it was hard to tear apart and then chew. The butter was almost cold and hard to spread. Really bad start. 

We then ordered the escargot, the salmon tartare, and cheese plate to share. The escargot was delicious, I'll admit, but a tiny portion. 

The tartare was very disappointingly bland and had almost no taste to it, and it wasn't as if the salmon tasted super fresh either. There was nothing to scoop the tartare on so we had to ask for another bread roll (which was again, stale). 

The cheese plate was ok but nothing stand out. The cheese were ok, the accompaniments were minimal and ok. 

We decided to order a dessert to see if our dinner could be salvaged. It sounded amazing -- some kind of frozen praline parfait. It was not good on both the praline and the parfait front. It was essentially two thin slabs of frozen ice cream with a hint of praline. There was no texture differences or anything else standout about it -- just ice cream. How was this a parfait???? 

Oh, and we also got a 3rd bread roll that was noticeably MUCH fresher. It tasted like bread should taste, and just goes to show that they must have been serving us bread rolls from the day before. 

Will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, terrible service."}
{"text":"Great food and good wines.  We thoroughly enjoyed every crumb of our dinner (we had the $35 fixed price menu with cold leeks and potatoes soup, the duck confit, and the risotto, followed by creme brulee and chocolate mousse).

We felt like we were falling out from the generally overdressed and snobbish-looking crowd.  Why would somebody want to sit on the patio in an evening dress?  Anyhow, we were not discriminated against (nor frowned at) for wearing jeans and sneakers, so this was not a big issue.

The service was aiming to be top notch, but falling somewhat short - we found our main waitress to be a bit too official, and the bus boys clearly did not know what they were doing."}
{"text":"Have been there twice. Solid food but nothing extraordinary. I would say it's a bit pricey for what they offer. If I want to spend that much I will go somewhere else. They did serve me the best glass of Malbec I have ever had."}
{"text":"Steak frites and chocolate mousse to DIE for. The outside seating is so beautiful and the service is friendly. A MUST visit while in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ate here twice the summer it opened (about two years ago). It may have improved since, but I don't plan on finding out. I never finished anything I ordered. The bouillabaisse was inedible--bland, and I suspect not too fresh. I also had to send back a steak, which was a first. I don't expect a flat iron to cut like a strip loin, but this thing was a solid slab of gristle. Couldn't cut it, much less chew it. And they had the gall to price it like a prime cut. That's what I felt like on both visits--these people must think I'm the dumbest SOB on two legs. They won't get me a third time."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and great service.  Delicious coffee, and we enjoyed their stuffed french toast and authentic maple syrup!"}
{"text":"Both the Confit de Canard and Croque-Madame were sheer perfection."}
{"text":"Strange location for this place as its' tucked right behind King West but it certainly didn't detour diners as I found myself behind 3 other groups on a busy sunny Sunday Morning waiting for a spot outside in their patio. This place is a French Bistro and the décor screams it which I like as it is very bright and clean inside. 

It's French fare so be warned that the dishes are typically very very HEAVY...you could find yourself going back home and crawling back to bed after brunch here. A lot of poached eggs options and their croissants are fresh baked. I tried the Croque Madame (difference between monsieur is this has an egg on top, I learn something new every day). It was delicious, HEAVY, but delicious that came with a side of frites. The ambience is busy but also very relaxing and I find the servers to be fairly attentive. My only criticism is the time it took to get our food, it was literally a 30 min wait since we placed our orders. But that won't deter me from going back but will certainly learn to order a basket of fresh croissants to start with next time."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, and have liked it. Even though the service is at times horrible, the quality of the food makes up for it. 

Today we went for mother's day brunch and well, let me say this was the LAST time I will ever go there.

First of all, they did not have their regular menue and wanted us to use the prix fix. They do not tell you this on their website / on the phone when you are booking a reservation. 

I am a vegetarian, and cannot have Hamm or Salmon. When I asked that they substitute goat cheese for the proteine, the waitress rudely told me that it was impossible and they wouldnt do it. now you have to understand I'e been to brunch to Le select a dozen times, at least in the past year, and every single time they substitute for me. This time though, the waitress just refused to even listen to me, or ask the kitchen if they could* do it.

My mother cannot eat pig due to religious reasons. I asked if instead of the sausage they could give her a side brisket. I said I would pay extra. the waitress again rudely said no and then refused to add more vegetables or rosti potatoes in place of it. the dish COMES with Rosti potatoes... apparantly it was too much* for the kitchen to add a little more....

The waitress then came back, and got into it with me over how it wasnt her fault and how its the kitchen. Again so rude. 

Then the food came back. 

First of all the portions were SMALL. half the regular portions. please keep in mind we did not order the entire prix fix. just items from it. so no reason to cut it down. just charge us the regular price, but give me the regular portions. 

my poor mother's food was essentially two runny eggs and 4 rosti potatoes, since clearly adding more potatoes had proved too much for the kitchen.

my food was bland and tasteless. I have ordered this dish before and its AMAZING. not today. bland, cold and soggy.

same thing for the fritz.

I am so dissapointed in LeSelect. I have recommended them to a lot of my friends and always have my birthday party and my anniversary dinner there. 

No MORE .

I dont know whats happened to the management/ staff/ kitchen / chef.But this place is NOT what it used to be. so dissapointed. a mother's day ruined. shame on them.

Skip this place and go to One or Bymark, where they actually RESPECT their customers. 

Ps. I should mention they comped my meal bc I couldnt eat any of it. so i guess thanks?"}
{"text":"It is such a nice and cozy place. I expected it to be pricey, but to my surprise many dishes were under $20. The food was great."}
{"text":"I have been to Le Select twice now, and the first time was good. The second time, a couple of days ago, wasn't. My boyfriend and I arrived around four o'clock on a Friday. We ordered wine, and two sizable appetizers to split as a light dinner. The appetizers were the cheese plate (three varieties of cheeses) and the meat plate (many different kinds of meats with two patés, or spreads). The cheese plate came with a handful of crackers, definitely not enough for the cheese they came with. The meat platter came with nothing and I was left wondering what the paté was meant to be spread over. The cheeses and meats themselves, however, are delicious. 

More to the point, though, was the terrible service. Our waiter took our drink orders, delivered the wine, and proceeded to blatantly ignore us for the rest of the time we were there in favour of a couple immediately next to us. At one point, he stood at this other table, discussing wines with the other couple, with his back to us, for literally fifteen minutes. We asked him for some crackers and he never brought them, nor did he refill our wine glasses. He actually just ignored us. 

How is this at all acceptable at a supposedly \"fine dining\" establishment?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto!! We have been going there for over 25 years ... When it was at the old location on Queen Street. I travel twice a year to Paris and the food and ambience is like you never left Paris ... I love the warm goat cheese salad with beets & walnuts and the foie gras melts in your mouth ... For a main course the Beef Bourgonine is so incredible that I dream about it ... For dessert the lemon tart is perfect and of course the wine list has so many  great wines to complement your delicious meal at very reasonable prices ... If you want that evening in Paris ... This is the real thing and I hope to keep going back for many more years
Bon Apetit"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. Always make a point of going whenever I visit. Good food, wine, and ambiance. One of the best places to eat outdoors in Toronto. Desserts could be a little more inventive, but that's a minor quibble. A little pricey, but I have never experience a bad dish (and I have had many different ones) in close to twenty years of visiting.

Update 8/19: Still great."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Le Select. I don't get to try French cuisine too often and since I heard many good things about this place, I was raring to go. Now this is beginning to sound like an intro to a bad review? Well, not THAT bad. The place definitely looks chic. We went for lunch, and I could imagine it looked prettier at night. Service was awesome - quick, helpful, friendly.

I ordered the grilled salmon with hollandaise sauce - picture pretty. But it really tasted overcooked, too salty and really nothing special. The rest of our table seemed pleased with theirs though - one had duck confit, another had the salad with goat cheese. Maybe just my plate had problems?

Unfortunately, I won't try it again to find out."}
{"text":"I would say this place started my french appetite. 

We had mousse de poisson fumé, Joue de beuf bourguignonne and
Duck Confit. Check out the pictures, they are all amazingly delicious! As if the food and sauce blends perfectly together when you bite on them. I am definitely coming back here if I am in town again."}
{"text":"We had my sister's birthday dinner at Le Select last night. Because we had a group of 17, we were required to have a prix fixe menu, which was $55 per person, and I was given many options to customize this. The menus were personalized with my sister's name. Everything from the booking process to the service to the wine to the meal was absolutely perfect. I would not hesitate to recommend this for a group - many downtown restaurants require a set prix fixe for a much higher $ amount, and a minimum spend, and the quality of food would not be at the level of Le Select. I often go for brunch and dinner, and would absolutely hold another party there as well."}
{"text":"This place is kinda like a French bistro, kinda like a Balthazar's in NYC, but it's very comfortably Toronto.  

Delicious steak frites, delicious duck confit, wonderful salads and soups especially the french onion soup.  

It's a great restaurant that gets mixed reviews, but for me, it's always been solid. I mean it's traditional French food in the heart of Toronto at a decent price.  It's not your Monday night Swiss Chalet dinner place but for a nice night out, it's a good option."}
{"text":"Let us not go overboard with the compliments. It is a very solid resto with an extremely talented kitchen. The service is adequate and I am being kind. Nevertheless, a good choice in the area of Spadina and Front, especially if you eat on the patio or rear garden.  For the record, I have been there over a dozen times. The last two times the experience was greatly diminished by the service."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked away unassumingly.  I was introduced to Le Select Bistro on a first date and it set the perfect mood.  We sat in the patio area on a warm sunny summer day and the ambiance made us feel like we were somewhere other than Toronto.  The service was great with attentive waiters.  We went back five months later on NYE 2012 and it was just as we had left it, great service and romantic ambiance.  Food was only served to those with reservations but upon telling the server our little story of meeting there for the first time, strings were pulled and we got ourselves a little meal with champagne.  Nothing but great words for this little gem."}
{"text":"Merely passable French fare, though having just visited Paris, I may be unfairly biased.

I didn't think the atmosphere here was particularly authentic - a touch too industrial, perhaps? - but it was nice. The seating is a bit cramped in the bar room section for me to consider it romantic at all.

The wine and beer selection is pretty decent, and the waiter recommended a great beer for my meal on request, but I cannot remember what it was. The couple we dined with opted for the BYOW. The waiter chilled the white for them and served it in an ice bucket next to the table.

My starter was the escargot, which was served in a small pastry vessel and generally lacking flavour. I asked the watier if I should have the cassoulet or the bouillabaisse, and he recommended the cassoulet so I went with that. It was humongous, hearty, artery-clogging and quite delicious. I was heartbroken when I realized I forgot the leftovers.

My husband had the steakfrites and gave it a \"meh\".

The server, while friendly, did not refill our water at any point and had difficulty splitting the bill amongst three credit cards when it came time to pay up, which, speaking of paying up, this place gets pretty expensive pretty quickly.

I like the food and atmosphere at the Paradis in the Annex just as much and the price is 1/2 to 2/3 what it is here.

I might come back to try brunch, but for dinner, I'd rather go to the Paradis."}
{"text":"Le Select is probably my absolute favourite Toronto restaurant--I've gone dozens of times, at various hours of the day and it has never failed. 

Nestled on a quieter downtown street, this authentic, casual yet elegant French Bistro features a gorgeous patio and a lovely interior, complete with an old fashioned zinc bar. The atmosphere is gorgeous--such a wonderful blend of comfort and style. 

 The service is prompt, friendly but a tad formal, and very professional--the servers are always knowledgeable and very much treat the patron like a guest! 

In the winter especially, I like to request a booth at the back for a little more space as the one drawback to Le Select is that the tables are very closely spaced--this can feel a little uncomfortable when the bistro is busy. 

The wine list is great, and servers are happy to recommend an excellent wine for whatever meal your'e having. 

All of the menu offerings are delicious and are very consistently prepared and presented. Some of the items may not be for the average North American however--Although delectable, Beef Cheek, Braised Cocks Combs, etc. may turn up a few unsuspecting noses--it's best to check with guests before deciding to make a reservation based on this. I love the Fois Gras and Scallops for Brunch! The French Fries, served with the Tartare and Steak Frites are excellent.  

I really enjoy having brunch at Le Select, but it can be quite busy--I would suggest reservations. I also love a late lunch here when the bistro is a little quieter and the aforementioned booths are usually open....

As a strange bonus, the washrooms are quite beautiful :)"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. One of the better meals we had in Toronto. The Foie Gras and Briskets dishes were both fantastic. Only complaint was the coffee - a bit too dark for my taste... But that is the preferred roast of the French."}
{"text":"I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were a group of 12. We had the back room all to ourselves...along with a couple who was having a romantic diner. Oy. 

I had the soup of the day which was..oh...so...tasty. And, duck confit for main. It was quite tasty but abit dry. The potatoes gratin was out of this world.

It is a BYOW with a $15 corkage fee. I'm from Montreal where BYOW, means BYOW without corkage fee! Still getting use to this."}
{"text":"Enjoyed: Steak Frites, Bone Marrow and service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times.  The minute I sit down I order the charcuterie.  It has to be the best I've ever eaten in Toronto (second to Daniel Boulud's).  
I ordered the cassoulet and my friend had the mackerel.  
The cassoulet was meaty and rich.  The beans were cooked perfectly.  This is a filling dish so it was the perfect comfort food on a cold snowy evening.  The mackerel was light and crisp, and not heavy and oily as one would expect.  
The service is wonderful and the wait staff don't hang all over you.  The only downside was that this was the first time that we got cold bread instead of the delightful warm roll that we were used to.  
Reservations were not necessary even though the restaurant was pretty full and buzzing with patrons."}
{"text":"This is a great French resto that is not going to break your bank. I usually order the steak et frites. The creamy cheese sauces is incredible and really compliments the steak. I like my steak cooked rare to blue and these guys did a great job of ensure that my steak was cooked to my liking. The fois gras creme brulee was also incredible - if you like fois gras you should definitely try this dish. The other highlight of this restaurant is the vast wine selection. Each dish on the menu comes with a nice wine pairing recommendation. As far as ambiance goes this is a very hip place - If your looking for this place to be some kind of worm-hole portal that is going to transport you to Paris... you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for a cool French resto in the city, that serves great French food, you'll be happy at Le Select Bistro!

PS - the patio here is really nice as well - great for brunch"}
{"text":"My favourite brunch in my area. :)

Try the french toast or benedict. You will love it for sure !:) 

xoxoxo"}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions for brunch and dinner and have yet to be disappointed.  Definitely a place to go if you want good quality food and exceptional service with a smile.

Atmosphere is very Parisian with French music playing in the background and the charm of a real bistro.  Love the decor because it's simple, but yet elegant and you really feel like you're in Paris.

I celebrated a birthday dinner here many years ago and remembered they offered a prix-fixe menu for the group, plus had a specialized menu printed for the party that indicated it was my Birthday celebration.  It was definitely a nice touch.

My recent visit, I came for a late dinner and we had a lovely server who was very friendly and attentive, but not intrusive at all.  She came at the right time and was available when we needed her.

The menu is quite extensive and offers something for every palate.  If you want real French cuisine, come dine at Le Select Bistro.  Plus their creme brulee is probably one of the best in the city. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"First visit last night. Liked the duo de gravalax although it was a bit salty. The poulet grille was awful . Very bland chicken and vegetables were covered in sauce that was too sweet and had a powerful vinegar taste. Room is very nice and they were accomodating despite no reservation. 
We also had the steak frites which were a bit of a let down as well. Frites were good but steak was tough. Strictly for french food lovers"}
{"text":"If you're looking for traditional bistro fare - this is your place. Excellent wine menu, delicious food and great service in an unpretentious atmosphere. Though I'm not a heavy meat eater - everyone loved their cuts - I opted for tuna steak which was perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday and had the duck confit legs with a couple Campari OJs. No reservations required and we sat out on the patio. Food was great and the location of the restaurant is nicely tucked along Wellington. Would be a nice place to go on a brunch date!"}
{"text":"Visiting Le Select was a nostalgic move, since it used to be a mainstay of French bistro-style dining in Toronto in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was located on Queen St ... it was good to once again taste a decent steak with some decent peppercorn sauce and appropriately stringy frites, but the service was inconsistent, after a promising start."}
{"text":"Been there twice.

First time: had their lamb burger, mimosa, and escargot. all delicious. Which is why I cam back second time.

second time: came with a big group, so we got two bottles of wine, lots of food. The lamb burger was still a hit. The foi gras I had was pretty terrible comparing to some other places. The wine was good. Duck was ok, kind of bland, chicken was tasty. Service was really slow. 

After the second visit, I had to take it off my \"fav french rest in Toronto\" list."}
{"text":"Je connais le Sélect Bistro depuis de très nombreuses années quand il se trouvait sur Queen West. Je n'avais jamais eu l'occasion d'aller au nouveau local sur Wellington et la surprise fut de mise : l'espace est impressionnant, le décor sobre ... La carte est très bien fournie et les plats proposés sont d'une très grande variété : ce sont des plats classiques pour les connaisseurs de bistrots et restaurants français, ce sont des plats peu communs pour les consommateurs de Toronto. Qualité, variété, ambiance ... excellent !"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday.
I was excited to try this place since I've heard so many good things from friends and co-workers.
I'm a sucker for eggs Benny so I went for their two pouched eggs with ham on a croissant for $15.95 yup not cheap! My bf ordered the 2 eggs and their house made red pork sausage for $14.95
My bf and I were both not impressed  with  our dishes  my hollandaise sauce was sour and we both thought the portions were quite small.
Our waitress seemed a little distracted and had to come back to our table to take our order a second time.She also had to be reminded to bring us milk,sugar and to refill our coffees.
I honestly expected a little more for the price and I have to say I was very disappointed :("}
{"text":"French bistros are basically everything that I love: beautiful atmosphere, a bar stocked with French-influenced spirits, good wine by the glass, charcuterie, and simple, unfussy classics so wonderful when well-prepared. Bistros are where I go to relax and wind down, thus, after an eight-hour drive to Toronto, and feeling frustrated by the nearby hotel where we had just checked in, I remembered spying Le Select while driving around the block to park. It was just what we were looking for, and a round of Negronis definitely took the edge off for both my partner and I. We followed that up with a plate of the head-to-tail charcuterie, with the lovely crock of pickles and a glass of wine, and thus fortified, headed off into the city to enjoy our trip. 

We determined to come back once more, because I wanted to indulge in my once-a-decade bite of foie, which they serve with Sauternes -- a wonderful pairing I had never had because so few restaurants have Sauternes. Again a lovely, lovely experience. Only wish we'd had time to have a full meal there."}
{"text":"Not only is the food here absolute perfection, but the restaurant is on top of its game. Even with a completely full house and a full patio, our party's food arrived perfectly as ordered (the blue steak, even, came perfectly blue!)."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the service.

Unfortunately, what everyone else has been saying about the lackluster service is very true. Our waitress seemed annoyed she had to serve us and rather aggressively threw down our bottle of wine and additional silverware.

The food on the other hand is actually very good. 

We started with the foie gras and escargot. The escargot comes in a buttery, flakey pastry crust which was a decadent/melt-in-our mouth texture. This was my first time having foie gras so I cannot objectively comment on the quality but overall, I'm not a huge fan.

For my main meal I had the Loup de mer provencal - bass filets with chickpeas, sunchokes, tomatoes and olives. In case you didn't know (I didn't!) sunchokes are from the sunflower family and taste similar to artichokes. This dish was incredible! Full of flavor with some very good textures from the firm chickpeas to the buttery softness of the bass.

All said, if you're in the area, I would stop by. However, due to the service, I would recommend other dining spots in the city."}
{"text":"Duck confit was on point and the \"tendon de boeuf\" - 72 hour slow cooked beef short rib was absolutely fall-off-the-bone delicious. We shared the pig ear salad. Very fresh. 

Mains were $25-$30 so reasonably priced. Ambience is classic French bistro. 

Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"I'll charitably say that there was a mix-up with our group reservation. Handled the appropriate way, it would have been a minor issue. Instead, we were met with cold indifference, along with no effort to come up with a solution. I felt for our server, as the manager on duty repeatedly told us to leave. I have never felt more unwelcome by a business.

I'm sure this place has great food; it clearly has some great wait staff. Just know if things go awry, you'll be left wanting."}
{"text":"I would compare the service in this restaurant to the service in a fast food restaurant.  The waitress was more interested for a group of us to hurry up and finish our food and leave.  No consideration was given to the fact that we were a group of friends having brunch and wanting to have a conversation between eating.  

If spending more than 25 minutes in a restaurant eating and socializing in a is a norm for you - think twice about eating here.  Your conversation will be interrupted by the waitress who wants to remove your dishes while you are still eating and there is still food on everyones plates.  Certainly would not recommend."}
{"text":"Le Select is a lovely, classic French bistro.  The atmosphere is warm and light-filled, and the food is reliably good.  The menu doesn't serve up any surprises, but surprises aren't necessary when there are so many excellent French classics to try.  The salade de betteraves au chèvre is amazing, as is the confit de canard.  It's hard to go wrong with the extensive wine list.  Le Select is a great place for a nice lunch or a date."}
{"text":"We arrived to a packed house at 1:30 on Sunday. Our fault for not making reservation but we were told it be 15-20 minute wait for table which turned into more then 40 minute wait this is where they lost star. Service was fantastic waters and coffees were refilled several times during lunch. Food came in reasonable amount of time was hot and you could tell they use amazing quality ingredients especially the salmon by how pink it was after being cooked. My friend had the duck confit was very satisfied with their meal. Our waiter was friendly didn't let the busy rush effect him at all. I'd definitely consider returning here to eat again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Very good address. Good variety of french food. They have organic and sustainable food. The restaurant is very nice. It feels like being in Paris almost. Staff is very friendly too. The patio is super nice."}
{"text":"Love the French bistro decor. Suitable for romantic dinners for two in intimate crescent shaped booths or for large parties in the back room. Roasted tomato and fennel soup was the best of it's kind, delicious fresh hot sour dough bread, foie GRAS terrine with orange rind was the brilliantly devised for balance of acid and creamy. Salmon with french green lentils was savoury and prepared medium rare nNot too sweet Exotic Sorbets polished off the meal as a terrific palate cleanser. Service was friendly and helpful and atmosphere was very nice. Surrounded with inspirational posters of great master painter artists exhibits on the walls and candles on the tables. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Le Select wants very badly to be seen as Authentic. To this end, the owners have built an homage to the 1930s Parisian bistro: the brown wood, the bistro chairs, the frosted glass, the big one-page menus, etc. -- the kind of place that, in Paris, looks like it's been there forever and has the scuffs and patina of age to show for it. Too bad that on Wellington St. it feels like the Disney version thereof - more a marketing creation than an authentic expression of French culture.

But hey, those bistro chairs are surprisingly comfortable and the service is friendly. So let's move on to the food. An extensive menu that hits all the traditional French notes: bavette and bouillabaise, cassoulet and choucroute, and so on. So far so good.

It all starts well enough, with soupe à l'oignon - nice rich broth, lots of cheesy goodness on top. Well done. The os à moelle - bone marrow - is served not the usual way - tubes of bone about 3 inches long - but as a long bone split down the middle, \"cro-magnon style,\" as the menu has it. Looks impressive, but the already rich marrow is swimming in fat. (Yeah, I know, is that really a bad thing?) It just doesn't excite the taste buds the way it does at Black Hoof. Next, the leg of lamb is perfect... but the joue de boeuf bourguignonne - beef cheeks braised in red wine with pearl onions, lardons and mushrooms - meh. The beef is tougher than it should be, and the mushrooms are MIA. Crème brûlée for dessert is just as it should be - a relief after the disappointing cheeks. 

So, all in all, the food is OK, not great, and the décor is more touristy than authentic.  I'm sure that when Le Select opened on Queen St., in 1977, it was revolutionary (as the restaurant's marketing keeps reminding us). Now, it's just another OK French resto in a city with better options. Want authentic neighbourhood bistro? Go to La Palette or Batifole. Want French tradition on a larger scale with a more expertly executed menu? Biff's. I'm sure I'll end up at Le Select again one day, but I am certainly not rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Very good, although pricey, french cuisine. The menu has some interesting items. My parents like it so much they go every chance they get! Went on a weekday and the noise levels were through the roof however.. lots of loud chatter."}
{"text":"Decent food but did not blow me away.   Pleasant is the somewhat bland word I would use.  But there's nothing wrong with pleasant, right?

Our server was personable and attentive - she was careful to set expectations around some of the items on the menu. 

The menu has several classic french options and for our party, which included two vegetarians, we appreciated that there were more than your usual meat heavy options leaving veggies with only salad or sides (on this date there was a risotto and a very light ravioli dish; as well as 3 of the 4 salads), as well as a socca provencale.   
  
It's the kind of place where you could bring your parents or a more conservative diner -- there's no scary fusion or 'small plates' or wacky menus.  Basically free of gimmicks; and the lighting is high enough to read the menu (ahh, I must be getting old, or my dining companions are getting older). It's a sizeable space also likely good for large groups.  

Overall reasonably priced, esp the 3 course 'menu fixe' which includes salad/soup, duck confit, steak frites or risotto (veg) and creme brulee/ chocolate mousse to finish for $35."}
{"text":"Tasty and good service. Definitely recommend trying some of the dishes with less common ingredients such as the tripe and bison tartare. 

Would consider this a nice dining restaurant except for the casualness (decor, dress code) is definitely that of a bistro."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed that everything tasted amazing, that I will Le Select Le Bistro as my future lunch/brunch spot! 

1. Croque-Monsieur $13.95 - This sandwich is the bomb! Covered with melted cheese with more cheese & ham in the middle, you might want to change your fries to a salad to keep the calories lower. The edges were perfectly crispy, and each bite was rich and delicious! 

2. Poulet Grille $16.95 - Grilled chicken breast on top of roasted zucchini, tomato & an arugula hazelnut piston. I don't know how they do it, but this is the juiciest chicken boob I've tasted. 

3. Confit De Canard $16.95 - the Yelp-famous duck leg confit! The skin wasn't crispy as stated in the menu, but the meat was very tender. It is served with potato au gratin, which will fill you up - otherwise portions are rather small. 

Service was a bit slow because of how busy they were. The clientele seems to be mostly business men in suits (wink wink) grabbing a quick bite. Everyone who works here appear to be fluent in French. My very Asian mother accidentally walked into the men's washroom because the sign was in French. Even their menu items were all in French with English descriptions on the bottom. Took me a while to decide what to eat. 

Parking in the back is cramped, with one lane to enter/exit. There's no back door entrance from the parking lot, so be careful of entering cars when walking around to the front door. 

I think it is general consensus that brunch is the most awesome meal of the day, but I must try their dinner menu some time!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city.

We've been a couple of times and everything on the menu is delicious. It's not that pricey for what it is, and the quiche is pretty much the best I've ever had. The waffles were light and fluffy as you're hoping waffles will be.

Coffee is excellent, though surprisingly, it's not french press. I don't really care, but I guess if you're looking for a perfectly French experience, it's worth mentioning?

They take reservations, so make one if you can.

Anyway, it really would be a five star in terms of Toronto brunch, but there was a mean manager who treated a server badly, which always leaves a bad taste in my mouth (punning around!).

Yay for Le Select Bistro! So tasty, we'll be back for dinner."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Food, service and atmosphere is always top notch. Everything we've tried here has been delicious but one thing we especially love is the Neanderthalesque bone marrow. I'm drooling just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Le Select Bistro!  C'est le yum.

I had no idea that this place was here!  
Back in the day, the only reason I was out here was to go to C Lounge.
Well, it's been a damn long time since then, so I was surprised that there was this cute bistro here! 

Continuing our Yelp night out (and YAY for Jenn K.'s 200th review!) we found ourselves here.

The decor captures the essence of a French bistro.  Dim lighting, decor of dark wood, brass, and tiles.  The hipster waiters are friendly and attentive, but I prefer bistros with cute French waiters (*cough, Le Societe, cough*). =)

It's hard to resist a Prix Fixe menu... and steak frites for $20 bucks!
There are a few options available for the late night dinner.

For mains: Steak, duck confit, asparagus and Parmesan risotto...
Your choice of soup or salad or dessert.
Creme brule, please!

The steak is 5oz, so it's snack size.
My steak was slightly overcooked but still salty and good.
The fries were skinny and crispy.

I liked my meal here and I would come back here if I'm in the area, maybe. 
But there are other French Bistros that I prefer."}
{"text":"This place is so perfect! Came here with my parents when they were in town before the Jays game. Made a reservation for 11 and we sat outside in the front. It did fill up by the time we left so definitely make a reservation. Food was delicious, I got the cheese omelet. They have a back patio as well. Overall, very nice, classy, relaxed place. Will definitely be back to sip some rosé and enjoy delicious French food!"}

Review of Experience: 

Arrived shortly after 5:30 for our reservation, and was met with a very friendly host. The server was very friendly and let us have lots of time to read over and digest the menu (which all the dishes are title in french with english descriptions).

The have a very (VERY) extensive and organized wine list/book/novel for you to choose out of, both with sommelier picks as well as brief descriptions of a majority of the wines. The food menu is not exhaustive but has a great deal of unique dishes. 

Started with the French Onion soup & Foie Gras. Have to say the French Onion soup might be one of the best I've ever had, especially in Toronto. Cooked to perfection, it has a balance of cheese, bread, and soup that doesn't have an overload of onion taste or thickness. The Foie Gras was good, nothing particularly amazing, but delicious.

Main course, we had the Duck Confit (x2 legs), Rabbit wrapped in bacon and the daily special open face ravioli. Each dish was as good as the last. The Duck Confit has a perfectly crisp skin but juicy and favourable meat, the rabbit wrapped in bacon was delicious and tender and the open face beef ravioli was surprisingly amazing. Each dish had it's own unique sides which was very paired perfectly. 

Lastly we finished the meal with the Creme Brûlée. Had a perfectly caramelized top, soft texture  and a like vanilla bean finish at the bottom.   

Note, there is parking at the rear, but the lot is fairly small and could be someone difficult to park/leave from. They also do an amazing job accommodating nut allergies with their dishes."}
{"text":"Great food great service!! Thank my mom for taking me here for my birthday :))"}
{"text":"We have been many times, and have never been disappointed with the food here. 

Our most recent visit saw us celebrating birthdays. Service was very attentive. Massive wine list will definitely impress. We started with the Terrine de Poisson Fume, lovely and delicate. The description they used on the menu \"airy\" was definitely accurate. Mains consisted of a rich boeuf bourgnignon and the spicy rabbit Merguez sausage, and our plates were finished entirely. Save space for dessert - the creme brulee made us wish we had ordered two instead of sharing one."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  Best French place in the city. We go all the time. Love dinner, love brunch. Always consistent and great food! 
Great atmosphere!  Always recommending it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful deco in a French bistro. Good business at dinner hour. We had a good time there. The food was delicious but the portion of the prix fix dinner is a bit small."}
{"text":"This was my second time having brunch at Le Select, and I was again not disappointed!

The service was great, the food was delicious and the wine was resplendent. I had the eggs Benedict again because they were so good the first time. The fries are also delectable - I would recommend a plate for the table to share if you have a group."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait. The decor is awesome, but brunch service takes forever. In order to compensate for the service the food needs to be out of this world...unfortunately that is not the case of Le Select Bistro. Nothing amazing just average for taste."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch in the past trips and brunch was excellent. 
However, recent visit I came here with family for dinner. I was a bit disappointed with the service and food. We had ordered a few appetizers and while ordering the waitress got interrupted and distracted by an elderly lady next table. She started talking to the lady without asking us if we were done ordering/ questions. I got her attention as she tried to leave after talking to the lady and ordered another appetizer. 
Only one appetizer came out. Later we got her attention and told her and she acted surprised and told us she did not get the other order (the one we ordered before she left to talk to the old lady) 
Yup, you didn't  get the order bc you weren't paying attention to us when we were talking to you and you went to the other table. 
We weren't angry or anything when she left to talk to the lady and we talked among ourselves how weird that was. But when we realized she didn't get our order, we were disappointed with our server and how she reacted when we asked her about the other appetizer. It kinda ruined our meal having an inattentive server. 
Food was ok. None of our main dishes were amazing per say but ok. 
I would go back for brunch but not sure about dinner. 
They do have great wine list if you can go through it all."}

{"text":"I cannot say enough how much I love Le Sélect.. This is probably one the most atmospheric, refined and friendly French restaurants in Toronto. There are a few other excellent French tables in Toronto but this is my go to destination for good authentic French brasserie fare, sometimes with a twist. All the classics are here. Boeuf Bourguignon, Tartare, Cassoulet, Choucroute, etc.  Originally on Queen Street west (remember the bread baskets hanging over the tables?), they moved some years ago to this bigger and much better location on Wellington street.The interior is very nicely decorated, with this Brasserie Parisienne atmosphere.
I went there for an early dinner with the Pretty Ballerina on Monday, June the 2nd 2014. The weather was lovely and we opted to sit on the lovely front patio.
Service was very friendly and efficient, and our waiter even spoke French with me, which is something I like. I have this thing about speaking the language of the cuisine I am savouring, it is a must. Unless of course, I do not know it (here is looking at you, Arabic and Vietnamese!).
As I was waiting for my dinner companion, I savoured a  delicious pastis of the Ricard Brand($6.50). Classical presentation, long glass with ice and pastis, with water in a nice carafe with the Ricard logo on it. The selection of wines by the glass is limited but at the same time, quite varied. We all had  5 oz glasses: 2 whites, Chablis Domaine Laroche '12 ($12.25) and Muscadet Coing de Sèvre '10 ($10.75) for her, while I had a red Cabernet Villa des Anges Languedoc '11 ($10.25). I had the pastis already so one glass of wine was enough and my guest had the muscadet as her apéritif.
We started our meal with an excellent dozen of Malpèque oysters ($29.00). While not specifically a seafood place, Le Sélect chooses very good bivalves, as they should: oysters and seafood platters being a forte of brasseries all over the Hexagone.
Then, the Pretty Ballerina ordered the Roasted Salmon with  cold Quinoa and Aubergine salad, which was delicious ($16.95).
I ordered the Bison Tartare. Bison is a perfect meat for this dish: not really fatty, with a good lean, fresh meaty taste. This tartare($17.95) is well-seasoned, with just enough spice and the chopped pistachios on top are a delicious touch . We tasted each other's dish and concluded that Le Sélect is very apt both at surfing and turfing.
For the finale, we shared the parfait praliné ($10.95). Praline is a popular French dessert ingredient  made from candied almonds and hazelnuts that are finely ground to make a sort of crunchy powder. This dessert incorporates it in an ice cream dish which is delicious and light on the palate, yet throws quite a flavour punch, simultaneously sweet and salty.
Often I skip coffee at downtown restaurants and head elsewhere for an after dinner caffeine fix, but Le Sélect is quite skilled with the espresso machine: we both had a cappucino(which makes for 2 cappucini, 4.50 each) and enjoyed it very much.
One word about Le Sélect's wine list. It is one of the best in the city and you will find a lot of different bottles for every taste at every price range. If you check the bin end section, you may find delicious bargains.
In conclusion, Le Sélect, after all these years remains one of the strongest dining options in the downtown west area. If you are a fan of French Cuisine and if you like restaurants similar to Les Halles in NYC, you will love this establishment."}
{"text":"The food was really good here! I had the beef brisket and I really enjoyed it. The service was not great - it was busy - but it wasn't bad either. It wasn't too pricey - for a downtown location. 
I'd definitely go there again - if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm now old enough to remember the days when Le Sélect was located in a beautiful little space flanked by used furniture stores, The Horseshoe, The 360 and other indie stores. As rents went up on Queen Street, Le Select and their bread-baskets on a string disappeared, or rather moved south to Wellington. Now, it's just far enough away to make it an occasional, rather than a \"what the heck, it's just down the block\" kind of place. The food has also changed in the same way as the bar which is to say it is far classier than back in the grubby QW area.  
The Lemon tart reminds me why I love lemon tarts- so much more than most of the french places within a few blocks of Le Select. It is brulee'd with a sugery crust and is so puckery good. 
Wine selection is certainly a reason to visit. The zinc bar is gorgeous and to select a find bottle of wine from the reserves and savour that while seated at the bar talking to the comely bartenders sounds like a great night out to me! 
Private event space also makes Le Select a potential Wedding reception, fancy family dinner or impress the clients venue."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Love the eggs Benedict. Good coffee. Great ambience and decor. Portions kind of on the small side so not the best value for money."}
{"text":"Bien sûr c'est tellement chic! The atmosphere is amped to the max and I swear you'll think you are in some Parisian Bistro, or even a little something you would find more so in the southern coasts of France.  There were times when it felt a bit too overdone, but that could be overlooked, and forgiven. 

The price tag was a bit steep but the food was worth it, and I guess that is why it didn't reach a five star with me.  There are places that could deliver the same punch for your buck, but nevertheless a spot in Toronto worth discovering."}
{"text":"Nailed it! 

Ordered the fixed price menu $35.
 Got the soup of the say which was a sweet potato puree and quinoa and smoked pork sausage. Delicious but a lot, could eat as a meal on its own. I got the duck confit. It was cooked perfectly; skin was crisp and meat was moist.  And finally came with creme brulé, which was okay. 

Dave got the rabbit wrapped with bacon. It was moist and the bacon was crispy. He really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner reception here after our wedding and everything was wonderful. The food was really stellar. They took great care of us. The service was just gracious, not pushy or impatient in any way. Despite there being some folks in my family who are not the easiest people in the world to serve and we didn't break the bank with massive bottles of wine or anything. Highly recommend the steak frites and the salmon tartare."}
{"text":"I went to Le Select for Brunch on Sunday without a reso. we were stuck in the cafe at a dinky tiny table. My eggs Benny was quite nice and my bf had the lamb and thuroughly enjoyed it. That being said i wasnt overly impressed. I do plan on giving it a second chance for dinner."}
{"text":"This hidden spot along Wellington was the location of a friends recent surprise birthday dinner. It's gorgeous looking, sophisticated and they serve great food. 

Fair warning, if you're a large group beware of the stuffy geriatric patrons who frequent this place on the regular, they can (and are) extremely rude to younger folks (such as our group) who were celebrating a birthday AND a surprise engagement. Seriously, one particularly sweet piece of heaven walked up to the new bride to be as she showed off her ring and told her to contain her excitement a little as there were other people eating... really? Oh and the old guy who told us to \"keep our broads in line\" - classy :-/

Thankfully, I must give it up to the staff of Le Select, they turned this potential series of confrontational night ruining events, around quickly as they offered us a private dining room towards the back for our group on account of the celebrations. I know this was more to keep the other patrons happy but we appreciated their efforts to maintain our happiness as well (rather than tell us to shush).

Once the craziness has settled down, we to settled in for some french fare! I was excited because the center portion of the menu listed multiple kinds of Steak Frites and I hadn't had this dish since my days in Paris back in 2010!

Given the smaller sizes of some of the cuts of meat, myself (and several male members of my group) opted for the larger, more adventurous Bison steak frites. Even while writing this now my mouth waters as it was one of the best cooked and most tender cuts of meat I'd had in awhile, served with veggies it was delicious! And the frites (fries), shoestring and crispy - almost giving McDonalds a run for their money (just kidding these were way better than McD's)!

They had a great selection of wine, spirits and the boys got into the scotch and bourbon pretty heavy, making the night even better! Service was impeccable and the prices (for a French restaurant) were extremely fair. 

Gentlemen, mark this as go to Toronto date spot, I'd even recommend the romantic rear garden patio at night which has fountains and gardens lit up for the special romantic night you've got in the works!

Au Revior! Eatcrest."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at this place with friends.  It was quite tasty, great little (within reason) bistro.

Everybody loved their food, plus they have Chimay White beer, which is awesome!  Would gladly come back here again and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely trash. They will seat people around you and offer larger groups tables and send small groups to sit at the bar.

The hostess is also extremely dismissive and does not try to fix the situation at all. She offered tables to parties around us and I was only informed that the restaurant was offering tables by another patron.

Food quality is not bad. But not worth me dealing with that type of service as there are tons and tons of comparable restaurants."}
{"text":"Right when we got out of the cab I felt I was transported to a french side street. Well mostly because Wellington west of Spadina is a strange, strange land. My boyfriend and I recently just went here to celebrate our two year anniversary and I'm really glad he picked this place. Great steak and a huge selection of wines, What more can you ask for? 

We both got the steak frites which was so delicious. A 4oz steak piled high with caramelized onions. Aka foodie heaven. He got the red pepper soup to start and I got the salad. Both were pretty good and left us feeling quite full at the end of the dinner. 

The service was also really great. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. Over all it was a great night out. Woo anniversaries!"}
{"text":"I made reservations at 11 am for brunch on a Saturday morning. There was already a small lineup of people waiting for the restaurant to open its doors as I drove up. There is free parking at the back of the restaurant and I believe you can park in the lot next door during weekends. Street parking right out front is $2.50/hr.

The service was superb from the start. Water brought out and drink order taken within minutes of being seated. Water and coffee refilled without being asked. Everyone served the dish they ordered without playing pass the hot plate! The waitress was very attentive.

I got the eggs benedict and the french toast. The rest of my table got the goat cheese omelette and eggs & sausage. One of my concerns was that the portions would be tiny seeing some of the pictures of skimpy plates on Yelp. The portions were actually perfect, even for the fellas in my group. I was surprised by the superb quality of the food and how they had managed to elevate simple breakfast dishes. 

My eggs benedict was delicious, best I've had in fact (more bests coming). I usually find hollandaise sauce bland, but not the case here! They even made me love runny yolks (I had forgotten to ask for my yolks firm)! The french toast was one huge slice (1/4 loaf of bread) stuffed with apples and it was served with maple syrup. Each bite was soft and delicious. I had a chance to taste all the other dishes as well. The pork sausage is bar none the best breakfast sausage I've ever had. The blue cheese omelette was delicious. Even the simple steamed veggies that came with each dish was done to perfection. Apart from my bellini, I also had a cappuccino. It was pure foamy deliciousness!! None of the items were greasy. So we had all indulged but stayed relatively healthy!!

The dining room has great ambience. I didn't get a chance to see the back dining area (had requested a seat there but was sat in the front,  thus the one star off). I will be back in the summer when the front glass doors are open and the terrace is in full bloom.

Overall, a great upscale brunch option with quality food and great service."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is quite pretty, the patio is nice, and the service is good...but the food is only average. I've been here for bunch a few times (I usually get the quiche or the croque monsieur) but I've never been blown away by this place."}
{"text":"I've only been to Le Select for brunch, but I really enjoyed it!

They've got a beautiful patio on a very pretty section of Wellington St.

The Croque-Madam is so freakin good. It's definitely a must have....and even though you'll be full, you will still find yourself munching on the huge side of yummy thin crispy fries that come with it. I challenge you to get through them all."}
{"text":"- the brunch is dope here. great atmosphere. not pretentious. a place where hipster, yuppie, and older folks can all get together on a late sunday morning.
- all their eggs are from free range menonite (sp?) farms - no factory farmed eggs which i'm totally down for.
- get two croissants. you wont want to share even one with a loved one! or get the eggs benny, as it's served ON a croissant!
- and yes, it does kind of feel like paris. 
- their bathroom situation is kinda odd though with the common sink area for men and ladies..."}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday at Le Select and the place lived up to the expectations. The food was very good, except for French Onion Soup that had excessive amounts of cheese, too much bread, and not enough onions. I also had goat cheese salad and Bouillabaisse, both were excellent. My husband had escargot in pastry and bison steak tartar, he loved them both. We both finished our meals with creme brulee - excellent. The service was fine, it was quick and friendly. Make sure to go to the washroom (even if you don't need to), you will see their kitchen - yes, they have french speaking staff there - and absolutely amazing wine cellar (see picture). Speaking of wine, they have crazy wine selection (300+), but everything is quite pricey. We noticed that the main menu also had few wines and these were a bit more reasonably priced, we ended up getting a bottle of Cab-Merlot for $50 (I think this was the cheapest option) but it was still quite good. The complementary parking at the back was a nice touch. Unfortunately, it was a cold rainy day so outdoor seating wasn't an option. Overall, we had a good experience and will likely come back, but we paid just under $250 for the two of us, so this is certainly a place for special occasions..."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and the ambiance on a Wednesday was great. It was for my wife's birthday. I made prior reservation and did not have to wait. We ate the risotto and the lamb burger. The food was great, the lamb burger was amazing. The service was very slow and not up to the mark. Our waitress just attended to us once, and then came directly with the cheque. I called for other side orders which she completely forgot and wasn't around to order another Beer. 3 stars over all, will I go back ... I don't know."}
{"text":"The strip between Spadina and Portland has two of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, Marben (closed down, revamped and now open) and Le Sélect.

It seemed fitting to take my sister to this Parisian bistro while she was in town - she hails from Montreal and loves her a terrasse.


I usually go to Le Sélectfor dinner. It's charming and serves classic French food with flavourful flair at a good price. It's also a nice place for brunch when the sun is out.  Their patio is the best way to say goodbye to the weekend - a cup of coffee in hand and a warm mini baguette to start. My sister found her Benedict on the salty side, but a bite of my house-made sausage saved the day. As for me, anything served with Rösti potatoes is, by default, amazing.




 
OEUFS ET SAUCISSES FERMIÈRES 



 
OEUFS BÉNÉDICTE 

Sunday was warm and sunny - perfect for a sit on the garden patio. Two coffees, two classic dishes, me and her...goodness comes in twos."}
{"text":"We ended up here after the first few choices had the kitchen closed. Whats with Toronto having most of the decent places closing kitchen at 10 PM on a Saturday! 
Ah well I made sure they had the kitchen open before venturing here. I had this place bookmarked for a while and was thinking of trying there late night Prix Fix. Alas they don't serve it before 11 PM, never mind I decided to go with the normal Prix Fix.  I had the House Salad, Steak Frites (benchmark item IMO for all Bistros) and the Chocolate Mousse. Dinning companion who ate already earlier stuck with the french onion soup.
The place was bustling and has a very nice warm Parisian vibe with friendly staff, The beer selection for draft is good, bottled beer is even better. The wine selection was very impressive from what I saw and the prices seemed reasonable. In fact I think I will just come back here for a drink or two again. 
The food took a bit of wait to arrive (maybe me starving added 10 min). The soup was good according to my friend. Salad was forgetful. Steak frites were just OK with the steak nothing to write home about and fries elevating this dish a bit. The dessert was below average as well as the mousse was more like a pudding (my idea of mousse is light as air).
The meal was below average for what you pay here. I would say 2 star with a star thrown in for the bar area and beer list."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday when Mahas and Lady Marmalade were too busy. There wasn't a line to get a table and thank goodness there wasn't because the food was delicious. They have a nice patio as well. The brunch is slightly more expensive but was well worth it. We ordered the eggs with salmon and the omelette - both were season and cooked really well. Service was also good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have tried out their brunch menu several times and just recently checked out the dinner menu. It was a great experience all along. I ordered the steak with fries and my friend ended up having the braised ribeye. Both dishes were really good and the steak was cooked to perfection. We finished off the dinner with a couple of desserts: the Creme brûlée was a big yay but the mousse was just ok."}
{"text":"Le Select is my go-to place for authentic French bistro fare in Toronto. The food here is great! Some of my favourites are the french onion soup (which is perfection), duck confit, and cassoulet. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance as well, with a distinct French vibe. Great place for a date, or dinner with friends/family. Plus they have parking!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming this tradition French bistro since it was on Queen St., with the bread baskets hanging from the ceiling. I had my first date with my wife in 1998 there, and three weeks ago we celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary. It is a place where we always felt it's warm embrace and enjoyed a culinary experience that rarely disappointed. If there was a cockup, they made it right. Friday, May 18th, 2018 all that, and years of memories with friends at Le Select, came to an end. It was a total lapse in the quality of service and customer attention we've only ever experienced and expect from Le Select. While I waited on my wife to arrive, I ordered the fois gras terrine. A perennial gastro favourite of ours. I was handed a cocktail list. The frois gras came  minutes later but they offered no cocktail. In fact nothing was offered for 45 minutes. It's usual to order a less than dry Gewürztraminer or better yet a Sauterne. A tepid glass of water sufficed to wash the terrine and brioche down. In the meantime, several servers and food runners, passed by without a look or any queries. I was stewing. Normally, I would politely point out these shortcomings, but I was having less than a stellar day and only looking to indulge. My lovely, and no wallflower wife, arrived. \"Still no wine?\" she observes. That was it. The tipping point. When, clearly we were perturbed, a server was immediately on the scene. All they had to offer was, \"They were busy.\" A Friday night, busy you say? A shocker. We were part of the busy. Yet somehow, we fell through the cracks. It happens. Don't get me wrong. But Le Select, has a reputation for great food and even better service. We love traditional french cuisine and this bistro has been our go to for over 20 years. Recommendations for another classic French bistro are welcome. We've moved on."}
{"text":"Amazing. This French style Bistro has gotten it right. Their menu is extensive with savoury steak being our table favourite. The wine list was so in depth and our server, who happened to be a Sommelier, was more than informative. He made both menus user friendly and really made our dining experience a Brilliant one.

I highly recommend the Steak Frites, and the Creme Brulee. We paired it with a Chateau Haut-Monplaisir, Prestige, 2004 Cahor. It was perfectly paired with the steak.

Merci Le Select."}
{"text":"Above average food and ambiance, cannot say the same about service. 
We were seated at the furthest table from the entrance on a completely empty day. To put into perspective, the front hall was half empty, we were taken to the back hall which was completely empty and seated at the furthest table possible. Okay, no problem, we won't bother anyone and vice versa.
We sit for a couple of minutes (without any attention) then are approached by a gentleman who informs us that our stroller is blocking the fire path/door. At this point, the stroller is indeed about 10 inches in front of the door. But we notice something funny. The fire door opens out into a back patio, and there is seating and table set in front of this door (photographed). The doors would not even open properly, let alone abiding by the fire route regulations. 
Now I am an informed and vocal person, but I'm also a smart family man and I don't want to ruin our night out. My wife is much more informed and vocal but luckily, she is also smart and holds it back. We enjoy the moment we are together as a family.
The food is good. But let's please (as the owners and customers of this restaurant) take a moment and remember that such establishment should in fact meet both service and cuisine criterion.
I hope they feel a bit of shame for whatever childish demographic standart they were trying to empose.
4 stars for the food. Negative 3 stars for the service/experience."}
{"text":"Overrated could best sum up my experience at this restaurant. Let's start with the good. The decor is really nice, with a true feel of a French bistro. From the bar top to the booth, the ceiling to the tiles on the floor, the bottles of Ricard neatly lined up on the walls, this place looks, smells and sounds like a true French Bistro. 

Now the food. It's not that it's bad. It's just that it lacks vibrance, and there are tons of little details which are wrong. For instance, I took the foie gras as an appetizer. I can not say it was totally bad, but it had a number of problems. First, it was glistening when I received it, as if the slice had been put into some kind of invisible jelly before being served. That definitely altered the texture which was more smoochy than a true foie gras that's been homemade (there is no way this one was, or the guy who made it should go back to cooking class). It was also a bit acid, and I have to say, lacked taste. My impression is that the chef ordered big foie gras ( more than 400g) which have a lot less taste and generate more loss than smaller ones. 

My next dish was the sweetbread. One word: miserable portion. I cook sweetbread at home when I have people coming over and I know how much it costs here to buy them at butcher shop. Nothing like the price in France where it's considered an expensive meat. Here it's about one third the price for the same quantity. So it is beyond me why my plate only contained 3 little pieces each could be eaten in 2 times. This was a joke. The sauce was good (yet too salty) and the accompanying vegetables excellent (mushrooms, bok-choy and potatoes) but the meat was definitely missing. I hate that when a restaurant tries to hide that they're running out of a dish or don't serve decent portions.

Deserts were OK if uneventfull.

Service was not great. At all. Whoever the hostess is, she sure got one thing right from the French (I'm one, trust me I know my kind): she managed to get that face where she's smiling and look grumpy and positively unenchanted to see you. I watched her come and serve some tables during the lunch and she was seriously not happy to be here, yet managing to put that fake smile on herself that grumpy French waiters manage to get. The waiter we had was positively bored of serving and almost took offense when we asked him to give us water glass without ice. There is something screwed up in the work atmosphere of this restaurant and it has gotten to a point where patrons are beginning to notice. 

The last, and the worst part of the meal, was the price. I am not shy to paying hefty prices for superior food. I go to gastronomical restaurants several times a year because I enjoy good food. Of course, I knew where I was going when coming into this place and knew it was not that kind of restaurant, however knowing the price tag in advance, I was expecting better. This place is absolutely over-rated. Their quality is so-so, the quantities are very small (when I order sweetbreads, I don't want a plate of vegetables, no matter how good these are) and their by-the-wine glass is a joke. What other place offer wine by glasses of 3 oz for the prize of a 5 oz (and of course the 5 oz is as much more expensive). The owner has understood that \"French\" in Toronto was a goldmine if you offered the ambiance and a minimum of know-how in the cooking and he's milking that cow like crazy. I have friends in the restaurant business and I know what small portions, sub-par quality and disgruntled staff means: either the place is in trouble to meet the rent (I'd be surprised here) or the owner is a voracious vulture who wants to make more money than the average restaurant economical model allow for and he's cutting on the patrons. That's what is happening here I believe."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner. Went with guests from out of town and everyone was very impressed with their food. Went with the price fix menu and the options were good. Particularly enjoyed the chocolate mousse and duck confit. 

The patio is lovely."}
{"text":"My favourite place in Toronto!
Not just my favourite French place, my favourite place, period.
The food is consistently fantastic, the staff is amazing, the atmosphere is great...
Anyway we come here every week, I bring everyone and it is always a great success!
Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is an experience. From the second you walk in you get the full treatment from start to finish. The layout is really nice it's set up making anywhere you sit feel like a private space. It's a very intimate decore which gives it a feeling of warmth. Each day they have a meal special- I high recommend Sunday's ribs.wow. For all meat eaters out there this is the dream! They also offer a byob for wine for a corkage which is always a nice touch
A very nice spot for a special occasion or celebration"}
{"text":"Pricier, but amazing! Mimosas and eggs Benedict were a great way to start a Jays game day in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Le Select is one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto. It's truly a French Bistro in the North American sense.  They have great French cuts of meat - the Pave is my favourite for dinner or the Beef or Biston TarTare. Wait staff are always helpful - sometimes a bit absent when its very busy - but generally friendly and knowledgeable.  Great front and back patio for brunch or dinner with friends.  Brunch serves a great Croque Madame and Eggs Benedict. Select is in my top 5 go to places and has been for years..."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. 1 star for the oddly sexist attitude of the seating host last Sunday during brunch. 

I stood in line with my husband ( I stood in front of him) - the seating host (male, thin with glasses) skipped over me and asked if my husband needed help. 

Ok....will give him the benefit of the doubt...maybe I'm invisible. 

Later after we are seated with our party of 12 (birthday brunch for a friend) - the majority of the group were female with 3 guys. The host goes up to the far end of the table to a MALE diner to confirm, \"is this Shelly's reservation?\"

Weird right? He's clearly not Shelly?! Does this guy just not see or talk to women??"}
{"text":"I always have the best dinners in Toronto at le select.  The foie gras and the sweet little bread it's served with is delicious. My boyfriend loved his beef bourguignon which was tender and in a lovely sauce - the perfect portion! I also recommend the onion soup, cheese plate, and also their extensive wine list! Absolutely a must when in Toronto. And they're open later than most : )"}
{"text":"I had my Wedding after brunch done at this place back in 2016. It was wonderful & very good - they have a private room in the back. The pain au chocolat tasted so close to what we are used to in France! Great menu choice & it was easy to plan the event with them. I would 100% do it again. The only thing I was a little disappointed in was on the printed menus for the event they misspelled my husband name even though it was written by email and it's not a hard name lol."}
{"text":"With all of the great reviews and a friends personal recommendation, I was quite excited to try Le Select Bistro!  However with a number of small things that could easily be corrected, they ruined my Sunday Brunch experience, and our party of 10 will probably not return.  

I've worked in the service industry, so I wouldn't complain about things that I know can be out of the restaurant's control however the following things were unacceptable:

Greeting:  We waited 10 minutes before anyone even said hello, when the host finally did appear there was no hello and welcome just how many?  (there were tons of servers and bartenders walking in front of us and the line up of people that formed to get a table, not even one acknowledged us or said that someone would be with us in a few minutes.  This leads us to wondering if we are standing in the right spot?  Do we wait to be seated, very confusing and a poor reception.)

Then we are led to a table for 2 after my partner tells the host that we have a reservation for 10.  We get to the table and tell her that, she goes back to the computer, with a manager, neither of them can find the reservation.  Luckily they have space in the back (1pm on a Sunday , prime brunch time)  And go set this up.  Leaving us to stand awkwardly where we were left, no ushering back to the waiting area, so we went back ourself, all fine again, but the beginning of a bumpy road.

We are seated, our friends arrive, they have an 8 month old baby, to be fair they warned us on the phone there were not high chairs at the location, however we asked for a booster seat, and the server said, they have them, but don't recommend sitting children on them on the chairs we had (we were on the back patio, with more rickety chairs, however if it were me, I would have brought a chair outside from inside which could accommodate the booster seat, quick fix right)

Anyway ignoring these things, choosing to have a great time, (was a college reunion brunch) placed our order and went about chatting.  

The place was busy, the food however did take 40-50minutes to reach our table, ok fine, it's busy we get it, (no check in with the server or manager or anyone to tell us this was happening.)  Then one of our party didn't receive any water, even though they brought everyone else some (without asking, which was great)  She asked for water when her food arrived, the server did not bring it.  We asked for salt and pepper as there was none on the table, didn't get it.  We asked for ketchup for the frites, you can guess where this is going?  Didn't get it!  We asked for cream for coffee, 3 times, didn't get it.  One of the dining, paying guests got up and got all of these things for everyone at the table!  That to me is so unacceptable, and we didn't do this immediately, we tried waiting for the service we are paying for.

This is a pricey place, brunch plates are 16-25$, as well a morning mimosa or bellini $10, so it's not like dinner prices deal with service, Le Select is really missing out on providing a great experience for all guests.

To top it all off!  On our way out, the manager at the computer, stops us and says, just so you know we ended up finding your reservation.  We are like ok?  He's like it was cancelled, did someone call to cancel it?  There is no way that anyone from our party called to cancel this, in fact we asked for noon and they asked if we could take 1pm instead, which we took, but this was an error on their end, and the manager thought it appropriate to stop us and say, it wasn't our fault, trying to blame this again on us.

Anyway it was just a snowball of things going on, of course the 15% gratuity was added to our parties bill, I'm sure no one tipped above that, to be honest, it was a rare circumstance where I wanted to not even pay the 15% auto amount, and just add like a 5% tip to cover tip out, but being a good Canadian we just paid the bill and got out of there.

Le Select really really missed the mark!  I'm sure it will continue to thrive for it's great location, atmosphere, and decent food, (though tiny portions for $16, I had the eggs Benedict, half a croissant, two eggs, super thin ham and a small portion of veggies...)

I really hope the establishment reads this review and goes through with their staff the small things that they need to do correctly to let their guests enjoy their experience, all of these things could have been avoided to frustrate us and definitely our word of mouth experience will be repeated.

Thanks for overcharging for a sub par experience!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Le Select at 9:30 last Saturday night for our 9:30 reservation.  There were three of us.  We were escorted to a table that would not have comfortably fit two much less three.  Why such an inappropriate table would be offered us is beyond me, but hey, I guess the rule is always get rid of your worst table first.  I informed the hostess that we would not be able to sit there and were told we could wait at the bar for another table to open up.  Fine.  I have no problem waiting.  As we sat at the bar she gave each of us menus.  \"We aren't eating at the bar\" I said, but she just ignored me and left them.  There were two bartenders and another restaurant person behind the bar.  They were cleaning glasses, chit chatting amongst themselves and generally ignoring us.  Finally, after about 10 minutes I asked, \"you do serve alcohol here don't you?\"  
 
At around 10pm we were finally seated and low and behold....it was the same table but with an extension on it.  Oh well, it is now ten and everyone was hungry so we sat.  
 
Service was slow to adequate.  The food was just above average to poor.  Both women had the Steak which was not bad.  I had the grilled chicken which was horrible.  How can you screw up grilled chicken?    
 
I eat out almost every night of my life and I know that restaurants have good nights and bad nights.  My girlfriend however was really unimpressed.  She felt so strongly that she wrote them a note the next morning.  It wasn't a harsh letter, just a chronicle of an unsatisfactory dining experience.  Their response....nothing.  No, \"we got your letter and are looking into it\" or \"sorry you had a bad experience please try us again\".  
 
That they didn't respond to her is symptomatic of what I think the place is about.  They just don't care about their clientele.  It is a beautiful restaurant, expensive by TO standards, serving mid range chain restaurant food.  Take the food from Milestones and serve it up at Le Select and I am sure the regulars would not notice the difference.  
 
Its unfortunate because the place has so much potential to be first rate. That it neither achieves or aspires to anything more than mediocrity is disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the french bistro atmosphere and the cozy round booths at Le Select. I remember liking it here, and after spending last spring in Paris and Lyon, my boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our 5th Anniversary with some French fare.

Service was wonderful. The server was funny and held us to decide on ordering the whitefish mousse with the foie gras terrine to start.

Foie gras, as always, was melt in your mouth delicious accompanied by brioche toast and sour cherries. The cherries were sweet, but perhaps a bit to sour to pair well with the foie gras, so we ate them on their own.

Smoked whitefish mousse was an experience in texture and with the soft rosemary focaccia, it proved to be a savoury cloud from heaven.

Mains fell a little short. My boyfriend's steak frites was okay, but the meat tasted most of caramelized shallots and nothing else. Frites were excellent, but could have been coked just a fraction longer. I told him to ask for some that were a little more well done, but he never sends food back.

My res de veau (sweetbreads) were definitely not the best I've had. They were great, because they were sweetbreads, which I love, but they weren't cooked very well. There was no colouring on the outside layer of the meat and the inside, typically found to be creamy and of a differing texture from the outer layer, was just homogenous and unexciting. This is coming from someone who has cooked them at home as well as eating them often in restaurants. The mushroom madeira sauce was ok and it also featured a potato cake that, while having a nice contrasting texture, seemed tough and perhaps not the freshest.

We finished with a lemon tart, which was nice and had sufficient zing, but the back crust of the pie was falling apart. My boyfriend enjoyed his semifreddo.

We had a nice dinner, but I wasn't impressed with the food. It felt as though a few line cooks had been drinking and prepared the food in a rushed and loveless fashion. I've eaten here before and it was wonderful, perhaps it was just a bad night, but I remember it being much better. 

I might return for brunch, and perhaps even for dinner since I'm confident that they can do much better."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, incredible food. 
Servers are so attentive and the restaurant is tucked away on Wellington away from the hustle and bustle of king st. The patio is very romantic and dog friendly. Such a cute French feel here. Would recommend 100 times over!"}
{"text":"Outstanding eggs florentine. Service ranges between impeccable and the worst ever experienced. Gorgeous decor. Kind of like a Canadian version of Balthazar, but needs more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on eating at le select.  So much hype as the go to brunch spot in Toronto.  I've heard of supposed line ups and long waits.  Anyway, we chose the morning after the snowstorm to go, so the crowd was non-existent.

The restaurant itself is pretty neat.  A nice ambiance and parisian feel to it.  I'll admit I was a bit hyped to eat here.  It's also hard to screw up brunch.  We had the eggs benny and eggs and sausage.  They had run out of croissants (at 1pm and a 1/3 full restaurant?).  The eggs benny was nothing spectacular.  The hollondaise sauce had a sour taste to it.  I've unfortunately had better eggs benny at half the price.  My eggs and sausage was two small eggs (yes, I get that they're fancy organic ones) and two small house made pork sausages that tasted like they came from a hotel continental breakfast.  The rosti was good, though.

Service was mediocre.  Friendly but forgetful waitress.  Maybe my expectations were too high or I just ordered the wrong thing, or maybe the lunch/dinner is much better.  Either way, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"An expensive but very satisfying brunch spot! I came here with a friend on Sunday at 11am. They were very busy but it didn't affect the service. We didn't have a reservation as our plans were last minute. We only had to wait about 10 min for a seat, which is amazing compared to the 1 hr wait at Portland Variety. 

The service and atmosphere were great. Compared to other brunch spots in Toronto, this one had an older crowd. 

The prices are higher than other brunch spots I've been to. On the upside, it was the best eggs benny I've ever had! We also ordered a croissant to share and the bread they served was also tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Eaten here almost 100 times. My favorite bistro, bar none. Albert Ponzo is a wonderful chef and the wine list is fantastic. 

Bouillabaisse, Steak Frites, Chicken Basquiat, Beef Cheeks, Short Ribs, French Onion Soup, Terrine de Foie Gras, all brilliant. Desserts and cheese plate superb, too. 

Had nearly all the servers. So wonderfully consistent.

Think Paris, taste Paris. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome braised beef. The duck confit was good but seemed to have more of an Asian flare (ie anise) rather than letting the natural flavour come out. Fois Gras was great but not as good as the few we had in Paris:.. cool and very difficult to cut and spread. Otherwise we loved the place."}
{"text":"Love it... Great food, great atmosphere, great service! Hands down- one of my favorite brunch places in the city."}
{"text":"I had brunch here  2 weeks ago and absolutely enjoyed everything about the restaurant. The food, decor, atmosphere was the perfect way to begin a Sunday."}
{"text":"We had a lively and memorable rehearsal dinner at Le Select on the Friday evening of our wedding weekend, hosted graciously by my granny. We had about 60 people and used the Atelier space in the back of the restaurant overlooking the terrace. It was a wonderful affair and the staff at the restaurant couldn't have been more helpful, organized or pleasant to work with. 

I have been for brunch and dinner at Le Select a handful of times over the years and so I knew the food was classic and solid, but I had never been to a private event here. It was great! My mom and myself worked with Michelle Cummings, the special events coordinator, and she made everything a breeze for us.

Le Select brings a great balance of down to earth, but highly professional business and service. They have many options to choose from for your group and we ordered the suggested amount of canapés for our numbers; we did wine, beer, coffee, tea etc based on consumption; and a 3 course menu (printed and personalized for us) with 3-4 different options for each course listed which our guests could choose from at the time of ordering. We had the hard, but delicious choice of selecting the menu options, but Michelle was great with helping us appeal to the masses while still picking dishes that we love. 

On the night of the rehearsal dinner the staff were attentive and all of our flowers, menus, seating chart and table numbers had been set up. The parking for our guests was complimentary, which is fantastic (they have a private free lot in the back for patrons). There was space against the window where toasts/entertainment could occur and this happened after passed canapés when everyone went to their tables. If it was during the summer months, this sort of thing would ideally happen in the garden terrace for better viewing and acoustics.  Overall everything ran smoothly. 

It was a great way to kick off our wedding festivities with the bridal party and close family. I would highly recommend Michelle and their private events team if you are wanting to plan an authentic but unpretentious and charming smallish event downtown (min is 16 guests, max is listed at 70 guests if you rent out the Atelier space, but realistically 60-65 guests is optimal for comfort). 

Note: if you use the Atelier space in the warmer months you will have access to said outdoor terrace which would be lovely for canapés or even a harvest table set up outside."}
{"text":"Le Select is a good option for a group brunch/ outing. The restaurant is like La Societe's smaller and more down to earth sister. It has that Parisian feel and a front and back patio in the summer. Service was not very on point. We were a group of six and although there were four of us already there, no waiters came to even offer us water and/or take any drink orders for a while. 

Surprisingly, I loved their capuccino. It was very creamy and frothy. They also offer a couple of Belgian beers on their menu which was cool.  It definitely put me in a better mood. The brunch menu has something for everyone; and thus, I decided to go with the French toast, which in retrospect I wish I hadn't because it was nothing special. If anything, it was gimmicky. There was barely any filling and the fruits were almost non-existent. I think more brunch places should learn something from the french toast at The Swan. It is still my no. 1. 

We decided to take another chance with the tarte au citron, but that was nothing to write home about either. I would have liked more tartness and could have down without the caramelization on top."}
{"text":"food was good but a little underwhelming. 
the usual brunch/lunch menu items were not available...on s Saturday afternoon. 
duck confit, foie gras toast etc. 
everything on the menu was really mediocre and not very impressive. 
the lamb burger i had was good and the fries were tasty, but i really wanted more authentic french choices or even more interesting ones...
good but not great"}
{"text":"Got a seat by the window, enjoyed the view. Great ambiance, service, help with wine pairings. Food is spectacular, the meat is so tender and served hot. 2nd time here and will be back."}
{"text":"Great brunch - the Croque Madame was exactly as it should be and the fried egg on top was perfectly cooked.  

Great food and atmosphere - has a very Parisian feel."}
{"text":"True french bistro dining.

I took my friend here for brunch- he's lived in france and montreal for most of his life and he fell in love with it instantly.  

Beautiful decor on a small street, comfortable bistro that was much more affordable than it looks.

I ordered the regular eggs and sausage breakfast and my partner ordered an omlette.

Good points:
-Homemade sausage that was the best sausage I had ever tasted in my life
-Hashbrowns: I usually douse my breafasts in ketchup and hot sauce but my friend, in true french style, would have given me the look of death if i had asked for ketchup in a french bistro.  So I went at the hashbrowns alone and DAMN, they were good.  Now I know WHY the french get testy over ketchup- you DON'T mess with excellent seasoning)
-Eggs: they OBVIOUSLY put a lot of cream and butter.
-DESSERT (yes, I ordered dessert at brunch)- the creme brulee was probably one of the best i've had and my partner's lemon tart was delish and had a bruleed top aswell (unique and tasty).
-Good service, affordable- entrees are around the 13$ range
-EVERYTHING out of the kithen looked amazing and well-plated.  I wanted to stay here the whole dato eat lunch and dinner!

Low points- The croissant is made in house but pales in comparison to Brassaii and the little store on Church Street.
But the croissant was also a fraction of the price of those other places as well (1.50$)

Note that this is TRUE french bistro dining- quaint, no table cloths and a VERY nice way to spend a weekend brunch.  The food is HEAVY.  They don't overload your plate with tasteless food- it's a good portion made with heavy creams and butters that is VERY filling.

the quality/price ratio makes it an easy regular spot for my weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Classic French bistro; from the ambiance (lighting, music) to the décor, staff and food, this is a great place to visit for lunch, dinner or to host a private meeting (small groups). Highly recommend the pâté, salads, wine selection and steak-frites!"}
{"text":"Located on a quiet street a little west of downtown, this is one of Toronto's sort-of-hidden gems.  I believe it's gotten popular over the years (I've never seen it so busy on a Saturday) but they've kept up nicely with the crowd.

We recently went here on a Saturday night to celebrate birthdays.  We were placed in a large room in the back with a high ceiling and a large group - we found it very noisy (and very hot) but by the time it got to irritating levels, we were well into dinner and didn't bother saying anything.  Our server was fairly attentive although the large group monopolized his time most of the evening.

We all started with the French onion soup, which was delicious.  Three of us has the peppercorn steak frites, which was delicious and tender, though a tad stingy on the fries.  The other at the table had the lamb which looked pretty good.

Overall, it's a great place for an evening out.  Very French bistro style and with very good food.  In the summer they have a cute garden with a waterfall that's great for a romantic night out.  This place is worth checking out - just beware of large groups!"}
{"text":"Drop by the other day to try this restaurant out from a recommendation, and unfortunately was quite disappointed in the whole experience. Was nicely greeted at the door by either the manager or the host of the restaurant and even tho we had no resos we were still able to grab a table. As soon as we sat it kinda went a bit downhill from here. We recieved our menus but our waitress was nowhere to be seen for about 15ish mins, eventually she did show up, but there was no introduction of herself, no apologies, no asking us if it's our first time here, lackluster to say so far. I am personally not too familiar with the menu so we went on a limb and order some of her recommendations which included 

-The Onion Soup
Pretty standard, more heavy on the beef concentrate, with barely any flavor of caramelised onions, the cheese and croutons were good but I've had better at Morton's.

-Escargot in Puff Pastry
Extremely disappointing, pastry was not fluffy but kind of stale, sauce was extremely runny, escargot was overdone, and it just was extremely bland. I would skip this in a heartbeat.

-Grilled Hanger Steak with Caramelized Shallots
Hanger Steak was a bit bland, barely had a crust, and the meat itself wasn't that much different from what you can get at The Keg or Baton Rouge. But the frites itself was quite salty so I don't know what happened there. The alcohol they caramelized the shallots with took away the complete flavor of the shallots and literally had an unappetizing strong alcohol orange rind taste to it, regardless we just left it on the side.

-Fillet Mignon with Green Peppercorn Sauce with Brandy and Cream
As I am aware Fillet Mignon is one of the most blandest cut of meat, but it's no excuse for it to taste the equivalent to a romp roast. As mentioned before under-seasoned, no crust, and my greatest suggestion is to PLEASE have the sauce on the side as I had requested. The sauce itself is very heavy of brandy and I find it takes away almost all the flavor of the beef. In my opinion if the sauce was applied on top it honestly would taste like a roast beef with gravy and not a steak. Disappointed 

We had skipped dessert as from the entire meal it was a lot left to be desired, disappointment in how all the dishes were done we didn't bother about desserts. Also the neighboring table had ordered a mousse and it was extremely droopy which they had sent back, that alone discouraged me about how the meal was going to go. The complimentary bread was not warm or at least toasted, so we didn't bother with it. Sparkling water was Perrier...might as well drink soda water, Orange Juice was sour. Server didn't really seem interested about taking care of us, the bus boy however I will congratulate worked quite hard and made sure our table was setup nicely for the next meal.

Bill for 2 came up to $130ish dollar with a 15% tip post-tax.

Unfortunately the inconvenient location and the mediocre food and experience I'll probably not be returning. Toronto has a lot of other better options in that area and this one as I mentioned before isn't one. There's just so much competition I thought at least Le Select would step thier game up but just like when we left there was no goodbyes or thank you on the way out, so sadly I won't be saying hello to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"It's been 5 months since I came back from Paris.  I miss the charming bistros that are seemingly everywhere in Paris.  Not so plentiful in Toromto but Le Select certainly helps!

The Yelp reviews complained about service and food but my experience was all positive.  Fresh bread, good food, and nice ambiance.   When in Paris... Or when downtown ... Come in have a glass of wine and enjoy..."}
{"text":"The food and service were exceptional!  A delicious Bordeaux wine.  Brandade de Morue appetizer.  Delicious venison and duck confit.  Finished with the perfect chocolate mousse-- rick dark, not too sweet, and the perfect texture and density: creamy with some air but not fluffy."}
{"text":"If classic no-fuss French bistro is what you're looking for then Le Select is an excellent choice. Food is consistently good. Price is on point and competitive for the offering and ambiance, with charming patio seating for the summer months. 
Food: Classics such as steak frites and onion soup never disappoint. They serve an excellent brunch on weekends, including a perfectly fluffy omelette with creamy goat's cheese. Order a side of sausages, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Need to get this out of the way now, this is hands down my favourite restaurant. I've been coming to this beautiful spot on Wellington St. W for just about 2 years now, maybe a dozen or so times, and have yet to experience any kind of \"off taste\", dry meat or anything even resembling inconsistency. It's as if the chef in the kitchen is a machine. From the duck confit to the seared red deer, everything here is delicious. Have gone with groups of 4 or more a number of times, so when I say everything here is amazing I know this for a fact, having tried everything on the menu. The appetizer I recommend is the \"terrine de foie gras\" served with a few pieces of lightly toasted brioche bread, the foie gras is extremely light and smooth as ever, turned into a pâté style dish with a marmalade on the side. It's one of the main reasons I continue coming to this restaurant. If you're a wine enthusiasts, look no further, their massive wine list will make your head spin, a wine for any occasion. When it comes to the desert, call me old fashioned, I need to go with the creme brûlée, I won't spoil your desert by glorifying it here, try it and see what you think. What more is there to say 10/10, 5 stars, 100% recommend this restaurant. They get very busy on the weekends, so if you're up to take your wife or hot date on a Friday night, reservations are a must. Bon appetite!!"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of \"nice\" dining. I only came here cause my GF \"forced\" me to. 

As a foodie, I would say the food is pretty good. We ordered Foie Gras and a braised cabbage dish with an assortment of meats. I've never had Foie Gras before. It's nice but not something I would go crazy for. The cabbage dish I didn't find as special, but it was delicious none the less. The various pieces of different kinds of pork were so flavorful and tender.

I've always associated French restaurants with \"pretentious\" and \"overpriced\". This restaurant kind of confirms my expectations but it's not \"that\" bad. Lunch for 2 came out to be $80. A soup, and entree for each adds up fast, especially if you add a glass of wine, which they charge an arm and a leg for. 

My verdict is...this place serves up some good French food. I just fundamentally don't go crazy about French food. I'm a guy and I guess I can echo what a lot of guys feel about this kind of restaurant: Go to this kind of place to make your woman happy. I'd much rather fill my stomach with a nice plate of pasta or some stir fried noodles that won't break my wallet. I still give this place a solid 4 stars because it's a great place that serves decent food. I like spices and flavors and French food might be a bit too \"delicate\" for me to appreciate. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Big fan of Bistro~ 
I was  in my vegetarian days when i went to Le Select, so that I might not be the best person to comment on the food. 

I order the cheese as appetizer, and they have great collections. Main dish I order the mushroom, one of the best mushroom dish I ever had. 

But on the other hand, my friend claims that the dinning experience wasn't very pleasant. Such like the ham appetizer was to the too salty side (whatever it means) and the steak is very dry. So that I was really hesitate to give out the 4 star.

However, I love the dinning environment  and even the menu design ~ 

Just put it on the list of places you would like to try. Will be a shame if you just deny it right away."}
{"text":"Le Select is absolutely lovely. Always a good time, service is attentive but not overbearing. The brunch French toast is fabulous, with whipped cream melting upon a soft and warm brioche French toast and soaked in maple syrup. Why not 5 stars? When it gets busy food is slow to come out, the coffee is \"meh\" and comes out of a Tim Hortons type carafe and the house salad, albeit fresh and delicious is soaking in dressing. The croque madame is very good but not outstanding ... could have used a bit more \"croque\". The decor is very warm and inviting. All in all we'll always go back :) especially when warmer weather hits and the doors to the patio stay open."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner tonight with 2 friends. Located in a rather remote part of downtown but not hard to find. The restaurant was surprisingly crowded for a Tuesday night but then again it is the holiday season. I ordered the Bouillabaisse and split the Baba Rhum cake with a friend. 

To start the bread was amazing. Prolly one of the best restaurant breads in Toronto. I think it's a sin to serve cold bread so I was delighted to find that Le Select served up warm bread. Crisp on the outside and airy and soft on the inside. My fellow diners ordered the Prix Fixe Menu (starter salad, duck confit and chocolate mousse). And also a smoked (can't recall which fish) mousse. It was savory and was served with naan bread. He had the Beef Bourgignon which looked good.

My Bouillabaisse was amazing. They bring the rouille separately and pour it for you once the dish arrives at the table. The fish was pan fried and had a great crunch to it. The scallops were a bit overdone. The baba Rhum cake was nice and light. They pour the Rhum on at your table... We should've told her to stop pouring way before as the Rhum was just too strong for my palate. Will definitely come back and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Well prepared traditional French Bistro fare. Escargots, foie gras terrine, bone marrow and paté appetizers are really well done. The cocks' combs are an acquired taste, which apparently I haven't acquired as of yet. As for entrées,  the choucroute is fantastic, the beef cheeks are all right (a bit on the salty side for me) and the duck confit is proper. Always a good dining experience with good service."}
{"text":"Went during dinner time for my friends birthday. Walked in and was greeted very kindly and welcoming. My girlfriend and I were the first one there, so we waited for the rest of the party to come. We were served the moment we sat down. \"Let me get you a glass of water to start\" - service was fantastic!

The food was..  A++ IMHO. I had the braised beef (Saturday special).. It was the biggest and juiciest piece of meat EVER.. My friends had the other dishes (rabbit, deer, chicken) they were all very tasty and delicious. As for dessert, everyone at the table got a free dessert of choice (friends bday, maybe?)

I highly recommend this restaurant to all.

PS: got 2 plates of free fries too.. Lol"}
{"text":"Very nice and authentic French cuisine with reasonable price and great service. Loved it :)"}
{"text":"I've been here yeeaaarrs ago for brunch - which was delish. However, finally decided to check this cute spot out for some dinner and wine. 

Started out with a bottle of Pinot Noir (Hidden Bench). I've had it before - nothing spectacular but will do the trick. Ordered the tartare to start which was really tasty. I had the duck confit as my entree (because if there's a duck option, I alllwayyss get it) and loved it. The duck was cooked perfectly and fell off the bone and the potatoes that accompanied it were really nice. Unfortunately after it all there was no room for dessert (sad face). 

This spot just remains consistently good and oh-so-adorable."}
{"text":"What a complete disaster. This is one of my usual haunts and they have completely lost my business. Steak was undercooked -- twice--  and despite the fact I left half a cow on my plate and they knew I was happy (apologies from the waiter, no sign of the manager) they still put it on bill. I'm so disappointed because I go here so often and rely on it as my go to place. I guess I need to find some place new. Such a shame."}
{"text":"This bistro feels like home (France). The food is quite authentic for Toronto and the service is exceptional. The only downside is the price. An average glass of wine is about $15 but I guess that's the norm for Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs and sausage. The scrambled eggs were one of the most delicious I've ever had. They were fluffy and moist.  The sausages were ok . The potatoes were underwhelming .

They make excellent lattes and the bread was tastey. 

One of our group asked for glutton free options and they did not have any."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with my boyfriend. We got the eggs Benedict and the salmon croissant with cream cheese and cucumbers. So fresh and so tasty. Eggs cooked perfectly and the croissants were light and flaky. Salmon was fresh tasting and didn't smell fishy. Cream cheese was smooth and the cucumbers added a wonderful crunch.

We sat out on the patio and it's great because the it's on a side street that isn't too busy so it's quiet enough. But just an FYI, there's a little bit of construction going on next door and a few patrons including ourselves noticed it got pretty dusty at times.

Other than that, food was great and so was the complimentary bread."}
{"text":"Maybe the best dinner we ever had?? Lol. Came here for a nice date. If you enjoy French food, this is probably the best in the city.

Escargots in puff pastry: 11 out of 10. It's that good. The pastry, the sauce, just everything is out of this world. 

French onion soup: 9 out of 10. Wonderful taste, made to perfection. Best I've ever had and I've had a lot. 

Bone marrow: It was fine. I won't rate it because I'm not qualified to rate a delicacy such as this and it was my first time trying it.

Duck confit: 8.5 out of 10 - delicious, fatty, crispy.

8oz peppercorn filet: 8 out of 10 - I'm not a fan of \"saucy\" steaks but the cut and preparation was phenomenal. 

Gateau chocolat (chocolate cake): 11 out of 10. The best cake either of us have ever had in our lives. Tastes more like a moist brownie or pudding. Incredible. 

Service was good (not extraordinary).

I have a feeling you can do no wrong at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, I\"m surprised I haven't written a review about this yet, but let me preface it by saying that I haven't been since last summer, but it has always been a favourite since I discovered it at least 5 years ago. 

It's a real bistro atmosphere, even their menu reflects that. 

I've had the chacuterie plate, and it was very good. As well as the fall off the bone pig knuckle. 

Sorry this review isn't as detailed as usual, but I just want to tell everyone that I love this place, stop looking and come have a try."}
{"text":"SO good. I remembered it fondly from way back when they were on Queen St. Foie Gras, Boudin Noir, Steak Frites, Onion soup, creme brulee. A few glasses of Bordeaux and another of port. Outstanding...all of them. Despite the button down atmosphere, they were super sweet to the kids, gave us a great table with no Reservation,"}

{"text":"Entrees were good.  Price was reasonable.  But if you don't drink alcohol the price for the juices were high.  Took a long time for the table to get our entrees... Mine came about 15 min after everyone else's which surprised me since the place wasn't full for lunch that day. Also got a drink order wrong.

I would have given 4 stars for taste alone but value for food and service dragged it down."}
{"text":"Always a happening place. I've frequented a lot over the years and I am always happy with the ambiance. It is a little piece of Paris bistro! 

I find that the food is generally good. It's really rich but then again, I can easily just fill up on that amazing bread they serve.

Not too crazy about their daily specials but who cares when you have a croque monsieur that's smothered in cheese?"}

The kitchen is an open area just down stairs and it is nice to see the crew there in action!"}
{"text":"Stop 7 of AlzCon 2k16. 
You know, apparently, in order to become a Yelp Elite, you need to have unbiased opinions. Which is asinine and stupid and completely ignorant, because opinions are inherently biased. Piss off, Yelp. 
My biased opinion is that the color scheme for this restaurant is gorgeous. Mahogany, brown, yellow, cream, and, of course, eggshell white. Honestly, it's perfect.
It took a bit of time to find the entrance. We ended up walking all the way up the alley, all the way back down, and finally found the door next to the outdoor seating. God, what geniuses. 
Ordered French Onion Soup (my favorite food, along with Hot Pot and Gogigui) and Croque Madame. (You know, French Onion Soup would be a lot better with Feta cheese instead of Swiss. But I guess I'm too biased. It was good.) The Croque Madame was cooked perfectly, with a runny sunny side up on top and cheese baked all around the bread instead of in between. Brilliant. Fries were cool too. I like how small they cut them. It's nice. 
Geez, I love French food. It's almost worth giving this place an extra star just for that. (Suck on that, Yelp.)

leaders and had a Kir before ordering some white wine.  The Pate de Campagne
 is more filling than one would expect and made just right. 
My main was the Cassoulet.  The pork belly 
was cooked perfectly with the fat melting in my mouth and not too salty.
The duck skin was as crispy as Peking duck and the sausage was a nice compliment to
the already meaty dish.

Rushed service. Server removes plate before meal is completed. Dijon mustard arrives in large canning container with spoon that presumably other patrons have dipped into. Bill arrives too early and not upon request. 
 A server named Marco is the gold standard and owners and other employees would be advised to try to emulate his level of service."}
{"text":"We had earlier in the twilight flown into Toronto ...Sunday night...dinner ...onto Yelp and this joint came up as open and looking to be a good option. So we rang and we booked..

We arrived and took our seats .... placed our wine and food order, and we had good time to reflect on the day and the worth coming week. Sitting here there relaxing feel.

We stated with a goats cheese salad and for mains we had the Berkshire rib and the Striped Bass ... along with a bottle of La Croix Chaptal red....we had an average experience. Probably the most limiting feature was the mains were sauced over so neither the fish or the rib got a chance to be enjoyed for what they were...nor was it quite how we expected them to be served.

We would come at a pinch...however we would need to be more directive of server service....an ok meal..."}
{"text":"nice upscale atmospheric restaurant.  it has its own euro feel.  elegant, casually loud.  food wise we ordered french onion soup.and a salad and steak.

the onion soup was extremely hearty probably the most heart ive ever had.  the cheese was thick.  to be honest not my fav.  

otherwise the service and restaurant itself was decent .  small portions which is to be expected with authentic french cuisine."}
{"text":"I went to La Select Bistro for Valentine's Day and had a great experience. It was a set 3 course menu for $59 per person which isn't too bad. 

Appetizer:
I got Salade De Homard (lobster salad with apple cider vanilla vinaigrette) and it was delicious, my date Consommé De Canard (duck consommé) and to be honest it smelt and tasted like pho. We both are Vietnamese so we got a good giggle out of his appetizer. 

Entree:
My date got Tendron De Boeuf A L'Orge (beef short rib) and he really seems to enjoy his meal, he wanted to get an extra order of the fries too. I opted for Gigot D'Agneau De L'Alberta (leg of lamb) and I wish I got a second plate of it, the lamb was so tender and delicious!

Dessert:
For dessert I quickly chose the lemon tart because I love citrus desserts but my date was unsure of what to get and asked our waiter to surprise him with something. He ended up with the Frangipane Au Boudin Aux Pommes, he enjoyed the first few bites but the fact that there was pork in his dessert quickly came to light and he ended up only finishing half of his dessert but ate the entire apple crust instead. 

Overall the experience and atmosphere was lovely for a Valentine's date. Would return again for another romantic occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon for Sunday brunch with two girlfriends.

Love the atmosphere and decor; it reminds me of a cafe in France.

Pricing is reasonable and the menu is extensive. Service was fab. Heaps of street parking in front of Select Bistro.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"great bistro ambience.. not too casual not too stiff... just perfect for a easy evening with someone you want to eat fois gras with.. 
service was great, everything we ordered was just perfect...
from salad, fish to steak...  love this place would def come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Reminded me of being in Paris.   Everything was fresh and very tasty.   The BEST eggs Benedict.   Braised Beef sandwich was also terrific.   Great food at great prices."}
{"text":"Had brunch here with friends this past Sunday. The food was pretty good but definitely heavy. About 70% through what felt like a 5 egg goat cheese omelette I hit a wall. I plowed through it afterwords of course, but I still hit it regardless. They're definitely pouring heavy cream into these bad boys for sure.

Heart stopping brunch for 2 (including a 5oz glass of freshly squeezed OJ) will come out to just under $50. It's pricey for breakfast, but if you aren't doing it all the time what the hell. Giv'er.

Hash browns good. 
Complimentary pre-entry mini baguette good.

Also, Anne Hathaway served our food.

{"text":"My family and I decided to come here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.
The service was very good and our server was very attentive to us the entire time.
I came with a large group so we ordered multiple things off the menu. After placing our order, we were given warm, fresh bread with butter. It was so good we all asked for more!
As for the main meal, I ordered the mushroom risotto which was absolutely amazing. There was a variety of mushrooms in the dish which I really loved. However, I was unable to finish my meal because it was very heavy.
The one thing I did particularly enjoy, was the lunch prix fixe menu. You have a choice of an appetizer, meal, and dessert for a good price.
All in all, it is a very cute French bistro which offers a variety of traditional french dishes. However, if I were to return, it would be for brunch instead of lunch."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for a friend's birthday dinner. This French bistro is a nice little place,  very cozy atmosphere. But I have to say I was a little bit disappointed with the food.  The menu was a pricey and the food was salty. I ordered the lamb burger. The seasoning was good but just too salty."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch a couple weeks ago. I enjoyed the food (goat cheese tart) but the service was a bit off- they took a long time to bring us milk for our tea, to the point where we asked multiple times. This bothered me as when we asked the 3rd time we mentioned that we all (4 of us) would like milk for our drinks and the waitress replied we would only need one creamer. Was very odd. I think the \"A-OK\" designation fits perfectly."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared a plate of two duck legs (about $28), as well as several appetizers. The pig ears plate was interesting and tasty; crispy, like bacon. We also enjoyed the goat cheese and beet salad, which had a good portion of cheese."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  

Steak frits and mushroom risotto all day long.  

A wine list that I still think is unmatched in the city.  


All you need to know is above!"}
{"text":"French onion soup beyond delicious ... Charcuterie more than mouthwatering ... I will be back"}
{"text":"I only came here for breakfast, so my review doesn't speak for lunch or dinner.  Walked in right after they opened.  Got an omelet with goat cheese, a side of green beans, and au gratin potatoes.

The service was fast and friendly, and the food was buttery, rich, and french!  So much richness to the plate that I had to stop eating it about three quarters of the way through.  I really liked this place though.  I had to stop eating, not because it was bad, but because it was too good and had overwhelmed my senses (and my butter quota).

I wanted to come back here again, but was never able to get a reservation to seat a larger party.  It's a shame too! Call ahead!!! 

The feel was unpretentious. We were the least dressed up of anyone in the place (we looked like slobs, really), but no one cared.  We were treated like french gods.  Oh god the food was good!"}
{"text":"The ambience is nice and we always get great service but breakfasts are disappointing and not tasty at all. I've tried the crossaint with salmon and cheese and it was not good at all and my friend was not happy with her breakfast either. I realized the chefs are all french but this is not close to the quality of breakfast we get in QC let alone France!"}
{"text":"i have been meaning to come here for so long! I really wanted a nice french place that brings me back to Paris.. I think i just found it!

We came here for Valentine's day/birthday dinner. we ordered double duck confit legs and the beef tartare - the quality and portions are superb! it's definitely a nice date environment, dim lit and romantic. There are so many things on the menu I wanted to try but didn't end up having the stomach space for it - will definitely return another time!

Yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. It sits just outside of Spadina and is tucked behind the Globe and Mail building. There is free parking behind the restaurant which is a huge plus for me. The patio in the front is very nice. It has a large awning that covers the entire space. Inside the restaurant, there is mostly booth seating. They can definitely accommodate large groups. My girlfriend and I were seated at a corner booth. 

I have heard that the steak frites were good, so we both ordered it with the prix fixe menu (soup, creme brulee). We were given bread and butter to start. The bread was fresh and satisfying. The soup we had that day was rock fish and clam. It was ok. It was a bit too fishy tasting for my liking but what do you expect from a seafood based soup. Once we finished our soup, our steaks came shortly after. I ordered my steak rare and got exactly what I wanted. When I cut through it, I knew it was going to be good. The steak was nice and tender. There are not many places where you can get a steak like that for under $40. The frites that came with it were good. Nothing special though. They were thin cut and tossed in some parsley. The creme brulee is really good. This is coming from someone that does not enjoy desserts. Most of my desserts are usually given to my girlfriend but that day I was not sharing it with her. The caramel was not too sweet and the custard was light. It was also topped with a strawberry and blueberry. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will be coming back to try the tartare, duck confit, lamb and to eat a whole jar of cornichons all to myself."}
{"text":"Foie gras pairing w jam and toast, and duck entree were amazing! Dim lighting and cute booths makes this a cozy date for two ;)"}
{"text":"First time here, I like the ambience - not too noisy and it's a very romantic setting. The food was fabulous.. Servers were nice but would disappear for a long time. She asked if we wanted any condiments when our food came and our glass was refilled all the time =) She came back to ask how the food was and always smiled. 
I had the Pave de Bouef, the beef was excellent and very juicy. Sauce was rich, creamy and peppery (yum!) My fries were cold but I just picked at it.

I would recommend this place if you have a craving for some authentic Parisian food, a fancy gathering with friends or a business dinner/lunch. 
Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Le Select is, quite simply, Toronto's best French Bistro. Excellent menu with great daily specials (Thursday is sweetbreads- my favourite). This restaurant is a Toronto tradition.

Beautiful room, downtown location & excellent service add to the terrific food.

The only reason I don't eat here once a week or more is that I live too far away!

I hope Le Select never changes. A true treasure."}
{"text":"Thank god for Yelp reviews because left to our own devices, we would not have discovered this gem! It's completely tucked away but luckily, only a 5 minute walk from our hotel (The Renaissance Downtown). The servers are so professional and nice, and I left with a wonderful feeling of discovering the cutest little brunch spot. 

It was here that I discovered Rahier's famous baked croissants. It was here that I fell in love with French Toast+Canadian maple syrup. And their lemon tart was fantastic and perfectly glazed on the top. 

If I ever find myself in Toronto again, this would definitely be my first stop!"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious. I particularly enjoyed the boudin noire au sarrasin and the salade friseé lardons. The boudin noir paired perfectly with the roasted apple and red wine, Port and mustard sauce. Service was friendly. A must come for those who love French cuisine."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I love that it's close to a busy part of downtown, but a few blocks from areas with tons of restaurants, so it felt like a secret find.  i was blown away by the ambiance, I've never felt so much like I was in France while being so far from France.  I guess the owners are from France and had a lot of the decor imported, including the long bar, all one piece, made of zinc and nickel.  And I believe the tin ceiling as well.  Service was friendly and food was great.  I got an omelette with goat cheese and mushrooms, and a kir royal for brunch. Very romantic vibe.  There is a nice patio in front."}
{"text":"It was a very nice meal. We were well catered too. The food was well prepared and the service was very attentive. All of us were very happy with the meal. 
Fast service."}
{"text":"What a great find in the city! Friendly service and kick-ass French food. Best part? A kids menu which creative choices like duck leg and lamb chops.  Kids loved it.  French onion soup is so rich.  And cassoulet is fresh and original.  Cannot find a fault here.  And prices are quite reasonable for food too.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Been here only twice but food and service were consistently good, and my visits were a year apart. The first time I came was for Mother's Day. Tried their Risotto de millet à la Betterave (which at the time had beets) and it was quite unique and delicious. My partner got the Pain dorée aux pommes, which was a very generous portion. On my second visit, I was surprised the waitress didn't recommend the risotto but highly recommended the steak tartare to my friends. She was friendly and had the right level of attentiveness and didn't leave us feeling intruded upon (as wait staff in some other establishments tend to do).

I would have to say this place is a hidden gem. I don't recall seeing any hype about it on blogto or Toronto Life, and I had never heard about it when my partner first brought me here, but this place just blows me away. The food, the service, the decor. Everything is genuine and unpretentious. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a monday.

I began with the goat cheese and beet salad.  No complaints, good but not exceptional.  There was a citrus note that I could not precisely identify which was an amusing twist.

The soup of the day was potato and bacon.  I'm not really a soup person, but I decided to be \"adventurous\" and give it a try.  I found it quite boring, and with a sourness that I found unpleasant.

The \"neanderthalesque\" bone marrow was rich and satisfying, served with small crisp toasts.

The lamb neck, which I had as my main, was tender and moist, with a bit of springyness to it.  It was unfortunately a little too salty.

My dessert, the B52 creme brulee was quite successful.  It had a nice texture, and I could clearly taste the orange and cream, though perhaps not the coffee.

Service was polite, attentive, and prompt."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 for me. I'm in and out of the Niagara Falls area several times a year to see fam but this was my very first stay exclusively in Toronto. Wanted to try some of the local eats and this was one of the places I was repeatedly told I had to try. 

Promptly seated the minute we arrived and announced ourselves to the host. The decor is minimal and lighting low but not too low. My MO for any restaurant I've never been to previously is to order everything from their apps selection because it's usual the section of a menu where the chef can get pretty creative. 

Interestingly though nothing stood out as spectacular. Everything was just OK to good. Our server said their white fish terrine is a huge hit but can't understand how or why. The usual french classics of escargot and the foie gras were both delicious and the portions were very generous. The \"ravioli\" made of thinly sliced pickled celerac and layered with fresh crabmeat was amazing too.

Ordered the special entree of the day, braised short ribs and again very classically prepared and just melt in your mouth amazing. The duck confit was both crispy on the outside and aptly soft and juicy on the inside. Ordered the creme brulee to cap off the night and it was a right choice.

Not quite sure I'll be back any time soon in the near future however when I do return I'll be back for just the popular and familiar classic french dishes."}
{"text":"Really really like it !! The oysters are soon good! And the open face something ... Don't remember but open face something, so good, also the gnocchi is great."}
{"text":"Looking for a patio to chill on w/ that snazzy French vibe on quiet Wellington? Grabbing a bev or two with some girlfriends? Le Select. If you're a tad bit hungry, this bistro has decent food but on the pricier side of things.

AMBIANCE
+ Tucked away on quiet Wellington, Le Select looks rather modest from afar but as you edge closer, you're greeted by a wonderfully open patio space with happy people chatting away over scrumptious-looking dishes. Step through the doors and you're welcomed by a beautifully quaint interior. Lovely!
+ Feel free to dress up or down - totally up to you

SERVICE
Note: Bustling place! Definitely a regular spot for many. 
+ Servers are sufficiently attentive with water/coffee refills. 
+ Despite the busyness, the hostess was very accommodating to the change of our party size (3 to 4). Though waters were already set down, they changed us to a cozy corner without a fuss. 
+/- I forgot to switch out the fries for salad and although I was lightly chastised (lol), the server allotted my desired salad 

FOOD [Brunch review! $27 incl tax and tip  steak tartare + croissant]
+ Complimentary starter: DELICIOUS butter, delightfully creamy in a subtle manner. Pairs nicely with the bread.
+/- Beef Tartare: I enjoyed this with the pepper on the table. This is supposedly best in the city (thanks, Yelpers!) but was not to my fancy. I do confess that I'm not much of a beef tartare person to begin with though. 
+/- Braised Brisket Brioche Sandwich: I sampled this and it was VERY flavourful. If you're a hungry, savoury bruncher - this might be it. Brisket literally melted in my mouth.. UNF. This is accompanied by vegetable chips (similar to the black bags you get at Porter)- yum! Personally, I wouldn't have been able to eat the entire sandwich though, a bit too overpowering for my palate.
- Pass on the Rahier croissant - it isn't anything special but if you must, ask for jam (no extra cost)! The jam was good!! 

Overall: I'd be down to come back here to try their sweet brunch foods. 

COFFEE
+ Refills ftw"}
{"text":"Bustling café with a lovely selection of brunch options. Pain Doré aux Pommes is recommended."}
{"text":"Came for a wedding and the venue couldn't have been more perfect for party of less than 60 people. The service was excellent! Every single guest was well attended to. We were seated at the back of the restaurant and it was cozy and elegant! The food was perfect. Our menu had more than enough choices and truly I wished I could have tried them all. I tried the foie gras and the onion soup appetizer and both were rich and delicious and generous in servings. I had the seared steak done medium rare with caramelized onions and loved it. I had creme brûlée for dessert and again it was rich and oh so good. Thank goodness at parties we don't count calories. I would highly recommend for a wedding party. Just plan on parking ahead because parking is limited."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch and Dinner
Specialty: Authentic French cuisine
Menu items: Confit de Canard, Beef Cheeks, Bone Marrow and Mussels with smoked bacon

Le Select brings me back to my days in La France. It is an intimate, unique and perfectly decorated French bistro located in the heart of downtown Toronto; yet it gives you a feeling of space, elegance and tradition.
From their fantastic wine cellar located in the basement, to the outdoor garden in the back that let's enjoy summer in a unique French way, this place holds a dear place both in my heart and appetite.

From duck, to beef cheeks and even bone marrow; Le Select's menu is unique, versatile, creative and oh so tasty. I never really do get enough of Chef Albert Ponzo's creations; his cooking style not only roots from tradition, but also from the heart.

A traditional Confit de Canard at Le Select presents you with a savory duck leg and a very crispy skin. The skin is the key to a great tasting duck dish, especially if doing it the classical way. It's a rather difficult task because the chef needs to make sure the duck meat is not overcooked while the skin, well, almost is. And all this without getting a burnt taste or marks.

Going from complex to intriguing, Le Select's fantastic Beef Checks will definitely take you down the road of \"different\". On the menu, this dish is called \"Joue de Boeuf Bourguignonne\". My eyes were quickly drawn to it as this was the first time I was ever trying beef cheeks...I mean is that even a part of the cow one eats?  
Well ladies and gentleman, its not only a part we eat, its a part we should always eat! The cheeks are braised with red wine and cooked with mushrooms and lardons (aka bacon). The meat is juicy and quite honestly just feels like butter in your mouth. What a delicacy.

And with the topic of unique and different in mind, on the same night, I ventured deeper into it by also ordering, and quite honestly potentially clogging an artery in the process, the famous Bone Marrow.
\"Le Os de Cro-Magong\", meaning bone marrow, is Le Select's featured appie item and one of the best executed items of the menu. The server not only makes sure you know exactly how this is eaten, but also Chef Ponzo ensures you indulge in it with the right accompaniments. For example, you just don't get salt, you get a special sea salt...and what you see its not just toasted bread, its toasted slices of baguette. So working your way through this dish is not only fun, but also experimental, tasteful and delightful.

And what will a French bistro be without Mussels? These are Atlantic mussels steamed with a strong Quebec Ale beer with smoked bacon. In my mind, the creativity within this dish is the beer itself. It gives the dish that Je ne sais quoi that has you digging for your bread to get that one last bit of juice left on the plate.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"I feel like the food should be so much better tasting.   This was my fourth time here and each time I was not satisfied with the way my steak was cooked and also with the  taste.  They have other dishes that are good though, hence the 3 star."}
{"text":"I went to Le Sélect Bistro for a birthday dinner, I made reservations, got prime seating by the fireplace as per reservation request, check. Everything going according to plan, check. I ordered the prix fixe menu and my boyfriend ordered the steak frites, pretty simple right? Not exactly.

First our server was non-existent once we ordered. She seemed to be chatting it up to some big shots who ordered the whole wine menu next to us. No problem, get those tips sweety, just make sure my appetizer comes before my main course! Oops fail #1. 

Second I had to remind our server that I was there for a birthday and  I was curious if a dessert would accompany our dinner. She said of course, then asked what type of dessert the birthday boy would like.  I'm still wondering what type of dessert would have appeared in front of my companion if I'd never gotten up to ask her in the first place! Fail #2. Btw when she brought out my boyfriend's dessert, I also had to remind her that I also had a dessert as well!!!! You know because that comes as part of the prix fixe! Again she seemed surprised and went to put in the order. Fail #3

The only thing saving Le Select Bistro is the atmosphere which did remind me of cafes in Paris, but the service was no where close to Parisian service! 

On to the actual food :

1a). House Salad: was okay nothing special here b) the complimentary bread was delicious but only one per customer! 
2. Escargot Puff Pastry thing: again nothing special, which was disappointing 
3.  Steak Frites: now I'm no steak connoisseur but the steak was very tender and pretty good. Frites were nothing special tasted very similar to Holy Chuck fries actually. My boyfriend however wasn't as impressed with his steak said he preferred Canyon Creek! 
4. Creme Brulee: this was probably the best out of everything, very delicious! 
5. Birthday Chocolate cake with some type of Mango sorbet: Chocolate cake was alright; the standout here was the Mango sorbet, very good!

All in all the dinner was just okay. I'd still give this place a shot for brunch and see if it can redeem itself. However, they really need to do something with their staff because for the price you pay you get below average service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots. 

Love the duck confit. Croque Madame. 

Croissants are amazingly soft and flaky. 

Good coffee. 

Family friendly."}
{"text":"The kefir pancake is more like a cake, fill my belly up really quick. Overall, great atmosphere. I wish I can order something savoury next time."}
{"text":"YES. Thank you. GOOD French food in TO.

Didier was such a disappointment, so I approached Le Select with caution. I wasn't expecting much. I was cynical, but it was a business lunch, and someone else had requested this place, so I went with it.

I had the omelette au fromage. It came with green beans and potatoes. It was fantastic. THANK GOODNESS. I had essentially the same thing when I ate at Didier (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/didier-restaurant-and-catering-toronto).

It is definitely on the snooty side, but they are waaaay more relaxed here than at a lot of the other upscale French places in T.O.

Our party of four was extremely pleased.

It was a bit hard to find because of construction, but I understand that as of this summer (2011), all will be back to normal.

Thanks, Le Select!"}
{"text":"The most delicious beef on the planet. I am actually salivating writing this.

I had the french onion soup and the boeuf bourguignon...eating the pieces of beef was like eating beef flavoured butter...it was so soft. I would go back there in a heartbeat. The service was great as well.

Very few restaurants this delish and with that true bistro style in Toronto."}
{"text":"I am so surprised that just a few people complained about their poor service. Last Sunday, my friend and I went there for brunch. I was so excited when I entered the restaurant since the environment and decorations are just so nice. I was led to a table and then I waited for my friend to come. 

There are two ladies, just got their seats beside our table, were well treated by a waitress. But she just ignored me when I was sitting there. When my friend came, the waitress simply gave us tap water without even asking what we want to drink. It's so ridiculous that she was being so nice to the two ladies beside us, and completely ignored us for the whole time. We had to ask another waitress to order, and that waitress said there will be bacon in my friend's dish. So my friend ordered. But then her dish came and it was with ham. So we spoke with the rude waitress about it, and she simply says \"there is no bacon in our house\". I questioned, and explained that what the other waitress said. And she replied, \" I don't know what she said, but I've told you that there is no bacon in our place!\" I can tell that she is so mad and impolite. She was literally yelling at me when she said that. I was really pissed off. During our time there, no one ever came and ask how we felt about the dishes. I have to say, I will never ever come back to this place again. Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"There are three main reasons to go to Le Select: 
1) They take brunch reservations. This makes Le Select a rare unicorn in downtown Toronto.
2) Their patio is (small) dog friendly. They brought water out for my little pooch and took care to sweep up black pepper which had fallen earlier on the ground, out of concerns that my dog would sneeze. SO CUTE!
3) The woman who takes your name at the front (she might be the manager/owner/maitre-d) is stunning, and her outfits are straight off a Paris runway which just adds to the Parisian feel of this restaurant. 

I suppose there are other reasons too. My ratatouille with poached eggs was delicious, the free freshly baked bread was warm and soft, they have bottomless coffee, and - dare i say it - french fries that are better than anywhere else in the city. I'm serious. They're even better than the Chase skinny fries, McDonald's fries (which are really the gold standard of fries) and Swiss Chalet fries. Bold statement, I know - try them and let me know if you disagree!"}
{"text":"Jennifer K brought us here after our awesome Elite event this month. It's great to know that you can get a decent meal in this area (no pizza, subs, or fries) late at night while avoiding King West. 

The restaurant itself is super cute and authentic, while avoiding kitsch, and the service is solid considering the time of night. Cute hipster waiter aside.

The prix fixe menu is good (2 of the 3 courses for $20), though I generally prefer a little more option beside the 1 vegetarian meal. I get French cuisine doesn't really do vegetarian but I've been spoiled by the options in Toronto -so why settle?

I had the risotto (squash, parmesan and white wine) with chocolate mousse. Granted, I could have gone with salad but I'm a sucker for the carbs. The texture of the risotto was great, but my dish was somewhat oversalted. The delicious chocolate mousse was light and fluffly.

I'll definitely try Le Select again, this time I'll be back for an earlier meal. 

Maybe lunch?"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with three other dinner guests - two of whom were not foodies (one of whom was a vegetarian).  The non-foodies didn't get anything out of the place and the vegetarian was extremely disappointed.  The foodies thought the place to be good if you were in the mood for an authentic French bistro, but if you weren't, then you probably will not be wow'ed.  Convenient location for hanging out on King West afterwards but I actually preferred the cheaper places in France when I was studying there than this place.  Ah well, c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"So my work had the Christmas party here,  we booked the private room which was segregated from the rest of the restaurant...in the back with closed curtains.... 

Upon arrival, we we're greeted promptly and walked to our area...i like the \"mini garden\" as it was nice and comfy...just when there are way too many people, the area gets a bit humid...

As a group, we got to choose from the $55 menu. I ordered the French Onion Soup, which was pretty good, wasn't overly salty which is an epic fail for alot of places when they put a bottle of salt in it. My coworker ordered the tuna tartar. They were equally good as I tried a bit of hers..

For the main course, I ordered the steak...I wanted rare but was given medium rare, the steak was still delicious tho...quality and tenderness of the meat...no complains...

For the dessert, I got the espresso parfait but the coffee wasn't strong enough in it...more milky than caffine in it...

I've heard other things from my respective coworkers, i.e. salmon was tad bit overcooked, risotto was overly salty and etcc...

I think I just got lucky..with the items I chose...solid 3 stars but not yet hitting a 4**"}
{"text":"the food was fucking ass. The steak tartare and frites were an absolute joke. The steak was terribly cooked but the fries were decent initially but they were very salty at the bottom (obviously if they sprinkled salt onto the fries after putting them on the plate). The french onion soup was TERRIBLY CHEESY. There was too much cheese and too little bread. Had more bread been in the soup, it would have soaked more of the soup and less cheese would have been much appreciated. All in all, I'm never returning again."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for brunch. We ordered the croque monsieur, foie gras with berries (my order), confit de canard and the salmon. The foie gras was melt-in-your-mouth delicious but the portion was tiny. The other dishes were pretty nice and portions were larger. 

For desert, we got the creme brulee, the paris-brest and the fluffy-egg-white-custard thingy (I forget). I enjoyed the both the creme brulee and the paris-brest but the third desert, I didn't really like too much. 

The ambiance was really nice, especially the patio (even though we sat inside). I would probably come here again."}
{"text":"Superb service from the sommelier and our charismatic server Kathleen.  She was such a sweety that when my phone died, she took a pic of our lovely dessert and emailed it to me and went to charge my phone.  I guess you get what you pay for and I could get used to this type of treatment!  Parsnip soup of the day was flavourful light and fresh,  not too salty,  and paired deliciously with the recommended \"Kir Royal\" champagne cocktail. They brought me and my date complimentary fresh bread which made the soup all that much better. 

Then,  I decided to have the foie gras since I had loved it so much at the St. James hotel in Montreal but la select's version was much more a pate and I didn't enjoy it as much but it was well plated with a side of a blueberry type jam and crackers. This alone would not have satisfied me so it's a good thing I had the soup and bread. The sommelier recommended the \"Gewürztraminer\" for the foie gras and it was perfect for my sweet tooth.  My date enjoyed his glass of Niagara Riesling with the Sunday special - short rib and risotto.  The meat was very tender and juicy with a nice jus on top but the risotto was not my favourite.... Bit too al dente for me. 

I had been anticipating dessert and it was well worth the wait (as you can see in the photo!).  I almost chose my safe go-to -  the creme brulee -  but Kathleen made it impossible scooters  resist the lemon tart pie. We added the three flavours of sorbet to soothe our stomachs and I warmed up with a grand marnier blueberry tea. 

Needless to say,  I was on cloud nine tonight at select!  Loved the atmosphere as well and the special Canadian maple bourbon shooters Kathleen created for us was a real treat.  Thank you for the wonderful service experience and I shall be back to try the beef bourgignonne or le lapin."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service great as well, though the food did take quite some time to come out (90 min from seating to main course, and not all of us had ordered starters). Seemed like maybe we just came in at the wrong time and/or ordered the wrong things as some tables near us were served much quicker. You can tell that the kitchen works hard and everyone was hustling, while very pleasant. All in all a great place!"}
{"text":"This is a 2-meal review:

First Experience: Dinner, group of 7, Saturday night at 6pm

Seated promptly and very excited to try the nicoise salad.... but they only served it at lunch :( Since it was a special night for me, we asked the kitchen if they could specially make it for us.. but no dice. Tempted to get the Nicoise tart instead, I was not really up for eating pastry. For a $35, a tempting 3-course prix meal was also offered... but didn't feel like red meat. So I ended up opting for the Salmon with Quinoa. 
Having a taste of the french onion soup, it was very flavourful, loaded with cheesy goodness and extremely satisfying for the tastebuds. The salad was dressed nicely as well, and complimentary warm bread and mini pickles were a nice add-on.
Then the main course comes... and I was very happy with the salmon, a little undercooked, just the way I like it. However, the quinoa was really undercooked, making it a little hard to chew, and the dish was just lukewarm, which was a major turnoff. I felt like my dish was finished cooking first and sitting underneath the heat lamp.
The desserts - creme brulee and chocolate mouse was very decadent and if I wasn't so full, I would have eaten my friends' entire dish. It was unfortunate that while the starters and desserts were very well presented, the main star of my meal was subpar.

Second Experience: Lunch, group of 7, Monday afternoon at 12:30pm

Not surprised that at lunch time on a Monday, this place was packed with business workers in the area - looked like mostly groups too. Service was very scattered as our waitress disappeared for long periods of times to give us drinks and take orders. 

Remember that Nicoise salad that was only available at lunch? Well it's not on the menu anymore so do not get excited. The tarte nicoise is still there is anyone's interested. There was a seared albacore tuna with julienne radiccio salad, with walnuts and hierloom tomatoes - so that's what I got. When it came out, it was not what I had expected, but it was nicely presented. The salad portion was presented as a circular mold, and the tuna was cut into 3 pieces (I had not recognized it, as I thought it was be seared into thin slices). The tuna was a little bland, but with the rest of the salad gave it a refreshing bite.

There are a lot of things I would like to try on this menu - however, both times I was not blown away by the overall dish, and believe me  - I love french.

Since this will be in my little hometown neighbourhood, I may stop in for a late night bite and a glass of wine.... we'll see."}
{"text":"Delicious French food, I went there twice, the first time I got the confit de canard and the second time I got the steak and fries. Five stars ! Makes you feel like you're in France !"}
{"text":"Came here on June29. 
Our female server was excellent. One of the best waitresses I have had.
Decor is excellent and the patios are even better. 
The food was great, with reasonable prices. The asparagus risotto was a little meh (Not enough butter?), but then again who orders an Italian dish at a French restaurant. Hah. Drinks were great as well.


I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4.5 if it wasn't for the horrible service we received.  Perhaps the server was just having a bad day,  but the management didn't care and promises  to make things right went unfulfilled."}
{"text":"Came to Le Sélect Bistro for a Christmas GNO dinner. We loved it!
Service was great and the food quality was good. For my friends that drove here, they complimented on the availability of parking space.

DRINKS:
MERLOT/CAB 

CONFIT DE CANARD (4/5)
(duck leg confit with crispy skin, served with veggies, potatoes au gratin)

Mm.. this was so yummy!! There's an option for one / two duck legs - I should've ordered two!! The duck leg size was not that big so if you're hungry I would suggest you order two duck legs. My friend and I grabbed snacks after dinner because we were still hungry.. but this duck confit was so delicious! I'd come back and order this again :)"}
{"text":"Ever since Julie & Julia, I have had a craving for French food.  Let me rephrase that, phenomenal French food.

I would say there are two reasons to go here: one) the book of wines and spirits. It literally is a novel. Whatever you want, you will find. b) the vegetables were perfectly cooked. They were crisp and flavourful veggies that complimented the sauces they were paired with.

The atmosphere is a lovely vision of a Parisian bistro. By no means is it authentic enough to actually replicate a genuine Parisian establishment. It felt too new and as one reviewer said like a ``Disney version.'  I felt it was a good effort.

My house salad was banal. Plain greens and balsamic vinegar.  My companion felt so sorry for me.  Next, steak frites.  I enjoyed this more as I continued to eat it.  It was just a slight bit more overcooked than I wanted but all in all not bad.  

It's difficult for any place to recreate an experience from Paris.  So far, The Smoking Dog Bistro, wins hands down in achieving this with their version of steak frites."}
{"text":"Miss my days in France, sat down for a food excursion in an attempt to relive la vie. The service was on point. Had wonderful and friendly service that visited us just enough times to ensure we were taken care of, but not obsessively intrusive. Always had a smile to share which made the visit very enjoyable. Ambiance was slightly on the middle to up scale decor, but experienced a surprisingly comfortable and non-pretentious environment. 

Now the food... As much as I wanted to love this place, I can't. Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, maybe it was a stroke of bad luck for food these days, but the food was not enjoyable whatsoever. 

The onion soup was too salty and the color was too dark. Couldn't really taste the onion but the few weak strands swimming around proved it was not the wrong order. The cheese that covered it stole the show, leaving little room to taste anything else. My daily special with scallops were... A piece of art. Hahhaa I'm not sure what to say only because the scallops were... Scallops. Fresh, but bland. The thin slivers of asparagus were my only enjoyment in the dish. The strawberries that were far from ripe (and I believed swam in vinegar overnight) was a scare. Lips pursed and brows knotted together, given how sour the strawberries, were a treat for my company to witness. That must have been the lasting effect because it was more for your company's laughter than it is for your personal enjoyment. 

Given how high the reviews were for this restaurant I want to give the benefit of the doubt and maybe I just got unlucky with my order. Unfortunately this round was not something that inspires me to revisit anytime soon. One thing that made the visit worth coming though! Amazing and wide selection of wine that you can pair to your hearts content. All I can say is hopefully next time will be better. If not, c'est la vie!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Family Day with a party of 3. 

Decadent, buttery dishes in a French-style cafe. Reminds me of a smaller, home-y version of La Societe. 

Highlight for me was their omelette: a creamy, buttery, and delicate french omelette with goat cheese! I love french omelettes, so this was perfect. I prefer my rosti a little thinner and crispier though, but just a personal preference. 

French toast and steak tartare were well executed, so can't ask for more than that. Millet risotto was creamy and buttery, but a little heavy for brunch. 

Latte was velvety, and champagne cocktails were fun and delicious!"}
{"text":"Fabulous physical facility, with an open room at the rear of the restaurant for larger groups, or more private booths and tables up front.  Front patio AND back terrace.  The Kitchen is in the lower level and patrons can watch the action like an episode from Iron Chef.  The wine cellar is one of the best in Canada, and also in plain view in the lower level.

Menu was extensive and authentic Parisian bistro fare.  The French Onion Soup was the best I have ever had; and a Black Cod over Alsatian Sauerkraut w/mussels was impressive.  Expertly prepared and presented.  

Only compliant was the server, while knowledgeable, was easily thrown off his game and getting the bill and the end of the evening was troublesome.  Yes, we were a large group, but it shouldn't take 30 minutes to sort out the bill..."}
{"text":"I had the Beef Brisket sandwich with an egg on top and vegetable chips, which I was very pleased with.  My friends ordered the Croque monsieurs with french fries.  Next time, I am going to get the Croque monsieur.

My friends and I sat on the patio for Saturday brunch and the patio was nicely spaced out and the service was very good."}
{"text":"The staff here is capable of consistently producing beautiful and delicious food - the best food I've had anywhere.

I have really fond memories of this beautiful little French bistro. When I first came to live in Toronto for school, I had about a week to spare before classes started. I am a novice cook who spent the entire previous summer cooking through Julia Child's book and I was eager to learn more with hands on experience with professionals. I emailed Chef Albert about this possibility and he agreed to let his friendly kitchen staff show me how they operate and teach me some basic techniques and teach me about their basic operations. After my days at the restaurant were over, he invited me to join him and a few of the kitchen staff to join him at an offsite event.

I come here only occasionally since I'm on a student budget and about half the time I'm given some nice sparkling wine (on the house!) to sip on while I'm waiting for food. This is probably at the request of the chef, so thanks chef!"}
{"text":"Great creme brulle with proper crisp top. service and interior takes you to France"}
{"text":"Top notch brunch offering! We sat out on the patio in glorious long weekend sunshine and had a great meal. Service is great and friendly, which defies French stereotypes perhaps, I think the eggs benny on a croissant is probably the greatest I've ever had, but there are so many menu options to go back for."}
{"text":"Cool French Restaurant. You've got the usual duck confit/steak frites, I decided to give their Chicken Supreme and Lamb burger a go.

The lamb burger was delicious. It was seasoned with similar spices you find in Tandoori Chicken. I very much recommend this.

Le Select's Chicken dish was disappointing. To dumb it down, it was a chicken parm without the parm. It was a chicken breast with a delicate tomato sauce but nothing really stood out about this dish. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing experience eating here with my family in from out of town. The best dining experience I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Onion soups were bitter. So the dishes after became no flavour. Bug in beer. Average."}
{"text":"I've been to Le Select a handful of times within the last five years or so, more recently yesterday for lunch and I have to say this place is very consistent with quality of food. Their menu is very standard French Bistro, and what they do here, they do well.

Duck Confit with Scalloped Potatoes - This was an amazing dish. The duck was fall of the bone tender and the skin was crisp to perfection. The potatoes were out of this world. The price on this was good too, they knocked this one out of the park.

Mussels with Pulled Pork - We got this to share, and it was pretty good too. The mussels were very fresh. A good dish to get to share.

The decor and ambience of this place is great, very traditional bistro like. The only thing is, the service in my opinion wasn't all that great. Not terrible, but not great. Nevertheless, the food is good enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Le Select is a fabulous bistro - almost like Pastis in NYC or L'express in Montreal with a great French bistro atmosphere and tasty food.  I had brunch at Le Select back in October.  We sat out on the patio, and it was a fantastic place to enjoy the last of the nice weather.  The service was really slow at first, but it seemed they just forgot about us and once we got that straightened out it was better.  

We all enjoyed our brunch food and drinks - especially the Caesar, but the food portions are small for the price.  Parking is good if you have a car.  I'd definitely recommend it,and plan to go back to try it for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Today I had Sunday brunch at Le Sélect, in 10 years since I was here last time. I love everything about this French restaurant: the vibe, the decor, the food, the music.... most importantly their attentive service make you feel like home. It's very local, very friendly, very traditional. I have never been to France, but my friends told me this is exactly what French local bistro looks like. 
Love they give you free refill to your coffee, this is a plus for me. This restaurant can be very busy on weekends so better book reservation online before you go. Unlike other trendy eateries in Downtown Toronto you have to book reservation weeks ahead, I'm glad I can still able to book reservation on the same day: doors open at 10:30 Sunday morning, I book it online before 9am. 
I didn't ask for preference for seating, but I was lucky to be seated at the back of the main dining room where with heigh ceiling, floor to ceiling french doors with lots of natural sunlight and you can see the back garden patio... very beautiful. I can picture my future small wedding reception here in the summertime.. would be beautiful.
The front of the house is a diner + Bistro setting, more comfy and casual if that's what you like. My boyfriend didn't dress up (and you don't need to) so he felt a bit nervous at the beginning, but our waitress Cheryl done a great job to made him feel like home in a second. Every servers here are extremely friendly, warm and professional, especially Cheryl she is knowledgeable and attentive to every details.
Now comes the food:
As soon as we sat down, our drink orders were taken and fresh bread and butter were brought out immediately.
I ordered French onion soup - delicious. If you love strong cheese and crispy breads. To me this is good for rainy or snowy days, I'm craving for a soups like that.
Smoke salmon sandwich also delicious and light, it made with cream cheese and cucumber in a croissant. I changed the side salad to steam vegetables, there are baby bockchoy, oyster mushrooms, and asparagus. Love the steam vegetables are made as delicious as the main.
My BF had steak and egg, it turns out he said this is the best steak and egg he has ever had. Small portions but enough to eat. Beef was so tender and juicy. Egg was a perfect sunny side up. 
Cappuccino was creamy too, it comes with chocolate as french tradition.. plus plus!
We will definitely come back again! Hopefully won't be another 10 years. Bravo to the team."}
{"text":"Excellent food, with a traditional French menu. Nice options for eating inside or outside. Service will not be fast!"}
{"text":"\"French Bistro for all occasions\"

I had the pleasure of attending a private event here for a close friend and this place is an excellent French Bistro. It's just off the beaten path just West of Spadina on Wellington in between Fashion District and Wellington Place. 

It's right beside the old C-Lounge which is now Addison's. One pro-tip, there is parking, limited to about 12, but parking nonetheless behind the building for customers of Le Select. 

Atmosphere: 

A nice contemporary atmosphere for a French bistro. It has the feel of a place you can go for a nice date night or a drink after work. Atmosphere has a very nice upscale casual feel with lots of wood accents, and wine bottles adorning the walls all around. There is a nice dining area, private dining area in the back you can potentially book, and a patio/outdoor area in the back which would make a nice place to sit for brunch in the summer.

The servers all speak French and are very helpful.

Food: 

Food was well presented as can be expected by a French Bistro, but there is a selection of classics with modern twists like Duck, Steak, salmon, and tarts. We had a prix fixe menu that featured a Kale and Goat Cheese Salad (refreshing), Goat Cheese and mushroom tart salad, Sirloin flap steak with jus, Duck, Creme Brule, and Fruit platter.

All items were delicious, though the steak was overpowered by the Onion jus, and could've stood on it's own without. 

Overall a nice spot for French cuisine and somewhere I'd recommend to go if that's what you're craving and are in the area. Not that pricey either."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded me of Paris - from their seating, romantic atmosphere to their soft lighting and extensive wine list. Their food was delicious - perfectly seasoned, local and seasonal. We ordered a charcuterie board to start and I had their bouillabaisse while my partner had their duck confit. The prices were reasonable however the service was a bit slow. I saw many waiters and when we were checked on, it was great however there was always a bit of a wait -- wait for our orders to be taken, food to be served and bill to given. Overall our meal took 2.5 hours. Now, I understand, perhaps that is the Parisian way of enjoying food but I found it a bit long. They also have a patio for you to sit in and they open the windows which made the restaurant extremely warm. This was noticed by tables all around us. However, the pro's definitely outweigh the cons and I would love to come back for the food and wine which is most important anyhow."}
{"text":"Le Select Bistro is good for all who love traditional French food. If you have a taste for some escargots, bouillabaisse, beef tartare or perhaps coq au vin, you can find it here.

The restaurant caters to a somewhat earlier dinner crowd. This is probably not the ideal place to begin a meal at or after 9 pm, as things tend to begin slowing down by then. They have a nice patio in front of the place that tends to run a bit later.

I had a special beef filet that was very good. The best thing I ate here was the escargots in a white wine sauce.

When you come here, be sure to check out the expansive wine cellar downstairs. The selection of wine here is second to none.

Probably because the kitchen is downstairs, service here can be a bit uneven."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot about French food in general,  but I really enjoyed my experience here. The food, the ambience, the music played (although my French date heavily disagreed on this). Reminded me of having dinner in a cute Parisian restaurant. 

If I can break it down, I'd rate the food 3 stars and the ambience/service 4 stars. For food/drinks, here's what we had: 

1) drinks: Kir Royal and Kir Saint Germain  (both delicious)

2) Bouillabaise à la rascasse - Which is a very intense soup with some seafood items in it. Although for the price, I would hope there's more than 1 scallop, 1 mussel, some fish pieces and lots of croutons. I did enjoy the flavor though. 

3) Steak Frite - it came in a form of a burger, which is very unexpected. I didn't have any of it, but my date didn't enjoy it very much. 

4) Assiette De Fromage - of course going on a date with a French, you'd end the course with the cheese platter! I really enjoyed the platter, and loved all the cheese we had, which are all from Quebec and Ontario! I also really liked the fact that they had honey comb as a side. Definitely a plus there! 

All in all, I'd probably be back for a quick drink/snack but most probably not for the main course."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Parisian, beautiful music, friendly staff, nice decor 

Food: exquisite!! Finely done in a high end fashion. Great menu selection. I had the salmon croissant with cream cheese and cucumber which was wonderful for the summer. Along with freshly squeezed orange juice.   The hash browns are crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. 


Will definitely be back for more brunch in the future. One thing I noticed was that even though it is a quality  high end restaurant, the customers were laid back in their attire. This kept the place humble."}
{"text":"This place satisfies my craving for French Bistro.  You can't really get classic french bistro food in the Buffy-croque monsieur, steak frites, cassoulet.

The croque-monsieur is not as good as the one at Pastis (the standard against which all others should be measured).  Needs more bechamel melty goodness.  Bread is excellent.  Good rose by the glass.  Adequate waitstaff.

I even tried steak tartare.  Wooooo."}
{"text":"I came here with my best friend for her birthday on Sunday.  We made reservations, mainly because I was afraid that we were going to have line-up like most other brunch places within the GTA.  Luckily, La Select is a large bistro and has many seats.  They have a cute little patio in the front, but we decided to sit inside since it felt like it was going to rain.  We were quickly seated and they our waitress was extra friendly.

They gave us fresh buns that were hot with butter that easily melted on the bread.  Thank goodness for that - most places that I go to have a cold roll and butter that's too hard to slab on!

I ended up ordering the SANDWICH CROISSANT AU GRAVLAX, and my friend had ordered the SALADES FRISEES LARDON.  The croissant was delectable, and the lox and cream cheese were to die for.  It wasn't TOO heavy, which I enjoyed, because most of the time when I walk out of a brunch place, I am just TOO full.  My friend really enjoyed her salad, as it came with bacon bits and a poached egg on top as well.

Great place if you're in the area!  It's sort of located in a secluded neighbourhood (next to C Lounge and down the street from Flirty Girl Fitness).  Service was also impeccable."}
{"text":"My wife and I figured we've been going to Le Select when we visit Toronto for at least 30 years.  This is the type of restaurant that even Gordon Ramsey would be proud of (and that says a lot).  All staff are very professional, yet the wait staff is down-to-earth friendly, which seems to indicate they enjoy their jobs even under pressure.

Not being an expert on Parisian food (despite two trips there), I'm not going to say if this is genuine Paris bistro or not.  But all the food is prepared well, creative, and varied.  If on a budget, the prie fixe for $35 includes soup or salad, main, and creme brulee or mousse.  You'll be happy with this the first visit.  After that, be prepared to spend lots more, but the choices are endless.  I went out of my comfort zone and had  a grilled stripped bass dish which was  excellent and my wife had an equally recommendable pork chop entree. Despite a neighboring table recommending a mackerel dish, I thought I'd not venture that far into fishy land. Wine choice can be from normally-priced suggested house wines by the glass to many bottles at hundreds of dollars from a notably huge wine cellar.

You must go downstairs to  use the restrooms.  The journey leads you past the open kitchen which is entertainment by itself.  Then you have a window view into the wine cellar. Both are part of the experience.  Le Select deserves it's long-term success due to keeping current yet retaining it's charm."}
{"text":"Great place for a dinner date. The ambience is nice, staff are friendly, and the overall volume is low enough so that you can hold a conversation. I had the duck confit which was one of the better confit dishes I've had. Their wine menu is also something I would check out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent at Le Select!  You are greeted by a bar at the front of the restaurant. 2 galleys of dining areas follow and an expanded dining room is located in the middle and at the back.  No matter where you are seated, you wil get the same refined and yet casual French bistro ambience.

I attended a work dinner function with over 100 colleagues and our event took up the entire restaurant for the evening.   The hors- d'eourves that were passed around are not available on the nighly dinner menu but there were fantastic - grilled prawns on skewers and bison tartar.  The tartar was smooth and full of flavour and it melted in my mouth.  I had onion soup and joue de boeuf bouguignonne for dinner.   My meal could have stopped after the soup.  It was full of baguettes topped with a  thick thick layer of Swiss cheese.  I even scraped of the cheese from the side of the bowl at the end.  My beef bouguignonne was exceptional also.  The beef cheek was cooked to the right tenderness.  The flavour was rich and it was a rather heavy dish.   I could only finish half of it since I was stuffed from the hors-d'oeuvre and the close to meal-size soup.

It's a little out of the way and a trek for us Vancourites from our hotel on Front and Lower Simcoe in -10c weather with mixture of snow, slush and salt on the roads.  However, it was worth it."}
{"text":"We decided to come here after an adventurous road trip thru the city to find several of our initial restaurants either closed due to hours or renovations. So we landed at this place late at night. The restaurant was probably about half empty but you can still feel the good cozy atmosphere of a typical French restaurant. The inside decor was pretty decent and our waitress was pretty friendly and service was overall pretty good with no complaints.

We had the soup of the day first which was really good. I don't know what da heck it was but it was dark greyish looking and again tasted really good with the bread. Then I ordered a few pints of beers to drink with my friends plus CASSOULET which is braised white lingot beans with lamb, pork belly, Toulouse sausage and duck confit. My other friends just ordered the Duck Confit, so I think with hindsight my meal was a better deal since I got the same size piece of duck plus some lamb, pork and sausage.

The variety of extra meats was mixed in a nice juicy tangy broth sauce that was extra tasty. The lamb was soft and just melted in my mouth, and so did the pork belly since it was with fatty pieces of fat. The sausage was okay but still good enough to recommend. Of course the duck confit was the main part of the dish and it was quite good indeed. The duck was soft and tender, coming off the bone easily and when dipped into that tangy broth sauce it's definitely one of the better dishes to order in the menu. 

So overall, a really good French experience in a not so French city compared to Montreal or Quebec. I would definitely come back here again when given the chance. But make sure to bring your stack of credit cards as you can only afford to pay for yourself since it is French food and I haven't found a cheap French restaurant just yet."}
{"text":"2.5/5

I hate to give this place such a low review after all the amazing things I've read, but it really just didn't \"wow\" me.

We came here on Good Friday, they did have a prix fixe menu but we opted to a la carte some of the other items.

I ordered a bellini, but they gave me a mimosa instead. I am both a bellini and mimosa fan so I kept the mimosa. My boyfriend had an orange juice, though we both felt that $4.50 for a very small flute of OJ is a bit overpriced.

We were given some complimentary bread, though no butter or anything to accompany it. It was okay.

I went with the eggs benny. The croissant was nice, buttery, flakey, and obviously very freshly baked; I am also a big fan of their hollandaise! Unforutnately, my eggs were very overcooked and the asparagus & bok choy that accompanied it were looking a bit sad.

My boyfriend in his usual breakfast fashion ordered two dishes - the stuffed french toast & the eggs & sausages. The stuffed french toast was good, as were the sausages (nice & smoky!). He complained that his eggs were too runny for his liking, and I did see that the table beside us sent their eggs back for the same thing.

We had the chocolate cake for dessert. It was good, but not really a stand-out. The passion fruit sorbet that came with it was delicious though, we devoured it pretty quickly!

Service was okay, but a bit absent. I felt that we had to go out of our way to get our servers attention most of the time.

I think I may give this place a 2nd chance, as many of the reviews seem to be stellar, hopefully the experience will be a bit better! :)"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Service is acceptable. The food is alright but its priced pretty high for what you get."}
{"text":"Hands down best French bistro in Toronto. Ambience feels like you are in France. Food is very traditional French bistro and outstanding service. Great job Le Sélect!! Wish we came for dinner too."}
{"text":"Facing into the restaurant makes you feel like you're in France. Facing out reminds you that you're sitting on the ass end of Wellington Street. 

Pricey menu with good quality food. If you're not feeling adventurous then try the set menu. $35 gets you a selection of their best dishes. I highly suggest going for the duck confit rather than the steak. Amazing dish. 

Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. Again, just don't look out onto Wellington street."}
{"text":"Their mousse and mimosas are the greatest. Usually booked up so it's best to make a reservation first."}
{"text":"There is an amazing wine selection with a wide price range. I got escargot, choucroute, and chocolate cake. Everything was excellent. The service is friendly and quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Elegant in and out, spacious, no problem to find a seat at 7 pm on a Friday night, although I did a reservation on-line. Tasty food we had indeed, small portions though. I had the 1 leg of duck, which was tender and flavorful, comes with a potato the size of half matchbox and 5 leaves of spinach and one baby carrot. My wife ordered the beef cheek dish, melt in the mouth doesn't do justice, very flavorful as well. 1 soup and one appetizer and we paid $90 tip included (no drinks). I would go again? maybe"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of French food in general. I can't exactly pinpoint what it is, but I just never get excited about it. With that in mind, I was actually pleasantly surprised with my meal at Le Select Bistro.

Staff: Staff was friendly and accommodating. It was a large party and some were arriving later than others. They were pretty attentive throughout the night keeping our glasses full and ensuring we had everything we wanted. The food came at a fairly reasonable rate. It was a birthday so we had brought a cake. There was a plating fee which was unfortunate but no unheard of but they did add fruit to the plates so it wasn't just a fee for slicing a cake.

Ambience: Very comfortable for parties of all sizes. Great seating and tall ceilings. We made it pretty loud since we were such a large party. The soft light made it very intimate but it wasn't too dark which was great. I did find that our table was a little cramped but they cleared the table away pretty often so it wasn't too bad.

Food: I ordered Assiette de Charcuterie which was their assorted meats to start. It was alright and nothing unique about it. For my main I ordered the Poulet Grillé Bio which was their chicken on top of grilled vegetables. The chicken was a little overcooked but the zucchini and tomatoes was nice.

I think at the end of the day, the ambience and service made this a very nice experience. However, the food was good but nothing really wowed me."}
{"text":"My husband actually took me here on our first date AND proposed to me here. It's been one of our regular places to go for good French food. We always have a good meal here. I like the ambiance. It's quite casual but has a nice French bistro feel."}
{"text":"Five stars is not enough for this restaurant.  We arrived for dinner around 9 pm.  Although we did not have reservations, we were quickly seated in the mostly full restaurant.

Service:
Completely professional, courteous, prompt.  There was one misstep when the waitress misheard our order and brought out the wrong entree.  She was completely apologetic and the kitchen quickly brought out the correct entree.  To fix the mistake, they offered us free dessert (which, as you will read later, was much appreciated).

Drinks:
Excellent selection of beer, wine and liquor.  Not to mention the fact that they have legitimate French drinks, such as Kir and Kir Royale, which I never see other than in France.  After dinner, we retired to the bar where we proceeded to drink multiple, delicious dirty gin martinis.  Excellent bartenders.

Food:
This is what earns them 5+ stars, in my book.  I ordered the duck confit because so many reviewers raved about this dish.  I was skeptical because I don't really like dark meat.  But I decided to go on a limb - am I glad that I did!! The skin was thin and crispy with incredible flavor.  The meat was so tender and the taste was out of this world.  Not nearly as \"greasy\" as dark chicken or turkey meat.  One leg was only $19.99 which I found to be very reasonable.  The sides it came with were also fantastic (the potatoes au gratin in particular).

My date had the salmon which was also excellent.  A huge filet cooked to perfection with a mustard sauce.  

Because we were offered a free dessert, we went with the lemon tart.  This was one of the best desserts either of us ever had.  There was torched sugar on top and the crust was dense and delicious.  Served with fresh fruit on the side.  Everything reminded me of creme brulee but better because of the excellent lemon flavor.

Ambiance:
Romantic, candlelit.  The tables are close together but this too is reminiscent of a real French restaurant.  Everyone is so engaged in their meal and the experience that you end up forgetting that you're basically sitting right next to a complete stranger."}
{"text":"With a wine list that reads like a novel, and charming decor LeSelect is now on our regular rotation. Authentically prepared french dishes and spot on service with grace and polish, not surprised to see so many fans."}
{"text":"What a great experience and a great meal!  The service was great (Odd that I came all the way from California to Toronto and had a server from California.) and the food was exquisite.  Had the cassoulet and the duck confit and lamb were perfectly prepared.  An excellent (if pricey) wine list just added to the overall excellence.  Yes, you'll spend some money, but it will be well spent.  Looking forward to my next trip to Toronto.  (Oh, and to my server:  sorry I kept stealing the coasters!)"}
{"text":"Nice alternative to Marben when MARBEN IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS DAMNIT

Great food. They have a nice fixed priced dinner option for $35. Other than that it's quite pricey."}
{"text":"Located on a quiet part of Wellington by Spadina, Le Select is a Parisien style French Bistro with an authentic atmosphere and comprehensive menu. 

We came here on a Friday night to a pretty full house. The restaurant gets quite loud with all the chatter. The kitchen is in the basement whete they also have a really cool wine cellar that you should check out (along the way to the washroom). 

Across the group we ordered duck confit, venison, steak and frities, beef tar tar and the French onion soup. Highlights would be the duck confit which was crispy and flavourful with the sauce. The venison wasn't too dry and tasted good. The steak was a bit small to be filling. The French onion soup was good but not worth the cost.

Service was slow, including our wait for the food. However our waitress was kind and made recommendations for food before we ordered.

Pricing is on the higher end. I'd recommend trying this but I'l likely try to visit some other French bistros in Toronto before coming back."}
{"text":"A fine beer establishment at one time. Though their beer list has shrunk since they moved to their new fancy-schmancy location on wellington. I preferred this place when it was an unassuming little bistro off queen & spadina. Now it has kind of a pretentious vibe. Man, they used to serve you bread in a basket they lowered on a string using an elaborate pulley-system! It was downright charming.

Yet another tragic downfall by venue-change.

Anyway, not a regular haunt anymore for me."}
{"text":"One Sunday morning in July, my friend and I went to Le Select Bistro in Toronto. Although some foodie writers seem to think that authentic French food left France and can now only be found in North America and Asia (I strongly beg to differ), they would make a good argument by featuring the dishes at Le Select. I really wanted to order the Foie Gras dish but they were OUT OF FOIE GRAS!!! Now I should have just left right then and there, but I decided to give them a second chance and ordered the Bison meat steak tartare. I do not regret my choice. It was fabulous. Flavorful and fresh, I ate every bite! My beautiful friend ordered the confit de canard (Duck confit) and it was also delicious. For dessert, I enjoyed a strong double espresso and stole a few bites of said friend's chocolate cake. I just couldn't resist. I also have to interject here and mention that I am a big fan of Canada's twist on the Bloody Mary: the Caeser. Just as spicy and tomato-y, the Caeser features Clamato juice instead of plain Tomato Juice. The secret ingredient? Clam juice. AWESOME."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)

Came here for Sunday brunch. They take reservations, which is nice, although we were hoping to get a patio spot but it was full. The inside is actually quite nice. Very warm and like a classic French bistro with mahogany wood (similar feel to La Societe in Yorkville). The round booths are very cozy and would be a romantic setting for a date. Loved the art posters on the walls. 

Service was comme-ci, comme-ca. I arrived early. While waiting for my DC, someone brought water but no one asked if I wanted a drink or coffee while I waited. Also at the end of the meal, it was really hard to flag down our server to get the bill. She kept coming near us but kept zipping away... She did seem really busy! 

I had a cappucchino which was great. Lots of foam! So many places now don't seem to know the difference between a latte and cappucchino. For food, I had the goat cheese omelette ($15) which was done very well. It came with delicious, crispy rosti potatoes. On the menu it said it came with mushrooms and bok choy, but it was like 1 tiny piece of bok choy and just a few slivers of mushrooms. I would've liked more veggies! Prices are slightly higher than other brunch places (e.g. $3.50 for a croissant? Even if it is a Rahier croissant... those are delicious but better to just go to Rahier yourself, I'm pretty sure they're half the price). 

Anyways, other than the slow service and slight priceyness, this is a pretty good option for a leisurely weekend brunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Nice decoration ( feels like you are in Paris). One of the greatest wine selections. The brunch was just average. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs benny with salmon substitute. Served on a croissant with dill hollandaise sauce, which was great although slightly too salty for my taste.

Atmosphere is relaxed even though it has that bustling ambience of a parisian cafe. Giving a 4 because the front of house service was fantastic - I came in to dine alone and he gave me a great booth and made me feel very comfortable."}
{"text":"Great for brunch. I'd recommend eggs Benedict, it's on a croissant- it is delicious!! The staff is friendly and accommodating. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went for dinner and had one of the most romantic/relaxing evenings ever. Warm and cozy atmosphere makes for a great date place. Steak to die for. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on Saturday night and thought everything was just okay - so 3 stars it is.

We tried:
-french onion soup: this was yummy but I don't think it's worth $15 for a bowl. -____- I like how the bread was crunchy-ish despite being in the soup though.
-foie gras: came out on a big platter and some bread but nothing particularly special
-some special of the day - 72 hr braised beef rib and barley mash risotto: I thought this tasted really similar to the Vietnamese thit kho dish. Huge and generous beef portion though.
-duck confit: this came w/some veggies and potatoes. It was just okay - I think I've had better elsewhere.
-creme brulee

Maybe i was expecting too much bc of the yelp reviews, but I think Le Select is more of a 3.5 star restaurant. It's also worth noting that their $35 prefix menu isn't at all bad if you want to try that."}
{"text":"A Classic French Bistro on a quiet street in Toronto. 
I was gladly introduced to this place from a friend and now I am happy man with this new find. 

This place has an amazing patio and a decent party room in the back. 

The wine menu is huge with excellent options from $50-500 a bottle. 

There is a great price fix menu as well for $35 for a nice 3 course meal. 

Finally the menu is rich with classic French items to some unique plates. 

A great place for dates and special occasions with that special someone. 

I had several items on the menu. 
1.  Salmon tartar - perfect and plated 
2.  Kale salad just right with the dressing 
3.  Deer was unbelievable 
4.  Fish was very good
5.  Deconstructed Ravioli was interesting. Not my fave
6.  Cheese platter was excellent
7.  Salami and meat board was excellent
8.  Steak and Fritz yum
9.  Lemon Tart perfect
10. Creme Brulee nice
11. Coffee was perfect

I'll be back for sure. 
Thanks for the amazing meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant turned me into someone who complains about surprise cheese being in my meal, and I am not okay with that.

I had the goat cheese and beat salad, looking for a healthier, cleaner option, and what I actually got was a pile of beets, shredded leaves, and salt. The goat cheese was in a tiny pile on top of the lettuce, and then, melted on top of my salad was the saltiest cheese I have ever tasted (& this was not listed on the menu). As cheese is one of my favourite indulgences, I am very saddened to say that it completely ruined the salad for me. All I could taste was salt.

Dessert, on the other hand, was the opposite yet same experience: my lemon tart tasted like pure sugar. It was so disgustingly sweet, topped with some kind of caramelized sugar (also not listed on the menu), and the crust honestly tasted as though it had been frozen- so dense and kind of chewy.

The only thing that saved my evening was our server; she offered great service and made sure that my water glass was constantly refilled as I drank many glasses to counteract my salt salad."}
{"text":"Le Select truly deserves this 5 stars review. Whether it's for a nice romantic dinner or a casual late night bite, you won't be let down. 

From the start, the staff is very welcoming, the dinning feels intimate even though it is spacious. A nice Parisian themed is going around. The menu offers a good range of options, most of them having animal proteins in them. The pricing is on the higher up end but the quality will meet your expectations. 

My better half and I decided to share 3 main dishes. First one was the St Jacques Cauliflower. I am still raving about the cauliflower puree that was so smooth, tasteful and went so well with the other elements of the dish. The scallops were seared perfectly and the endive and mushrooms were also great. I would have put this dish more has a appetizer due to it's size as the portion was slightly small for a $30 main. (4.5/5).

Second came the Gigot d'agneau. I recommend having it medium to appreciate the flavors and juiciness of this nice cut of meat. The rosemary jus was very thick, almost like a glaze but still went well with the dish. (4.5/5). 

Last but not least was the Bouillabaise. Everything was great; from the broth, to the octopus, to more scallops and these great garlic croutons. Beautifully presented. (5/5). 

Side note for the owner ; your reservation system should be changed. The hostess seated us, and at the end of the meal will still received an automated message saying we were late. Not the nicest way to do things."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant! I actually stumbled upon this place randomly and decided to host my birthday dinner here.

I've never had bone marrow before so I decided to start off my meal with that. I didn't quite know what to expect so I kept an open mind. The bone marrow was good. Was it something I would order again and again? Probably not because it was a bit too rich and I prefer ordering appetizers that I can share with the rest of the table.

My friend ordered a vol-au-vent d'escargots which is a tiny pastry with escargots in it. It was delicious and I highly recommend that dish.

I wanted to try steak tartare since I've never had that before but they ran out so I went for a safe choice - filet mignon. It was good. I would say just as good as any other steakhouse's filet mignon. It came with a side order for fries which was SO delicious. It was thin and crispy and just perfection.

At the end of the meal, the restaurant gave me a free dessert of my choice. I got a lemon pie which was very good and they even wrote happy birthday on my plate! However, I would say that my friend's creme brulee was much more delicious than my lemon pie so make sure you get that if you're in the mood for desserts!

The food was good here but what really stood out was the service. They were kind and thoughtful and it was such a lovely experience dining here. I'm definitely coming back when I get a chance!"}
{"text":"Probably the closest thing you'll get to a real Parisienne bistro in Toronto. The food is very standard French fare from both the city and some other regions. The brunch is spectacular and they make a LEGIT Croque Monsieur/Madame."}
{"text":"Everyone knows by now, I love French food. And this place is terrifically French. Very classic and traditional French food cooked well. Quite a large menu with daily specials and a wine list to die for - the wine \"list\" is novel sized and daunting but their house selection is perfect as well - I suggest the Rhone for Red. But their staff is very knowledgeable if you're looking for something extra special.

I've had a quite a few dishes here - which being a vegetarian at a French restaurant can be a nice surprise - their frites are AMAZING, perfectly salted and come to the table nice and hot. The omelet with brie cheese and potato rosti is a perfect brunch meal as is the quiche. The salads are lovely and a nice size and the desserts rich and sweet as they should be! Coffee comes served with a beautiful piece of chocolate - every part of your experience here feels controlled and catered to in all the right ways.

They make a delicious martini! And I'm assured by my friends, bf and colleagues that the meat dishes are spectacular as well. They take care with their ingredients, where they come from and how they are raised which always wins me over. Its on the higher end of pricing for restaurants of a similar ilk but I think it's totally worth it.

Perfect for business, pleasure, romance, family dining, this place has it all. Cozy romantic tables and booths, larger flat tops for business, including a back room worthy of a good sized party, a lovely patio out front that is nicely decorated by some bushes so you feel away from the somewhat industrial nature of Wellington. Everything I love about French decor and ambience is here."}
{"text":"I went twice here. Today I went for my friend's birthday brunch. I had the Croque Madame. It was well prepared but I think the cost is exorbitant for what you're getting. Not impressed with the dishes and they don't wow me. Servers were nice though."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service. I would come back any time. Great menu and I love the decor. This is perfect for large parties - even on a very busy night, it doesn't get too loud (aka, you can still hold a conversation without shouting). 

Wine selection is great - on your \"adventure\" to the washrooms downstairs you can see part of their cellar, they are sure stocked up. I also call it an adventure because you get to pass by an opening to the very busy kitchen, which I always think is cool. I like to see the action take place. 

The dining area itself is relaxing, yet somewhat formal and very romantic. This is a perfect date spot. Parking isn't so great - especially in the winter, so you may have a bit of a walk ahead of you. 

There is nothing here that I didn't like. The French Onion soup is a must-order in the winter."}
{"text":"It's been hit or miss with me. I had the salmon croissant sandwich, and it was just really cold and bland. The scallops are delicious, but it's a very small portion. But I think they have the best fries in the city. So delicious.

The patio is nice, but has way too many insects in the summer."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant! 

This place is bright, welcoming, and the staff is very friendly. I went here for the first time this weekend for brunch and it was a wonderful experience. I've heard quite a bit about Le Select but haven't had the chance of going until now since I was visiting in Toronto.

We called and made a reservation Saturday morning since the place fills up quickly for brunch. We got a comfortable little table for our party and were seated right away. The staff was courteous and brought out our drinks and food quite quickly. We got some freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice..delicious!

For brunch, we got a variety of scrambles, salmon, and I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were prepared perfectly and their hollandaise sauce is superb! It was well priced and the venues decor was lovely. It's a perfect place for brunch, a dinner date, or even to take your mother out for mother's day! I would love to come back and try out their dinner menu sometime!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for weekend brunch! Place was pretty packed and very Frech-style like. I definitely consider it a relaxing, romantic brunch spot.

Got the eggs benny (like usual) and a latte. Complimentary bread was delicious and our food came fairly quicky considering how busy it was. Eggs benny wasn't bad, but the asparagus and mushrooms made the perfect compliment."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back to this place since we went here this past summer.

The staff was courteous and attentive. The food was spot on and I had a great time eating here! Their backroom is a great place to hold a larger party. I'd highly recommend thee mackerel if you get the chance to try it. Parking is right across the street, so there is very little reason to go here :)"}
{"text":"Try the French onion soup! It's so scrumptious.  The service is excellent, great selection of wine, great place to bring a date since they have cozy booths. We had the lamb burger and the fish with fries paired up with a nice glass of Bordeaux wine, along with th lemon tart for dessert.  I was also very impressed with the taste of their decaf espresso.  
Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & even better service. Beautiful location & retro decor. Mickael Z made a simple brunch into the most enjoyable afternoon for my group of 6 friends. He is funny, attentive & provided outstanding service. We will be back just for him!"}
{"text":"I regularly eat here with a good friend. The espresso is hit and miss. The service at times is amazing but other times falters. 

The steak frites are great and I rank them with Crush. 

For brunch I get the stuffed French Toast and sausage. 

I love that you get bread with your meal - it is warm and I dunk it into my coffee :)

Overall - go, it won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Very tasty and interesting decor. Portions were a little on the small side, but scrumptious as can be."}
{"text":"***CURLY HAIR in my food and extremely poor service.

I was here for Sunday brunch on Valentine's Day and while I expected the restaurant to be busy as usual, I did not anticipate the horrible experience we ended up having here.

To start things off, after we were seated, our waiter greeted us by huffing about how \"busy\" it was after we asked him how he was doing. As guests at this popular brunch spot, we expected it to be \"busy\", patiently waited and did not have a problem with the crowds. His comment made things awkward and we did not feel very welcome. We overheard him saying this to all the other guests as well - what do you expect, it's Sunday brunch!

We placed our order promptly. It took over 25 minutes for our food to arrive: the quiche and lamb burger. We got started while still waiting for the lobster bisque. Our original server disappeared so when we followed up 10 minutes later (with another server we finally managed to flag down) he responded \"did you still want it?\". Did they not want our business or something? We requested for the soup to still be brought out but it was NOT worth the wait.

Just when I concluded I would give this place 3 stars for the lacklustre food and cold service, I discovered a hair BAKED into my quiche (see photo). I quickly brought this to our waiter's attention and he went to inform the chef. A few minutes later he came back and offered his sincerest apologies from \"the chef\". For what I thought was a classy place, there was no acknowledgement from \"the chef\" or Manager on duty about this disgraceful incident. Simply a sad sorry from our waiter who clearly didn't care anyways. When the bill arrived, the quiche was deducted from the total (obviously) but to our disappointment there was no effort to comfort us that this would not happen again or that it was an isolated situation. 

As we left, our waiter and the Manager did not even acknowledge us. They sure did a good job of giving us NO incentive of ever coming back again."}
{"text":"why so many high ratings here? Ordered the onion soup, foie gras and steak, none of them meets the level of \"tasty\". In fact it is the worst foie gras I ever had. Onion soup tasted bitter and i dont know why. most of foods were left in the plate after the meal cuz i just cant enjoy them. Definitely never come again."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. Went for lunch with team mates and had a great time.

We were seated in the back patio where it was just the right temperature.

Had the Kale and local Ricotta salad to start. It was light and fresh and the ricotta was amazing. 

For entree had the Pavé du Bouef. My-oh-my! The meat was soft, tender, like butter. The sauce, which I thought was going to be heavy and sweet, complemented the beef perfectly and had just the right amount of flavour. And the frites..... YUM!

Desert was ok, had a lemon tart (huge serving) and some seasonal fruit. 

Im still thinking about the steak..... And they have a huge wine selection too.

Ps. Washrooms are downstairs keep to the right."}
{"text":"Le Select has always been on my list to try, albeit closer to the bottom. I felt a little inspired to pop-in as I was unable to score any reso's at more glamorous joints in such a time crunch, but I've only got good things to say. The smoked fish terrine and the escargot-filled puff pastry made fantastic starters, though the terrine had a flavor profile you'd expect from an Eastern European deli rather than a French bistro. The short rib was fantastic, beautifully presented, and could be cut with a butter knife. The bison tartare fell a little short for me, lacking the mustardy sharpness I was hoping for, but those traditional frites made up the for that. I'd definitely return, but not for the ambiance atmosphere, I thought they may have been running a seniors' special."}
{"text":"the place, both inside and outside, is gorgeous. for the ten-plus years that i've been coming here, the food and service have been _consistently_ very high quality. the drink offerings are extensive. all-in-all, pretty much the perfect french restaurant."}
{"text":"Le Select is a comfortable place with a French bistro menu. The cassoulet is very good and I have been ordering it for many years. I also enjoy the seafood dishes although they are often out of some of the items. Bone marrow is done nicely. Wine list is excellent and is one of the best in town. Service can be a bit slow because it's always very busy. Le Select has a well established customer base it built when it was located on Queen St."}
{"text":"A nice Resturant with good atmosphere and a over average food. Good place to bring your fine wines.

Our male server did not make us very comfortable, he was probably on a tight schedule or in a bad mood. He asked to take our orders 3 times in 5 mins when we told him we need a minute on the first attempt.  Then we ordered appetizers to start, we wanted time for the wine to open up and he was rushing for us to order the main course."}
{"text":"Locate in an interesting neighborhood. The service was just ok, you shouldn't have to pour your own wine or ask for water. I had the Beef short rib which was very good. I suggest you at least give this place a try."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Toronto, I lived in soulless condos near Skydome.  I used to wander aimlessly searching for breakfast foods on weekends, and I felt disdain towards the lengthy lineups at Coras on weekends (even in a blizzard, people will line up around the corner there.)  Finally someone recommended that I check out Le Select for brunch and I am so glad they did.  

My sister was in town and we made our way over there one Saturday morning to be greeted by people wearing sport jackets and Polo attire.  I think Beth might have been wearing track pants, and I was definitely wearing and offensively pink shirt.  They let us in anyways, after a very strange exchange about having a reservation (we did not, but there were lots of empty tables).  They tried to seat us inside, but I asked to be seated outside, and again we had a little exchange about it (they asked a lot of questions; I felt like I had to show them my amex corporate card so they would feel better about bringing us food) and eventually we sat down outside on one of the most beautiful patios on Wellington.

The OJ is fresh and fabulous.  They make their own sausages here (oddly enough, I don't think you can get bacon).  I had the french toast which was stuffed with apples and cranberries and I can safely say it is by far the best I have ever had.  Beth had eggs and sausage with rosti potatoes and everything was amazing.  

I can say for certain, that this is my favorite brunch spot in Toronto.  

I have also been here for steak and frites, and I am pretty picky about steak.  I will NEVER eat thin pathetic 'bar steak'.  I don't recall as much about the steak as I do about the brunch, but I don't recall being disappointed or having a tainted image of Le Select in my mind, so it must have been good.

The prix-fixe steak frites menu $19.95 (with starter or dessert) is available:

Monday -Wednesday 10:00pm - 11:00pm
Thursday - Friday 10:30pm - 11:30pm
Saturday 10:30pm - midnight
Sunday - 9:30 - 10:30pm"}
{"text":"Ok food but poor service. Waiter wasn't happy to see us for some reason. Her attitude spoiled the entire experience. We asked if they had a sommelier to help us with pairing. She said yes and came back later with a \"encyclopedia\" of their wines. So she's the sommelier. Fine... So we ask her advice for pairing. Her reply- What's your budget? She went on about budget for good 10 minutes. We finally had to select wine without her help. She wouldn't check on us, wouldn't refresh our water, and pretended she didn't hear us when we called her. By the end of the evening it was a really bizarre experience! Not going there again."}
{"text":"Le Select Bistro, just the name brings back memories of foie gras on a board, cheeses, duck and all sorts of French delicacies. Since we are not in France and it is sometimes hard to find a relaxed French restaurant you hold on to the ones you have and le select happens to be one of them. Le select Bistro far proceeds my lifetime having many distinguished chefs pass through their kitchens over time and forever securing its place as an institution for high quality cooking in Toronto. Because I live in LA, every time I get to come home for any period of time I make sure I make it out to this pillar of gastronomy for a dinner. If you do Le Select, do it right. Rule #1 take a cab because you will want to have wine and lots of it. Their wine program is extensive and has a focus on top tier French wines which I have had the pleasure of experiencing each time I go. #2 Don't go there and try to be on a diet, if you go, go all out, order the duck confite eat their homemade bread and yes eat a giant slab of their mouthwatering foie gras. Lastly make sure to try some dish that puts you out of your comfort zone because the team of chefs downstairs will not disappoint. Le Select has been an institution for years in Toronto and whenever I am lucky enough to get a reservation I feel honored to dine at such an established landmark of gastronomy. I will be back Le Select, you can count on that."}
{"text":"Le Select Bistro has always been one of my go to resto for weekend brunch because it's close to my home, the service is always great and the food is delicious but I was disappointed on this visit. 

We ordered the kefir pancakes and quiche Lorraine.  The pancake was just one big pancake with blueberries and orange zest baked inside with fruits on top. While the presentation is on point, that taste wasn't.  The pancake was soggy maybe due to its thickness but more importantly, the orange zest just didn't taste right inside a pancake. It was too overwhelming and dominated the taste.  My husband's quiche was pretty good with a nice arugula salad to compliment the richness. 

When we finished our meals and told our server there is no more room for dessert, he immediately bought us the bill.  I thought that was a bit rude since we didn't ask for it.  

One thing I would like to see from Le Select is to introduce some new or special items on their brunch menu once in a while as their menu hasn't change in the last decade."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a good Sunday brunch. Delicious offerings such as french toast, goat cheese quiche, a lamb burger (with Moroccan spices) are a perfect complement to a rainy Sunday morning with friends. Or a nice date. They also have a  great selection of desserts worth checking out.

This is a very busy restaurant, and I would suggest making reservations ahead of time. We went there at 11:30 - and it was packed, with a steady flow of people. The noise is a little too loud, but not annoyingly so.

 I'd love to check this place out during the summertime, since it seems like they also have a patio section out back."}
{"text":"Just came home from a \"mommy group\" that was held at Le Select. I was a little hesitant to go as I've been there for brunch before and know very well that it can get crowded. It also isn't very stroller friendly as there are stairs throughout the restaurant. 

That being said, the staff were so friendly and accommodating which quickly put all my worries aside. At each set of stairs there was a staff member waiting to help with the stroller, which isn't something you always encounter in the city. 

The whole entire back room of the restaurant was set aside for our group of 7 and our strollers, our server was friendly and attentive, and my meal (goat cheese quiche with arugula salad) was tasty. 

I will definitely be returning to this restaurant again and would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a young family."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this place, it delivers every time! Le Select is definitely on our regular brunch rotation, and it should be on yours. 

The ambience, food quality, and the perfect fall-back spot for last minute brunch plans, this resto is one of my favourite in the city. Another huge plus - online brunch reservations! It absolutely beats waiting in line for hours just to get some decent grub. 

For brunch, I automatically go to the French Toast with a side foie gras. It's excessive I know, but it's fantastic! Can't go wrong with the Croque-Madame, or anything else on the menu for that matter. They also have excellent croissants, from Rahier bakery.

Go Now!"}
{"text":"Good -
1. takes reservation for brunch
2. offers free parking at the rear - FREE parking at downtown location!!
3. beautiful decor and lovely patio. You will feel like being in Paris
4. offers kids meal
5. price is right
6. food was tasty

Bad -
1. Service was rush. It may be one particular wait staff; he was so rush and made us feel like being in a fast food restaurant. He asked the adults if we wanted coffee but ignored the younger (teens) in the group.

I may give Le Bistro another try, and hope we will get a better service next time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite French restaurant in the city!  It's a hidden gem because of it's location. But that means we have free parking in the city!  Once you step in you entered a bistro in Paris.  The servers all speak French (and English), there's French songs in the background, the seatings, bar etc all make it very French to start with.

The food is great! I especially love the seared fois gras and the cold fois gras terrain.  The cheese board is better than a lot of places.  The service is casual and warm kind of food service. Price is not marked as high as other fancy location restaurants, it's a good deal for this quality of food! 

This is a place I keep returning for many years."}
{"text":"My actual rating is 4.5.

I had a chance to have lunch today at Le Select.  Instantly, I liked the place.  It felt spacious yet still had some elements of classic bistro charm without being gimmicky.  And I'm feeling the location;  I would like to go back in the summer and try their patio.

I shared the gravlax and tartare for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious, but so rich!  This should have prepared me for the next round!  My Croque Monsieur was decadence defined!  There was so much yummy melted cheese that I could only handle half of the sandwich... and the frites were great too, but again, I had to doggy bag some.  From what I saw, no one can accuse Le Select of being tight on portions!  

Four of us shared a bottle of Chianti ($55) which we all enjoyed, but it was a tough decision with such an extensive wine list.

I want to return very soon for dinner and try out some of the other amazing dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to a birthday party...beautiful separate room with garden patio.  Excellent food and service.  Saw a  hugh wine cellar in the basement.  If you want European and French cuisine...you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 star!

Le Select Bistro feels a little bit off the beaten path as it's hidden away down the \"quiet-ish\" side of Wellington street (east of Spadina). They have a lovely tree-lined patio and a fairly spacious interior. 

They have some amazing tables at the back which fit two people in a half-circle shaped booth with a small round table. Very intimate and absolutely perfect for a romantic date.

The menu had every single one of my favourite French dishes and it was hard choosing just one. I ended up picking the Boullabaisse, which is a soup with mixed seafood. It had a really delicious tomato-based broth which was different than when I've normally had this dish, but it was a nice change. It came topped with rouille (mayo based sauce) on toasted bread slices. A perfect dish.

The wine list at this place is somewhat ridiculous; so big that it even has an index page at the beginning. Apparently they also have a corkage fee of $18 if you BYOW, which seems quite reasonable.

They have a prix fixe but the options were very limited (choice of 2 apps, 2 mains). 

Service was a B+"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will have to ruin this streak of exceptional reviews. My wife and I have walked by this place many times and it is usually always busy around dinner time. The fact that they name their chef on the menu gives the indication that food will be expensive, but should have delicious flavours.

On their menu they had some items that were framed, indicating that they are a recommended dish. The appetizer was sow's ear, and the main dish was beef tripe. I figured I'd be a little adventurous and give them a shot. The ear was deep fried and cut up so it didn't look like an ear. I would compare the taste of it to a chewier deep fried bacon. There is nothing \"gross\" about the plate, so you could give it a shot. My dinner dish I really didn't like.  Tripe is actually part of the stomach (which I didn't know before hand), and I found this to be very fatty. There seemed to be more fat than meat. I have no doubt this is how it should be but I cannot stand fatty meat. That one is my bad.

My wife went with the price fix menu which included a salad, mushroom risotto and desert. For dinner they have this deal for $35 and in between lunch and dinner they have this same deal for $20. On their online menu it states the $20 and when we got there we found out the real price. My wife really liked the risotto except for the black hair that came with it from the kitchen (and neither my wife or I have black hair). This hair wasn't noticed until after a few forkfuls, and when we alerted the waiter he took the dish back to be replaced. What ticks me off is the fact that she didn't get her meal again until mine was done, and all they did was replace the dish. For that kind of money and the inconvenience of eating together yet separately, I felt some other sort of compensation was warranted (like a free desert). But all we got was an apology and a new plate. I'm not one to raise a stink because it's not the waiter's fault, but I was expecting more.

I would like to give this place another shot to give it a better review when I actually order something I would like, but I can't get over the hair in the risotto."}
{"text":"The reputation  of this \"bistro\" in Toronto has turned it into a place where I would probably never go back. Food is ok, with some pseudo-French creations (I never found or heared about cretes de coq in Paris) but is not transcendent at all. Overall, everything was globally tasting too flat to me (apart from the chocolate mousse, really good - even though more creamy than fluffy). 

Also and importantly, I was really disappointed by the pushy service/waiters (only few speaking French by the way), who want you to take the priciest of everything, from still water (big Evian bottle rather than tap water, Perrier 1 liter bottle instead of 30 cl) to wine glasses or desert. Such a behaviour spoils if not ruins the ambiance. And do not expect any of the 6 or so waiters to greet you with a goodbye when leaving, despite the expensive bill and even a good tip.

Overrated to me. Had better meals and much bettter experiences in Le Paradis or Tati."}
{"text":"Well ... overall a worthwhile experience.  The wine list is very extensive with choices from many countries, types and all price ranges.  
The seating was a bit too close for my taste, and not as intimite/private as it could've been.
We ordered a NY strip and rissoto as mains and they were both good.  Not great.  Just good.  The portions and sides were quite small ... and I'm a big dude, and was damn hungry ... so sure my 8oz steak went down fine, but the accompanying beans and potatoes were just not quite enough.
Not overpriced, otherwise I'd be writing a very bad review.  Moderately priced ... so an OK experience overall.  If you're 60+ and/or french ... this is the place!  lol."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite place in the city for french bistro. If you are a fan of french cooking because you appreciate the art of making a good classical french sauce, this place should do. Is it michelin? No but I have brought my family and friends here on numerous occasion because they do the basics like the confit and bourguignon better than a lot of places that I have been to with that controversial 3-star rating system that Toronto restaurants will probably never gather enough attention to earn. They introduced and made me fall in love with the cassoulet (I'm a meat lover) especially in combination with the wine offerings available which is impressive to say the least. Want to impress someone on a first date but don't quite want that auberge over-the-top type atmosphere but still want to eat a meal I'm sure will at least put a smile on Keller? La select will do. Having said that, no need to try their special event (i.e. valentines) menus, just stick to a la carte because quite frankly, their bone marrow is bigger than black hoofs and you're gonna miss it ordering their prix fixe."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving weekend, we wanted to have Sunday brunch at Casa Loma.  However, that brunch was completely sold out when we got around to calling for reservations.  After I got the bad news, I went to the interwebs and looked for a few Sunday brunch restaurants with fabulous reviews.  Le Select was on my list of choices and a local we met on Saturday recommended as well.  Le Select is was!
Reservations were not necessary, but I would recommend them just in case.  The restaurant was fairly full when we arrived and I was fairly hungover.  The last thing anyone wants while they're hungover is to stand waiting for a table watching other people eat.  Make reservations if you can.
The restaurant is very bistro.  Small tables and we were cozied up fairly close to our neighboring diners.  We started with mimosas and I had a most delicious latte.  My hangover thanked me greatly for those two.  Service was fairly slow between bringing our drinks and taking our order.  A couple times I asked my friend if he thought our server quit or was taking his lunch break.  Once he finally returned, we ordered the pain dor aux pommes (French toast) and the eufs benedicte (eggs Benedict).  
The food came fairly quickly after we ordered.  My French toast was out of this world!  It was a thick piece of bread filled with apples and cranberries.  Honestly, I ordered because we were trying to embrace Canada during our trip and it said Canadian maple syrup.  I'm so happy I did.  I'm not into sweet dishes for breakfast, but this wasn't too sweet.  The fruit and syrup tasted fresh with a natural amount of sweetness to it.  I didn't try my friend's eggs, but they looked great. 
What a wonderful breakfast spot.  One of the gems of our trip.
There are plenty of parking spots, which is rare in the city.  We walked over rather than drive because we figured we wouldn't find parking.  It helped to walk off the hangover, though."}
{"text":"This place is great! They accommodate for large group functions and the vibes are very calm and cozy.  Great for date night and great for fancy and special events. It's a pretty penny but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"was missing paris today and had a serious hankering for a good cassoulet! We made reservations and headed down for dinner! We ordered 2 beers and I ordered the cassoulet and my fiance ordered the steak tartare with frites. We were served warm fresh bread with butter. I love warm bread! Service wasn't exceptioally friendly but it was warm. Serv er was helpful with any questions we had but had that sort of reserved french way of being. Our mains came fairly quicky and portions were perfect! My cassoulet was better than the one in paris. So creamy and warm, hearty... It was perfect!!! My fiance's steak tartare was also very good but not as good as the steak tartare in france. He especially enjoyed the frites! Overall we enjoyed our meal and will defoinately come back next time we reminisce about france and the food! :)"}
{"text":"Le Select Bistro

- Late Night Prix Fixe ($20) means Value

- Steak Frites and Creme Brulee  

- Yelper friends meeting up after an Elite Event

- My 2000th review

I been wanting to go to Le Select Bistro for their Late Night Prix Fixe for the longest time. Steak after 10 pm, might not be for everyone... but for me a deal is a deal, I can eat anytime of the day....

After the Elite Party, my Yelp ladies asked where are we going for after party snack... I knew I want to go to Le Select Bistro, but would they come or would they enjoy that? 

Steak Frites, Risotto, Creme Brulee. Dark Chocolate Mousse all made an enjoyable experience... Portions were perfect, I was satisfied but not stuffed!

Bistro vibe was cozy, intimate and casual at the same time. We would have kept chatting through the night if not because it was close to midnight and I don't want to be stuck on the Night bus again...

I'll be back.... I just could not pass up a deal...."}
{"text":"Favorite brunch spot in Toronto. Their croque madame and croissant are really really good. I tried their quiche last time that was very moist and soft - it was quite egg intensive so depending on what time of quiche you like. I thought it was pretty good. Their fries are very delicious too. Lamb burger tastes a little like kebab so it's very interesting to eat it - I felt like I was eating kebab in a burger bun :) cool ambience, casual, can be loud but I didn't mind. Very nice patio to sit outside but in the front and back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here. Nice environment and service. Coffee and the French beer Kronenbourg didn't taste good. The Choucroute garnie does not worth the price. Millet Risotto was OK. In general, I think this place is overpriced for the food quality."}
{"text":"Located on Wellington, with other residential and office buildings, it appeared hidden in the dark. Due to the fall season, the patio area was closed. My friend got a small table near the window for this Parisian style restaurant. I was surprised that the kitchen is located on the basement, open concept for you to view all the cooks; everyone wore white. At one point, someone was yelling the orders like Gordon Ramsay from Hell's Kitchen. That was cool to see and hear. 

The washrooms are located together and one must share the sink with the other gender. Reminded me of my time in Paris, France. It was clean! 

Happy:  I got a three-course meal. I started with soup of the day which was a parsnip and potato purée and it came hot. It was the right texture. Creme brûlée was the choice for dessert and it was soft and sweet. I was too full to finish everything. 

Not happy:  For the entree, I had the duck confit with minimal veggies. The potatoes were interesting as it was finely sliced and stacked up like a lasagna. Cut into a triangle for uniqueness. The duck leg had enough meat for me but too bad it was salty. 

Verdict:  The waitress was very attentive and respectful. The meals came at a reasonable time. By the time we left, the place was packed, but we weren't rushed out. I would go back for another celebration to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Nothing in Toronto makes you feel like you are about to step into a busy Fouquet's cafe on the Champs Elysees like pushing the door open at Le Select. By the time you're done and out on the street you can't help but think about whether your next trip to Europe should connect in Paris.

Go for the omelette. Even their basic one will have Madame Mallory smiling.
Their salad vinaigrettes and the mushroom risotto: chapeau bas !

In another cafe, on a noisier street, and one that serves American-sized orange juices, I'd stand up and give the server an earful for depriving my table of forks and knives for 7 minutes, but this is Le Select. And it is exempt. Because Toronto could learn a thing or two about how breakfast is enjoyed."}
{"text":"There is a certain standard you expect when you hear about nicer restaurants such as this but I can say none of my standards were met.

Went with a group of 4 people for dinner. 

The restaurant looked approx 80% full, no large parties were dining and it was still extremely loud. I even noticed that the music sounded like it was competing with the noise of the guests. My step mother had a migraine after our night spent here.

The service was friendly but very sparse. Our waiter was not attentive after our entire group was seated and we waited a half hour before we were visited by him to place our orders. The waiter also accidentally served my sister club soda instead of sprite which we had to wait 20 minutes to get it exchanged because of lack of his attention. We also had dirty appetizer dishes on our table throughout our main course when they should have been removed.

Ordered at the table:
-Chicken: simple meal, no complaints, decent sized chicken thigh
-Duck and fries: the fries were very thin and sad looking and didn't taste like anything special. The duck was seasoned well, portion was smaller than the chicken.
-Beef bourguignon: a staple meal in France and disappointing that this French bistro could not meet my standards. The beef was over cooked and a little tough. It did not at all resemble the \"slowly braised\" description on the menu. The cut of beef was fatty and a lot of it went to waste. As well the beef did not have as much flavour as other bourguignons I have tasted. I would not recommend this meal.

Overall it was a difficult meal because of the lack of attention from our server. I did not enjoy my meal but from the single bite I had from other plates the meals tasted reasonable. The restaurant was given 2 stars for these reasons:

1) the service, however non-existent, was friendly
2) we got a free glass of wine because the waiter forgot to charge us"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice when I was visiting Toronto for three days. I fell in love with their white fish terrine. I used to eat foi gras terrine until I learned how foi gras was made, so I stopped. I think the white fish terrine is the better alternative, and it's actually my first time eating white fish terrine. Absolutely love it. However, the sandwich here is just meh."}
{"text":"Dined here for a late lunch on a Thursday, party of 2. Free parking at the rear of the building was great! 
Service: Reservations with special requests can be made online which is helpful. We were greeted and seated promptly, at our selection of near the fire place which made for a cozy romantic setting. Our server was friendly and quick service (this was a quieter time of the day). 

Food: Great selection of wines!! as well as beers. They serve warm soft ciabatta bread which was quite yummy while waiting for our food. One negative was that the dish of the day was sold out already so we didn't get to try the ravioli. I had the beef cheek (boeuf bourguignon). It wasn't a huge portion, maybe it was  lunched sized but really got two chunks of meat which I found to be overly marbled with fat (this might be the way beef cheek is but it was too much fat for me, I had to scrape it out). Overall the dish was tasty especially the red wine braise. The veggies  served with it was also very scamp, I was looking forward to the button mushrooms but there were only two in my dish. Mainly portion size was a downer. I ordered a side of frites ($4.50 for a side is a little steep) which were crispy and tasty. 

My date got the 'bavette aux echalotes' basically a 5oz steak with caramelized , shallots served with fries. After trying both dishes, in our opinions this was definitely the better dish in taste. It was cooked perfectly and the shallots on top were perfectly caramelized and tasted good! 

For dessert: chocolate cake, not my liking, but the passion fruit ice cream and fruit served with it added the sweetness needed to cut the bitterness of the cocoa. 

Overall, worth visiting for a nice lunch or dinner out. I would be interested to visit again to try other dishes as another patron raved about the lamb and steak with peppercorn. In our opinion if these dishes were served for dinner with the increased dinner prices this would have been a great disappointment, but maybe the dinner servings are bigger portions! We'll just have to visit again to see!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! We had a large party for a special event and Le Select was able to accommodate us in every way.

Meal: I had the lamb burger with fries which at first glance I thought was a small burger but it was very filling. I was very satisfied with the meal selection and the menu had a huge range of French dishes to try. I also tried the bone marrow appetizer and the charcuterie. Both were delicious although on the heavier side.

 All in all, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Food and drink: I loved the goat cheese quiche. The crust was buttery and thin, and the quiche was creamy and fluffy - there was tons of goat cheese and butter but somehow I still walked away feeling light. The arugula salad on the side was a perfect balance to the richness of the tart, with very fresh greens and a simple, light dressing on top. The drip coffee was also delicious and they were prompt at refilling our cups.

Service and atmosphere: I love that you can make reservations for weekend brunch. I requested a seat in their backroom because of the height of the ceilings, the sun that streams in from their floor-to-ceiling windows, and the patio that it overlooks in the back. Interesting french-inspired decor on the walls too"}
{"text":"We came here for a work lunch. The ambiance is pretty nice, very Parisian. My biggest disappointment with Le Select was the lack of service. There were a number of people standing around doing nothing and we were waiting for our order to be taken. It was at least 15 minutes between being seated and taking our order. We were given once piece of bread while we waited another 30-40 minutes for our food to arrive. Granted, the short ribs that I ordered was delicious. The co-workers who ordered the risotto were disappointed in how salty it was."}
{"text":"Delicious. 
As you walk in you already feel the quality. Great lighting and furniture. You feel like you are in a modern bistro on Champs-Élysées.
Le Select takes pride in every dish. From a simple onion soup to a well prepared duck. I don't live in Toronto... but this will be my first stop upon my return. Try the Duck Confit - you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"French food in Toronto!! Yay!

I wish I could say I liked the food, but I am not sure. I always like trying new things so it was worth it. Food was so exotic minus the soup.

I got the soup of the day, it was smooth and creamy and good. Moving onto the main course began the start of my exotic adventure. I wish I could remember the menu item names.. too French-y.

Waitress was really nice and made the dinner very pleasant. In a very good mood, I was happy to order desert. Got the glace et sorbet... and was shocked to find the taste pretty exotic as well. I will have to come back here again and try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Loved this place!
We came here for a birthday celebration, and the restaurant kindly offered us free desserts on the house! They even thoughtfully wrote \"Happy birthday\" on the plate, which was a nice touch.
Besides the free desserts, the food itself was excellent. Both my French onion soup and escargot vol-au-vent were delicious! My friend had the steak frites, which was cooked perfectly and accompanied by a delicious peppercorn sauce. The fries were also very tasty."}
{"text":"UPDATE: No more Stuffed French toast !?  this made me really sad. The online menu apparently is outdated. Which is why I removed a star....Please bring it back!!!!!



Excellent food and service. The waitress had such great attention to every detail. The bouillabaisse was different from what we had expected but it in a good way :) (though I wish they put a bit more seafood and and a bigger scallop, instead of teeny one...) 

Was very impressed with the ingredients here. The unsalted butter was extremely fresh and creamy and the risotto (we requested it to have less cheese) was not too cheesy and perfectly brothed. You can tell they are careful with sourcing the ingredients as the veggies were extremely fresh and tasty. 

Dessert was something we weren't planning to have but could not resist the lychee sorbet, passion fruit and brandy infused ice cream all made in-house. 

I will definitely be back very soon. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"One of the finest French bistros in the city. Perfect in every way. Decor. Food. Service. Great patio in good weather. Cozy atmosphere on wintry days.

My only concern would be, can they survive now that the Globe and Mail has moved from across Wellington Street to King Street East?

Perhaps the burgeoning tech scene in the area will replace columnists and publishers. Let's hope."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was for Mother's Day brunch. The food was pricey but amazing quality. 

Getting there by car wasn't the easiest to get to and a lot of traffic in the area. Free parking spots in the rear but tight and limited. 

The setting is small French bistro style. 

The food: white fish terrine, beet risotto, and french toast stuff with apple and cranberry. The white fish terrine was smooth and favourful and the brrad was nice and soft. First time having risotto with beets so it turned out red but it works and taste good (very filling). Normally I am not a fan of french toast but I gave this a pass and I would recommend it (it is on their regular menu). 

Overall good impression."}
{"text":"I love the French food here. We had some great Champagne, bread, foie gras, charcuterie, steak, and confit de canard. The service was great. The whole place makes you feel like as though you were in Paris. Rumor has it that they do have one of the largest wine selections in Toronto in their wine cellar."}
{"text":"I'm starting to feel that I am out of my element.
Many things that I think are great get crummy reviews by people on Yelp, and the stuff that I think is crap everyone else seems to love.
Ah well, for what it's worth...  I was quite disappointed with Le Select Bistro...
I lived in Montreal for a few years and the notion of a \"French\" Bistro was never thought of as something that is exclusive by any means.
I was really looking forward to this place as I had heard so many great things about it.  This is always a dangerous thing as your expectations become unrealistic, but if I had never heard anything about this place I know that I can safely say that this place is not what it claims to be.
French bistro?  Neah, not really.
First of all, for the starter I ordered the bean and bacon soup.  Seriously, a tin of Campbell's has more on this place.  Or just as much anyway.  It was decent enough but a sprinkle of cheese in the middle of the bowl just won't do it for me.
Since the best bistros that I have been to over the years are known for the steak-frite, this is exactly what I was dying to try at this place and so this is what I ordered for my main.  
The steak itself was as tough as leather and was totally overcooked (I ordered it medium), but that wasn't the worst part...  They coated the whole piece of meat in a goopy sludge of caramelized onions which had the texture of instant onion soup mix and molasses.  The main problem with this was that the taste of these onions was so sweet and potent that it totally overpowered and ruined the steak.  All you could taste were these saucy onions, which tasted awful as they were.  I ended up scraping the huge amount of caramelized onions off the steak altogether only to find that the steak itself had no flavour anyway.  I have had a better steak at Applebee's in the States for a quarter of the price.  The frits served with the steak were overdone and a little burnt and the whole experience was actually pathetic.  I can think of a few places where you could place this restaurant and watch it go out of business in one week.
Best part of the meal was the crème brulee.  Wow!  They actually got something right!  But by the end of the meal it was just too little too late.
The ambiance is the one thing that this place has going for it but I would really have a hard time justifying a return visit to this place."}
{"text":"Amazing on all fronts.

I came here for a dear friend's post-Bachelorette brunch.

ATMOSPHERE: Super classy. Gorgeous. Spacious. Old time, regal vibe here.  Perfect for special occasion, hanging out with girlfriends or bring a date. In terms of attire, lots of people were dressed up, but many were casual - in jeans and t-shirt. All were fine. There are lots of different dining rooms & spaces available too - so make requests for a particular space if you wish. Some are quite closed-off so it's nice for private functions. We were seated in the lovely back patio, on a sunny afternoon. Twas perfect.

SERVICE: Good service. Courteous and friendly staff. Made good recommendations.

PRICE: Average. Totally worth it for the quality of food, service, and beautiful space.

FOOD: Great presentation, fair portions, and tasty! Everyone in our party of 7 ordered vastly different things, and everything was perfect.



Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This old boy has been around for as long as I can remember. Originally with it's Parisian patio sticking out on Queen W and now tucked away on lovely Wellington St, it's still as delicious as ever, and the inside (and outside!) are oh-so French and oh-so beautiful. A true, buttery French experience in downtown Toronto is always welcome. 

On a date night recently we enjoyed the rose and cab by the glass, the French onion soup, the steak tartar and the pate. We had over eaten at the movie we'd seen immediately before, but we are already plotting our return for the steak and duck. 

Merci, Le Select."}
{"text":"Let me say. I LOVE steak. So when friend Sarah l. said, \"hey lets get a steak at 10:30 cuz this place sells it for 20 dollars, with dessert or an app at a certain time each night.\" i said, \" YES!\"

And to my amazement it was a beautiful Le Select. Granted this place is a fine dining restaurant and super nice, it's older location on queen was so much nicer and personal! This new location is a bit more umm.. adelaideish.

That aside. steak is delicious. specially when it's late at night, after drinking lots.

I recommend it during cheap prix fix hours!

And more so during the summer."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a bunch of family members the other day.  I saw them when I walked in, so didn't bother telling the hostesses that I didn't need help with seating (since I didn't), and when I walked by they looked very confused/concerned by my apparent act of rebellion.  They even stared at me for a few minutes after I sat down.  As a former hostess myself, I would like to send them \"don't worry about it, dudes!\" vibes.

Anyway our server (guy with brown hair) was super helpful, friendly, attentive, etc.

I ordered the most ground-breaking and daring thing on the menu - the croque-monsieur.  

YUM IN MY TUM

I like cheese and bread and ham, I also like cheese when it's mating with ham between an envelopment of bread.  And then I like cheese when it's melted on top of the previously mentioned orgy.  That's what they gave me, along with way too many skinny (tasty) fries.  

The couple next to me laughed when I stuck my butt in their faces to get out for a few minutes (close-seating), so the accompanying clientèle were great in my books.  

I will return here, it's just down the street and I like cheese and I want MOAR"}
{"text":"Le Select Bistro is so good that I actually invited my mom in law, trying to impress her with the best Toronto places. Should I say more?

Well, I guess I can add some more details...

Excellent service. They know what they are doing and love that.

Excellent food. Reasonably authentic (though who am I to judge), impressive quality.

Very nice ambient, love it.

So why 4 stars?

Price-to-portion-size relationship. It is wrong, sorry. I am not saying that such a great food served in such a wonderful environment by such a professional folks should be cheap. Not at all. However, I strongly feel that main platter should fill me better than a starter. Otherwise it's like paying for a car to get a bicycle - not quite even.

Otherwise, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner at 7:30pm with a reservation and was seated promptly. Our waitress came right away and got us our drinks. We ordered the bison steak tartare. I've never had steak tartare before but I have some damn high expectations now since this was absolutely so tasty and very well seasoned. The seasoning didn't overwhelm and brought the taste and texture of the bison out. It was garnished with crushed pistachios and came with a plate of fries. These fries were DA BOMB. OMG. They were like McDonald's fries but 100 times better because, you know, they were real potatoes...

We also got the charcuterie platter that had assorted cured meats such as in house smoked ham, salami, pates, and they gave us a jar of small pickles that they make in house and it was awesome.

I ordered the roasted fresh Alberta leg of lamb with a lemon and rosemary jus. It was super tasty but for $34.95 I was like \"oh...\" You get what you pay for. It came with very delicious potatoes and veggies. I was very satisfied.

My friends all got the 8 oz centre cut steak filet with a green peppercorn sauce with Brandy and cream with fries ($29.95). If you thought the fries were da bomb, this sauce that came with their steaks was AH-MAY-ZING! Exclaimation point and everything. They all asked for more sauce. I don't believe we were charged extra.

We were all feeling gluttonous so desserts it is! We all got ourselves a creme brulee. Oh my word, this was fantastic. So thick. It was $11.95 each.

If I had all the monies in the world, this is one of the places I would go to on a regular basis. I absolutely love this place. My bill with my friend came up to around $125. Pricey but so worth it."}
