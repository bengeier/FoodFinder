{"text":"I'mma be real here.. there's no better pho between Scarborough and York region than this place. I review one or two places a year on Yelp cuz i ain't got time for this.. but here I am writing my second(!) review of this place 8 months later. 

First off can I just say if you're worried about the decor or servers who don't speak perfect English, or want to substitute beef for bean curd (huhh??? C'mon now........) you got your? pho priorities all wrong. 

Here's how it is: These legit Viet folks make a deep, savoury and complex broth that's not oily and they don't use msg so you can drink that bowl up. They use thin rice noodles not Chinese hofun, and are generous with the meat- which comes tender and fresh. Plus they got that pickled garlic on the table that goes oh so well with the srirarcha and hoisin. Simple and delicious. What the hell else you want from a pho place???

Whoever says this joint is just another Scarborough pho place does not understand pho. Even my kids who we drag around the city trying different pho places ask to come back here, which we do once a month at minimum. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The place is dimly lit and the decor could be updated. The restaurant is never packed, which could be a good thing or a bad thing. The food is decent and the prices are fair. Not a fan of the \"self-serve\" utensils from a hygiene and cleanliness perspective. Service is generally good."}
{"text":"New management is amazing , I recommend you go again if you think it's like the old one... I used to come here either way, but it Def got better , I had to comment to support..."}
{"text":"I was sceptical at first, but definitely a great little shop with a great menu of dishes to try. I came in with my sister to try the pho. And I have to say, we were thoroughly impressed. I had the rare beef with beef ball pho. Would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place for Vietnamese food! I'm glad I found this place ,their fried spring roll(yam)is to die for,basil wrapped in meat ,fresh rolls ,viet coffee are some of my favorite .Every time I try something new ,they never disappoint .Ask the server for recommendation ! A must try place"}
{"text":"This is my \"Go To\" Pho restaurant. I have tried several different Pho dishes at this location and I have not been disappointed yet. The portion sizes are great (maybe a little too much for me), the staff are friendly, service is fast, and the atmosphere is enjoyable.

The spring rolls are also excellent. I was quite surprised at the presentation of the spring rolls when I first ordered them. 

I have yet to eat a large bowl of Pho and a side of spring rolls yet.

Take the advice from someone who has visited Pho restaurants from here to Hamilton and try this location. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place used to be Pho 88. The food is mediocre, definitely not as good as it was when it was Pho 88. We went as a group of 10 so we ordered quite a bit to share. Some foods were alright. I wasn't particular happy when we ordered the platter (the one where you make your own rice rolls) and it came with only 4 rice papers. There was a good amount of food like meat, veggies and vermicelli but 4 rice papers?? I think the waiters heard me surprise and ended up giving us another 2 but that was it.

So I would say service is good but food is either average or slightly below in my opinion compared to other places."}
{"text":"tried their house special pho.  portion is decent but lacks quite a bit of flavour. might be good for health conscious crowd who wants less salt, but not up to expectation for a pho soup base."}
{"text":"Used to be pho88 for years! This new place is nice.... Portion is good with excellent service! I prefer this over Kim bo anytime!"}
{"text":"this was suggested to me,
the service was ok nothing out of the ordinary 
we ordered 2 xl soup and they were a good size
however the soup was on the bland side,

we also ordered vermiceli with grilled chicken and spring roll, portion of the chicken coukd have been better but overall not too bad

spring rolls, this was highly suggested
and i did like that they use a different wrapper
however it was just ok, the springrolls were big
but the taste was just ok,  

overall the experience was just ok"}
{"text":"From start to finish I loved this place! Friendly staff. Great spring rolls. Bun was awesome. Lot's of food! Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Had a wonder-pho meal!! Pho w/ beef tripe, tendon, rare beef, and an aesthetic atmosphere for only 7.25 a bowl is the best combo! 
The owner checks on tables himself and he cares greatly about his customers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the regular pho with all the toppings. It had good amount of meat as well as broth to go with the noodles. I liked the mild broth that did not taste oily. The servers were responsive and helpful. Considering the price and the quality of food, I would recommend it to others. I would love to come back."}
{"text":"Fast service, great pho. That's all I ever wanted in a pho restaurant. 
Oh and avocado milkshakes of course but... maybe not here. Instead I like to get the fried tofu and spring rolls!! The springs rolls are a work of art and they are really big.
I honestly always come here."}
{"text":"Went back for the grilled beef and spring roll combo. Was really yummmmmy! The spring roll is a really generous size and the noodles are perfect consistency! 

I'll come back next time and let you guys know how their rice dishes go too!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night with outside temperature hover around -15c. Good occasion for a hot bowl of pho. Ordered the P01 signature pho, a standard to compare to all other pho restaurants. The broth was light & flavourful.,..good noodle:meat ratio. The fried spring roll was the best I've ever had ...beautiful presentation and a must order! Service was wonderful which is refreshing for an Asian restaurant. Owner is very friendly with a very interesting background with great knowledgeable of the business....requested our feedback on the food with complimentary chocolate mousse dessert that was a real treat. 
No plastic bowls/plates!!  
Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"After spending the entire day at the zoo to bid the pandas farewell, I found myself at this restaurant trying the sweet and sour fish soup my friend recommended a dozen times.

The soup was a tad bit on the sour side for me, but it was loaded with all the right ingredients and the pieces of fish were fresh and cooked perfectly. This item is a popular authentic Vietnamese dish which does not frequent on many menus. It's worth a definitely try, if you're interested in trying something different.

Pho on the other hand was mediocre, wouldn't come here to get my pho-fix."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bun bo hue. Flavours are all there, taste authentic and spicy enough to my liking. I have never tried their pho before but I was told it's really yummy as well. Portions are huge as well and the owner is super friendly. I just wish they didn't close so early!"}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade)
The spring rolls were very unexpectedly charming! The pho itself was more or less like any other pho places, but the snacks here are definitely worth checking out! The shrimp rolls had some extra greens in it compared to other Vietnamese places that give it a nice twist (though my siblings didn't like this slight additions, I felt that it was refreshing). The shrimp on sugar cane came with a side of veggies, which complemented it REALLY well -- the greens offset the savouriness and oil in the deep fried dish well. In general, what really gave the sides an extra \"mph\" compared with other Vietnamese places was the side of greens and the general harmony of the tastes each dish delivered. The sides themselves were already above par in tastes, and the extra garnishes they put there gave it both aesthetic and culinary taste.

Ambiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)
There wasn't much to say about the general ambiance-- step in and you expect it to be just like any other Vietnamese restaurant. It was obvious that they didn't really try to win customers over with superior interior decor. They did, however, fulfilled the norms by keeping the place clean-- even the seafood sauce and sriracha sauce squirt bottles didn't have and sauce residue on them (which was nice to see, because having a chunk of dried sauce on the tip of the squirt-er always looks nasty).

Service 3/5 (15% of final grade)
We were promptly seated as soon as we got in, and there were already menus on the table, so we didn't have to wait for them to bring us menus. Tea was also very quickly put onto the table for us when the lady server left a pencil and a page and told us to fill it in ourselves (which was, in my opinion, better, because I could take as much time as I liked figuring out what to order). When I asked the lady about what the \"three coloured ice\" drink was, she readily described it and recommended this supposedly popular drink. The best thing was that she didn't have an attitude like you would see in most east-Asian establishments. Sure, she wasn't totally enthusiastic about the dishes, but she did have a tone of patience in her voice, which is nice.

Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade)
For the quality and taste of the food, this place was very reasonable! I went with my two siblings who eat a lot. We each got a drink and ordered 3 sides and a large pho to share. Everything costed us a little over $40 (tips and tax included) for lunch. I wanted to try more foods, so $40 was actually more than necessary, so if you just wanted to grab a cheap eat with a friend, an XL pho under $10 would easily hit the spot ;)

Other 3/5 (10% of final grade)
Brownie points round! When we walked in there was a boy around 12-13 years old who really expertly asked us how many people we had and directed us to a table. The lack of inhibition and gracefulness he had was very awesome for his age. Props to the little guy helping out his family restaurant during his summer vacation!

Final Grade = 63.5/100 = 3 Stars, easily!

TLDR: Definitely a place I would go back to for the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered the beef brisket stew, in an effort to break out of my habitual order of house pho. 

The dish featured a savoury tomato based broth with tender chunks of beef brisket. 

Overall my taste buds were very satisfied from beginning to end. I would recommend this dish to anyone looking for a more rich, tangy and tamarindy broth."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place. The staff, especially the owner, are quite friendly. The food comes out in a timely manner. My favourite soup which I always order is called \"Pho Dac Biet Vuon Lao\" which comes with a variety of beef types. My only critique would be that I  wish it came with more meat. But for the price, it's understandable. Honestly though, the broth is delicious and it comes with good portion of noodles and broth, even in the small size. 
The com suon bi, which is grilled pork chop with rice was declious. The pork was flavourful and tender. The rice was also good but it was ordinary. The sauce they give to accompany the rice is great! It adds flavour to the rice.
The fresh spring rolls are delicious! I typically go for the fresh shrimp or fresh sausage spring rolls. A delicious and unique appetizer is called \"Banh Dap\" which is a deep fried shrimp cracker with noodles and grilled pork. It is so tasty! I highly recommend it. It comes with 10 so you are getting a reasonable portion for the cost. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. The food is delicious, the service is great."}
{"text":"Pho is easily our favourite winter meal. Having tried pho in all different cities including London, Hong Kong and several in Canada, this is easily the BEST pho we have ever had. Chef told us he uses on top quality veal bones for the broth which clearly makes all the difference!
Service is excellent as well! 
Do try this spot!"}
{"text":"Rare beef pho was ruined with jasmine and the broth was plain we also ordered spring rolls tasted like they were frozen and beef balls too"}
{"text":"I honestly thought this would turn out to be just like all the other pho places in Scarborough (disappointing), but this place is clean, they are always attentive and working, and their portions are decent as well as the cuts in beef - there's no fat and the broth isn't bubbly. My friend even commented that the avocado milkshake was really good, so thumbs up. 

Would recommend and come back here again."}
{"text":"Their food is good! I got the Vermicelli with Beef, Meatballs, and Spring Rolls, Mango Slush, and the Lemongrass Chicken with Rice. All our dishes were good and hit the spot.

The only thing Is that their portions are smaller than average but it isn't anything too dramatic. 

Service was very good and would come back!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch.  Was pleasantly surprised.

Decor is still the same as previous? restaurant it looks like.

Food quality was very good.   Ordered P01 - pho special (L).   You get quite the big portion here.   Broth was fairly good, very fresh tasting .  The highlight was the meat.   This is very good quality beef especially for pho.   I was quite impressed.   

I think I have found my new pho spot.   I also got a spring roll (very nice presentation.  See picture).    Was very full after the meal and quite satisfied.  

Price is very reasonable.   Definitely going back"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my parents and we really enjoyed it. They have such a variety of authentic Vietnamese dishes, and everything we tried was delicious.

The owner, Thanh, greeted us and he was very friendly and welcoming. He made great recommendations, and I really appreciated his honesty in suggesting that I get a small when I ordered a large (noodle soup). Their portions are very generous and I was thoroughly satisfied with a small; a large would have been too much for me.

We started with spring rolls (the menu says 2 rolls for $5.95, but the 2 rolls were equivalent in size to 4 normal rolls). The spring rolls were among the best I've ever had. The wrapper was the authentic Vietnamese rice paper kind and not the wheat-based kind. The filling had taro, carrots, cabbage, mung beans, pork and vermicelli. The presentation was also beautiful. They were cut on a bias and placed in a crispy edible shell. I would definitely order this again and again.

I got the small Hu Tieu My Tho ($7.50), which is a soup from the Vietnamese city of My Tho which typically has tapioca noodles, shrimp, and pork. The broth was delicious. It was very fragrant and I loved the fried onions in it. I think they also fried the ground pork before putting it in the soup which gave it a nice crunchy texture. The tapioca noodles were really chewy, just the way I like them. I was told they get them from Japan. The pork slices were too fatty for my liking, but I know many people like it that way. I was also a bit disappointed that I only got 1 shrimp and only 1 fish ball, but for the price, I can't complain much. The shrimp was a good size and the fish ball was tasty. Overall, I did enjoy my meal a lot.

My mom had the small Bun Bo Hue ($7.95), which is a noodle soup from the Vietnamese city of Hue that typically has round rice noodles, beef slices, pork hocks, and Vietnamese sausage. She really enjoyed her meal too. 

My dad got the small Bun Mang Vit (Duck and Bamboo rice noodle soup) $7.95. He enjoyed his meal too, although he did mention he felt the bamboo was a little too soft.

They had my mom's favourite dessert: Che Ba Mau (Tri-coloured dessert) $3.25.  She was full but still wanted to try it, so I selflessly volunteered to share it with her, lol. When we ordered it, I asked for an extra glass so we could divvy it up, but I was so pleasantly surprised when they brought it out already in 2 glasses, all layered and pretty! It had red beans, yellow mung beans, and green jelly, topped with crushed ice and coconut cream. Yum!

Service was exceptional. The owner chatted with us extensively and was so sincere and genuine. 

Portions were generous and prices were excellent. It is too bad that we live in Ottawa now. If I still lived in Toronto, I would eat at Pho Vuon Lai all the time!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant used to be a Pho 88 that re-branded or was purchased and converted, so the interior is a little dated. The food is genuinely Vietnamese, and the broth for the noodles is very delicious. The restaurant is stereotypical in that the menu selection is HUGE. There are probably over 100 items to choose from.

3.5/5 - Food
3.5/5 - Overall Experience

I visited this restaurant with my family, and we tried a bit of everything. The classic beef pho, deep fried spring rolls, vermicelli, curry noodles and rice and pork chops. The pho was probably the best, as it should be. The broth was clear and light, but very fragrant and full-bodied. The deep fried spring rolls were good, but slightly mushy from the vegetables inside. The curry noodles were most disappointing as they had just chopped up a chicken leg into there. Not much seasoning on the chicken, it seemed like it was just tossed into the soup.

The restaurant has your typical booth seating and a few open tables. The washrooms and floor areas were slightly dirty, partially due to the snow from outside. Service is typical of an Asian restaurant, you may need to flag someone down to get your order, and with the high backs of the booths, they may not see you, nor stop by to check up.

Overall, the food is good, but nothing to go out of your way for if you know what good pho is."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today.  Wanting to try it from the good Yelp reviews.

We go out to eat pho once a week and usually go somewhere else.  But we had an unfortunate incident, at our usual place, and will not be returning. 

The restaurant was about a third full, when we arrived, at around 1.15pm.  There is ample seating as it's quite a large restaurant.  We ordered shredded pork rolls, special pho (dry and fresh noodles) and pork chop rice.  The small pho comes in a small bowl but it's full of noodles, soup and toppings.  The amount of toppings was excellent, the amount given is what you normally get for large, at other places.  Plus they gave a beef ball for the special pho, most places omit the beef ball for special pho.  The soup was nice and flavourful too.  Shredded pork roll was nice, only my kids eat them, I am not a fan.  The pork chop rice was decent too.  Only bad comment was that my dry noodles were a tad too soft but still not mushy. 

I think that we've found our new pho place.  Staff were all pleasant and a waiter even recognised me from when  we used to frequent Kim Po."}
{"text":"My go to pho place in the East end. Plenty of ample parking and seating. The owners who are 100% Nammers knows how to treat their customers and everything on the menu is tasty and genuine as it can be! I highly recommend this place! 
The decor could be upgraded a bit."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food.  I'm usually not crazy about spring rolls but the ones here are amazing.  They give you 4 pieces served over crispy wonton shells for $5.95.  Pho was tasty and hits the spot.  Would return if in the area and in the mood for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I don't normally go out for Vietnamese food but was surprised with all the options Jasmine Garden had to offer, tons of appetizers and huge bowls of noodles soup (even the small is still pretty big). My go to at any Vietnamese restaurant is Bun Bo Hue and as you can tell by the picture posted it was filled to the brim! 
For apps I got the pork on shrimp crackers and it was a nice light snack before the meal, pork was wonderfully seasoned and well cooked. 
Only complaints I have about the Jasmine Garden is that it was quite dirty and everything felt sticky. Also in order to go to the bathroom you had to pass by the stations where the servers kept all their utensils, which was quite awkward for both parties and there wasnt really any organization with the seating because these two people sat themselves down when we were just putting our coats on.... yikes!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the many great reviews...and was very disappointed. Ordered a large pho (with fresh noodles) and a bunh xeo to share. Both were bland and not exciting. The bunh xeo was soggy and was just all beansprouts. The pho smelled like raw pork.. definitely not very pleasant."}
{"text":"Quiet for a weeknight.  Food came at ok speed.

Large and xl were good portions.  Liked that we could ask for extra onions or fresh noodle.

Important thing is soup was hot and tasty.  And good portion of meat and noodle. We did not try rice or other dishes.

Good prices.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a Pho 88 and you can find another Pho 88 downtown along Spadina in Chinatown (I've been there once, maybe 3-4 years ago and I can't say I recommend it though maybe time has made it better). This location was and still is more run-down and the Pho 88 here was, for so many years, a family favourite. I guess as time passed, quality started to fade and crowds changed... and then the restaurant itself changed.

With the same decor, Pho Vuon Lai Jasmine Garden serves Vietnamese cuisine but with a slightly different menu (and therefore, different branding). I've been here twice - once during its opening week and another time about a week ago. 

The first time I went was with a large group of people (around 10) - we ordered pho, deep fried spring rolls, and a variety of vermicelli and rice dishes. The place was full and we were greeted by a host that explained that it was his family's business - a business he bought for his wife - the chef behind the dishes. That day, I got the impression that it's a good family-run business by a great Viet family. 

The second time I went, it was on a weekday afternoon, an hour before the dinner rush.  It was a lot quieter, no host,  a couple of waitresses, and one other customer. I missed the host's energy - I think it made a difference to their service.  I went with two other people and we ordered: 

Pork chop on rice ($7.50): It was yummy - tangy, zesty, and juicy, not too tough. It was similar to a recipe my mom would make at home. 

Deep fried spring rolls (2 cut in half, $5.95): Great presentation, fried for the right amount of time, the rolls where delicious. 

Pho - well done flank and beef tripe, XL ($9.95; S - 7.25; M - 8.25): The pho was okay - while the soup base was nice and clear in taste, it was still bland. It had a more fragrant taste than the restaurant here before but lacked flavour. The meat was nicely cooked however and added to the taste. 

I'd probably come here again - the flavours are good, the people are friendly, and service is quick... though I do find myself wanting more from their pho."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give it a try with my friend and take a break from Vietnam Noodle Star. I ordered the house special pho with everything in it and my friend ordered the pork chop on rice. It was not as great as I expected because the meat was too hard to chew and the noodles were really thin. They also got my friend's order wrong in which they gave us extra spring rolls.  Although we didn't order them, they still charged us. I think the price was good because they gave such large portions but I don't think I'd make it my go to pho restaurant."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp while searching for a new pho place to try out and overall i'd give it a 2.5/5.

The spring roll, while large, is not as hard and crunchy as I would like it to be. The filling contains bean sprouts which excretes water when cooked for too long, so that may be a part of the reason why. I like it when the spring rolls are crunchy and just all pork, carrot and taro filling. 

The pho special (pho dac biet) had a lot of noodles which is great if you're carb loading to prep for a race/marathon or if you're really hungry. It doesn't have a lot of toppings compared to other pho places I go to like Pho Metro, Vietnam Noodle Star, or The Pho. I expected more meat for a large bowl of Pho. I couldn't figure out why I kept sipping on the soup even though I was feeling uber full but then later concluded it was probably the MSG that made that broth taste delicious (I arrived to this conclusion after my 6th glass of water). 

The prices were a bit higher than other places I normally go to so I'm not sure if I'd come back here. All in all, an average pho place to me."}
{"text":"Their spring rolls are the best I have ever had in the GTA. BIG and packed with fillings including taro!!! And of course the presentation is just out of this world. Vermicelli was good considering it was only $ 7 (the one from Pho Metro is still better but at $ 9). Their milk shakes were pretty good too. Super friendly and quick service. A spacious dining area plus lots of parking because this plaza is not that busy compared to other major ones in the area."}
{"text":"This place used to be pho 99 or pho 88 and they used to serve quail eggs in their pho. I think it changed owners some time last year and now it's called jasmine garden. Sad that the quail eggs are gone, but, the menu has undergone a sensational improvement in quality. The food is phenomenal and, truly, is now a taste of genuine Vietnamese cuisine. 

Sure the place doesn't look inviting, but the pho is the best in town. Great portions, fresh meat, savory broth. My go to is the special pho and egg noodle (M01).  I've gone to some pho restaurants and the broth is just not hot enough but 10/10 times here, the soup is hot! And you don't even need to add sriracha or hoisin sauce! 

Don't forget the appetizers such as the spring roll, grilled pork fresh rolls and Vietnamese sausage rolls.  They are nicely presented and also absolutely delicious! Another delightful surprise is their milk shakes. My favorite are durian, coconut, jack fruit, passion fruit, mango and avocado. Super creamy and thick (but not the gross kind). Made with 100% real and fresh fruits! Even tried their 3 color ice and that was good too. I did try their rice dishes as well but they were just mediocre in comparison to their pho.

Service isn't the best but the owner is super hard working and I often see him striking a conversation with his customers. I swear he recognizes me since I'm a regular. I come here 1-2 times a month and they've never disappoint. Prices are reasonable ($7.95 for small pho, $5-6 for appetizers)."}
{"text":"Best place for your Vietnamese cravings wether it be pho, grilled meats on rice and spring rolls all are very tasty choices that never disappoint. I recommend everyone try it out."}
{"text":"With such high ratings, I wanted to love this place, or maybe it set me up for high expectations, but coming here with 10 people during the weekend, the overall experience was displeasing. 

We called to make a reservation and the person on the other line took down our request for 10 people but did not ask for our name or call back--how would they know it's us when we get there?

We had to write our own order, which wasn't bad because most pho places do that. Since there were 10 of us, we quickly filled that sheet. It took us a couple waves to get the attention of a waiter/waitress to put our order in. Once our order was placed,  probably within 5 minutes, our first dish came out pretty quickly. 

I loved that it was fast service for making our food but I hated how hard it was for us to wave down a waiter/waitress to get refill for our teas and more bean spouts--which has a ridiculous story to it. We asked multiple times to different waiter/waitress to get the bean sprouts. Finally, one waiter actually got what we wanted and in the second plate, he told us that they ran out of bean sprouts so we have to make due with the cabbage. I'm like... \"okay, this is a first, a pho place that ran out of bean sprouts and using cabbage... we'll give that a try.\" But here's the problem, we walked up individually to pay for our bill and lo-and-behold, there were two buckets on the side, one for bean sprouts and the other for cabbage. Then I was like... \"you've got to be *^&%$ kidding' me, you tell me that you ran out of bean sprouts and look at the abundance that you have there!\" I didn't want to cause a scene over simple bean sprouts but just made a mental note that I probably won't return. 

The reason extends more than just bean sprouts; the food didn't taste delicious. I ordered the seafood noodle soup and for $8.99, I expected more than 1 shrimp, 3 pieces of calamari, and 4 half pieces of fishballs. It was pathetic to the max, the chef totally skimped out on the toppings. Also, the soup base flavour could have been more developed, it just tasted like water lightly salted. I've had pho somewhere better... I didn't want to waste my time with awful service and below-mediocre pho. 

The only thing, literally, ONLY THING that I will comment on the positive side is their smoothie. I had the avocado smoothie and it was delicious. The drink was very smooth and I could clearly taste the avocado. This smoothie alone is the reason why I am giving this place a 2-star rating. 

Overall, like I said throughout, I won't return to dine-in for their pho because service and flavour just did not deliver. However, since the smoothie was so great, I might just come and grab a take-out of that if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in so long.  Coming here as a kid, this place has changed names a few times, last time it was PHO 88, so you can imagine what this place has gone through.  In this case.....nothing has changed since it was PHO, the set up, decor, overall ambiance is the same.  
Pho Vuon is a typical Vietnamese restaurant.  The service was fast, efficient and pleasant.  
Their food was at par, nothing special.  
I ordered their traditional Vietnamese Pho with the full works, fish ball, tripe, beef, etc.  
The only thing that I enjoyed, though it was oily, was their spring rolls.  Beautifully presented and huge!!!
Prices are reasonable and portions are good, quality is....OK.."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when it was pho88, I'd get the family special with quail egg all the time. I came to see how the place changed, the decor is still the same (all the booths and tables haven't changed) but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. 

I ordered the house special pho, spring rolls, and an avocado milkshake. The prices are reasonable and the quality and presentation of the food is definitely better and a step up from the old joint. Everything was made fresh - the spring rolls were so delicious and packed with taro. The avocado milkshake was smooth and had great flavour, I find that at most places I get the avocado shake, it's either really bland and/or icy in consistency. 

The interior is pretty drab but they keep the place tidy and clean. I will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and has always been fantastic.  The quality of the meals only gets better after every visit.  Highly recommend the spring rolls, they're really good."}
{"text":"great food and generous servings. owner was always nice to say hello and chat."}
{"text":"Exterior doesn't look like a restaurant. A storefront THAT shade of purple screams nail salon. 

Anyway, about the food: 
Pho definitely has MSG - a glass of water please. Another glass of water please! The beef slices are tender and tendons seem to be of good quality. My boyfriend requested vegetables in the broth which cost him an extra $3. Broth and noodles were unremarkable. 

The fried spring rolls atop a fried wonton wrapper were delicious - crispy, flavourful and oh so satisfying. I ate the wonton wrapper too. 

Overall not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"My fav and go to place whenever I'm craving Vietnamese food! If you want authentic, affordable Vietnamese food and at in Scarborough definitely give this place a try. The spring rolls are a must. The broth is never fatty and doesn't have MSG in it either, reach fam"}
{"text":"Broth today lacked flavour but what you get for the price is massive. A lot of noodles and meat. I would decrease the portion and work on the broth. Left really full but not satisfied."}
{"text":"\"Read Kyle K's review and thought I should give this place a shot. He's not wrong.\"

It's a good place just down the road into Scarborough from Markham run by Vietnamese people who sell Pho and a ton of other dishes. Great flavour, selection, lots of cuts of meat (I always, always get the house special) in a broth that tastes light and fresh. 

Don't ever order the biggest size of Pho ever unless you're a really big person or going to finish it. The size in the middle is almost always perfect and enough to fill you up for the day. Pricing is very affordable and under $10 fills you up. I'm all for that. 

Meat was tender, colour was good on both the broth and the beef (especially the rare beef). Of course the basil, bean sprouts and other sauce toppings are on the side you help you \"customize.\"

Nothing more to say other than if you're in the area and want a pho place you can trust, this place is great.

{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 star rating because right away the restaurant has a dead atmosphere, one women doesn't understand english and can only speak vietnamese!!!, the other women is not as bad because she can barely understand english and when i try to tell her that I want to substitute the meat with bean curd, she looks at me funny!!!, and she suggested tofu. So I said ok.

Why can't they understand English?, this is Terrible!!!!!!!!!

So, when my dish is arrived after waiting 5 minutes i looked at it and I should have substituted the meat with vegetables.

Definitely not worth it!!!!

{"text":"Huge, huge, huge portions.

I typically order extra large bowl of pho if its available on the menu. The extra large in this place is really big. Beef was rare just the way I like. Soup was really good. I was really full after this bowl of pho and in a mini coma so I completely forgot how much it cost. I think it was $10.95 or $11.95 but either way you get your moneys worth. 

Deep fried spring roll $5.95 - the menu says it comes with two pieces but don't let that fool you. These are super jumbo size spring rolls and its really like you are getting four. A nice crisp on the outside and filled with all sorts of good stuff on the inside. 

Durian milk share $3.95 - a very strong flavour of durian. Went down smooth and tasted amazing. 

I think this is a family run restaurant because the wait staff were children about the age of 10-15 years. This did not in anyway make the service bad. In fact the service was excellent in my opinion."}
{"text":"A usual spot to eat pho for myself. The owners are amazing, always offer the best service and do everything with a sense of urgency. Within a fast paced environment, they manage to put time into all of their customers. 5/5 on service.

The food is satisfactory, and I would say in my top two places to eat pho. In my opinion, a pho restaurant should make amazing pho but also be up to par with their other dishes and this place definitely is. I personally don't think you can go wrong with any rice or vermicelli dish. Some of my favourites are the beef vermicelli and the pork chop with rice. 

As for price, you can easily get a meal for around $10, definitely a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket stew with fresh noodle. The soup base was perfect. There was a good amount of  beef brisket and it was very tender. Weird how the waiter asked if we wanted egg noodle or fresh noodle as I was expecting choose between dry or fresh noodle like most places. My cousin and I ordered this and we both enjoyed it. 

The spring rolls was really good. Crispy with lots of taros. One of the best spring rolls I've had in Scarborough. 

The grilled pork rice roll was delicious. I like how to leave out the big leek/ chive and made it simple. 

I tried my cousins mango slush which was really good. 

Will definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner. This location was previously a pho88 for the longest time. Growing up in the area this plaza used to have a lot of restaurants but now it seems like a dead plaza. Was tired so decided to eat close to home.

Surprisingly the quality of his place went up after they changed owners. Ordered the p06, rare beef with beef balls. The broth was very tasty and flavourful and the noodles portion was alright.

Mind you at these places service is basically \" what do you want to eat?\" Serves you then leaves so don't expect much.

Would come back and try other things."}
{"text":"I love it!

The food is great, friendly staff, and clean utensils. Food is very affordable and portions are very reasonable, they can speak multiple languages here so there's no fear for language barriers!"}
{"text":"Came here based on friend's recommendation, I didn't think there was much to write home about.
Pho was good, soup was flavourful but not fragrant enough. Sides also tasted decent, the cane shrimp was tasty but came with an oddly abundant amount of garnishes. The shrimp chips were not too filled so perfect for a bite. They were both ok, nothing too memorable about the flavours.
nothing stands out about them as a whole compared to other small Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the top 3 pho places in Scarborough now. Portions are enormous, meat quality excellent and not too fat. And the broth taste better than a lot of places. Seems to be run by Vietnamese ppl too."}
{"text":"Sunday night, too lazy to cook?  Need something good and cheap??  Pho checks off all those boxes baby!

Decided to have some Sunday night dinner at Pho Vuon Lai and have to say it was a very good choice.

Located in Alton Towers, Pho Vuon Lai serves some solid authentic Vietnamese food in the area.

We really enjoyed our meal here as all the dishes came out quickly and delicious, but the highlight as what most people have said are the fried spring rolls.  They are much bigger then most places and beautifully presented on a fried wonton skin wrapper.

The pho here is very good but the standout part is that they give you a lot of fillings....most places the noodle to soup ratio is about 30/70.  Here its closer to 50/50 so for big eaters like me you will be very satisfied especially if you order XL.

Solid choice for pho in the area!  4/5"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. The XL pho has huge, lots of noodles! The rice dish was good as well but was hoping for more meat. Overall good place to dine and the price is right."}
{"text":"Nice Vietnamese restaurant buried in a Chinese-dominated restaurant mall in northeastern Scarborough. Their price is reasonable and even a \"small\" size of Pho is plenty enough for small eaters. I ordered their classic Pho (menu number P01) and it's assorted meat. I do wish that they would put more than one tiny meat ball into the bowl (the size of the meat ball is less than a timbit, so go figure...)"}
{"text":"I've been craving for pho that day so I decided to bring my parents along with me. 

I came here at around 8 on a weekday and was surprised to see only 2 tables were occupied. My dad was suspicious as to how good this restaurant can be since it was so empty... but we still gave it a shot. 

There were cracker crumbs on our table that the waitress claims to be from the previous table. But this proves that they did not clean the table properly. 

This place is the typical Asian restaurant where service isn't highly valued.

All of us chose P1, which is equivalent to the special pho with assorted toppings. In my opinion, the pho was decent. The broth was clear and tasty. The noodles are the skinny type which I like and the beef wasn't fat like some other restaurants. However for a large, I think they could've been more generous with the noodles. 

I would come back to quickly fulfill my pho cravings."}
{"text":"Huge portions but huge disappointment on the taste. 

My friend got the XL pho with rare beef and the bowl was the size a frisbee! I tried a small bowl of his pho and I thought the broth was decent. It was quite clear with a good balance of saltiness and a hint of sweetness. The beef however, was not the freshest. I ordered the Banh Xeo which is crepe with shrimp, pork and veggies. It was a huge disappointment. The crepe was soggy and the pork slices tasted so bad. There is a distinct taste when pork past their best before date and I think theses slices definitely passed that date.

Besides the disappointing food, the resto was a bit dark and dirty. Service was ok, typical Asian resto service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I want to say that the food isn't as good as people make it seem. The soup is meh, proportions are a bit larger than most pho places.

The service is undertrained, but they make up for it by trying to be helpful. Place is clean enough, but decor is meh.

Overrated."}
{"text":"I had an order of the large rare beef, we'll done tripe and tendon beef noodle soup. 

Though I had little meat, it was all quick juicy and tender. 

The decor is very basic but the food came out quick and was satisfying. The servers were friendly and very open and the prices were fair.

I was a little skeptical at first but I believe it's a lot better than the pho 88 that used to be there."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when I first stepped inside this \"new\" Vietnamese restaurant, Jasmine Garden. There is nothing really new aside from the new name and the new menu. It used the same deco from the previous restaurant. I can in fact saying that this is quite rundown and dark.

Pho House Special ($7.25) was served less than 5 minute after I put in my order. The broth was really cleared and well flavoured with good cut of meat and portion size was decent.

Service is fast and friendly.

Jasmine Garden is a good neighbourhood Vietnamese restaurant for some pho or other Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"When we walked the server seated me at a table that's not clean,  it wasn't any big issue, he then move us to another table. The overall environment is fine and they serve really good Jasmin tea. 
If you want Vietnamese side dish that is not on the menu, they can make it for you. I got a small plate of cha lua (pork sausage) for $5.

We ordered a raw beef noodle, raw beef salad, and  carb noodle. I came here specifically for the raw beef salad. Sadly, their raw beef salad is a little different. It's like some cooked beef with a lot of onion, which definitely not what I expected. The Carb noodle is a little lack of flavor compare to other place.

Over all this place is fine and has good service. One of the must try is actually their dessert , the chocolate tower. It has chocolate on top with chocolate moose inside and it's really good. I wanted to give a 3/5 for this place, but the service deserves more."}
{"text":"I had one of their soups and it hit the spot. Big portions and fair pricing. Standard pot of tea."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food in this restaurant. As others reviewer mentioned, the spring rolls were quite impressive and they were the best spring rolls I've ever had. They got lots of fillings inside and nice presentation and tasted so good. 

I also got the raw beef pho. I noticed they used better quality of beef compare to other pho places, and I also didn't taste the msg from the soup. This is definitely a winner. 

I reduced one star because it was a bit dark inside even it was so bright out. If you manage to get the tables by the window, then you won't have any problem. 

And also they only gave each person one napkin which i found a bit inconvenient as other pho places they usually put the napkin box on the table and you can get whenever you need it."}
{"text":"Great find in a seemingly quiet strip mall!
Broth is super flavourful and portions are huge! Definitely recommend the rare beef rice noodle soup. Service is also very friendly and attentive. A must try if you're craving pho!"}
