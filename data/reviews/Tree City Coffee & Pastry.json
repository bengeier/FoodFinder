{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't dislike Tree City; I just dislike their coffee. I like to buy my beans locally, but from what I understand, most of their beans are not fair trade, and therefore defeats the purpose (I think) of buying locally. I also think a lot of the roasts are very bitter and not what worth what they charge.   That being said, the atmosphere is nice and it's a decent spot for studying or meeting up with a friend. The staff is very helpful and always friendly, and I do stop in from time to time, just not for coffee."}
{"text":"Cafe au lat was incredible. Chocolate peanut butter brownie rich and tasty. They have beer and wine. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love going to Tree City!  Locally owned, great atmosphere, and fresh coffee.  The staff have always been friendly and helpful.  For my first few trips, I could never quite remember the name of the brew I preferred.  The employees have always taken the time to explain which is which - in knowledgeable coffee terms.  Nice!  Also, try one of the homemade bagels with cream cheese...so good!  Heavy on cream cheese, but that is a great thing for many people, including me!  (My sister likes them with just butter.  She says you can taste the bagel better.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in  for seasonal latte and cappuccino and we were not disappointed! Place was packed and we grabbed a table as soon  as we noticed people were leaving. Great place to visit with friends, study or just sit back and read relax. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"All I want is a macciato for a reasonable price.   For those who don't know, a macchiato is two shots of espresso with foam.   Several months ago I went to tree city coffee and ordered a dopio macciato breve style (use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk). I ordered maybe five of them that week for $2.25. The next week I was charged $2.75 because \"the owner said that 1/2 & 1/2 cost more than 2%). Frustrated, I boycotted for about 6 months and went back to Starbucks (regrettably).  Last week I went back to tree city, ordered a micchiato with 2% for $2.25. Again I ordered about 5 of them over the week and yesterday (10.24.2013) I ordered the same drink and I got charged $2.75 an 18% markup overnight. I told the nice girl helping me that this was B.S. and wanted to know why!. She said the owner said that it takes a lot of milk to make foam so there is waste. WHAT?????!!!! the last excuse was 1/2 & 1/2 costs more, now this excuse????!!!!!   I think the owner is a bafoon and makes up rules as (s)he goes.   I Googled refrothing milk, AND YOU CAN contrary to the nice girls comments, plus its the morning and busy so they're using the steamed milk probably within a minute. I Googled how many ounces of coffee grounds for an espresso (7 grams for 1 shot, 14 grams for 2) so I'm being charged a 400% markup on coffee ($9lb from the store, $36/lb for the espresso price (i.e., $2.25 x 16 Oz)) and now I'm being charged the equivalent of $16 for a gallon of milk - another 400% markup, this place is ridiculous in its pricing for 2 shots of espresso and a little foam.   Anyway, some of the people who work there are nice, some not so nice as others have said, but I won't be back. The owner seems to be a horrible leader, makes up pricing as she goes, and overall I do not frequent places that do business like this.   And while some may say, good riddance, it's not worth the owners time to fret about $2.25/2.75. I am a professor at Kent State and I meet with students and colleagues all the time. I estimate the amount of money I could bring Tree City to be about $500/month or $6,000 per year if I were to frequent the place.   Alas, the owner just lost my business for good because she wants to charge me 0.50 extra.   In essence what this means is the owner is charging me an extra $130/year but lost about $6000/yr. Hey owner, nice business acumen. It would serve you better to look at the whole picture, not just the price of a cup of coffee, but I doubt you have the frontal lobe engagement to understand what I just said.   Since I hate complaining without a solution, why not have a VIP card that offers a 10 or 20% discount, or a frequent buyer card so we can get the 11th cup free.   Good grief, we all have to suffer so many ignorant business owners."}
{"text":"I agree with the other poster earlier in this thread. Tree City gets it right in some ways. Terrific ambience, amazing baked goods, and a decent cup of coffee and or latte, espresso. I believe what they are lacking in is the customer service. Usually the front counter are okay and greet you with smiles. Some of the baristas mostly girls seem pissed off and never smile. I thanked one today and all she could do is give me an angry look. I don't think I'll be going back. They could take lessons of good customer service from Bent Tree or Scribbles."}
{"text":"Great coffee and baked goods.  I love the cranberry scones and the spinach feta egg sandwich.  The coffee always tastes fresh.  It can be a bit difficult to find a table on the weekend and in the evenings when students are around."}
{"text":"Best cafe in Kent! Great service, friendly servers, great homemade pastries, and a decent cup of coffee. Has a very welcoming environment and great fireplace!"}
{"text":"Love their specialty coffee drinks and wine and beer selection. But their desserts take the cake -- they have amazing cheesecakes and do seasonal offerings like pumpkin cheesecake in the fall."}
{"text":"Moved from NYC to Kent and trying to find a staple coffee shop like I had in my 'hood in Manhattan. Tree City is good, but not quite there. Coffee is consistently really good, which is the most important aspect. atmosphere is not bad either. My big issue is with their bagels. Thy have some fresh pastries but the bagels come out of a plastic package and they heat them and NOBODY AT TREE CITY KNOWS HOW TO SCOOP OUT A BAGEL. I really feel like this should be an essential skill for anyone serving bagels like at a coffee shop, but I've asked at least half a dozen different times and I am consistently met with blank stares.  I will happily up the stars on my review when this changes. Please, tree city, teach your employees to scoop out bagels on request!!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee beverages and bakery items - vegan brownies are amazing.  This place is 4-stars, but I'm giving an extra star because of the ridiculously friendly workers who leave customers thinking, \"they must want to sleep with me...\""}
{"text":"Tree City is my coffee staple. I am in there at least twice a week MINIMUM. Their vanilla lattes, jasmine tea, caramel macchiatos, caramel apple spices, and hot chocolates are the bomb. The cookies are awesome too! Truthfully, I've been wowed by everything on the menu except for the sandwiches and the cupcakes.   Sure, you could get a similar cup of joe at Starbucks for maaaaybe a few cents cheaper, but look at it this way... A) You don't have to strangle someone for a parking spot because Tree City has a drive through!  B) The fact that their coffee is local and fair trade isn't half bad either. C) You won't have to waste your time memorizing lame pseudonyms for small, medium, and large...because Tree City don't roll like dat.   Also, the owner is almost always there and goes out of his way to make sure his customers are satisfied. The baristas are usually friendly too.   So, if you happen to be strolling in Acorn Alley on a cold, blustery day (we have many in Kent), stop in for a warm drink. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Not a better place in downtown Kent to spend some time. Read a book, scan the trades, meet a friend, catch up on the news -- all great things to do here. Staff is great -- friendly and knowledgeable -- and you can order must about anything you'd expect at an upscale coffee house. Happy that Tree City calls Kent home."}
{"text":"They have coconut milk!!! So that makes them a winner. I wish this place was here when I went to college. Its amazing. Its also an independent business which is even better. They atmosphere is great and studying here would be my next goal- If I still had to study. :) oh- and most importantly, the coffee was good and the snacks were great. We had the oatmeal."}
{"text":"Travelling from Asheville, NC to Ravenna, Oh and stopping at highly rated shops along the way. Tree City has by far been the best so far.  Atmosphere is fantastic whether you are a college student or a family. Very attractive and clean. Great selection of food items.   One thing that stands out is their milk offerings. Of all the places I've stopped they have dairy, almond and coconut milk to choose from. Almond milk is replacing soy in the industry, so this shows me the owner takes quality seriously.  Recently switched from a super to a Simonelli automatic. A great step.  I'm giving four out of five stars for Barista training. The girl obviously had been trained by Starbucks, so her milk texturing needed some work. Clean bar, though. Good wand maintenance tells me a lot."}
{"text":"Love this place and so happy that a nice local coffee shop has opened up. I work right around the corner from the shop so it's convenient! The hours are great, and so is what they sell. Try the maple latte! I also love the pastries, my favorite are the orange star anise scones. They feel so light, and the flavor is so unique! I would love if they would get some vegan or at least some gluten free pastries, but I already mentioned it and I was told that was a goal of theirs. The staff is so nice, and I love the fireplace, nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this coffee shop since it opened and was employed there for a short period of time. I love the quality of coffee with many organic choices. The flavor of any coffee chosen outdoes Starbucks' burned beans any day! The espresso is outstanding. Organic peanut butter is amazing as well. All ingredients for food are always fresh and it keeps me coming back for breakfast almost every morning! The interior reflects the amazingness which is unlike any coffee shop I've visited. It's hands down the best coffee establishment in Kent!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee shop (which serves cocktails at night) that serves a full breakfast. We happened in just before Santa (and his DJ) were supposed to arrive on a Saturday morning. So we quickly drank our hot teas, latte, and coffees while enjoying various pastries and biscuits.   The staff was great and made some lovely latte art for my aunt. The tea selection was OK and I wish they had it posted somewhere instead of just a ring with cards/flavors.   Definitely a spot I would use for a quick meal/snack and a beverage if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Actually very decent espresso. This is almost impossible to find in Northeast Ohio, by the way."}
{"text":"This place holds a very soft part of my heart I don't know if it's just something about when you walk in and you can be in a crowd of people at a coffee shop and just lose yourself even though so many people are there, there's a beautiful ornamental tree figured around the fireplace that's always running and plus there's a drive-through just in case you want to get that graham cracker latte on the way.  I've got to say in her numerous times we've gone it's whimsical, we buy beans here, there's little pastries and food you can order for breakfast and the staff is very nice really nothing to ever complain about."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble across this place one day. Reminds me of a Starbucks but aimed more towards a healthier choice. They have pb&j sandwiches which are delicious. Different choices of jams and toasted or untasted gives it a different variety than a normal pbj. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Kent. Consistently good. Consistently clean. Friendly staff who can help you figure out what you want."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  The iced latte was good--- a little too much milk relative to coffee.  Very friendly staff.  The muffins, scones (sweet and savory) and cupcakes in the case look amazingly delicious!  Parking is limited out front."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Kent. The drinks are pricey, but worth it for the quality and to support a local business. The pastries are top notch - I recommend their cayenne cheddar biscuits with butter. The staff is ridiculously friendly. Bonus: if I drive through for my drink and my dog is in the car, she usually gets a free treat!"}
{"text":"Tree City is my favorite Kent coffee shop by far. They have a great vibe and amazing products. Any chance I get to meet up with someone in Kent, Tree City is where I suggest.   Whether you like coffee straight up, something fancy, something seasonal... you'll find it here! If you like to try something fun, their seasonal drink menus are always on point. They also have teas as well.   Tree City also has a great selection of delicious baked goods and sandwiches. All the sandwiches are made fresh and the ones including PB are made from freshly ground PB! The Fluffernutter is my favorite    While I have never indulged, they also have a selection of cocktail drinks, beers, and wines."}
{"text":"Nice employees and a good, clean open space to have your java.  So far every sweet treat I've tried has been excellent.  The cupcakes here look incredibly decadent but I haven't tried them yet.  The best part is they have a drive-thru.  I'm sure I'll be here often over the next two painful years at KSU."}
{"text":"Noisy atmosphere if you're looking for a good place to study.   Tree city feels more like a commercial coffee shop like Starbucks and less like an intimate coffee shop.   Their sandwiches are pretty good, I normally get their lox bagel."}
{"text":"Tree City is exactly what I want out of a college town coffee shop. When the university is in session, the shop is filled with students working on papers, group assignments, research projects, etc., and it gives a nice nostalgic vibe for those of us who've graduated. There's plenty of comfortable seating in a warm, calming space - exactly what I'm looking for if I just want relax with an espresso.  But most importantly, the coffee is good. I'm not a sweet drink fan, so I've really only tried their regular roast coffee and espresso, but it's my favorite by far. The drinks always tastes hot and fresh, and they have a drive-thru for extra convenience - if you don't want to deal with street parking, you can get your coffee and some of their food options to go. And the snacks are good. I love the lox bagel, and there's always plenty of fresh-baked treats available in the display case.   Tree City also sells beer and wine, but I haven't tried it - someone else will have to let me know how it is :)   Now, as a coffee shop in a college town, it can get pretty busy. But the few times I've stopped by and had to wait longer than usual for my order, the staff make a point to check in with me and let me know they haven't forgotten me. And more impressively, I've actually received gift cards from the manager when she thought we'd been waiting too long. Which was a pleasant shock - they were obviously slammed and we didn't have anywhere to be...but it's a sign of how dedicated they are to their customers and to the local community."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good Americano here recently, but the wifi is painfully slow!"}
{"text":"Oh Tree...I wanted to love thee!  This place hits a few nails Smack. On. The. Head.  First, the coffee is terrific and danced on my tongue! I could not have enjoyed the cup any more -- I almost forgot I was doing work -- almost.  Second, the entire side of the shop goes up like a garage door and all of the sudden you think, \"Am I outside? Am I inside? ... I don't know...but I'm happy!\"  It is the best of both worlds!!!  Third, I am going to need the name of their decorator - stat - I am redecorating my own home and this place is the essence of what I dream my place to look like.  However, Oh Tree...you seemed to have missed in a few areas. Their were four girls working the day I was in.  One was happy and helpful, one was nondescript and I almost forgot she was there, and two looked soooooooo pisssssyyy I could not get over it. FAKE IT LADIES!   I believe it really ruins the mood when the staff looks like miserable lemmings.  Also, I ordered a spinach, egg, and feta sandwich and it was one of the most disappointing things I have ate in awhile.  The egg patties were likely premade, with no taste of feta at all, slapped in between some thick mushy bread and microwaved until it was too hot to eat for fifteen to twenty minutes. Not worth finishing, and so I left early because I was still hungry.  I'd come for the coffee and to sit (though definitely not facing the unhappy staff) but definitely never to eat!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels, coffee, and pastries. I like the interior but I do not like all of the people who sit on their laptops there. Just work on your laptop at home. Limited seating and kind of slow sometimes but good stuff."}
{"text":"Loved it!! The baristas were very kind and helpful!! They only had two roasts available, though, which I thought was a little lacking. If I lived closer, this would definitely be a regular spot for me, though!"}
{"text":"We had a small group of friends who went there after getting donuts across the street at Peace, Love, and Little Donuts (highly recommend!). We bought delicious drinks to go with our donuts. THEN we were told we couldn't eat our donuts there! I was devastated and wanted to return my drink - which is apparently not allowed at coffee shops.  I would NOT recommend Tree City due to their silly and poor customer service. We will not be returning and will instead boycott from across the street while eating delicious mini-donuts."}
{"text":"Get their iced coffee. So so good. Homemade pastries and other baked goods. Can be noisy. Love that they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"While the location is prime for any downtown Kent-sort-of-activity, and the decor and atmosphere relaxing and inviting, the drink menu needs to seriously be revised. There have been several times when I've walked in, ordered one of their fancy-sounding, one of a kind drinks that I've never seen any coffee shop make, and instantly regret within the first sip. Even some of the more classic and traditional drinks such as the seasonal pumpkin spice latte and green tea latte were disappointing in flavor. I would SERIOUSLY recommend those who work there to taste test the concoctions that Tree City is making up and putting on the list and answer yourself truthfully if it should be place on the menu at all and if it is work $4.60.  I will add however that the breakfast sandwiches are amazing. Bravo to however put those together, I have never wanted to throw one away after taking a bite."}
{"text":"Great coffee! Wonderful pastries! My 3 and 4 year olds loved the pb and fluff sandwich (shared) was also great. The free cucumber water was a nice touch and very refreshing. I will go again and perhaps use the drive thru on my garage sale adventures! zoe."}
{"text":"Nothing special, the cafe was OK and the coffee was OK but really nothing special. Certainly a notch above the chains but I guess I have been spoiled by great coffee places on the West Coast and this is in Ohio..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee spots in Kent. There are many different options in Kent but Tree City really steps it up. The environment is inviting whether you are there to meet friends or to get some work done. No matter if you get a hot chocolate, breakfast sandwich, or pastry you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to sit down and have a coffee. When I go in there, I don't want to leave. Whether meeting up with a friend, or studying for an exam, this place has the right atmosphere. Their pastries are dangerously addictive, so watch out!"}
{"text":"Disaffected hipster girl, why are you so angry? Is it because you strive to be a tattoo artist or knitter of ironic beard beanies, but instead, you're stuck in Kent, Ohio slathering peanut butter and jelly on bread? Is it because you long to show your artistic talents by making cool leaf pattern latte art, but they won't let you anywhere near the espresso machines? I know, I know. We all have dreams, but this is your job. You CHOSE to work in the service industry. Part of working in service is...well...service.   The scowl on your face was enough to make me question why I was giving this shop my money, but the kicker was when I thanked you for making my breakfast sandwich and the most you could muster was a grimace, a sneer, and then you turned around and started spreading cream cheese on a bagel. Here's a tip, people will like you better if you're nice to them. You don't have to be friends with them, or even like them for that matter. You simply need to acknowledge their existence, flash some teeth, or force yourself to utter the words; \"You're welcome.\" It's not that hard. Three little syllables will go a long way.  I know it's hard working your four hour shift and having to deal with your manager yelling at you for not putting enough marshmallow fluff on the homemade wheat bread. I understand your piddly 16 hours per week will never allow you to move to the Mission District in San Francisco and ride a crochet-covered fixie with a raccoon tail streaming behind you in the breeze. But I bet if your were at least pleasant, you might get to learn how to steam milk or pull a shot. Baristas get all the glory, don't they?  And they should, because the baristas in your shop make a fine cup of coffee. In fact, some of the best I've had in a long time, but they too were pissy, hostile, and disgruntled. It makes me wonder if it isn't a picture of the management and not necessarily the fact that you all look like you hate the world.  Great coffee + awful attitude = no customers. When you lose your jobs, how will you afford your denim skorts and ironic t-shirts? It's food for thought, no?"}
{"text":"Met a few friends here for coffee this afternoon. One friend hadn't been to Kent for nearly 30 years, and I was excited to show her the new downtown. I'm sorry to say I was extremely embarrassed by the dirty tables and dirty floors.   Next time we are going to meet at Baked in the Village."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. I imagine that this would be a nice place to sit and work or read or people watch at the big, open tables. A little strange it had a drive through but I guess that's a mid-west thing I forget about after living in California. It did give a fast-food type vibe to it, which took away from the cozy environment it could have.   I was a little disappointed in the coffee - the roast didn't taste very distinct or strong. Actually... It tasted watered down. It seemed the focus was on ancillary beverages, but shouldn't a coffee house have great coffee? I am not sure that this place has that focus - I believe I also saw wine there?   I think this place could lend a cool environment like Brady's had, but it needs a better coffee."}
{"text":"A well-lit, cozy and comfortable place to settle in with a book, laptop, or good friend. It takes the \"modern, sleek, clean' approach to the comfy coffee shop, so don't look for tattered couches or beat-up coffee tables here.  Convenient for both Kent State students and the townspeople of Kent.    They have lots of organic drink offerings, including almond and coconut milk (which you can't find at Starbucks), and tasty pastries. Their bagels are particularly soft, un-bulky, and lend themselves well to breakfast sandwiching. They also make their own peanut butter, which they sell to go, and feature it in a number of inventive PB&J sandwiches.    Also, oddly enough, they apparently have a liquor license, and sell some craft beer and wine. So that's, again, a nice feature for a place that invites you to curl up with a chunky novel and stay a while.    Prices aren't exactly cheap (but what do you expect for organic ingredients), but the staff is helpful and the drinks are made lickity-split."}
{"text":"Tree City is my favorite coffee shop in Kent. Their coffee is absolutely amazing and all of their food is great. Also everyone who works there is high on life and so nice.  BUT they literally run out of their cayenne cheddar biscuit by 9am nearly everyday. Truly devastating. It's SO good. They make a tiny batch of everything the day before and once it's out, that's it. This happens with their blueberry scones too (my back up order when the cayenne biscuit is out)."}
{"text":"Amazing maple latte and a tasty egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. My son and husband got peanut butter sandwiches, which were also tasty (albeit a bit too thick bread). A great atmosphere - really fun plce."}
{"text":"Love that maple latte! I'm not usually one for sweet coffee drinks, but I can't resist the maple latte! This is a great little local coffee shop in Kent. Plenty of outlets and a quiet atmosphere make this place a great study location."}
{"text":"Very much the opposite of Scribbles up the street in terms of atmosphere.  This is very new with big windows, high ceiling and a hollow sound.  Could be noisy when crowded.  Only one couch next to fireplace that wasn't working.  Nice space with plenty of outlets for all the attendant screenwriters, but not broken in.  Americans decent, but a little thin."}
{"text":"Expensive and the food is mediocre. not impressed with the atmosphere either. if you're the kind who likes over priced coffee while you work on your novel, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for coffee in the whole state of Ohio.  Nothing fancy for me, I get a medium roast coffee black.  Excellent roast.  Get a coffee here then walk around the little local shops."}
{"text":"This place is addictive. Not every barista is a breath of fresh air, but the coffee is amazing. Maple latte is a staple when I can't choose, but their seasonal options are always great. Try the maple bacon cupcakes! Absolutely decadent and just remembering them will make your mouth water.  The atmosphere is wonderful. Yes, occasional hipster glares, but with the crackling fireplace in the winter and the big open front in the spring and summer you quickly find yourself not wanting to leave. Great place for a first date, a quiet study, or catching up with old friends. Oh, yeah. Organic wines as your carryout? Sold."}
{"text":"Great coffee. I tried their caramel machiatto and I loved it. Their coffee is NOT burnt like some chain coffee shops! Also the place has a great atmosphere. Their sandwiches are delicious - I tried peanut butter and jam sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm SO glad I wandered into this place during my day visit to Kent. The foam on my cappuccino was like a cloud on an espresso spot. Their PB&J sandwich is definitely worth a trying. The staff is super friendly and nice. Tonnes of seating and plugs for chargers."}
{"text":"Unbelievable coffee and such nice employees. Even better that they have a drive through!! Love it here."}
{"text":"Really great coffee, helpful and friendly server. I went here to grab breakfast with my mom, and we really enjoyed everything. I think that they're only open for breakfast and lunch, but they had a pretty sizable menu, which included some healthier options.   My mom and I both had coffee, which was good (but I'll be honest, I'm not too picky about coffee as long as it has caffeine and doesn't taste burnt). I had a waffle with strawberries on it. My mom went for toast, two eggs, and bacon. She requested her bacon to be as crispy as possible, and they delivered. My mom can be very finicky about her food, and she said she really enjoyed everything. Best of all, it was reasonably priced. Most breakfast places aren't going to break the bank, but it's nice to be pleasantly surprised when your final bill is less than you expected."}
{"text":"UGH. Students at Kent State have no idea how lucky they are that the downtown Kent area has become so developed and awesome.  Tree City is a lovely addition to downtown Kent, and a place I wish existed when I went to Kent State. Tree City is a shockingly hip coffee and tea shop that is reminiscent of a big, cozy city café. It is incredibly spacious with open seating filled with respectful folks on laptops working away. The ambiance is welcoming and inspiring, and the decor exudes a modern, local art type of vibe. I am a big believer in vibes, and I could easily see myself sitting here all day doing work.   I ordered the London Fog (lavender, earl grey tea, vanilla, steamed milk) and it was the best London Fog i've ever ordered in a coffee shop. My friend had a fancy coffee and was super impressed. They also had a great selection of snacks, pastries and overnight oats to-go. Totally random side note, but their branding, logo and coffee packaging is really cute. I will absolutely be making this a stop on every visit to Kent. I wish the parking was a little easier, but there are a few free spots directly in front, if you can catch it at the right time. I wish we had a Tree City closer to Cleveland, but for now, i'll have to visit here! You lucky Kent kids, you."}
{"text":"Their coffee is great and they have lots of alternative options (almond milk, soy, vegan options) but their prices are quite high!"}
{"text":"Tree City is such a gem. With the closing a few years back of Susan's Coffee & Tea, a beloved & independent local spot, Tree City is a welcome pseudo-replacement in newly revitalized downtown Kent. Spacious & modern, with a sort of industrial-but-cozy ambiance, this local joint boasts organic, fair-trade coffee & a short but sweet food menu of fun twists on PB&J sandwiches & a host of homemade pastries.   Their website touts a \"stay-put atmosphere,\" inviting customers to camp out with a laptop or a textbook - no pressure to hustle out as soon as you're done with your latte. Clientele is varied, from students to professors to local color, & seating options accommodate all kinds of visitors - big tables, small tables, lounge chairs, & a couch around a fireplace for folks who just want to chat or read a copy of The Kent Stater newspaper.   I considered docking one point for snooty baristas (not all of them, but a distressing number) & for not having low-fat cream cheese. They specialize in healthy & organic, but I've gotta order full-fat cream cheese? Annoying. But I've got to give a full five points - & enthusiastically so - for tasty lattes (try the maple!), creative seasonal offerings, low prices, high standards, a calming atmosphere, a super-clean facility, & providing an alternative to corporate Starbucks down the road.  My cream cheese grudge aside, this place is really a gem among gems - my favorite coffee shop, period, including all the ones I've frequent in big cities like D.C. & Boston. As downtown Kent continues to grow & thrive, I hope to see Tree City \"rooted\" here for a long time to come."}
{"text":"They have really good coffee and pastries and much more variety than any old Starbucks. The staff is sort of snotty at times though, I must say."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. A local cafe in the middle of a small town, with good quality coffee and warm environment was all I needed :)"}
{"text":"I am reviewing Tree City as a coffee shop. The fact that they offer so much food and wine takes away from the coffee effect to me. It suggests that they aren't as dedicated to coffee as they should be.   Design at Tree City is a somewhat modern polished theme with a bit of an unrefined twist. Pretty cool, I guess. 7 of 10  Quality of coffee: Better than 2nd wave by a good little ways but not quite up to 3rd wave yet.  From what I hear they use mostly local organic products. 14 out of 20  Price: For what you're getting I'd give it a 8 out of 10.   Baristas: I haven't noticed anything outstanding in either a good or bad way, although some of the other reviews make it sound like there can be some fairly rude staff. I guess figure that out for yourself. 7 out of 10  Total: 36 out of 50"}
{"text":"This place is very cute. The employees are super nice and they have really good coffee. A nice place to come and relax. 5 stars out of 5 :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great, local alternative to the typical starbucks or dunkin donuts. The coffee is local, they feature tasty seasonal drinks, and did I mention the homemade breads and peanut butter?  The ambience is perfect, with a garage style door that opens in the summer for fresh air and a sculptured fireplace in the middle that is on during the winter. I personally like to come here to read, and while I was still in school, when they first opened,  found it a great study spot. They will also buy out your starbucks/dunkin gift cards and replace them with their own, if you have any hanging around. A nice way to support local!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's such a cozy coffee shop and they have the best drinks! It's reasonably priced and the employees are very nice and cool. I recommend Tree City to all of my friends!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of their coffee because it's very sweet, but ask and they will customize it for you by lessening the syrups pumps etc! (They are really nice people). I love their tea, their overnight oats, and think it's really neat they also sell cocktails at night! It's my favorite spot to get work done."}
{"text":"A swell little coffee shop (and then some!) conveniently located in downtown Kent,  Tree City boasts a vast assortment of pastries, peanut butter sandwiches, coffee drinks, and alcoholic beverages as well--the latter quite the surprise to this reviewer, but certainly welcome. The ambiance is modern without being too cold, just don't expect to have a puffy old chair to cozy up in with a book. Tree City ain't about that life, apparently. The coffee is great--try the maple latte--not overly sweet and properly caffeinated. The alcohol selection is limited to a few craft beers and a small cocktail menu (the chai tea old fashioned looked intriguing). For only $5 a pop, the cocktails are perfectly priced for thirsty college students, one imagines. The true stars of the show, however, are Tree City's PB sandwiches, which are made to order and come in cute brown bags with chips and baby carrots. I tried the honey nut crunch: a toasted, soul-warming delight comprised of PB, granola, and honey. A perfect snack, and a real steal for only about $5."}
{"text":"A good area to study. You'll usually find a lot of students around. Prepare with headphones and put on good background music to muffle out the noise. Lots of chairs around, but they may be filled and you'll have to wait a bit for someone to leave.  If you want to be productive, come alone or pick that friend that you know can focus. If you want to feel productive, bring someone along and chat (no need to whisper here).  The coffee is decent with some interesting flavors without being high-brow-hipster. Nothing spectacular here, however. Note, there's a drive-through window if that floats your boat, but I like to have my coffee dine-in."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, wish there was more room to sit in the cafe. I know it's hard to facilitate for the guests that aren't students on the weekends, but perhaps they could ask the students who aren't eating or drinking anything to make room for paying guests? Just a suggestion :) love the drive through - but sometimes I just want to meet a friend and have a coffee date to chat- this cafe has more of a library atmosphere with all the students than a place to catch up."}
{"text":"Brewed coffee is vibrant and smooth. Lattes are wonderful. A nice internal atmosphere that has plenty of room to visit."}
{"text":"Good coffee, fresh building, nice staff. Great place to hang out. That was sort of the downside during my visit. Had to stalk out a table. Place was packed with like 30 people on laptops. I guess that's to be expected during finals. They seemed to keep up with the orders well regardless."}
{"text":"Come here almost every morning before class for a black coffee and some sort of bagel.  Great cozy environment, great service from a friendly staff, and a good variety of menu options.   Somewhat pricy compared to some other coffee shops but the level of quality in the ingredients and finished product is unmatched in the area.   Definitely my favorite place in Kent to sit around and study, read, or do work on my laptop."}
{"text":"This is my second visit this week. Excellent coffee and breakfast sandwiches. I recommend the lox bagel without cream cheese. This helps to get the full flavor of the lox which I greatly enjoy. The medium roast coffee is in point. Not a bitter coffee and seems less acidic than other coffee I have tried.  The staff is friendly and eager to help. Just watched a lady drop her beverage and the staff remade her drink before she could even explain what had happened.  The mornings are some what steady with foot traffic but nothing that would be considered obnoxious. A must visit!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times because it is close to my apartment in Kent. The breakfast sandwiches and peanut. Utter sandwiches are quite good and the drinks are also very tasty. I must say that I find their prices to be pretty high for the quality.  I don't find this place extraordinary but it's not terrible either. The space is very open and large. A good place to meet friends or do homework."}
{"text":"Tree City is a great place to grab a cup of coffee and a pastry. The sweets are very good and their overnight oats are fantastic. The prices are a bit high for the amount you get, however I would still rate Tree City as 4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"I only drink black coffee and an occasional cappuccino...both are wonderful here.  I dropped in to get some work done and it has a really organic look and feel...I'm a good way. Pretty sweet abstract metal tree sculpture towering over the whole center of the cafe.  Pretty unique layout with storage under your bench seat and a lot of power outlets!!!  It's a great cafe!"}
{"text":"If you're a resident of Kent or a student at Kent State, Tree City is a staple coffee shop to visit. I'm not even a huge coffee fan, but Tree City is my favorite place to go when I want a nice drink.  Although I'm not a coffee lover, Tree City has all kinds of other drinks and snacks which are super good! I usually get the apple chai tea and one of the breakfast sandwiches or cake pops. Tree City also has overnight oats that I often buy for the next day. The aesthetic of this place is super cozy, local and hipster, which I love. I've often come here to work on homework, and it's proved to be a great place to study.  If you're ever in Kent, I would definitely recommend branching out to Tree City."}
{"text":"A must stop when in Kent! Delicious!!! Amazing staff and wonderful college town atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tree city is rapidly becoming my favorite place in Kent. Ths drive thru makes it appear a little chain-y, but its totally not. Most of the pastries are house made too. The bagels are damn tasty (I really liked the breakfast sandwich with eggs, spinach,  and mushrooms), I normally get those.  But Sunday I got a maple roll and eggnog latte and they hit the spot! Oh, and their retail selection is pretty awesome as well, they sell decent beers and wines."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple for college students, professionals and families since it got here. We always get the iced mocha lattes and sandwiches. Awesome service."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great service. Wide variety of Sandwiches and pastries, desserts. Reasonably priced, local establishment. They also serve breakfast."}
{"text":"Thumbs up on the new lids! Now I can enjoy my Americano with half the water as if I were sitting at TCC and sipping from a mug while looking outside through the open garage doors.  I have been coming here since they opened and they are only getting better, not only are their cups so worthy of being left in any car's cup holders as they are an awesome design piece on their own, the contents are awesome!  The high ceilings and inviting atmosphere have made me bypass the drive thru even when I just need a single cup of coffee, this allows me to browse their pastry display to choose the day's best, be it a chocolate croissant, cayenne cheddar biscuit or my favorite the pumpkin Nutella bar.  They do also serve alcoholic drinks, so an cold brew with a tot of baileys is a definite possibility, and on your way out you can pick up a bag of the Tanzanian peaberry my fav whole beans there."}
{"text":"Locals only: \"take your Starbucks gift cards elsewhere!\" is what I feel like people say about coffee shops and surf tides. Since Kent, Ohio's surf is limited to the burning Cuyahoga, coffee shops it is!   Tree City Coffee is a newly built establishment in a whole newly built area of downtown Kent called Acorn Alley II -- a coffee shop for the everyman, not just the studying student, or business man's lunch break. The decor paints what it is, a newly built place but with a cozy and familiar attitude.   After a couple weeks of hearing about its greatness and budding rivalry with the coffee giant Starbucks, I gave it a try. The maple latte which was recommended by my twitter friends and the cashier was fantastic. Not too sweet and still gave me that latte taste and feeling I was searching for. The menu is bigger than expected furnishing pastries, sandwiches, and of course the quintessential coffee, tea and frozen drinks it should. Being out of eggs I was imposed to a bacon, sausage, and cheese sandwich which did not disappoint.   Friendly employees, well staffed, and inviting environment that creates a sit in, stay a while atmosphere.   From the area and still have that Starbucks gift card? You may want to go to Starbucks to save a buck or two BUT I do recommend local business and this is just that. -- remember, maple latte. #yum  - @ZakirGhazi"}
{"text":"This was always a favorite of mine as a student at KSU, and I absolutely had to visit again. It was just as I remember it. I ordered my old favorite--a maple latte, almond milk. It was wonderful. The staff is incredibly friendly and the drinks are made well and made quick. My only regret is that there is no Tree City in Georgia, where I live now. Guess I just have to come visit more often..."}
{"text":"My favorite date or study spot in Kent. The staff is incredibly friendly, the coffee is delicious, the atmosphere is great, & the bagel sandwiches are always hot & fast! I love studying here because I know I'll have a pick-me-up with coffee & if I'm there long enough, I'll have a snack or a bagel to keep me moving. Can't say enough positive things about the staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These local owners studied what the students and citizens of Kent would want in a coffee shop and what they found is what they put into their business!  This is such a cozy place for students and citizens to come and work (with more than enough convenient electrical outlets!) Their drinks are original and their cupcakes and other pastries are to die for.   You'll find me here often on weekend mornings! (PS. The place gets a bit crowded around midterms and finals.)"}
{"text":"I like the coffee and my dog loves the dog biscuits, but I hate the layout of the tables. There's always 1 person spread out across that whole huge table while other stand around looking for a place to sit. Great to drive through, not so great to stay awhile."}
{"text":"Coffee is above average, the ambiance is a bit above average too. Just wish they roasted their own coffee or used a local roaster. Most of their beans come from a shop in Cleveland, which is fine I suppose but it's not the best I've ever had. Overall I do enjoy coming here and would recommend checking it out. Biggest complaint would be sometimes in the winter it gets quite cold inside and the fireplace isn't always turned on."}
{"text":"I was in Kent to move my sister into the dorms at KSU, they grow up so fast! On my last day there, I had an hour to kill before I headed to the Akron-Canton airport. My mom and I passed by this place when we had first arrived and thought we would stop by for a cup of coffee. The inside has a cool and relaxed vibe. As one would assume for a business so close to a college campus, there was what I assumed looked to be college students working there. They greeted us quickly and were very friendly. They have your standard coffee drinks along with some specialty drinks they created. I saw one that piqued my interest call the campfire latte that was, by the description, supposed to taste reminiscent of a s'more. I asked the girl if it was really sweet and she said she didn't know. Okay, let's skip that one then. I noticed they had a salted caramel latte so I once again asked her if that one was also really sweet and, once again, she said she didn't know. That bothered me a little bit. As a former barista, I personally made it a point to try all the drinks we served so I could accurately give a customer a description if they asked for it. And if it was a drink I didn't know, I asked somebody who did. I don't expect everyone to do the same, but I just feel like \"I don't know\" is never a good answer no matter what your profession is but I digress. At any rate, I decided to take a shot with the salted caramel latte and was pleasantly surprised to see they had almond milk! As someone who isn't tolerable of diary or soy, I love it when I go to a coffee shop that has other choices for people like me (come on Starbucks, take note already). As I was waiting for my latte, the friendly barista chatted me up and made me feel welcome. I also noticed they sell local beer and wine and I thought that was pretty cool. I got my drink and took a sip and whoa! That is sweet! Granted, this is coming from a person who normally just drinks black coffee so it may not seem so sweet to other people. Aside from the sweet factor, the latte itself was well made but I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. All in all, I would come back here again the next time I'm visiting Kent, Ill just make sure to ask somebody who has tried the drink or stick with something I know I'll like."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee & pastry choices. Very friendly staff, only 1 seemed to want to share her bad mood, everyone else was smiling & engaging. The drinks have been good, regardless of my choice of the day. The environment is bright & open with plenty of outlets, which lets me know they understand their customers :-). The clientele is ecclectic. Overall a great place to spend some quiet time! I'm glad I found it :-)"}
{"text":"Good latte and nice services!!! I like the fact they always making better coffee than starbucks in Kent.  And you can have a glass of wine after 4p everyday! Also, more coZy relaxing spaces than other coffee shops."}
{"text":"Other Yelpers have already written the book on Tree City, but I will add that their packaged coffees make excellent presents.  Today two helpful staff members advised me on a locally-produced variety that would appease a Starbucks-addicted acquaintance.  They were knowledgeable, friendly, and made the transaction quick and easy, with a nice gift bag too boot.  The packaged coffees are located on shelves right as you walk in, packed in brown paper bags for maximum tempting aromas."}
{"text":"Hey-o!   This place can get pretty busy at times... from the young to the elderly, they all seem to flock to this destination perhaps due to some sort of winter migration pattern. The majority of the people who frequent here are trendy younglings looking to study, pretend to study or just talk ...and talk ...and talk. If you listen closely sometimes you'll hear them use hip lingo, like \"bumfuzzle\", \"snickerdoodle\" and \"poppycock\". Although I've noticed that most of these hipsters are glued to their laptops, just typing away as if they were writing in Doogie Howser's personal journal.   The baristas are very friendly and knowledgeable in their craft. I'm guessing they went through some rigorous training course to perfect their skills, like that of a Shaolin monk or a lion tamer.   As for the food, I haven't had a chance to try any of their pastries but they look pretty freaking delicious. I had the opportunity to watch an elderly person sit next to me and eat a sandwich like a cow chewing on grass... just chewing away in a hypnotic motion with food hanging out of her mouth and crumbs falling onto my papers. I wanted to turn away but I'm telling you it was pretty mesmerizing. Anyways, she seemed to enjoy the food very much... perhaps I'll try a sandwich sometime, maybe even chew it like a cow eating grass for other people's amusement. Pay it forward ;-)  The coffee is why I mainly come here; it's very appealing to the senses. You should remember not to throw away your cup if you plan on having another, refills are only 60 cents. I didn't know that but they were kind enough to give me a new cup. I also recommend the mint melange tea.  Anyways, in conclusion... check out this place. They also sell beer and wine, I can't really figure that out. I guess they want you to get wasted and then come back and sober up with some coffee... pretty clever Tree City.  Maybe one day I'll give that cycle a try; in the meantime I think I'll just stick with the coffee.    Cheers!"}
