{"text":"Visited the Mississauga location Monday, and ordered the \"Great\" Canadian burger. Took a photo, and didn't notice what was soon GLARINGLY obvious. There was a plastic TWIST TIE in my burger! Of course, I realized this on the first bite, and brought the burger to the counter. They offered to make a new burger, but downplayed the severity of the situation, saying \"Oh, yeah, that's just the twist tie that's used on the bags the buns come in\". I don't care WHAT it is used for. It's a FOREIGN OBJECT, and had absolutely NO BUNSINESS being in my burger! Not returning. Ever."}
{"text":"Live upstairs and wish they cooked a decent burger. Stale buns, frozen, pre-formed patties, guess it's Square One food-court instead."}
{"text":"It's a great location that offers cheap beer and plenty of tv's to watch games. The food menu and price doesn't match the quality of the food. It's not bad but there are better options for the price.

If you are looking for cheap beer and a spot to hang out, then this as good a place as any."}
{"text":"Union Burger, to me, seems to think of itself as a competitor to other more \"upscale\" burger joint chains, like Five Guys or The Works. With that standard in mind, I thought Union Burger was a great big fail. 

I popped in for lunch on my way to get some work done at a nearby coffeeshop. I was hungry, and wanted something convenient--all Union Burger had to do was deliver something in the vicinity of \"acceptable quality\" and I would have been satisfied. But it was not to be...

I paid $15 for a burger combo (fries + drink), which seemed pretty expensive to me for a burger joint, but I can make my peace spending that kind of money if the burger is truly tasty. It was not. The fries were decent--likely home-made (which is great), though mine felt like they had maybe sat under a lamp for a few minutes (not-so-great). I ate them pretty quickly so they didn't go completely cold on me. 

The burger itself was a complete disappointment. Whereas with Five Guys you know you are biting into a patty of fresh beef, the patty at Union Burger screamed \"pre-made and frozen (for a very long time)\". Worse yet, it was terribly overcooked. Despite feeling like I overpaid for my meal, I quit after getting 3/4 through my burger. It just wasn't worth it. The burger was also over-sauced with some bacon-dijon mayo of some description, but even then, it wasn't enough to conceal the inferior product underneath. 

The final nail in the coffin of Union Burger: this weekend I went to watch a softball tournament, and ordered a burger at the makeshift BBQ stand there. The patty was from Costco, but it was cooked well, and still pretty tasty; in other word's, Union Burger's $15 offering got trounced by a kid on a grill slinging $4 pre-made/frozen patties. 

If you want a more upscale burger experience, go to Five Guys or The Works. Hell, go to Wendy's before going to Union Burger...  

PS: This is also nothing to say of the speed of service or environment. I waited about 15 minutes for my meal. Again, no biggie if the food is tasty, but $15 and 15 minutes for a glorified hockey-puck is just no good."}
{"text":"I went to Burger Day last year in Toronto, and I have tried quite a few burger joints downtown. I was in the mood for a burger and I heard about Union Burger from my cousin, so I decided to try it out. I do not live in the area, so we drove there and had to pay for street parking. 

I ordered the Mushroom-Swiss burger and my boyfriend ordered the Philly Cheese, along with sweet potato fries. The fries were perfectly fried, hot and crispy. Despite being grilled to order, it was an incredibly long wait for our burgers, and the patties were slightly overcooked. The Mushroom-Swiss was very bland, and on the other hand, the Philly Cheese was extremely sweet and saucy. 

One of the things that may attract a lot of people is their Coca-Cola freestyle drink machine that gives you a variety of options in terms of beverages. I've seen this before so it was nothing special to me.

I don't think I will be returning to Union Burger by choice, but if my friends want to check it out, I will try another signature burger, or maybe even their original bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"The only thing more appalling than their lack of customer service is the gross food that they serve. This place USED to be amazing, great food and service, but it has really gone down the drain. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Food was pretty good. Menu doesn't really make sense. Regular bacon cheese meal is 6.99 but if you want double patty the meal is 9.99? Who pays $4 for an extra patty. Customer service could have been better also."}
{"text":"This is essentially a fast food restaurant that is not so fast. The servers are really nice though all in all.

I had a regular burger with a side of onion rings. You can basically pick your toppings from a list on the board. The burger was pretty good but the onion rings were just alright. It's a little bit expensive for what you get I thought. There are other burger places that are just as good and are cheaper than this.

I have also tried the peanut butter soft serve but it wasn't really good at all. I would recommend the mushroom Swiss burger."}
{"text":"When this location first opened it was great. However, my last  2 experiences have not been good. Each time they were out of domestic beer. Last night they were out of onion rings too. They were out of small patties as well, so some of the burgers were not available, and NO substitutions were allowed. 

Also, even though I had to order the premium beer, it seemed my bill was quite steep and when I enquired about the sign that said meals starting at $7.74 with a beer.....get this, the manager said that's the children's sized meal. I thought to myself, with a beer....lol really!!!!

Anyway, I was really disappointed with the managers attitude ( I asked if I could have the premium beer at the domestic price and he basically said \"no take that price or leave it.\" That was fine....but the way it was said was the problem.  if we were not so hungry and had not already ordered we would have walked out. 

This is really too bad, I think this place could be good, I was even recommending it to my friends....but not any more!  

My partner and I were laughing and saying \"what happened?\"
  Sure at first the restaurant is good and after they are open for awhile;  get you in the door, the service and quality begins to slide. Typical Chain Resturant :-("}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill. Used to have imported beers, the Coke freestyle machine, great food. Now the burgers are just mediocre and they've gotten rid of the good stuff. Front line staff aren't well trained and items were missed from our order."}
{"text":"Great place and one of the best burgers I ever had! Please is clean and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Great burger place - have been here on and off over the years. Staff is always nice, food tastes good.

Love that they have the pop machine that lets you have different flavors added to whatever pop you get. 

Best burger ever? The mac and cheese burger then it was around. Please bring this back, I miss it :("}
{"text":"Over cooked and over priced for the quality, fries were lack lustre as well. Cool atmosphere and drink dispenser and tvs but that's it. Wish the food matched the decor."}
{"text":"Been going since it opened, food and service was great (then) 

*BUT (Now) store is dirty, slow service, and kids even working with earphones in,  constantly feeding off the fountain drinks,  and fooling around behind the counter 

Food quality isn't great, crappy service and prices"}
{"text":"Ordered a small poutine minus the gravy so essentially fries and gravy. Gravy was great, fries were tiny and burnt. It was too packed for me to go back and return them so I didnt bother. I'm sure they have good food but wasn't a great experience for me."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a burger tonight and was told about this joint.  Walked in and was greeted right away with the friendly girl taking orders.   Placed my order for the Bourbon burger with fries & pop.   While I was waiting for my order I went over to the Cola machine and was amazed with the selection and touch screen.  I have never seen anything like this before and tried the sparking lime water..... sooo good & refreshing.  Im not a pop or juice drinker so appreciated this option.  My food took about 10 minutes and this was a take away.   I live about 5 min away, so started eating the fries on my way home.  Fries were ok, I thought they were a little undercooked and soggy.   Would of liked them hot and crispy...... Digging into my burger when I got home... one word... delish!!!   mouth watering.... bourbon burger had a bourbon sauce, grilled onions, cheddar cheese served on a fresh soft bun..... I am a fan and will be definitely making this my new burger spot.  Looking forward to trying the sweet potato fries or poutine next time."}
{"text":"Burgers are very \"meh.\" Very bland and not memorable at all. Service is slow and the items are over priced. It's a good place to tryout if you are a first timer. Positives are the Buffalo chicken fries and the Coca Cola drink station which dispenses a multitude of drink combinations."}
{"text":"I am vegetarian, and they have one of the best veggie burgers. I order one of their signature burgers but replace it with a veggie pattie. Its a new location with lots of tvs. The service was very friendly. I would highly recommend the onion rings!!!!"}
{"text":"Bourbon burger. Ugh. Sounds appealing with caramelized onions, bourbon whisky sauce and cheddar cheese right? Nope. The whisky sauce is a sweet pungent sauce that does not go with this burger at all. If they wanna use a sauce, scrap this one and use something enjoyable. The burger patty is a frozen patty cooked on a grill which already is disappointing. There's little flavour from the burger...as good as it can be for a frozen patty. The caramelized onions taste like something like you'd get from A&W. UB just opened up in the Mississauga location under condo buildings and unless they pull something good outta their hats, I can't see this place surviving at all. Also, parking sucks. Bring extra quarters to fill the meter while you wait for your burger. Poor location. Poor quality of food. Poor customer service, the cooks were goofing around while the cashier was trying to yell out the order to them while she had waiting customers repeating the order. Huge disappointment of a burger joint. Not going back there. Good luck..."}
{"text":"Newly opened right in central Mississauga, this Union Burger has marked the beginning of the gourmet burger uprising of Canada's sixth largest city. After Toronto's apparent gourmet-burger epidemic (Burger Priest, Holy Chuck, Burgernator) I was hardly surprised when this little gem popped up.

Being one of the first gourmet burger chains in Sauga, I decided to give it a try with a friend of mine.

All the pricing and options were very typical, I felt. I ordered the peppercorn/goat cheese burger while my friend got the vegetarian. Had I known I wouldn't be able to customize my options, I would have gone with a classic cheeseburger (with all the works haha). The combination was good, but not my favourite. We also ordered sweet potato fries (with chipotle mayo) and a drink to make a combo. At the time, they had a promotion where you would get a coupon for a free combo for the next burger you order.

The soda fountain was insane. You may have already seen it, but UB has the Coke machine that can dispense every Coke product in existence (Coca-Cola, not cocaine) and beyond. The machine could mix drinks to achieve strawberry-Sprite, lemonade-fruit punch, cranberry-iced tea and probably lots more. We settled with lemonade-fruit punch after much sampling.

Anyway, UB has great, friendly, PATIENT service (ordering a burger requires a lot of thought) and a very casual ambiance; great for relaxing with a good burger."}
{"text":"I am glad that I did not read any of the negative reviews before going here.  My experience at this restaurant was excellent.  And the burger. ... yummy yummy yummy.  The patty was good and flavourful.  I added bacon to my burger which was cooked perfectly and hot on the burger when I was eating it.  I mention that because some other restaurants put cold bacon on their burgers.   I read another review where the person said they prefer five guys.  Not sure if you have ever eaten at five guys, but the burgers have no flavour and the toppings are limited.  Union Burger has several combination choices and a variety of condiments and sides to choose from.    Another excellent thing about the burger is the bun.  It was delicious!  I would never get a burger here without the bun.  

My sides were sweet potato fries which were ok and onion rings which were good. 

The washroom was clean.  The service was friendly.  The food was fresh and hot.

Large selection of drink choices!! Domestic beer available as part of your combo for the same price (BONUS!!) ANOTHER BONUS is the pop machine that has hundreds of flavour choices.

This is my new favorite place.  It can easily make the shortlist of one of the best burger places in town.  Best burger in town in my books.  The fresh bun sends it over the top."}
{"text":"When they opened I checked out their website and saw they had a variety of veggie burger patties so I went and they only had one option. No one knew what was in the patty (I'm allergic to beans so had to check) and it turned out to be a regular soy patty. Fine. I ordered it with 3 toppings and it came with 2. I went back up to the counter to get my 3rd and they were all so confused, but after the cook put some jalapeños in a dish for me, the server just stood there holding it talking to her coworker until I spoke up asking for it. Agh. Burger wasn't even good. I asked the manager why they advertise multiple patty options but only have one. She didn't care at all and said, \"Maybe if we get busy in the future we would add some more\"."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a burger after work one evening. There weren't many people there (it was a bit on the later side) and the staff outnumbered the customers. You can tell this is a new location - the staff are very green. Painfully green. They seemed to be just wandering around the place aimlessly. Two of them just carried on a pretty loud conversation across the counter. It took a while to get my burger even though there were only two people waiting in front of me (their orders had already been placed, they were just waiting). One guy asked whether it usually takes 20 minutes to get your order. The girl looked flustered and said, \"Oh, here's your order.\" I don't know whether it was ready right at that second or they had forgotten to press the pager notifier to let him know his order was ready. 

The burger was suspiciously like a frozen patty. I'm not outright saying they do use frozen patties, but that's the impression that I got from this patty. It had that particular plastic-like surface you get with a frozen patty (like a Harvey's original patty). The texture and flavour were honestly no better than Hero Burger, and Hero Burger for me is at the bottom of the heap of overpriced \"gourmet\" burgers. These people also have a really heavy hand with the mustard. My burger was drenched in mustard.

I might try it again, but my initial impression wasn't that favourable."}
{"text":"Too expensive waited 20 minutes and they burned my burger.  Trust  me Macdonald  is way better  and cheaper and I don't even like Macdonald that how bad it was!"}
{"text":"After eating there twice in recent weeks, I am updating my rating for this restaurant from three stars to four. The specialty burgers that I had were excellent. The fries were tasty. They serve beer at a reasonable price. They are also offering quarter pound burgers at 4.99. Union Burger has become my favourite burger joint in Brampton."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to UB Burger. The first time I had a Chicken Club with sweet potato fries, which was quite tasty!

So, here I am again. Opted for a Philly Cheese Burger, with sweet potato fries and a soft drink. For the record, you have the option of ordering a beer with your meal if you plan to eat indoors, I just felt it was a bit early to start on the bottle at 4pm. Also, please note that they do not have whole wheat buns. 

Once you pay for your order, they give you one of those beeper thingies so that you can go and get cozy while they cook your burger. I went to get my drink and discovered this very Star Trek-like, next generation fountain drink machine, which apparently dispenses over 100 varieties of Coca-Cola beverages. I touched the digital touch pad to select Coke Zero, and then had options for my Coke Zero to be flavored with Vanilla, Raspberry, Peach, Lime, Cherry, Orange or any other number of crazy combinations. Very cool. 

I found a table and thought I'd flip open my MacBook to start reviewing, and discovered that I couldn't get WiFi in here... They have a network, but you need a password, and I have no idea if it's available to the public. 

Soon my food was ready, and I just grabbed my tray from the counter and traded in my beeper. The burger was really good, and the sweet potato fries were a tad soggy (which was not my experience the last time I was here). 

Overall the visit was great. The atmosphere is pretty chill, there are TVs around playing sports. The place is very clean, and still brand new. I saw a patron go up to the counter and let them know that a hockey game had started and the channel was promptly changed. The staff seem generally cheerful and happy, which hopefully means that management is good. There was one gentleman who appeared to be in charge, and I noticed that he was joking with staff, but still clearly the boss. It's still a new place, so I imagine he is spending a lot of time with everyone making sure they're fully trained up to the franchise's standards. 

I did dock them 1 star only because they don't offer whole wheat buns (which may be entirely outside of the owner's control as a franchise) and for the soggy fries, but I'll definitely be back. At the end of the day, it's a fast food joint, and it's 10 steps up over any McDonalds I've visited."}
{"text":"Yum. Burgers. Nuff said. 

Our gaggle of burger fans piled in last night for the 9th edition of Yelp's Burger Brigade. The premise for those not aware, it's essentially a BYOB (Buy Your Own Burger) Meat up! So we've got 2 left this year and who knows where we'll end up!

That said, I had no idea this was such a huge burger chain spanning not just Southwestern Ontario, but CANADA! Wow.

Located near Celebration square in Mississauga just off of Living Arts Drive, it's a trendy looking spot with a sweet corner location and a pretty boss little patio (for warmer weather times).

Last night I went for their Steakhouse burger, which had steak/bbq sauce, onion rings, bacon and cheese. The texture of the burger (as well as the taste) was oddly similar to that of a Harvey's charbroiled burger. That nostalgia factor and the fact that I LOVE BBQ/Steaksauce on EVERYTHING (seriously I would put a little in my hair in the morning... how else do you think I get it to stand up, slick?) made for a pleasurable burger experience.

Fries IMHO were fries, not something I was a fan of and the Sweet Potato Fries were a tad soggy. That said, the redeeming side was their delicious Onion rings. Huge, well battered, crisp and YUM! AND, let's not forget that you can get domestic Beer bottles for $2.50 and import bottles for $3.50 - Ummmm yes puhhlease!!!

Love their order process where they provide you with a light-up vibrating disk that notifies you when your order is ready. OH OH and SOOOO many TV's that allow you to watch the Leafs (even when they lose).

I'd come back... heck I'd have seconds. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Union Burger - don't know what some of these earlier reviewers are talking about... the burgers we had were awesome... good quality, great toppings... and fast service! 
Good fries too!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: They offered me a $20 gift card to try out their food again.

The food was pretty good.. It's a decent place to grab food when you're drunk late night. The service is a lot better. They have new line cooks and a few new servers. Everyone was a lot more friendly this time around, knowledgeable and didn't rush customers. 

All in all it's a lot better than before and I can recommend it based on the service and somewhat on the food. \"The food menu and price doesn't match the quality of the food. It's not bad but there are better options for the price.\" as Kamal G. said."}
{"text":"The ambience and service was really nice. It was also a pretty good deal. However, I was not too fond of my hotdog as it was overlooked and tasted funny to me."}
{"text":"I live close and have been here a few times. Food quality is not consistent and staff seem like they don't enjoy being there. They do have a good location and milkshakes have not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome local burger spot. Food is good. They have a smart pop drink dispenser. They serve beer and you can eat on their outside seating. It's more expensive than mcdonalds but better then mcd too! I had the chicken burger and was an actual grilled chicken breast. I like their onions rings too! And free wifi!! 
The service can get slow. And one time the ran out of drinks. Someone needs to stay on top of food inventory!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Union Burger yesterday with my girlfriends family because her dad was craving burgers. Let's all be honest, it's very difficult to find THE best burger burger joint. I was really hoping Union Burger would be THE one, and it actually ended up being pretty damn good. It's probably almost as good as my other favourite burger place, Woddy's Burgers.

I liked how we were able to customize the toppings on our burgers easily because the toppings were labeled right in front of us. Myself and my girlfriends dad ended up having a beer (only around $3 each) with our burgers, while the rest got a pop. I didn't get to fully see for myself, but my girlfriend said the pop dispenser was cool and provided many different options..all available using a touch screen system. We shared 1 regular fries and two sets of onion rings as well.

The burger was delicious and quite satisfying. Was juicy and tasty. The fries were average. I'm not a fan of onion rings, but my girlfriend loved them. She said they were crispy and delicious.

I would go back here again, It was a cheap meal, and what was even better was that they don't expect tip, even when we ordered beer. It was a great fast food style burger joint. I definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"This place has such delicious burgers and the fries are good. I like that the combos include beer! This is a change I could stand to see happen everywhere. 

The prices are a little high, but not enough to prevent me from enjoying myself. The burgers are cooked to order, and that shows in the quality of the product.

The seating area is clean and there are TVs if you like that sort of thing. 

The service has been generally passable the few times I have been, with one outstanding experience. All in all this is a worthy place to grab a burger and a beer (or make your own soda on their DIY fancy soda machine ;))"}
{"text":"We live very close to this location so had walked by a few times and were curious to taste good.
Decided to go in yesterday and a few minutes later, regretted going in.
Only one cashier so big line up, so very slow service. I noticed a customer going up to cashier and leaving right away. I wondered why and it wasn't till almost 20 mins waiting in line and getting to cashier that another cashier who had just started at cash, told us that only cash was been accepted. I asked her why didn't advised customers so we didn't have to wait in vain, she of course ignored the question.
Finally got our food 30 mins after going in.
The food is not as good as I thought, it's ordinary, nothing special. 
We won't be going back. If you wan to have good service and and good food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tasty! Aside from the wicked drink fountain where you can get so many different kinds of water and pop, this place also has good burgers. The buns in particular are delicious. And they grill the meat to order so it's quite fresh. Lots of speciality burgers and lots of topping choices. Their onion rings and fries are even pretty good. The kid's meal comes with a lot of food for the price. The atmosphere is nice too and clean, in the summer they have a patio that opens. The staff is very accommodating. I didn't want to give my 2 year old niece pop so they let me get her milk instead even though it wasn't part of the meal deal. They also let me change my order after they had already started to make it without making me feel like I was being a hassle. Will definitely eat here again, particularly in the summer months when the patio is available."}
{"text":"Five fresh Quarter Pound burger value combos and one Texas Dog value combo for $5.99 each.  Add a bottle of $2.99 domestic Mill Street Organic beer and we're all set for an inexpensive family dinner on the town.  We spent $7.25 tax included per person!Much better quality and value than McD....

Would have given a five star rating but the pop machine ice dispenser wasn't working (...same as 2 weeks ago as per my sister), the ladies bathroom cleanliness was poor, plus there a problem with how the order system works when you substitute a pop in a combo with a $2.99 beer and they actually charge you $5.28 for the beer!  I would have still ended up paying less had I taken all 6 pops from the combos and then added the $2.99 beer to the order.  This is not honest business, intentional or otherwise.

Great burger and fresh cut fries.  Staff service was very good."}
{"text":"We were planning to go to next door burrito boyz but decided to try this place for the first time. 

Reasonable combo deals. The humburger meat were juicy, lots of home cut fries with refill pop. They also have special for beer, $3... sounds like a fair price if you want to have beer with your burger.

I would come back here when I am craving for burger."}
{"text":"Kris' Burger Brigade 9.0 was held here tonight so it was a meeting of fellow burger loving Yelpers again, tonight in the Mississauga city center area.

I thought it was just ok.  This was the third burger meal I've had in the last 24 hours!  I had ordered the All American which wasn't as big as it looked like in the photo but overall I liked it.  The All American is 2 patties with onion rings, bacon, cheese and ketchup, mustard and mayo.  

Honestly it was filling enough.  I ate a lot of fries because it seemed I just couldn't get enough of them.  I was offered poutine several times but I was all poutined out.  I had poutine for breakfast sort of because I ate my left overs from last night that I couldn't finish when I was at La Belle et La Boeuf in Laval.  

This place has beer, that's a plus!  They have basically a choice of 4; Coors light and Canadian were the domestics and Heineken and Corona as imports.  They have one of those universal Coke machines so you can have everything from vanilla Barq to Cherry Coke to caffeine free diet Coke.  

The fries I really enjoyed.  They were not overcooked but they were crunchy but not greasy.  

They have a lot of TVs so that's a good thing.  It was the opening game of the NHL season so I had asked if they could put the game on and they were happy to oblige.  The staff were really good with our group.

It was nice to meet some new fellow Yelpers as well..."}
{"text":"Decent location, clean, good atmosphere and service was very good.

Fries were good, the burger, which is why I came was - meh.  

Not bad but nothing special.  I had the cheeseburger (fresh QP) and it did not have much flavor, not very juicy, reminded me of the Harvey's and Licks cheeseburgers, dry and not a lot of flavor.

If you have a burger craving, I would keep looking."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment, good prices especially for beer.  The new management is doing a great  job and service was exceptional.  

Will definitely return !"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning. This place is disgusting. Employees are slow lazy and everything seems to be malfunctioning.

Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"After watching way too many shows on the Food Network, I've been searching for the perfect burger joint near my home and work.  Decided to try out Union burger based on a flyer I saw in my mail.  Everything is cooked fresh and takes a bit longer than your standard Harvey's, Licks, etc.  

I ordered the Goat Cheese Peppercorn and when I opened it up, it looked deceivingly small (melted goat cheese, sauteed onions and mushrooms and ketchup)..  The goat cheese was really good and the meat was nice and would probably call it on par with Big Smoke Burger (formerly Craft Burger).  

The fries were okay, but tasted a bit burnt.  All in all, not bad, but not \"extremely amazing\", but would go again. Seems like a great place to hang out though."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst burger I have ever had I purchased two all American  got home only to find both were un eatable all four beef patties were burned to a crisp I have a picture I took of it before I through it out but I can't upload it"}
{"text":"Walked in for a late lunch at 1:15pm on a weekday and it took them 15 mins to get me my burger!!!Lame service for not even being busy!

This place also doesn't keep knives?!?!I mean what do I do if I want to split my burger in half?I practically just tore it apart since I like my burger in halves!

Overall the burger was dry there is room for improvement.The fries are to die for though.Might give them another try!"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken poutine, which is normally very good, was very soupy. Gravy was thin and had no taste. Ranch dressing didn't have any taste. And it seems they have changed the toppings. They used to put tomato and bacon on this poutine. Not anymore. 

Wings were a disappointment. If I'm going somewhere to pay over $10 for a lb of wings I would expect them not to be from M&M's. Because that's exactly what they tasted like.

The outlaw burger didn't look even close to the picture plastered everywhere. With that being said, it tasted good, not great. And a burger joint should have excellent burgers!"}
{"text":"My friend moved in to this building, so she frequents here alot already (she moved in a week before they opened. She was their first customer, and goes there on the reg because she can't cook.)

So she took me here.

It was great. I got the all american which was awesome. The fries were just meh, but I'll do the onion rings maybe next time. 

Also, the burger could've done without mustard. 

BUT
The meat was good. Fresh. Chunky. Yum

And the have the 100 coke drink machine thingy.

Who cares because..


THEY SERVE ICE COLD BEER.

Done. 

Don't need nothin' else.

Go here folks. Its fast food with beer.

FAST BEER FOOD."}
{"text":"I've been to Union Burger a handful of times now since they opened a couple of months ago. They have a great location at the Limelight building in the heart of Mississauga, right behind Sheridan College. 

Every time I visit, the service is top notch. The owner is always present and keeping everything in check while ensuring all the staff and visitors have a good time. The staff are friendly and always open to conversation. 

My favourite burger is the Goat Cheese Peppercorn Signature Burger - the peppercorns complement the burger perfectly. I've also tried both the regular fries and the sweet potato fries. The regular fries tasted a little dry and overcooked, but the sweet potato fries were perfect. Every order of sweet potato fries comes with a container of chipotle sauce, which is delicious. 

Lastly, this place has a Coke Freestyle machine. Forget the lackluster selection of fountain drinks most places have - this machine gives you 100+ drink options. 

So yeah, I definitely recommend Union Burger if you're in the Mississauga core. When UB hungry, go to UB!

Tip #1: They have a $6 lunch combo available between 11am-2pm, which includes a Little Burger, Fries (or Onion Rings), and a drink. Great value!

Tip #2: Union Burger is part of the SPC program - it gets you 10% off!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger is (before cooked) vegan, but they cook \"was told on the upper side of same griddle at all seven locations contacted. these patties on the same griddle as all the other burgers and was told that maybe first thing when they open and the griddle is clean then they could keep the oils from the hamburgers, cheeseburgers and even goats cheese all cooked on the same griddle. The cook was very nice and said even If we cook them a little to the side by lunchtime all would have burger fat ie grease on them (not vegan). Now to the fries, they are all cooked in the same oil as the chicken and even cheese products so         (not vegan) now last and you must know the buns that people rant and rave about are full of eggs (not vegan). This is not a vegan friendly place to eat and please all real ethical vegans DO NOT EAT @ Union Burger NOTHING is Vegan Friendly.
I would like to thank the staff at 7 locations we contacted about the cooking of Veggie Burgers, Egg Buns and Fries for being honest to us so we can let other Ethical Vegans know It's not safe for us to EAT. Thanks again Union Burger for the help and *WARNING to all VEGANS this place is off limits. Thanks again for all the honest help of staff for needed Information. *Not Vegan Friendly* Thanks ;)"}
{"text":"Their food was really nice when I last went there but this time. I had their ice cream and it was extremely delicious. I was walking around square one with my little nephews and cousins and we all got an ice cream, which is $1 each BTW. Amazing / but just FYI - VANILLA ONLY AVAILABLE."}
{"text":"The meat was fresh. 
Ordered the peppercorn burger.  Goat cheese was very tasty but the burger looked very empty. I wish theylarge amount oftoppings on"}
{"text":"The best $5.99 hamburger combo I have ever had. Puts McDonalds, Burger King and Wendys to shame. Fresh toppings and fresh cut fries. I went on a Saturday mid-afternoon so it wasn't busy just a few people drinking beer. They ran out of all soft drinks except Sprite and Canada Dry ginger ale. Parking could be a challenge at normal times though."}

{"text":"In my neverending quest for the greatest burger in all of the GTA, I've had the privilege of sampling q wide variety of burgers that range from abysmal to top notch.

Mississauga is not known for its burger restaurants as it seems like every other corner there is a McDonald's or a gas station. Culinary delectables are far in between for this city. 

I thought I had found a unique burger joint in Mississauga, however its not all quite there.

Union Burger is situated on the ground level of a newly built condo, part of the remarkable skyscraping housing boom in the centre of Mississauga in the last 5 years. Here you'll find more concentrated condo units than anywhere else within a 20km radius. 

The restaurant is new and clean, the seats and booths are comfortable cushions.  Even the ordering system is high tech, opting to utilize the pager system as it takes 5-10 minutes for them to prepare your meal. They also have a fancy soft drink machine offering a variety of Coke infused products and other Coca Cola products such as Dr. Pepper and Fuse iced tea.  Of additional note is that they offer beeeeeer!  I cannot think of any fast food joint that offers beer as a refreshment!  Other burger joints should take note.

However, that is where the positives end.   The burgers leaves a lot to be desired for and could definitely use a much needed improvement.

The patties are overcooked, and dry bland taste. The initial visit did not seem that bad, but on the second visit it felt like eating bland cardboard. Or at least, what one would imagine eating cardboard would be like.  I found it very underwhelming, not seasoned enough, and just did not taste as good as it looks.  The buns also do not help as it too was dry and hard to bite into.  I think they may be using pre-frozen patties?

It is important to mention that I did not completely finished my burger both times as I could not bring myself to finish it.  

In retrospect, McDonald's serves a better Quarter Pounder burger, even if it's frozen unhealthy crap. 

Union Burger showed so much promise - with its clean and sleek lines in their dining room, the offer of beer on the menu, to the fancy soft drink machine.  Alas, if only their burgers were as good as their physical restaurant presentation.

The quest for an even better burger than the last continues.."}
{"text":"I was really confused about what happened with this burger, but it's my first time ordering from here so I can't say I was familiar with their items. There was no lettuce, tomato or onion which might be one of their signature things or it might just be that the burger I ordered doesn't come with these things, but it was an element to the classic burger experience that I really missed. I don't like Kraft cheese slices, the stuff that I can't tell if it's cheese or actually plastic itself... so it really added to decreasing the quality of this burger for me. The patties however we're really well-done, they were juicy and not overcooked which was deserving of three stars. The bun itself was nice as well; soft and has a slightly sweet and savory taste to it. Bacon was pretty good, it was well-cooked and not overly salty. The onion rings were amazing, they were crunchy and not overly oily. The fries were lacking, it was so salty I actually needed to drink water and it left an unpleasant aftertaste, so they were tossed out. I decided to upgrade  my drink and try the oreo cookie and cream milkshake which was pretty good, but still too sweet for me. I can see a kid thoroughly enjoying this, but for myself personally it was too sweet. 
I was disappointed that they didn't carry a side salad as I had originally ordered it instead of the fries, but I was told they no longer carry salad. But this wasn't a big deal as I was just trying to placate the guilt I felt having such a heavy indulgent lunch. Lol
Overall the burger patty and the burger bun we're really good and I could see myself ordering from this establishment again. Perhaps there is an option for additional things like lettuce to be added to a burger when you order in person (this was a skip the dishes order). For $1.99 more you can upgrade from the pop to the milkshake which is a pretty good option. The entire combo with milkshake cost around $15 so it's not a bad price point for a burger, fries and a milkshake."}
{"text":"Came across this brampton Burger joint and was pleasantly surprised! 
Pretty nice inside and they serve beer ! 
The burgers are tasty and had the poutine and it was pretty tasty aswell gravy was good and fries were crispy . If your in the area give them a try !"}
{"text":"Excellent services, staffs are super friendly. We have ordered chicken club and all american they were both fresh and super yummy. Will definitely come back again. Its a good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Very good!  Delicious burgers, Poutine and outstanding shakes. Service was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Chicken so raw I don't even know how someone could pull this off. Please see my attached pictures. I bit into this.  Bravo, truly remarkable

Wish me luck guys, this isn't gonna be fun waiting to see what happens"}
{"text":"Service: They were pretty quick.

Burger: Tender and Juicy

Fries: A little too salty, something about them that i can`t even finish their fries...probably because i get too full from their burgers.

Drinks:Love how they're re-fillable and the best part is that...all the flavoured cokes are in their system. 

Price: Really PRICEY.  Like i said, you do get what you paid for.

I come here sometimes when im outside the mall or when my friends and i are not feeling the mall food court at all. Ambiance itself is really nice. Such a nice place to hang out though."}
{"text":"Average. Average. Average.  Ordered the Swiss Mushroom burger ... It was so overcooked, almost dry.  Nothing dripped onto my plate.  Others that experienced the same thing were not wrong.  McDonald's serves a better tasting burger.  The location however is perfect, great fast food environment.

Burger's Priest is the benchmark.  UB doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"Good selection and fairly priced.  I love the onion rings. Kids meal chicken nuggets very good too!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger place and it's near my home and it's always busy and they have Tv and we can watch games and the place is clean and the stuff are nice and the menu is great , if you want to add a topping is free and only some toppings you must pay and know they have Wings so I need to try this place and the have a pop machine and they have all flavours and I recommend this place for party , etc .... 

10/10 :)

Try all American burger it's so good and try the onions rings and try mushroom Swiss burger !!"}
{"text":"@unionburger #BURGERLOVE #YELPGTA

I've been here for an UYE - and a couple of times since. Can't believe I didn't pen this review sooner. The big plus for many of you guys out there? Get the fast food experience with a side of beer! 

Located conveniently close to Square One and Sheridan College, the space is nice. However, finding free parking is an issue around this place, especially if you don't know Mississauga well. 

As for the food, the burger isn't crumbly (I expected this to be a bit of Five Guys, Burgers Priest) - I would even go to say a tad overcooked. I've tried the little burger and little cheesburger (good sizes for little), and the mushroom-swiss signature. And I have the same complaint for each. The sides, however, are pretty fantastic. The sweet potato fries are perfectly seasoned, and the buffalo chicken poutine is excellent - spicy, I can probably only eat very little, but I've known others to love it. So if spice is your thing... 

Verdict? I'd solely come back for the nice comfortable space UB provides, for a small casual meal. I guess it'll take me some time to become a fan of their burgers!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I stumbled into his place when going for a jog and decided to give it a try with my girlfriend. Luckily when it first opened they were generous with coupons and made the high food price a little bit more tolerable. Those coupons were a great idea, since they've sold me and got a returning customer.

The place is clean trendy and a fancy coke machine. Prices as I said was a little high, but food quality is above regular fast food standards. I personally recommend the Canadian burger, the meat is perfectly cook with a your choice of toppings. Input whatever is in a regular burger and their amazon chipotle sauce. Yumm, I devour this burger.

The poutine is quite tasty also, however i feel this is not consistent every time I visit. Sometimes it is drenched with gravy, sometimes not, sometimes fries are crispy and sometimes not. Once they perfected his maybe they might just get a 5 star for me.

Thy also offer a great patio to hang out with your friends. Eat and enjoy the nice summer sun or the cold winter air :)

This joint is great and I'll be back. I'm glad they are not stingy with the pop and offers free refill. One thing they can improve on is the poutine. And it has the potential of being a weekly regular for me."}
{"text":"Best Burger place around! They even serve beer and it's cheap at 2.49 per bottle. The onion rigs are the best I ever had. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place  best burgers in Brampton! They have a coke machine with lots of different flavours will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Hmm...kinda on the fence on this one..I attended the newest mission of the GTA Burger Brigade and I was pretty stoked to try it, considering it was relatively close to my old neighborhood.  Union burger defnintely had my attention as I chose the new Triple patty Bourbon St Burger.  \"Fresh made to order\" was a slogan that was strewn across different signs on the restaurant, but finally getting my triple decker, bourbon flavored, cheesey burger...I was a little disappointed..  The burger itself seemed a little on the small side.  I estimated the size to be 3 4oz burgers (12oz total), but when you compare it side to side with the single burgers that others in the brigade had (6oz patties) kinda feel a little cheaped off.  The burger had all the marking of being cooked on a flattop grill (no grill marks, crusted edges) it seemed very dry.  I personally love flattop burgers, because of the juiciness and the crust, but this burger puzzled me on why it was so dry.  The pretzel bun that the burger was served on was also very chewy and I didn't enjoy it. The redeeming parts of this mission were not so much the burgers, but the side dishes! The buffalo chicken poutine....awesome...great taste! great portion size!. The french fries were good, but some were a little soggy, but a great taste!!  Union burger also has an amazing beer special...$2.50 domestic bottles $3.50 import bottles!! every day!! you can even combo your meal with a beer, fries or salad for $3.74 All in all not a bad burger experience, but the next time I think I will try one of the single burgers and one of the highly advertised milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I first tried Union burger while waiting for a YEE event near Square 1.  Since the location was literally next door to the event...a bunch of us tried it and it was pretty good.  This is only my second experience with Union Burger and compared to the last experience with another chain a couple of days ago...this concept and location is great!! 

I was doing jury duty at the Brampton courthouse and I noticed there was a Union burger close to the courthouse.  The location was optimal to me getting back on time, so I tried this location (Steeles and Hwy10).  This location of UB is quite busy as it is located near Shoppers World Brampton and the numerous government offices in the area.  I was intrigued by the huge..Bacon Poutine Burger..everything I want...bacon...beef...potatoes..cheese..gravy all on a burger...awesomesauce!!  

Knowing from past experience at UB..I opted for the combo and grabbed an ice cold Coors light beer bottle from the ice cooler at the front counter.  I also noticed that there are numerous premade signature burgers here as well and I was kinda torn between the Bacon Poutine burger and the Peppercorn Goat cheese burger..other combinations include...the All American..the Mushroom Swiss..and others.   They also have a couple of choices for the chicken option if you so desire as well (burgers and wings), plus they also have a couple of different meal sized poutine's as well.   Another thing from what I hear is that their milkshakes are awesome.  I have yet to try one, but that will be coming shortly.  The service here was quick and friendly and my food came out pretty fast considering the number of orders ahead of mine.  They do ask your name so you can sit down at your seat and they will call you when its ready.  The quick and dirty...Bacon Poutine burger...pretty good...maybe not as flavourful as I hoped but it was good.  Meat..pre-formed but more than adequate.  Toppings were fresh...fries...fresh cut and tasty..beer..cold and cheap..

If you in Brampton and Mississauga and want a burger...try Union Burger...you can't beat the price...$13.78 for a burger combo with a beer!! The value is excellent and I would gladly eat there again...5 stars"}
{"text":"I live near this location, and they have a few amazing unique choices. The buffalo chicken poutine is amazing and I 100% recommend it. Along with that I love drinking their cookie and cream milkshake it's great. The one thing that I wish was better was the price. It's pretty expensive for pretty average burgers. It also takes a long time for them to serve."}
{"text":"Im a fan of this place. At times its hard to find a burger joint with juicy fresh patties that are unusually huge in Mississauga. At least this place has it. 


It wasnt bad at all, I got the orginal cheeseburger with bacon and mushrooms(extra) with a poutine. The burger was great and the patty was thick and juicy the poutine was good as well. I love the buns they use here. They dont have just burgers, they have philly cheese steak sandwiches, milkshakes, salads etc. 


They have a Coca-Cola machine here with every flavour of soft drinks you can think of. Literally. It gets packed usually but you dont have to wait long to get your order."}
{"text":"I come for the poutine. I'm always on the hunt for a good one. And at ub you get quality and quantity for a reasonable price. 

Btw never had anything else of their menu, therefore this rating is solely for the poutine...someone say poutine?? lol

Let's talk about the location, not accessible depending on the direction your driving down Steeles. But I'll make the extra turn to access it. 

Walking in, you're greater with a nifty outdoor patio...no beers on the patio though, they don't allow it. There is ample seating. Some bar style, booths and a cool round table for larger groups. They have a number of tvs situated around and it's usually locked to the sports channel and CP24.  

The seating area is well kept and clean....hold on my buzzer thingy just vibrated...poutine is ready!!!!

Ok so and I devour my poutine, I'll finish this off! I say give ub a try, I heard their burgers are good but I can't be certain till I try it myself. (Mom's homemade burgers kicks butt)

Btw did I say I got the poutine?"}
{"text":"My dad was craving for burgers during the week so we decided to try out Union Burger earlier this evening. There weren't many customers around 6 pm so we were able to order as soon as we got there. It came out to approx $55 for five people. The majority of us ordered the bacon cheeseburger while my mom got the classic grilled chicken. I really think it's pretty cool that they serve beer at this burger joint. My dad and boyfriend both opted for the domestic beers for their combos.

We were given a beeper so that we didn't have to stand around and wait. It took about 10 minutes for all of our burgers to be ready. I also liked how they have many drink options than just the standard coke, sprite, root beer. Everyone enjoyed their burgers and said they would also give this place 4 stars. Omg, you definitely need to get their onion rings. They were amazing! So fresh, hot, and crispy. The fries were meh.

I will definitely return in the future if I want a burger. I'd rather get a burger here than pay for one in a restaurant and also pay tip."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and rude whenI went. But completely ignoring that fact, this burger joint is very \"meh\". Meat is overcooked and flavorless, and overall nothing that stands out from your average burger place. They are extremely lucky to have a student populated location because otherwise they'd have been closed down already"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a UYE, so needless to say, I had a good time!

Food-wise, here's the scoop:
Cheeseburger - I know what the signs say, but the patty tastes like it was previously frozen.  The size is too perfect and the texture is a bit chewy.  Patty itself was a bit dry and fairly tasteless, re:  not seasoned.  

Since they charge $0.60 for a slice of cheese, I asked if it was processed and apparently, it ISN'T.  It's cheddar cheese that they use.

Fries - Good, crispy, and seasoned.  Not sure if this was just the batch that I just ate, but I seemed to eat all the end pieces, but they were good.

Sweet Potato Fries - Tasteless, a bit soggy, and depended too much on the chipotle mayo.

Onion Rings - Crispy, batter was quite thick, but tasteless.

***BONUS:  Domestic Beer for $2.49, Import for $3.49.  So I'm guessing this place is geared towards Sheridan students - across the street.***

Miscellaneous:  No wifi, no recycling bins, the cool Coke machine almost made me drink pop.

Tip:  Park on Prince of Wales just East of Union Burger.  Still not fully developed yet.  OR underground Living Arts/Civic Centre/Library, free after 6pm!"}
{"text":"These are the best burgers i have ever had. Ever! Period. Even just a plain cheeseburger is to die for. The poutine is superb! I ordered through Skip and the food always arrived hot and delicious. I would definitely recommend and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Burgers are awful and overpriced. I had the Great Canadian and girlfriend had the Mushroom Swiss. You can just taste the low quality of the meat and toppings. Any of the fast food chains like McDonald's serves a better burger. Beers are pretty cheap though so at least there's that. Go to a place like Milestones if you want a good burger."}
{"text":"Nice patio! 2.50 beers! Value combo is good! Takes a really long time (15 to 20mins) to get your food! Not always consistent! Forgot bacon on chicken club!"}
{"text":"It was a decent meal but hands down it doesn't even come close to a five guys or burgers priest experience. This is definitely not on that level.

The good - coca cola freestyle machine is great for drinks and even though I was disappointed that it wasn't a sesame bun surprisingly it was tasty, fresh and did not fall apart.

The meh - i ordered the all american, the two patty's were decent but nothing overly interesting in terms or juiciness or char/crust.

The bad - fries and onion rings.  I tired the the regular fries, sweet potato fries and the onion rings.  All tasted frozen.  

Overall probably won't be back with all the other great burger options available elsewhere"}
{"text":"I was a regular customer of Union Burger during their first few months. Went back once in a while after. But then tonight was the WORST EXPERIENCE Ive ever had.

The burgers are still good..

But how can you come back to a place that  has a RUDE EMPLOYEE. The cashier lady who was on the shift (November 23 between 1030pm-11pm) looked so pissed at the 2 customers who came before us because they had so many questions and were indecisive (since its their first time). Me & my friend saw that the cashier lady rolled her eyes at them while the 2 customers are talking to each other about what food to get. There wasnt even a long line-up, t'was just us waiting on line... She was just unreasonably pissed.


And then, when it was our time to order.. She didnt greet/smile or anything.. And just looked like she doesnt care about the customers or worse, her job. We asked some items on our burger to be substituted for another, and she just shook her head while she was doing the adjustment on the POS.. Which made us feel SO uncomfortable. 

Overall, food is a 3/5
But service was a 1/5 for tonight.

Regardless of how good the food was, that  encounter with that rude cashier makes us not want to go back.

Hope the management does something about this."}
{"text":"Great place, good atmosphere. You got burgers, buffalo chicken poutine(it's really good) plus you can grab a beer or two love this spot"}
{"text":"Came here for the fries.

For Home fries I was expecting them to be a little bit more thick cut.
Nevertheless they were good.

I asked for a side of mayo and got a little container no charge.  They also have hot sauce and ketchup that you can put in little containers for take away which is pretty cool.

Lots of seating here."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment looks wise but the food is anything but great and the staff is very slow and unhelpful. 

I went with friends and was happy that they served beer but the food took forever to prepare almost 20 Min's for a burger and when the food came it was prepared wrong and they forgot to put my friends order through so wasted another 15 Min's for them to fix my order and prepare the order they messed up.  

Honestly save your money this place is a mess."}
{"text":"Fun and clean environment with a great atmosphere. Food was fantastic, no complaints. Excellent customer service and had a great experience with the owners. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon for lunch since I was going to Celebration Square which is 2 blocks away. 

I ordered an Original Cheeseburger Combo. $9.99 plus tax.
The order took about 10 minutes, I didn't time it, but that seems about right. 
Service was great, friendly and helpful if I had any questions. 
I was surprised to have my order presented on what looked like a circular cake pan and not the usual flat tray. No big deal. Just something different. 

Great meaty burger, nice and juicy. 
Fries were just fries but I was glad to see they had Frank's Hot Sauce , so I made my own spicy ketchup dipping sauce for them. Great idea I had there, if I may say so myself. :) 
Since they have the Coca Cola Freestyle machine there, and I've never used one before, I spent a minute or two looking over the different screens since the place wasn't busy with new customers coming in , though there were about 15 people already seated. 
I ended up choosing a Barq's Root Beer and Fanta Orange combination. I thought it was actually pretty good. 

The one missing star in my rating is because of the cramped space in the restaurant.
With Sheridan College across the street, I can see this place being jammed for lunch on a week day, so I may just stick to it on weekends because even with the place about 1/2 full, it still felt packed to me. 
Maybe too many tables? Not sure. But I still have another month or so before I have to worry about it being packed like that with it being summer break. 
 
I will definitely have to come back for their lunch special (11-2pm) for a small burger combo @ $6. Though the regular priced, original cheeseburger combo I had was great for the price, when compared to some other restaurants."}
{"text":"We just purchased 4 combo burgers at the UB at Living Arts Centre in Mississauga.

We were all extremely disappointed.

The burger patties were hard and overcooked, probably frozen.

The french fries (which are advertised as hand cut) were definitely not, and frozen, and tasted terrible.

The poutine looked like it came out of a blender, and was just a big mush.

This was probably the worst burger experience we have experienced.  There is way too much competition for these folks to pass this food off as good.

Never to be back.

Dale."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night dinner with my wife, ordered the pouting, bourbon burger, all American burger and strawberry milkshake. 
Burgers were prepped fast, built well and delicious.
Pouting was a little cold but full of flavour. 
Milkshake was the star of the show."}
