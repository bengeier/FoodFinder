{"text":"Was in the area doing some shopping and decided I needed to eat. Was going to hit one of the old standbys in the immediate area and noticed this place. Was up for something new so gave it a try. Dan was behind the counter and I told him I had never been here. He gladly have me a quick but informative rundown of the menu and a couple recommendations. I ended up going with the kalua pork rice bowl and couldn't have been more pleased. A mostly sweet dish with just the right amount of savory. Place was very clean and the menu was very simple to navigate. They have a selection of hot and soy sauces to add to your dish but I didn't find them necessary. In the plethora of Asian style places these days, this is a definite standout."}
{"text":"Almost a 40 minute wait for one pad Thai and nothing else. The staff didn't seem to care and just said \"we have new kitchen staff\". Will not be back."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my husband. I ordered the classic ramen broth bowl, but they let me sub the ramen for yakisoba noodles, which I loved. I added chicken to it and was in heaven. I'm still thinking about it and want another today! Husband ordered a wrap, and said it was good, but was disappointed by the size, even though it did end up filling him up. The interior is clean, modern, and trendy. I would actually want to go and eat here as opposed to the take out we got(which was moderately slow, but still piping hot). My only disappointment was the boba I got. I ordered the lemonade boba, with strawberry puree and the lemonade was powdered and the puree didn't taste like strawberry--I think the tartness of the lemonade overpowered it. It wasn't worth the money. Overall, I will be going back, even though it wasn't the most inexpensive, I still want that bowl again!"}
{"text":"Found this place 3 days ago and have come back every day since, it's that good, lol. :)"}
{"text":"First time there and the food was good.  Looking forward to trying the other dishes. I came in and it was a bit empty during lunch on a weekend. Hopefully they get more business."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try because it's close and a better option than fast food. I was very disappointed in both my meal and service. There were three small parties that had ordered before me, none of which had gotten their food. One by one they each went to the counter asking what the wait was. It was crazy because there were five people working at the time. Following a twenty minute wait, the food came out with dry steak and overcooked noodles. A mush pot of noodles with dry meat on top. It's unfortunate because the menu is good. I will never go back. Over fifty dollars for four entrees of this quality and poor service.... no thanks."}
{"text":"Tried for first time. Pretty disappointed. Had Red Curry dish. It's mostly rice and the rice wasn't even fully cooked. Decent flavor and chicken was good but rice was big distraction."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. crab bao was amazing. BIT STAY AWAY FROM SAUTEED BRUSSEL SPROUTS. Some other person on here recommend them, and it must have been a cruel joke cause these taste terrible."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice and both times have loved the food. The staff is friendly and very accommodating.  Some things on the menu I didn't know about and they explained what they were. Not a bad meal to choose from in my honest opinion. I'm a big guy with a healthy appetite and have never left hungry.  The tea's are very good and the balls in them are diffrent and add flavor to the tea. The restroom is very clean as well as the dining area. My goal is to try everything on the menu.  If your looking for something unlike anywhere else in the valley, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"They used to have the awesome things called Bao. The steak and blue was my favorite and they had a seafood one. Both were excellent...and they got rid of them. My wife's favorite was the caprese bao. RIP. Why get rid of the best menu items?!"}
{"text":"My family lives in Gilbert so I was super excited to try out Sobas.  Saw their Facebook about opening weekend. Popped in to try a bowl and got some brussels sprouts as well. All around really great! Speedy and super delicious. I'll definitely be back, it's now in the rounds for when I visit friends and family in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it so much! Have gone 4 times in the past 2 weeks and never had a bad experience!! The Mac and cheese is my favorite!! Recommend it if your a foodie!!"}
{"text":"This boba tastes like disappointment.  I was SO excited for this place and I wanted so much to like it.  When my husband came home with a bowl of the pho, spring rolls, skewers, and two bobas I was thrilled!  The pho was basically just tasteless noodle soup, the skewers were 70% fat, and the spring rolls looked like they had been assembled by a random teenager.  The boba made me the most sad.  The middle of the boba seemed undercooked or something and the tea was just boring.  They don't have any jellies or anything fun.  I am crossing my fingers that they will fix these things.  The whole experience was just inauthentic all the way through.  It costs the same as going to an authentic place, too!  It is so close to my house, if they could just improve these things I would be there every day!  Until I hear it gets better I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"super fun and modern inside. the food was just ok. was really excited to try the crispy brussel sprouts, but they were really just mushy from all the sauce. also got the spicy alfredo but theres no bacon in it like it describes lol. its ok but not anything that i would be craving to go back for."}
{"text":"My second time here. The first time I got the pork bao. It was alright! The price, portion, and quality didn't all match up though.   This time I got the kalua pork rice bowl. The topping - pork, peppers, pineapple. All great. The portion of pork was very good. But the rice.... dear god the rice... the staple of the dish... it tastes and had the consistency of Uncle Ben's \"boil in a bag\" instant boxed rice. I can say wholeheartedly, unless the rice changes... I probably will stray away from the bowls, or the restaurant all together."}
{"text":"I am so ecstatic about this place. I am on a no gluten, no egg and no dairy diet at the moment and have not been able to find anything good to eat. I came in here expecting to be able to eat some rice but to my surprise they had a ton of options that they could change to what you wanted. Wonderful service!! Fast! This is an awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and really like the Bao Mi sandwiches.  I agree with other reviews that the prices are high for what you get.  Hopefully the owners will adjust based on all the feedback.  It's a nice change of pace for the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service! Worker cleaned off baby chair and asked to pick up my son to clean area around chair and to help me put him in high chair. Manager came out and greeted us, asked how food was. girls at the register were very nice, kept waving at our 9 month old that was clearly flirting with them. Food had lots of flavor- place was clean, employees kept busy, clearing tables, atmosphere was relaxed"}
{"text":"I work nearby and have been excited for a new place to open to change up my lunch routine. I came in a few days after opening to find a nice looking place with friendly staff. I ordered a Pad Thai bowl with chicken, which was decent, but came in a VERY small portion. I'm not a big guy and I don't eat a ton, but honestly felt like I would have needed another bowl to fill me up. The selection is a little limited, and on top of that, $12 for that small amount of food does not bode well for me coming regularly, at least for lunch. Additionally, my credit card was charged twice for my meal, a situation I discovered several days later. Ultimately not that impressed."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since the place opened for decent ramen. Sadly, the business has consistently declined, but today was the final straw. My son's yogurt (go-gurt, which comes with the kids meal) was expired and served to us that way. The manager and staff were very apologetic and comp'ed our bill, but this is a simple thing that a restaurant should be on top of. What else are they serving that is expired?  The manager explained that he just took over the business. Hopefully, this place improves."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Sobas and when I bought my teammate and I lunch it was nothing like the picture. I tried the steak and bleu bao bun and don't get me wrong it was delicious but the fact that I paid $9 each entree to get a tiny bao bun was disappointing. I was like \"where is the rest of it?\" The picture made it seem big and $9 was a reasonable price (or so I thought). I was complaining to my GM William that we would never go there again. Totally ruined my lunch time but of course I eat every hour so I made up for it  Who knows maybe the rest of the menu won't be so bad on the entree size wise but don't get a bao bun and expect to pay $9 when you only get half the size. I'm just saying...."}
{"text":"You're all idiots. They have great steamed buns. I have an elder Chinese man that lives in my head and approves of their steamed buns. Ample parking"}
{"text":"Way too overpriced for the portions you receive - food was nothing special, and their boba tea was very watery"}
{"text":"The wasabi Caesar salad is amazing!! I added the rib eye and it was pretty lean and great in the salad. My husband has loved everything he has tried from the edamame to the brussel sprouts to the ramen. The people are always friendly and the place is very clean. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Costumer service was fantastic. Staff was so friendly and accommodating. Our food came out hot and the service was quick. Good was delicious and the proportions were generous. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"OMG, worst pho ever. Advise to owners: Go try what pho tastes like before you sell it - and don't serve completely wilted condiments - ruins the appetite. Not even close to what pho is... Smh"}
{"text":"Good Lil spot to take care of your  pho  kick and not pricey don't have to drive far good food"}
{"text":"The food are fresh but they can tone down the sweetness. We ordered  Asian chopped salad, their signature red curry and even their spring roll sauce. All the sauce in their dishes are sweet...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I had the Pad Thai & my husband had the Yakisoba stir fry. Both were delicious!  On top of that, I loved that they were handing out a promotion card of one meal (bowl) per month until December!  There were a lot of people in line & staff was handing out bottled water while we waited to order!  Very nice touch!"}
{"text":"Looks like they are trying to hard to create an Asian fusion type of restaurant. Disappointed in the food prep and quality. Ordered the Pad Thai and Gyoza. Didn't finish either of the two. Couldn't tell who was management and who was the regular employees due to all the gossip coming out of the staff."}
{"text":"Today was my first time in this restaurant. I had the peno popper with crispy brussels sprouts. It was fantastic! The peno popper was spicy and flavorful, not an overbearing hot and I can not say enough about the brussels sprouts! They were crispy and a sweet spicy to perfection.  The restaurant prices are very reasonable.  Items range from $5.00 - 11.00.  The staff is friendly and helpful. The owner was stopping by everyone's tables to be sure everything was good and making sure everyone had what they needed.  Anytime I am in the area, this will be one of my stops."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday. The deco is very nice and the service and attentiveness was great. The Bao mi was delicious ,lots of flavor, but the Mahi Bao was lacking flavor. The Asian slaw was disappointing, they need to work on that. I'll give this place another try, there were some items I would like to try. My only hesitation would be the prices. A little high for the amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing costumer service, they seem to really care about each customer. I watched the staff go and talk to every person that was there to see how everything tasted! The boba drinks are really good too!"}
{"text":"Second time here I ordered honeydew melon blended boba. Would it recommend it because the flavor isn't for me and it's made from powder. regular size is expensive for what the drink actually is. The noodles I got (takeout) did not contain ANY chicken and I am disappointed because I ordered it with chicken. Gyoza was alright, came with sweet and sour sauce, which is bizarre. $20 for all three items and would not return. Honestly Noodles and Company does it better haha"}
{"text":"So I don't typically go to new places but decided to stop in tonight after hearing about it. They've been open less than 2 weeks and logical people realize there are always bugs to be worked out. The owner/manager greeted us, explained the menu and what different things meant, made some suggestions that were completely out of the norm choices for my husband and I. The staff were all very friendly and the decor is really nice. They brought out our appetizers first the spring rolls and pork & seeds - both were delicious! Then our entrees were Bao Mi and Sriracha Alfredo with a side crunchy brussel sprouts. All the food was fresh and delicious. I don't even like brussel sprouts and we ate them all! My husband who is a meat and potatoes kind of guy really liked everything and suggested we bring our family back soon. There's enough spice in the food to give it some kick and good flavor but not overwhelming.   The plating of the items was very nice too!  So keep in mind this place has been open 2 weeks and go give them a try!!"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss.. my favorite thing is the crab bao, but the last 4 times I've been. THEY'VE BEEN OUT. The ramen is ok, the pork bao is usually pretty mediocre at best. It's not like real Chinese style pork belly. Kind of seems like thick bacon. The bibimbap is terrrrrible. The picture makes it look so good, but just say no. I do love the Taro Cookie shake. That is awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife kept raving about this place and their Ramen, so during my first visit, I was very impressed. The food was delicious, the establishment was well kept/clean and the staff was friendly. I give then extra credit on friendliness because we showed up 20 mins before closing time ?. That said, we had the 'El Gaucho', the Red Coconut Curry and she had some Ramen. The El Gaucho was by far the best tasting. The Bao Buns with beef, roasted corn salsa, southwest aioli, cilantro and crispy tortilla chips went so well together. Almost reminded me of a Mexican taco with an extra fluffy tortilla. I truly recommend these. The Red Coconut Curry was a little on the thicker side but still extremely tasty. Not too spicy and not to over powering either. The Ramen was a bit on the salty side for me, but still good nevertheless.   This place is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"The menu before was a lot better, I think they recently revamped it due to many not ordering certain things off the menu? Not sure but the recent changes aren't great either. Ordered pad Thai, which didn't have a garnish of carrots or cilantro, more like a carrot and cilantro salad inside my pad Thai. Also clumps of egg that were not sautéed into the mixture. The rest of the meals, bao mi and coconut curry had the same issue, minus the egg of course. Hopefully, it's a better choice next time I order."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. The teriyaki bowl had flavor and was an alright portion. My friend had the chow mein and was really disappointed though."}
{"text":"It's probably somewhere between a three and a four star experience, so far as this casual eater is concerned.  The food is quite tasty (we have chicken skewers that are a bit spicy as well as an entree each between me and my wife: she had Pad Thai and I had the Steak and Bleu).  Nice atmosphere.  Though we'll definitely go again, my only concern is I thought the prices were a bit high: we spent $30 (roughly), and it didn't seem like all that much food.  But -- as I said -- I'd definitely go again and try something different."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for a bit ;so glad I finally did! Ashley and Kim were very helpful with my dietary restrictions and made ordering quite simple. Had the Pad Thai and it was amazing- light , just the right amount of spice with a hint of citrus. Perfect for the two of us to share.  The atmosphere is crisp, clean and cozy. We will be back. Thank you for the pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"We Went Sobas and I feel compelled to write this review. No exaggeration here-- we literally tasted our Bibimbap and Pad Thai, left our plates at the table, and then walked out the door."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this restaurant. After reading the past Yelp reviews, I think I should mention, that I'm not picky about my ramen. If the food tastes good when I visit, I am happy. I ordered the Gyoza Ramen and thoroughly enjoyed it. The portion was a little on the small side for me, but it was delicious.  The staff was extremely friendly, and the pricing is about the same as your average Chilli's type restaurant. The ambiance was crisp, clean and a tad retro which was OK. I will return and would recommend this establishment to family and friends!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were apprehensive at first due to all of the bad reviews, but we wanted to give it a chance. Anything Asian fusion is a big risk, but it is possible and it can be done! I can't say the same for Sobas. I ordered the Korean mac and cheese and my hubs ordered the yakisoba stir-fry. The Mac and cheese was extremely soggy and the cheese sauce was so watered down and lacked flavor. I actually had a stomach ache after eating it! The yakisoba tasted bland as well and it's as if they poured a watery teriyaki sauce all over the noodles. The pork belly was way to crunchy and dry. I would much rather go to Panda Express and get a bigger bang for my buck (I don't even like Panda Express!). We dare not try the boba since the food was so blugh. I'm giving two stars since the interior was clean and modern...and that's about it. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Love Sobas! Thank goodness there is a fresh, healthy Asian food restaurant in the east valley! Food has consistently been great. I get take out here almost every week! The inside of nice for a casual meal as well. Highly recommend the Bao Mi, Pho, red curry and Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"WAY better than Noodles & Co.  I'm still recovering from that experience.  They are privately owned they do a pretty good job.  Gyoza Ramen was tasty and my wife liked the Pad Thai.  It's Americanized but we're in Gilbert AZ.  Whaddaya expect.  Exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch. Portion was the perfect size to fill you up and not leave you in a food coma. I got the Yakisoba Teriyaki. My husband got the chicken teriyaki. Mine was delicious with good flavor. His looked like it could've used a little more sauce. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! Try the El Gaucho Bao with a side of Brussels Sprouts. This our second visit and we have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful atmosphere. I love these types of places because I don't feel horrible after eating. Their menu includes a variety of food, I ordered their Ramen and I added in pork belly, was delicious, ordered their Beef skewers and I highly recommend them. Also tried their edamame, seasoning was on point but it seemed a little overcooked, I still enjoyed it. Overall: 5/5, tell everyone!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for good bao for years and was thrilled when I found this place on yelp. Their bao was soft and delicious. The filling was flavorful and a bit spicy. The brussel sprouts were delicious. Only complaint was the missing aoli."}
{"text":"Let the count down begin to another inevitable closure.  turning away customers away at 8:45 is not a good restaurant model for success, closing at 9:00 pm is another bad business decision."}
{"text":"They changed their menu and nothing is good anymore. Would've liked to try the wasabi Caesar salad or the Korean mac and cheese, but I guess they didn't go over well."}
{"text":"I am desperate for new places in my area, especially for boba. I tried this place yesterday - which was their 1 month anniversary since opening their doors. We only had the boba and it was great. My husband ordered the chai boba. It tasted like they made the mix themselves instead of it being a powdery, pre-made ones at other places we have tried. They were out of the taro frozen flavor which is what I was there for so I tried the honeydew which was really sweet but good!! I like how they have a rotating \"flavor of the week/day\" for boba. The greatest part about this place was the friendly service and the ambience. I'll definitely come back and hang out and get a boba to escape the heat! Can't wait to try their taro flavor!"}
{"text":"This is one of those pretty places with ok food at best. Service was nice and food came pretty quickly but I was the only one in the restaurant. 8pm wed night. I ordered the ramen and one of the baos. Ramen was small for what you paid for and the flavor just ok on the salty side. The chicken seemed dry and presentation wasn't great.  The Mahi bao was dry too. Ok flavor but not enough for me to want to order it again. Really wanted this place to be good and maybe when they're established they'll tweak their menu to improve their food. I won't come back until they're at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"I usually have the gyoza - I like it.  The real superstar on the menu is the Brussel sprouts. They are crispy balls of soy sauce, with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"A lot of the negative reviews pointed to bad flavor, but I actually thought their food was pretty good. I got the bao buns and pad thai. My biggest complaint is the price. This is just a quick-order restaurant, but the prices are closer to fine dining for the amount of food you get. It's literally 2x the price compared to Pei Wei for the amount of pad thai served (assuming you get chicken or beef). I spent $25 not including drink on 2 bao buns and pad thai, and I left hungry still.   I work in this shopping center and looked forward to eating here a couple times a week, but I just can't afford to."}
{"text":"Seriously... How is this place not at least 4 stars? The boba tea is really good and reasonably priced. The food is really good, also decent portion and reasonable price. They have a very diverse menu. I got El Gaucho sandwich today and it was excellent! Couple that with a yummy boba tea and I'm a happy camper! :-)"}
{"text":"My husband grabbed Chipotle and I thought I'd give these guys a try, as I wanted a lighter option.  I ordered the Spring Rolls and the Pad Thai (spicy) w/ added chicken.  The total: $17.00.  This price is waaaaay too much for what I got.  The least of the issues was that this was a lunch size portion.    The Spring Rolls tasted like lettuce (only lettuce), but I will add that they had more flavor than my Pad Thai.  Pad Thai is super yummy with a little bit of kick.  This was neither.  In all honesty, it was the blandest food I have ever eaten.  No.Flavor.Whatsoever.  I did get my order to-go, so maybe they forget the sauce???  But judging from what someone posted about the Pho, I doubt it.    If you're looking for healthier Asian cuisine, go elsewhere.  Overpriced and Underflavored."}
{"text":"Sobas is a great place for \"fast casual\" Asian \"fusionish\" healthier versions of food .  Ok I know that sounds long and confusing but this place isn't as simple as calling it a \"Ramen Place \" or \"Fusion Asian \" but what I can tell you is that the food is impeccable and amazing ! The food itself has a healthier feel and taste without compromising flavor .  It is not heavy or fatty .  Oh and they have Bao BUNS !!  Myself and my wife went on a Sunday after Church and I ordered Yakisoba with Pork Belly and she ordered Ramen with Chicken .  Both were cooked perfectly and beautifully displayed .  They were not overtly salty or greasy and the veggies were fresh and crisp .  We also had ordered regular BAO buns with side of crispy  brussel sprouts , but there was a miss communication and it got missed ( we didn't pay and I didn't notice ) but the manager politely and graciously got us an order and took care of us !  ( NOTE : the Bao buns are spicy !! But tasty like really really tasty !! ). We also got Chai Milk tea with boba and and regular green ice tea and both were perfect ! The chai was lightly sweetened and the boba tasty as expected !   Overall we were quite delighted and felt the whole experience was enjoyable.    The only complaint I have is not really something they are doing wrong but I have to say it.  My only issue with this place is the COST $$$ it's quite pricy ( 9$ for buns and side of brusselsprouts ... ) and 10$ for Yakisoba bowl with pork belly .. So you could order entree for you , your spouse and 2'drinks and maybe an app( bao) and it will be nearly 40$ which for a fast causal place is a bit much but not unheard of .   Over all I really enjoyed and felt the price was on par for the most part but it's not somewhere we can afford to eat at more than 1 time a month or every few months"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Siracha Alfredo noodle bowl. Large portion, very tasty. Servers friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Awesome food, Ebone came out to ask how the meal was. How often does that happen with fast food? I came here because the lines at subway next door were long and very glad I did. I'll be back!  5 stars for fast food. Crazy. I had the Yakisoba Stir fry which was really good and tasted clean and natural."}
{"text":"Had the Yakisoba Stir-Fry and shared a Bao Mi. Dang! Tons of flavor. Service was great and it's a cool environment. Worth checking out. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to pop in and grab a quick bite to eat. The food is freshly made and yummy. Been here several times and it never fails without a double... soooo good. The roasted Brussels sprouts are amazing along with the Korean chicken. I also enjoy the pork belly sandwich. A must try."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Price was good for lunch, portions were a good size and service was great.  Its a fast casual place.  You order at the counter and take a number to your table and they bring the food to your table.  Their menu is simple to read and understand and they have enough variety but not trying to cater to every single craving #cheesecakefactory #menubook (eyeroll). Since they are new they want to please.  We spoke to the manager and I offered some ideas for a dessert Bao.  they said they didn't have a freezer so they couldn't do it, but that also tells me that without a freezer, everything is fresh. I would go back here and take clients or friends."}
{"text":"Nice surprising find.  The soba stir-fry is nicely portioned and full of flavor. The chicken bites are amazing.  Try the iced teas for a great compliment to your meal.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here.  Being honest, I haven't spent much time at noodle houses so I don't have much to compare to.  That said, I left happy.  The Ramen was terrific as was the pad Thai.  Boba selection was lacking, especially when considering some of the options not far away, but this is just an observation.    Try it out!  Looking forward to trying Bao next time."}
{"text":"Today was their grand opening and I thought the line was going to be crazy, but it wasn't to bad when we went in for lunch. Every customer received a free bowl which I appreciated :)  I ordered the Korean Mac and Cheese and my fiancé ordered  the Yakisoba Stir-Fry with pork belly plus .I wanted to try their Honey Dew boba but the cashier said she wasn't sure if the drink was frozen enough. She let me sample the boba before ordering it to make sure that i liked it. It was a nice gesture that she let me sample it first or else I would have been disappointed because the boba was to watery. We ended up getting the Thai tea which was good and they gave us free refills which was nice.  The Korean Mac and cheese was interesting but good. I never would have thought to put kimchi and pork belly with Mac and cheese. The Yakisoba noodles were a little to greasy for me. I think maybe because we got the pork belly and the fat from it made the noodles greasy. My fiancé said he would have enjoyed it more if the pork belly weren't so crispy and if they added more vegetables. Overall the food & service was good. The interior was nice and clean. They were fast at wiping down the tables and made sure the tables were available as soon as customers left. The manager was attentive and went around the restaurant asking customers how their food was and thanked them for coming in. I'm giving them 3.8 stars because of the long wait to get our food and the pork belly was over cooked. I understand it was their opening day so they were busy but we waited over 40 minutes for our food. I'll be back though to explore some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this place and it did not disappoint! We went with an open mind after seeing a couple negative reviews but that's expected in the first week of opening.  Our family of four wanted to try a variety of menu items so we ordered several and shared.  The ramen is delicious, has a super flavorful broth and a perfectly soft cooked egg....couldn't keep my kids out of the bowl. We also tried and loved the gyoza, edamame, Asian slaw, wasabi Cesar salad, spring rolls and rib eye skewers (husband ate before I could take a picture) and the Brussel sprouts. Highly recommend the gyoza and Cesar salad...both are sooooo good. Also, the Brussel sprouts are to die for...I could eat a bowl for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The staff was super friendly and helpful with recommendations. Great portions and food came out quick and hot. Next time we plan to try the different bao and sriracha Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing teriyaki stir fry. Ready to go back and explore more of the menu. It was busy at lunch and the only tables were too high for a highchair for my toddler."}
{"text":"The interior is clean-cut, trendy, and open. They offer a variety of Asian food (fusion, japanese, thai). They also have boba beverages that are made from powder.  Pros: -Customer service: I have been here a few times, and they are always helpful. If it wasn't for the customer service, this place would get two stars. Their employees will give you recommendations, engage you in your likes and dislikes. They're also VERY quick to serve the food. -Restaurant itself is nice. -They have different options, particularly bao buns. I LOVE baos and was glad to see this place had it. The bao part was pretty soft, not too dry. The filling was an added bonus.  Cons: -It's a little too fusion. I felt like my dish had an Asian name but it didn't taste very Asian. -The Thai tea was mediocre. The texture felt a bit chalky. -The boba was horrible! It felt and tasted weird. A lot of boba doesn't have a taste but this one had a weird, slight metallic taste. The boba was also hard! It wasn't break-my-teeth hard, but it felt like biting into a stale gummy worm."}
{"text":"Very Nice restaurant, but food was just ok.   Expected so much more. We also tried out the pho, but was very bland and did not taste like authentic pho. I tried the ramen which was ok, but I rather eat package ramen then spending $10 for a bowl of ramen from here."}
{"text":"The food is so good! Don't understand the low reviews. Good food, I shouldn't have listened to the star rating. 6 of us came and ordered different food. Bao Mi, Gyaoza Raman and rice bowl. All cleaned up"}
{"text":"The food here was terrible!  We ordered the kid's meal bao and it was awful. Burned - they called it grilled - but as you can see it was BURNED. And it was a long wait for our order which is odd because the place was empty.  Maybe the wait was long because they were busy chatting it up and laughing in the kitchen burning the meal."}
{"text":"First I'll start with we frequent this place. We come here at least once a week. So I write this in hopes that this gets corrected. We come at 11-1130 on Saturday's. It is clear that who ever closed the night before did not clean tables, counters, soda dispensers, bathrooms nor mop the floors. So the folks who opened didn't either. The soda dispenser in the overflow catch thing has an old dried lemon that clearly has been there for days. This place used to be impeccably clean. It's just not any longer. It worries me that the food quality is being treated the same."}
{"text":"I was disappointed how deceiving the restaurant name was considering they barely have soba noodles. Although pricey, the food was decent but again, they charge you several extra bucks if you want meat."}
{"text":"Move on, everybody. This place isn't good for ramen. I should have known better when I saw beansprouts in the ramen... Sigh.  The broth is crap, pork looked like it was microwaved, noodles were mediocre and there were beansprouts in my ramen!  For those looking for good ramen, either go to Clever Koi, Tampopo or Fujiya Market. Sucks because I live near this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten in and ordered out from this place multiple times and every time it is spot on! I must say I'm a creature of habit and get the spicy ramen each time, so good!"}
{"text":"So I finally went to Sobas today and was pleasantly surprised. The service was very prompt and friendly, the atmosphere is very nice. I ordered the pad thai and while it's not a traditional style pad thai noodle, it is very good. The green tea is excellent! I will be going back."}
{"text":"After shopping at restoration hardware we came across this restaurant and was very excited at the concept. I love boba, I love Ramen and I love bao! It's like a match made in heaven. Now I love how the decorated the place and the concept was very promising. Even the service was great. The ladies there were so friendly and eager to help. We got our boba milk tea first and the milk tea was decent but the pearls were undercooked. Now the food is what really needs help...we ordered the ramen and the noodles were not cooked. We had to sent it back and they kindly remade it. I also ordered the bibimbap. But to be honest the food all seemed packaged even my rice tasted like Uncle Ben's packaged white rice. I doubt they made any of this in house. I asked the girls if this was the only location and they said yes. I then asked if the owners were Asian and she said she was unsure. My feedback to them was to get a first generation Asian's opinion on the food...it will be enlightening!  Concept is cool but definitely needs help on food. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This is what $9 gets you for the BAO Peño popper. Do yourself a favor and go to chipotle a couple doors down. Had the boba too and it tasted like sweetend milk water"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu looks so good. I chose the steak and blu grilled bao with side of Thai basil chips. So amazing. Can't say enough good things about this place. Fast service, amazing food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is THE place in many ways: fresh, hot food delivered to the table with concerned personnel who care about your experience. Have had numerous dishes -- all perfect. Consistency at its best -- our entire marketing staff loves it. Tevana tea! Brand new and wants to impress you!"}
{"text":"Great service! I was ordering Boba for a friend who wanted a flavor they did not have.  The manager or owner (didn't get his name) was more than willing to custom make a flavor and offered to let me try it beforehand.   He made two versions of the Boba, one with milk and one without and let me have both to take home to my friend.   The food was delicious to top it off.  Can't wait to go back to try other dishes that caught my eye and of course more Boba."}
{"text":"Yummy bao buns. Got the steak and bleu. Yummy boba tea. Lost one star coz the Bao bun I wanted was out of stock"}
{"text":"I was initially so excited when I saw this place was going to open, so I made it a point to go try it as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I did not find this place worth the time or money. It's a sad attempt at Asian Fusion without the authentic flavors. The portions were small for the cost. The ramen tasted like instant ramen with added embellishments to make it look more appealing. The baos were alright but not worth coming back for. The milk tea tastes literally like Lipton tea bags with milk/cream added and the boba was still hard. Also, the description on the menu describes boba as having a sealed lid... when it actuality, it had a regular lid. Not a big deal, but I think the menu description should reflect the actual item."}
{"text":"The food tasted fresh and this is a healthier option that a lot of faster food places. The Brussel sprouts were really good! The spring rolls were just ok IMO, but loved the B sprouts. My husband has the gyoza ramen and really enjoyed it. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Great food, service and setting. Had the salad and really liked it. Kids had ramen bowl and loved it. Definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. We ordered the Korean Mac n Cheese and Ramen. The Korean Mac n Cheese was boxed Mac n Cheese with kimchi. It was grainy and taste less. The ramen noodles were soggy and the egg was cold.  Both dish had way too much green onions on it."}
{"text":"I got the bibimbap.  I honestly wasn't expecting Korean bibimbap since this is fusion food, but they really should not use this name! The flavors don't blend at all. The meat seasoning is goopy and the pickled onions are super overbearing.  The other ingredients: raw carrots, raw spinach (nothing about them is \"kimchi\"-it's just raw spinach), a ton of raw green onion (at least 1/2c), bland over easy egg, and the worst of the worst is the rice- it tastes like minute rice. Extremely disappointed even with low standards."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Nice atmosphere but full of staff standing around doing nothing while we wait excessive periods of time for simple, but expensive food. Staff was clueless! Going to be out of business in 6 months..."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food! My go to is the Gyoza Ramen. Their boba is pretty good too. We have been multiple times and the food is consistently good and the staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"It just wasn't that great. Beef skewers were tough and bland if not dipped in the sweet chili sauce. Pad Thai was not close to authentic...bland and overloaded with sauce; more like a watered down peanut sauce rather than Pad Thai sauce. Plus, expensive for what came to the table as well. I was excited before we tried it and they super bummed with disappointment when we left."}
{"text":"Nice interior. Good food. I had the teriyaki bowl and just about finished it. I got full. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times the service is always great and the food is always awesome and the kids love the kids meals would recommend this for families couples singles a great place with a healthy menu for everyone"}
{"text":"Taro Boba Tea! This lavender-colored libation is my fave now that temps are in the 100's. Paired with the Korean mac and cheese --- boom.   And who thoughts crispy brussels sprouts would be a must have at an Asian spot? Order them."}
{"text":":(   I wanted SO badly to like this place. The restaurant's interior is beautiful and it makes you have such high hopes for this place. Great interior design and look. Unfortunately, the food and high price for such small plates were disappointing. We ordered skewers, bao mi, and soba salad which were not very good attempts at Asian fusion cuisine. I felt the flavors were off and needs refining. I gave them the 2nd star for their service and for recognizing that I wasn't very happy with my meal. I was offered another dish but declined as I wasn't excited about anything else on the menu.   Bottom line: Skip this place for now. They have some work to do."}
{"text":"At Sobas I got some bobas. :) Eh, it was alright. Note that we only had bubble tea here, or \"pearls\" as the cashier called it. My matcha green tea with boba was OK, but had a very very light taste of green tea. I do appreciate that it wasn't super sugary tasting like other places though. The boba itself was decent, not the best but not the worst. The teas came out in no time and the atmosphere itself is very chic and contemporary, kind of like you're in a spa rather than a bubble tea and Asian fast food shop."}
{"text":"I got so excited when I found out this restaurant was opened. It is beautiful inside with modern design. But the food was a huge disappointment. :(  Boba milk tea - Lack of tea favor, not sweet enough, lack of milk as well. Boba is hard. Ramen Noodle - The broth is not hot enough, adding the raw and cold bean sprouts make the whole bowl even colder. Very very salty, tasted like soy sauce mixed with a bit of water.   Gyoza - This is deep fried \"pai wei\" style, authentic Japanese style is no where like this.   Good chef is not easy to hire and I always wonder if restaurant owners aware what their food tasted like. I wish they could make something taste better."}
{"text":"I won't come back. I like their concept to have many different Asian fusion styles of foods. However, they are way over priced for the portion and ingredient. The Pho noodle is not even close to the picture on their menu. It taste too much like boiled soy sauce.   $28 for two with two boba tea taste watery, it's not worth the money for what they have to offer. I give them 2 star because of their friendly staff.  I came home still very much hungry."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my lady and we really, *REALLY* enjoyed our dining experience! We ordered the steak skewers, classic ramen with spicy broth, pork belly bao, and Thai tea. Everything was really, really good! The steak skewers were tender and juicy, and the sauce which came with them was wonderful. The ramen was really good- definitely not a substitute for a place which specializes in ramen, but good nonetheless. One extremely nice touch was that the egg was perfectly soft-boiled, which is a rarity at most places. The pieces of pork belly in the ramen were really delicious- perfectly crisped yet tender and flavorful. The bao, though, were a five-star food. Perfect little sandwiches, they've become our new craving in the casa. Today we ordered delivery from Grubhub, and the food was again really good. One critique that I have to make, though, is one that several other people have made:  their rice really needs work. The \"Uncle Ben's boil-in-the-bag\" description cinches it, and the Bibimbap genuinely suffered for having crappy rice.  So please, folks, buy yourself a few good commercial-sized rice cookers and start steaming your rice. You have to, and once you do I'll bump you up to five stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the bao mi and Brussel sprouts for my side. It was delicious, light and fresh. I was stuck between what side to choose and the gentleman taking my order helped with the decision, he was very nice and friendly. Loved the inside decor."}
{"text":"Very good, unique food!!  Have been here twice and was pleasantly surprised both visits.  the boba drinks I ordered weren't that great (I might not have ordered the right thing), but the food (have tried the ramen soup, bao with jalapeño, and the brussel sprouts) has been excellent!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst pho/ramen we have ever had! The pho doesn't even have proper pho noodles. Both soups looked and tasted like soup from a can. Quality was awful."}
{"text":"Excited about this new place! You HAVE to get the huckleberry lemonade - it's delicious! I had never seen huckleberry lemonade before, so I was excited to try it. It wasn't just a flavoring syrup like you'd expect, it was a real fruit puree. Really refreshing during the hot afternoon. I'll definitely be back to try it with boba added in.   I was nervous that the edamame we got to start would be really bland (usually not a huge fan), but it had a nice balance of salt and red pepper flakes that gave it a great flavor. I got the pho bowl with rib-eye. The rib-eye was tender but the portion size was a little on the small side. I didn't find the broth too salty at all.  I saw a few people get the bao buns, and they looked yummy! Excited to stop back in and try them."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing bowl of ramen I've ever had in a restaurant. My broth was not nearly as hot as expected. My soft boiled eggs were cold. I drove way too far to have bland food. Place is clean and tidy so that was nice. No authenticity at all. I should've walked out as soon as I walked in."}
{"text":"Came in today to try a new place and didn't realize this was first day it was open. Very friendly staff and well decorated. My husband got the penne and I got the bao mi. I loved the bao mi. So good. Also got the herbal mint tea with boba, just a touch of sweet with the boba.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! I ordered the ramen with pork belly (sans green onions because taste) and the Bao Mi. The broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork belly was cooked crispy on the outside and soft and melts on the inside. I removed a few bean sprouts (personal preference) and added a little bit of the provided chili oil and fresh ground pepper and I was on my way, didn't stop until the girlfriend shoved one of the Brussels sprouts that came with the Bao Mi in my face, and it too was tasty.  Then bao itself has great flavor along with the sauce and meat, but a bit too doughy.. again personal preference. The lady got the pho with ribeye, broth was a bit thin but still decent, the ribeye was a bit thick of a meat than we are used too, maybe do some thin slices and it will blend in better. Will definitely go again soon!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place out while I was in the area waiting for my car to be worked on.. I ordered the pad thai added chicken & shrimp, a bit expensive but glad I added them as the meat ended up being the only part of the dish I liked! The noodles were too sticky and there was SO much sauce, anytime I tried to eat the noodles the sauce went flying everywhere. The sauce was also WAY too sweet. I couldn't eat the noodles due to excessive sauce and there were too few bean sprouts. ): I ended up eating just the shrimp, chicken, & bean sprouts.   My boba was yummy. It was supposedly mango flavored.. It had a very faint taste of mango but I liked it.   A nice man approached me (I believe his name was Mike? He never told me and I didn't ask him. But the cashier told me as I was leaving) and asked how my dish was, when I advised him that it was too sweet for me and the texture was different he had advised me that they don't use a wok to stir fry the noodles.. I'm no expert but I thought pad thai was traditionally cooked that way? He said they were working on tweaking the recipe. He even went as far as to test out my suggestions in the kitchen and bring me back a small bowl to try it. It was still too sweet, but less saucy and I would have preferred it over what I was originally given. He also gave me a coupon for my next visit. (:  Sobas definitely has some improving to do but I think they'll be a great place once they work their kinks out. The staff is very personable!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times because of the location near my home. The best items in my opinion are the pork belly bao and matcha boba drink. The pad thai, ramen, salads and bibimbap rice bowl were not worth the money. The service seems rather slow but the food was fresh. I have eaten in and dined out. If you are looking for something a little different in the area, this is not a bad place to try, but stick with the bao."}
{"text":"Third time here.  First 2 times i had Pad Thai and this time Thai Cobb salad.  The ingredients seem very fresh and it tastes real good (or we wouldn't have been back).    :)  Everyone we've ever talked with here has been really nice and they come back and check mid way to see how your meal is.   I'd recommend you try it even if you're not a big Thai fan.  You may want to just ask them to make yours not too spicy.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The portions were small and the noodles dishes were too salty. The pad Thai was absolutely disgusting.  Should have gone to Panda Express next door."}
{"text":"Came with some friends. Loved the atmosphere. The food didn't match in my opinion. Friend had pad Thai.  It was more of a mush and not great.  I ordered a the Thai Cobb Salad. I asked for it with only romaine lettuce. The person taking more order said they could use the lettuce base of the Northwest Salad (romaine, kale and cabbage). I would have been great with that! Not a fan of iceberg. My Salad came with mostly iceberg. I let he person know who brought the salad that it was wrong. She proceeded to to tell me it was right. I asked the guy who took my order. He told me that they changed the mix to save money and that even though it says kale, romaine and cabbage that it is really and iceberg romaine mix. Okay?? So why did you not tell me when I ordered?? His response, I didn't think it would be that big of deal. Clearly, that is why I was asking. Both employees made no attempt to make it right.  Okay, fine I'll try it.  Salad would have been great otherwise but I think skimping on ingredients will ultimately cost them.  My friend had the pad Thai.  It was mush at best and not very flavor-able. My wife had ramen. She likes it but it didn't blow her away.  I want this place to be good so bad but not very well run and the food is sub par.  I will probably try again and order something different to see if my opinion changes."}
{"text":"I will give this two stars because the service was good and we did like the brussel sprouts. Everything else we ordered was not good. We had high hopes because the menu looked great.  We had pad Thai, bao mi, siracha alfredo, gyoza, edamame and the yakisoba stir fry. It was lacking flavor or had some odd flavoring to the dishes, pastas were a bit mushy. The gyoza had a weird texture. The Bao mi was soggy on the bottom bun. The edamame wasnt cooked entirely. We wouldnt go back but appreciate the staff friendliness."}
{"text":"Fresh ramen, fast service, cool place. Grateful to have this new spot in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I honestly wish this place was better but every time I try it again, I am always disappointed. I was extremely excited for this place when it was first opening up but after trying several of their dishes...it's just not worth trying again.   I feel like they are trying really hard to do an Asian fusion menu with items that just don't go well together. They really need to rethink and readjust their menu.   I was hoping with place would be my new go to boba place but that's definitely not going to be the case :("}
{"text":"This place gets two stars for atmosphere and cleanliness. But no stars for the food... If you're looking for super \"Caucasiannized\" Asian cuisine this might be your place. But if you know your Boba tea, Pho, &, Raman don't do it. You don't want to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Yelp discount incentive and they have a rewards program. It's a semi-casual area to eat. The food has its own taste. It's not authentic Asian food, it's just an adaptation of it. The boba drinks are from powder as oppose to tea, which is normal for places that don't market primarily boba."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something DIFFERENT, then this may be perfect.    My wife, toddler and I went with my sister-in-law and brother-in-law.  The other couple each got bowls and my wife and I got Bao's.  They paid $3 extra for chicken and they said they got a ton.   Our daughter got mac and cheese.    This place isn't cheap.  For the 3 of us it was $41.  We did get an appetizer though but with no desert.  Most of the food was tasty, but portions could be slightly bigger.  The bao bread is very doughie.  I thought it was odd that you had to ask for tea refills at the front instead of getting them by the soda fountain in the back.  We will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Try the iced tea on tap.  I had the steak pho the first time.  It was very spicy, but they used too much pepper.  It definitely is not a traditional pho.  The next time I had the ramen with egg on top, which I thought was much better. Unfortunately, not really designed for family seating or small kids."}
{"text":"Outstanding Asian themed lunch. Great Bibimbap. My kids loved their Ramen and chicken skewers. Much better than the usual fast food options."}
{"text":"I came here the other day because I was craving Pad Thai.  Unfortunately their Pad Thai did not taste like what I am accustomed to in most Thai restaurants.  It was good, but just had a different flavor that I was expecting.  I ordered it with tofu.  The tofu was really greasy.  The atmosphere is nice.  It was clean and relitively quiet, and the customer service was good.  It is close to work, so I will give it another try.  I will not order the Pad Thai again.  Definitely want to try something else."}
{"text":"Im giving it 2 stars for the brussel sprouts and because the ramen isnt that bad, just nothing special. But I have only been here twice and probably will never come back. I ordered the bao mi sandwich with brussel sprouts today and it took like 25-30 minutes to get to me (all of the people who came in after and ordered more got their food WAY before me) i gobbled down the sprouts because i was starving and then attempted to eat the bao. Wow, probably one of the worst things ive ever spent money on. Hard to eat, soaked in a super vinegary sauce, tiny slices of pork inside a massive bun. The only good part of it was the pork and there was like none of it. I dont normally write reviews, and even when i do i try to be as nice as possible, but im sorry this place is wildly over priced for some pretty mediocre food. Dont bother."}
{"text":"Must try it! Super casual with an eat in area. Outside tables but not when it's 118 outside! Kids meals are around 6.00 each bowls were 7 if you add a meat it's 3.00 more the Korean mac and cheese had an overload of green onion and was super cheesy but good the pad Thai was our favorite and had great flavor! The Brussels sprout looked awesome and next time I will try the bao mi with the sprouts as my side. Salad were around 9.00 and starters in the 4-8.00 range. A little something for everyone and if the kids aren't adventurous they offer a Mac & cheese or a chicken quesadilla! But the honeydew blended boba was AMAZING! hope it keeps coming back in the weekly rotation is was super refreshing on a hot day!!!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. The food wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad, it was alright. What kind of bothered me was that the workers were in the kitchen area eating In N Out and then grabbing food and bringing it out before washing their hands."}
{"text":"The pho is not very flavorful and the add ins are not fresh. The ramen is pretty tasty though."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly staff! Should have gone here instead of the panda nearby. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here MANY times, I usually enjoy their menu and the drinks they offer. Decided to try the fresh spring rolls today since I didnt want to drive to a Vietnamese restaurant and Im less than 5 mins from Sobas. I was a little disappointed at the spring rolls,  for 2 spring rolls, it costs $5... With NO meat (Shrimp) in it yet. It has more bean sprouts than the noodles they would typically have at a Viet restaurant. The sauce was good though. I also usually order brussel sprouts everytime I come here, and it seems like there's way too much soy sauce when I ordered today. You can really taste that there's a lot of sodium/salt in it. Other than that, it's one of those food spots that have an Asian flavor to it but still has the Americanized twist. I'll be back though, just will save my Spring rolls cravings for an actual Vietnamese restaurant. Bao Buns here are very good though!!! And as always, I love the structure of the building, very nice theme and clean."}
{"text":"Their tea is awful,and the only sweetener they have is sugar granules that do not dissolve in your tea, and they have you do it yourself. What kind of tea place is this? And their service is unfriendly and cold. I've had at least two tees there that I could not drink. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Great fast casual Asian fusion food. Using fresh ingredients and throwing in lots of flavors this is a jewel waiting to be discovered.  I hope it lasts!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this spot near my work. Very nice, clean, friendly restaurant! Food is delicious I got gynzo ramen noodle. Bought avocado boba was to sweet. Overall good"}
{"text":"The food was great, the Bobas were tasty (try the avocado-it will not disappoint). Ownership is very present and easy to talk to! I recommend going in! The salads are super fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Very limited menu and previous reviews elminated pho. I ordered pad Thai. Way too much cilantro!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly!! Great set up! Match tea with boba was amazing. Mac and cheese to die for! Also baby changing station in the bathroom is always a plus as well as cool high chairs! Little kids can fit at the high top tables just like mom and dad! We will be back !!"}
{"text":"We came here after seeing their Facebook promo for a free bowl on June 4th, so we stopped by to check them out. The atmosphere and decor is really clean and welcoming. The staff was nice. I got the pad Thai with pork belly and my husband got the ramen with pork belly and we also got their taro smoothie. The taro smoothie was super delicious! Very creamy and sweet and had good taro flavor. They had just added more liquid in the machine to make more so it was more of a drink than a smoothie because it didn't have time to freeze into a smoothie when I ordered it but the flavor was pretty good and I'd definitely be back for that. The food on the other hand was pretty disappointing and we will probably not be back. If you're looking for authentic Asian flavors, this is not the place to go unfortunately. The pad Thai was very bland and watery and there was equal amounts of bean sprouts and shredded carrots as there were noodles. The flavor was truly lacking and the texture of the noodles are definitely not what you would get at a Thai restaurant. Their pork belly was wayyyy dry and overcooked and shriveled into jerky-like strips. Their ramen broth was really salty and just tasted like canned broth and wasn't anything great. I did like the way they cooked the egg, it was medium cooked and still had the gooey yolk center. The lady next to us ordered the pho and when we saw the bowl and portion size of it, we were glad we didn't order it because it was so small and there was hardly anything in there. You can go to a Vietnamese restaurant and get a huge bowl of pho with tons of noodles and meat for under $7 bucks, so to come here and see the portion size and ingredients in the bowl that made up the pho, we were super shocked. Their spring rolls were like 6-8 bucks and the menu didn't even mention any meat being in there and it was like an additional $2 for shrimp to be added in there. You can get bigger spring rolls with meat and shrimp at a Vietnamese restaurant for under 3 bucks!! If you're looking for authentic flavors with good portions, this is not the place unfortunately. It's very Americanized and lacks flavor and spice. I knew this the moment I walked in as there weren't any Asians working behind the counter. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would enjoy this place, but it just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"I love their bao bun menu. I am also a big fan of their brussel sprout. A place to go for asian american fusion food. Tried the Korean mac n cheese, it is good but not a fan of it due to its mix flavoring for my taste. The place is really nice and well designed."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times with my boyfriend, each time I order something new and each time I'm happy.  Last time I got the curry bowl and enjoyed that for dinner that night and the leftovers for lunch the next day.  The prior visit I had the Ramen bowl, which wasn't quite as good, but was still acceptable for a quick dinner.  The first visit was the Pho and that was quite delicious.  Also, each time we've ordered a side of the roasted Brussel Sprouts, which are phenomenal!  I am glad this place is so convenient to us, we will be coming here a lot on nights we don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Over priced food for the amount you get. I will not be back. Wish I would of read the reviews before trying..."}
{"text":"If you know what real Boba milk tea taste like, this place might not be your first choice. My friends and I were in the general area and was excited to see a new place selling Boba in Gilbert. Without any hesitation, all of us walked right in expecting a delicious cups of Boba milk tea.....ah....no....  I got a taro milk tea and the Boba tastes weird. The taro flavor is decent but not great. Overall, I really am not impressed. This place is decroated beautify and is definitely a comfortable place for hang out. I saw that they do serve some Asian cruisine on their menus. If the drink tastes like this, I'm afraid to try their food.   I think I'll stick with the Boba milk tea place at other establishment that is actually authentic. Hopefully, this place will improve their drinks down the line. Best of luck!"}
