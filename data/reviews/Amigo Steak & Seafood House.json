{"text":"This restaurant specializes in Chinese-style Western food.  We came here upon recommendation of my aunt for lunch.  It's bright, airy inside with tables and booth seating.   We had the lunch special which changes every couple of weeks.  Japanese-style chicken which came with soup, vegetable and rice.  It also included bread and a coffee/tea/hot cocoa at end.  It was delicious.  I can't remember the price, but it was around $5-6.  We went and then stopped by the Chinese bakery several doors down (see my review) to have some snacks for later."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the kind of place that you dine in once and never want to re-visit.   Where do I begin, from the look of the menu ( price and selections) I thought what a deal and was eager to try out their food.  Then, everything went downhill once the waitress arrived to take our orders.  She was inpatient and rude.  I ordered the lobster special with lobster soup and my friend ordered steaks and ribs combos.  I liked their salad dressing, it is quite tasty but the lettuce leaves were not fresh, they looked brownish.  The soup tasted weird, no words to describe it.  When the main course arrived, I was totally disappointed, the halved lobster was chewy and the sirloin steak was thin and the sauce tasted bland.  Half way through the meal, I was ready to put a piece of carrot into my mouth and noticed a piece of hair stuck into the carrot.  My friends all took a look at my plate and we found more hair stuck on the broccoli.  We called the waitress to our table and OMG the waitress took the carrot and broccoli out of my plate with her bare hands in front of me.  Shortly, she went to the kitchen and return with a plate with four carrot pieces on it and said they are clean.  ORZ  I don't want to continue my review anymore, you get the picture."}
{"text":"When the Restaurant first open, it was a breath of fresh air.  Great Food, Great Service with a smile, Great Ambience.   Juicy Steaks and pastas, Amazing Variety of Desserts.  Unfortunately this restaurant the past 3 yrs had been taken a huge spiral downhill.  Completely Opposite of what it once was.  One would figure it would return to the days of what it once was...!  Unfortunately it's Closed Down Now."}
{"text":"Well that was much ado for nothing.  My mom and dad kept noticing this place every time we go to the plaza, and always wanted to try it. Well, we finally did this past weekend for dinner.  Their selection is quite extensive, with a lot of choices and such (and different combos). There was also live entertainment from a Chinese person singing some folk music (I bet you he was lip-syncing though). I ended up taking the $25.99 combo (soup, salad, entree, dessert).  I had the Lobster Bisque for soup, and it felt like tomato soup. No lobster at all. Scratch that, no lobster TASTE at all as well. The scallop salad...well, I didn't expect the scallop to be fried, so that was a disappointment. The rib eye I had was average at best, but I've definitely had better in other places. We also had dessert, which was some sort of mango cake if I remembered correctly. Their iced tea is terrible as well, bland taste."}
{"text":"When I want some Chinese style western food for lunch, this is my go to place. They have set lunches which is a great deal because it comes with soup, bread (my favorite bread, you have to go there to understand) and Hong Kong style coffee or tea.  My favourite dish is their fish and chips. It comes with a small salad (so you feel healthy not just eating fried food) and fries. The fish and fries are done very well. It's very crispy and the batter doesn't fall off the fish. It's just delicious.  I also like their sandwiches and noodles. Their rice and choice of protein combo is not my favorite but it's good. My parents usually enjoy that combo though.  The place is clean and the service is good if it's not busy. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this restaurant a 0.5 literally, why? Well i'll begin with the service of this place. The waitress didn't give me a smile when I dined in, and didn't ask me if i wanted a glass of ice water or tea. Instead she gave me tea, and I did not want tea. The place was beautiful, but the chairs were kind of dirty, very unpleasent to even sit on. I was the only customer in there that time, and no one else was there except the workers and chefs.  Lets start with the menu, it was very simple. Just two pages double sided with very little varieties to choose from. The meals are very expensive, the least on that menu was probably the drinks, which is coke, pepsi, etc for like a dollar. There's also steak, ribs, chicken, salad, soup, etc. Pretty much this place wanted to replicate a \"fancy\" cuisine restaurant. Ok, I ordered this meal with rib and grilled chicken with spaghetti, and for my drink I got an HK style hot tea, and my meal came with a caesar salad with the combo. The appetizer came immediately, and I was happy but I waited at least 25 minutes for my main course. Yes, 25 minutes of my life waiting for some simple food for one person. The salad tasted like sh** , it had too little caesar sauce, and way too little croutons. The HK style hot tea came with my meal after the long wait, and it had too much milk in it. I was very unsatisfied. It would have been better off just drinking milk, instead of milk tea. The ribs were anorexic, very little meat on them and were too over cooked. The chicken was supposed to be grilled, but it tasted like it was just boiled. It had too little seasoning on both the chicken and the ribs. The spaghetti tasted so plain with a little splash of tomato sauce. The sauce itself tasted like it was just used right off a can of spaghetti sauce, where you can buy at any local supermarket. The food was absolutely disgusting. Maybe one of the worst restaurants i've been to.  In conclusion, I don't recommend customers to go to this place to eat. The price was just way too much and the portion of the food was too little. This restaurant is a great example of the kind of place that you dine in once and never want to re-visit it again."}
