{"text":"Awesome taste!!!! Although it Looks like a dirty little hole from the outside, it's clean and nice on the outside, and their flavors are to die for...beef green curry is my favorite.  Hot and sour soup is also an item we always order when we go in"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! 

My wife and I used to order from here 5+ times a year. Their pad Thai and sticky rice with peanut sauce is consistently awesome, and the eggplant and green/red curry chicken/beef is awesome too. Just a delicious, cant-stop-eating-everything experience, every time. We'd often take out and order extra. 

The food is spiced perfectly - some dishes are hot, some mildly hot and some mild. 

I really hope they reopen somewhere because other Thai places don't measure up to Thai Plate!"}
{"text":"Thai Plate is a hidden gem in the city. Parida (one of the owners), is not only a warm and gracious hostess, but a phenomenal cook, catering to the speciality request of her guests.

Our family goes regularly to the restaurant and can't say enough good things.  We eat the vegetarian menu regularly and the food keeps us craving it for days. The portion size is generous but not over the top. You'll leave thinking about what to order next time."}
{"text":"Meh food, but probably one of the nicest delivery guys I've ever met. 

I'm of the opinion that Thai food in Toronto is sort of like Chinese food in a small town: all chicken balls and chop suey. This place is no different. They have the standard cashew chicken and other stuff that I imagine Thai families don't actually make at home. I knew this was the case going in, but no one at work wanted to drive to get food, and the places I usually go to nearby were all closed due to the Jewish holidays, and this was the only place that delivered so we ordered from here.

It was honestly not bad. I had the Spicy Eggplant, which wasn't the best I ever had, but was pretty good. The sticky rice I had on the side was really great, and came with a nice peanut sauce. My coworkers ordered the mango salad (a little mealy and sweet, not spicy at all) and the Shanghai noodles, which were actually these clear, broad, tangly noodles that I've never seen before. It tasted good enough, but it wasn't anything to write home about.

Like I said, the delivery guy was super nice. All smiles and thank-yous. He came with a debit machine in hand, which was cool. I'm not sure if I'd ever order here again, maybe if I were having a craving for fast-foody pad thai."}
{"text":"Extremely good food and excellent service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really great and reasonably priced thai food! I had the pad thai, mango salad and an assorted appetizer. I have ordered delivery on several occasions and it has always been prompt and delicous! :)"}
