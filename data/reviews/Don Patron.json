{"text":"First time here, did not disappoint!  Food was great, service was excellent.  Loved the margarita.  Will definitely be back.  They accommodated our dietary needs with no difficulty."}
{"text":"If I lived nearby, this would be my go to restaurant for Mexican food. The meat in the Fajita Burrito was fresh and grilled to perfection. The braised pork was full of flavor and not the least bit overcooked.
The staff was super friendly and the service excellent.  This is a great place to go for Mexican food that is tasty and not super spicy.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service. Food is good. Good beer selection. Could definitely use some upgrades to the patio. Very very clean. All in all a good Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit here this week.  The food is excellent, the staff amazing, the ambiance wonderful.  Jeesh, what more can I say.

They did everything but hug me when I walked in the front door.

I ordered Chile Relleno's (2) with rice and beans.  It came out quickly, hot and fresh.

Everything was superb without being too big.

Thanks Don Patron, wish I could take you home."}
{"text":"First time eating here, saw the good reviews and thought we'd give it a try.  We enjoyed our meals and drinks!  They served the food quickly and it was delicious.  Plenty of food - enough for leftovers tomorrow which was nice.  The quality of the food seemed good as well, meaning the chicken and shrimp was both plentiful and juicy.

We definitely plan to come back!"}
{"text":"Fourth time eating here. It's normally really good. Went 1/28/17 ordered my usual a chicken burrito. My chicken inside of the burrito was so hard I couldn't cut it and upon dissecting it even more the chicken had black & brown spots all through it.  The staff is normally friendly my waitress was not friendly at all. I prefer the Hudson location, I visit there about once a week. Food and staff is better they also have a better rewards program"}
{"text":"The food was good. It is new so it very clean and the service was fast. I did find it kind of weird that I had to pay a dollar more to have ingredients removed from a dish."}
{"text":"Just \"discovered\" this restaurant about a month ago and have been there a few times. Very friendly and attentive staff. The food is flavorful with great variety. A nice place for families as well."}
{"text":"This is a great small Mexican restaurant. The menu is ample, they have casual seating, bar area and an outdoor patio. They do have two TVs in the bar area for entertainment. The  decor is truly amazing. Large portions! Staff is very friendly and attentive. Convenient to highway. I had a Fajita taco salad which was delicious! They give you chips and salsa as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place and right off the highway!  Food is really good with great prices for right-sized portions. But the standout is the super friendly staff and the beautiful murals on the walls."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It is clean and friendly service.  The prices are great and the food quality far surpasses El Campesino where I will never return again.  My husband gets a dish that I don't have a clue how to spell -- Chilequiles or something like that.  He says it's the best he's ever had.  We've been back a few times and will continue to return.  The location, I fear, may lead to their demise...it's so tucked away beside Walmart that it doesn't get much random traffic.  That said, they stay pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service
Clean
Great food
Pleasant staff
Helpful owner 
Love it and will go back!"}
{"text":"We showed up at the beginning of happy hour on a Saturday, when no one was here (the waiter was still tying his apron on). 

Despite getting our order wrong (immediately rectified), this place gets five stars. The food was stellar, service great, environment is great.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not only customized the veggie option but also provided a good service when it was about the time to close. 
Was traveling interstate and decided to take a break at this exit and just randomly picked this place and decided to give it a go. And it was delicious:)
Do try the mushroom burrito!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Mexican food that we've ever had. Everything had a strange aftertaste and the margaritas smelled like toilet cleaner. The staff were very nice, seems popular with the locals, but if you love Mexican food then you may want to avoid Don Patron."}
{"text":"Well all I can say is this food service and atmosphere was perfect and I'm very hard to please. I just hope people really continue to come here because I really want this place to stay in Streetsboro.   Great food. Best Mexican food around. For real."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful night at Don Patron's - not badly priced, really great service, and pretty quick! I didn't think it was that expensive - I got a large burrito for $9 and a 16oz strawberry margarita for $6. The margarita wasn't the best, but my friend's tasted better, so maybe I just got a bad one. The owner of the restaurant even stopped at our table to ask about our experience and wish us a good night. The inside is currently being remodeled beautifully with cement sculptures on the wall. I'd recommend this restaurant and will definitely come back! I will say, however, this place is in a weird spot, tucked behind Walmart, but that's just a heads up and not a mark against it."}
{"text":"They serve an incredible amount of food really cheap. The mets were seasoned very well and the guacamole was amazing!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new Mexican restaurant. After waiting over 10 minutes for a server, I had to ask for clarity regarding the Fajita order. The price was very expensive and then was told it was for two not clearly indicated. OK after the up charges and all our bill for two( no alcohol) was upwards of $76.00. The food was good but not impressed with the service or the methodology they impose on customers for pricing. I understand the restaurant has to keep their costs low but I never experienced a few of these extra expenses for  a simple meal. Do not hate it but will be more vigilant when ordering if I return. It is up in the air right now....."}
{"text":"Excellent food awesome service. If you're in the area you need to try this place. It's a little hidden next to Walmart. Hope they stay in business. Great workers and wait staff."}
{"text":"Service was terrible!!!!!! The server was very nervous. And the cheese dip was cold 3 times they brought it out. Overall bad experience"}
{"text":"Went today with some friends from work on their recommendation. The location is very convenient off of SR 14 and the I-80 Turnpike. It's located in a tiny strip mall just north of the Mega Walmart that on the same development.

One of our colleagues in the group is originally from Central America, and they gave their seal of approval on the place, so we had that assurance going in.

The service was great, attentive friendly and fast. The food was fresh, at perfect temperature, and accessible to a wide audience. Prices at lunch are very reasonable, and overall I would say the restaurant offers good value. 4 stars only because there is not much unique going on here with regard to the food. The front of the house is very accessible, clean, and great for a lunch or casual dinner.

Don Ramon won't disappoint, nor will it knock your socks off. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great portions. Worth every penny, and you're getting both quality and quantity. I got the burrito Cancun, which was great. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and really enjoyed the street tacos. Great service and salsa! Came late at night and they were very accommodating. Food was hot and fresh. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Giving it 4 stars because they give so much food, I literally didn't eat for 2 days. The fundido was good and I like the authenticity tacos and served with 2 corn tortillas. Did Equis was super cold but I suggest splitting a meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I really like the food, service and atmosphere. The food is always fresh and hot and the servers here seem to enjoy their jobs and are very pleasant. I really like the tamales and fajitas!  Good job!"}
{"text":"We are just passing through on a trip from our home in Colorado to Maine. To be honest stopping for Mexican in Ohio didn't seem like a great idea but it was close to the hotel after a long day on the road. 
What a pleasant surprise!  
Everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious.  I would have to rate the food here better than most of what we get in Colorado. 
The service was also excellent. If you are in the area and like Mexican food you will not go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Have had Mexican food all over and this place is great! Extremely fast at this location, yet food is delicious & piping hot. My favorite thing to order is the Taquitos Mexicanos, but my husband always gets something different & always happy.

Great, fast service."}
{"text":"On our one night stop in OH, we picked this newly opened Mexican restaurant. They were celebrating their one year anniversary of being open. The staff was friendly, and although they could have been more attentive, they were nic

The location of the restaurant was a bit hidden near the Walmart, but has plenty of parking. 
It is a perfect location though, given it's right off the interstate, and directly across the road from the hotel we were staying at. Great for their business! 

Now to the food!
My husband had ordered the Cancun Burrito, and I got the fajita burrito. My oldest son (7) ordered a cheeseburger and fries. We also receive the complimentary endless chips and salsa. There was a spicy and a mild salsa, both good.

Now, these burritos were not of small portion: they were HUGE! My husband and I could have easily shared one and been stuffed. (Check the photos for evidence.)

The Cancun: I don't  have much to say on this because I was too focused on the massive meal on the plate directly in front of me. It did have a light, creamy sauce on top. My husband got the chicken. It was seasoned well! The burrito was full of mushrooms, beans and rice. He LOVES mushrooms, so this was a real winner.

The Fajita burrito:
HELLO FOOD THE SIZE OF MY HEAD!
So, the pregnancy cravings for steak were real. So I picked the fajita burrito. The steak was cooked perfectly, and wasn't chewy with fat at all. The rice inside was good. While the plating of the burrito and the placement of the guacamole & sour cream wasn't very great, it completed the burrito. So yummy!

While this isn't the #1 best Mexican place I've been to, it is in the top 3 best Mexican places I've been to for sure. Overall, it was worth it to stop here!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Super Friendly staff. Quick service. The burritos and fajitas are worth a try."}
{"text":"We stopped here after seeing it on Yelp as we were driving by on the turnpike. Convenient, fast, and delicious. I got the chili relleno combination and the beans, the rice, and especially the chili rellenos were awesome. My wife got taco and enchiladas combo and she said they were delicious and the portion size was generous.  She especially liked the hard taco and said it was the best she ever had. So mission accomplished on Mother's Day. The wife and kids were happy and so was I."}
{"text":"Do not pass up this place.  You will regret it.  

The location is on short strip mall which is deceiving (they are the only operating business on it).

They are very much open and well worth it.  Food and service was well above par.  The atmosphere inside is beautifully done.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Went here due to the reviews but regret giving them a chance. I ordered the carne asada tacos but the waiter gave me the carne asada dinner plate instead (2-3$ more expensive). Thought it to be an honest mistake and didn't make a fuss about it. I asked how much guacamole on the tacos would be, and he didn't know and kind of scratched his head and said...\"so you want just a side of guacamole?\" Almost as if he was just going to provide it, because he didn't answer how much it would be. So I said \"yes\". ($3.50). I ate my meal and he then came back and asked if I wanted more tortillas, so I said \"sure\". ($1.50). 

I received my check and noticed all of the upcharges and was frustrated enough to not even leave a tip. I've never paid for more tortillas when dining in a Mexican restaurant in my life. It just seemed like they were trying to squeeze every penny out of me and the food was mediocre at best. 

Definitely won't be returning and I imagine this place will be closed down in about one year from now due to their shady practices, below average food, and unfortunate location."}
{"text":"We don't live near Streetsboro but were in the area and found this gem!  We loved the food and drinks.  Everything was brought out exactly as ordered and tasted great!   The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and the service was amazing!  Wish we could move the restaurant and Antonio down to the Canton area."}
{"text":"Oh my. Such a great find after a long day of driving. Jumbo margaritas at Happy Hour prices, and the margaritas are wonderful. Service people are attentive.... and happy. Service was quick, they added rice as an extra because they gave the wrong entree to me, instead of my husband. The restaurant was clean. Atmosphere is amazing. Prices are low for quality and quality of food. Fresh/warm tortilla chips and great bottomless salsa.The walls are pieces of art, beautiful murals. I applaud this place, so happy we found it, thank you."}
{"text":"I usually go there for lunch and have the tacos de asada. Always good. Always fast service. Very reasonable prices.  Will be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and decided to check yelp for good food fare. Don Patron did not disappoint! I wish I could take this restaurant home with me back to Michigan. The margaritas, appetizer and meal were outstanding. You must get the chorizo and cheese dip for your starter. Wow!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!  Lunch menu is varied and priced well.  Plenty of food on the plate.  Just the right amount of favor with my meal.  Salsa is right on!  
Plenty of seating with an outside area with umbrellas.  Very clean.  Staff is really nice and  pleasant.  I came for lunch to check it out but will be back with my husband for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been frequent flyers since they opened a few months ago.  Everything has been excellent.  Always super yummy!  Great food, great margaritas and great staff.  So happy we have great Mexican food close to home."}
{"text":"There wasn't just one hair in my food there were four. And the waiters sat at the bar the whole time talking and weren't paying any attention to me. Didn't even ask how my food was. Dont come here!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and enjoy trying new places. Like any dining experience, the food, aesthetics, and the service all contribute to the overall enjoyment of a meal. The best thing this little restaurant has going for it is the aesthetics, with a unique ancient Aztec ruins and jungle theme instead of the usual bright yellow decor other Mexican restaurants seem to follow. Not what you'd expect to find in a strip of shops next to a Walmart.

My daughter and I found the food to be very average, though fresh. Both of our plates had the same presentation: a pile of shredded iceberg lettuce with a large glop of sour cream. I ordered the Burrito Superior with chicken and my daughter had Nachos Supreme.

Our visit hit a few snags, the first being the service. It was a bit slow and the server we had was pleasant, but seemed to be under a lot of pressure. He came off as a bit rushed, so a little edgy and in a hurry. I didn't want refried beans and requested black beans instead, but black beans were not available. First Mexican restaurant I've ever been to where black beans were not available. When the food came, there seemed to be some confusion. Instead of our original server, a woman with two plates that appeared to be ours approached our table, then stopped to look around, looked back at our table, then walked away. Five minutes later, our hurried server came back with the same two plates, set them on our table, then went about his business. Our food wasn't even hot. Both of us were hungry, so we just started to eat.

I was very disappointed in the size of my burrito. It was about the size of a certain fast food chain's offering. When I went to cut it there was nothing but shell fering, very thin and both ends of the burrito were empty--not what you'd expect from an item labeled as 'Superior' for $7.99. The shredded chicken inside was fresh, so no complaints there, but everything was very bland. Honestly, we could have been across the street at the chain restaurant. My daughter's nachos were pretty much the same. Just a very generic offering.

Maybe we just ordered the wrong menu items and came in an \"off\" evening. I wanted to like this place because of the unique decor. It was busy for a Friday dinner hour, but I'm thinking there are better options for Mexican outside of Streetsboro."}
{"text":"I have been to both this and the Hudson location many times;  I am a fan of both.   Decent service, good atmosphere and good food.  Seems like a family-owned restaurant which I appreciate.   Hope they last a long time!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the new Don Patron next to WalMart and had a very nice meal.  Very friendly staff, quickly served, and excellent food.  Not a big restaurant but it filled up on a Saturday evening.  
I had a carnitas dish and the roast pork was awesome.
The restaurant is on a small strip next to WalMart, and the other storefronts are empty-- but don't let the location fool you, this is a nice place to eat.  Good food, nice staff, clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I've tried them all. If you are looking for Mexican in the Kent/Streetsboro area, this is the best you're going to find. 5 stars based on small town NE Ohio standards."}
