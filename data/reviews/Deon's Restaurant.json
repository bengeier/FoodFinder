{"text":"Yuck! I didn't like the fish or fries, they were both soggy and undercooked so I trashed it. I mean why did they tell us that the wait was 30 mins if they weren't going to cook the food all the way? I was so disappointed after having eaten at the Cedar location just a few days before where that same meal was slamming! This meal made me extremely sad so I definitely won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this restaurant but after having to wait 40 mins for our order, then finding out that the order never made it to the kitchen, waiting and additional 15 mins for food and then finally getting home to find out that they used an old potato and reheated it to make my $12 shrimp stuffed potato, I'm beyond pissed and won't be back...this was completely unacceptable!!!!"}
{"text":"They hung up on me while asking about an item on the menu. They then referred me to check online, which forces an app to open that does not list the specific item I was looking for.

Worst customer experience and I didn't even have to step in the restaurant.

I called again and the person asked me to come in and grab a menu.

What's the purpose of ordering delivery if I have to come in???"}
{"text":"The food is good. It's one of the few places where you can get homemade Mac and cheese and the cheese is melted all the way through. BUT I love catfish and I've had it twice from the superior location and there was a very weird after taste both times. Maybe they need to change the oil or something but they have to figure it out."}
{"text":"Brand new joint in Cedar Center. Stopped by to check it out, but it seemed they weren't open yet, so I took a menu. Menu looks great and am excited to try. Pricing is all over the place with a lot of combos and sandwiches under $10, entrees and dinner in the teens... all the way up to $45. Not sure what type of demographic they're trying to cater to. It's a casual setting, but not likely a place I would go to drop $45 a plate in. Will update this review once I'm able to try their fare."}
{"text":"When you need a early or late spot this is my go to place. I love the chicken philly sandwich and the chicken wings. The fries could be cook a little longer but other than that it is good. Lastly I am so glad they change the location because it was not a spot."}
{"text":"I would have made it a 2 1/2 stars but can't. I had been wanting Bbq so I saw on FB that a friend said it was good. So I go 1st thing it was so much ice in front of the door way only there's. Everyone else clean theirs. After sliding in the employees laughing having a conversation needed to be shoveling putting salt down. The food was cold they could have microwave it better. The ribs were ok the mac cheese was about 2 days old and dry. I went there once don't ever have to go back. Sorry keep your money"}
{"text":"Hubby liked his..but the Mac and cheese was below average. Honestly it was \"ok\" but for $30 it should have tasted great! I got a Chicken Philly it was a lot of sandwich (got a medium) but it was like I was eating air. No flavor and my chicken was cut up like baby food (not shredded or diced)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the pork ribs and fries from deon's. The ribs literally could not even hold onto the bones, thats how tender they were. The mac and cheese was so spot on, so much cheese, I was in heaven. The wings were ok (we got \"wingdings\") but I'm excited to try more stuff from their menu. Prices are amazing, got all of that for about $15. I've heard their lunch specials are even better

Only inconvenient thing is it's cash only. Still worth it"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY - there is an ATM, but only a few bucks in hand and you'll be good

Favorite food joint in Cleveland for cheap, hot food.

The deals for a quick meal are very cheap. A meal will fill you up very well. They do not skimp out!

A couple of friends and I stopped by for lunch and got there a little bit earlier than opening, but was still welcomed and served. The owners came in for morning drop-off of items and they were incredibly friendly and nice.

I always recommend this restaurant to all of my friends. I also suggest calling ahead of time and ordering for pick up if you do not want to wait. It can go to 15-20 minutes for an order."}
{"text":"Wings are easily found in this area. However, these are better than most I've tried. The menu is fairly priced for the portion size and the order came quickly. I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was sooo disappointed with my food, I actually took it back I had jumbo shrimp dinner fried. $15.00. The shrimp were fried with the shell and legs still on, as if they dumped them in the batter without cleaning them, when I returned the manager said, \"is that all that was wrong, it would be different if they were burnt, you can't peel your own shell?  You should have showed be that before you left? I would have pulled them off with my hands and handed you the box back. \" I asked him what the resolution was??he said, if there were feathers coming out if a chicken, maybe he could help, but shrimp fried with shell and legs on, no big deal. This place is a joke. You are not that hungry, not to eat this subpar food."}
{"text":"Order was wrong. Ordered half slab got rib tips that tasted days old. Food was not fresh, had been reheated. Paid an extra $4 for approximately a half cup of garlic powder seasoned green beans. Way too overpriced for food with no love in it whatsoever. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats. My bf found the chicken wings with onion rings and mac to be average. I also ordered a strawberry cheesecake. Was not delivered. The uber eats driver said that's all he was given and I should call the restaurant if I don't have what I ordered...so I tried calling SIX TIMES and they DIDNT ANSWER ONCE!!!!!!!! How? They don't close til 2 am???????  Literally so disappointed bc that's all I ordered so I paid for a cheesecake I was never given.. will not order from again. Cheap frozen food."}
{"text":"I really like the wings here.  They're always fresh and hot when I get them, and the prices aren't that bad either."}
{"text":"I order through a delivery app and wanted to try something new. So I ordered a flounder sandwich combo with onion rings and two whole wings plain.

First, lets address the packaging.  Fish and onion rings came in a great plastic container and the wings in a styrofoam container.  Better quality than many restaurants in this neighborhood.  They also sent containers with hot sauce, barbecue and tartar sauce.

Now to the food, hot and fresh.  A lot of time with fried food, the don't like to use plastic because the food would be greasy but this was hot and not greasy at all!  HUGE PLUS.  The onion rings were crisp and the fish WAS OUTSTANDING!  Perfectly seasoned.

The wings, breaded and fried, PERFECTLY SEASONED!  This was some seriously good food!

I definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"Been going to Deon's for about 4 years.
Stopped going after I moved.
Decided to stop in for the 10 piece wing ding and fries with sauce for $5, what a deal.
Chicken is hand battered like momma does them, fries seem fresh cut.
Really enjoyed my meal.
Had to go back in 1 hour to order 2 more meals for the kids.

***cash only*** it is an ATM."}
{"text":"Arrived to an empty restaurant. Not sure if that was a good or bad thing seeing as we were pressed for time. This proved to be a warning sign. Tables were sticky, service was slow, food was cold. When we asked to speak to a manager she was phoned as there wasn't one on site. The manager was rude and dismissive. No adjustments were made to rectify the problem. Will not patronize ever again. One and done. Food mediocre at best."}
