{"text":"I hate to be one of those obnoxious people who come from Montreal and compare everything in Toronto to how much 'better' everything is in Montreal--but to be honest the Holts Cafe in Montreal is about 10x better. First of all this location is great, perched high above Bloor Street looking out at the plebeians below you with an open airy feeling because of the large windows and skylight. My mum, boyfriend, and I ate along the window which was great--not too cold for all you concerned about Canadian winter weather. Our server was fine, nothing special rather pedestrian if I do say so myself. He welcomed us, took our drink orders, and returned to take our orders. No chit-chat which is either good or bad depending on how you like your servers. 

My main concern was the food. The menu is small which I think is good for an operation like Holts Cafe. Its best to keep it simple and focused. Like Montreal the Toronto location offers the infamous tartines--open-faced Scandinavian inspired sandwiches--on French poil√¢ne bread. I love the tartines but because Toronto only offers 5-6 options (versus 10-12 in Montreal) I opted to try something else. My eyes immediately honed in on the Chicken Pot Pie which was fine. Just fine. Nothing too spectacular. The puff pastry was really quite tasty, but the 'chicken' inside was shredded and rather sad in quantity. I recently had a Chicken Pot Pie at Bannock (in the rapidly improving the Bay on Queen St. W.) which had huge chunks of fresh chicken breast. The Holts incarnation was tasty but gurrrrl I'm hungry, I'm not one of those ladies who like to lunch who pick at their food, drag it around the plate, and then claim rather exuberantly 'I'm full!'. No no I like my meals and I like them filling. 

My boyfriend had the Holts Burger which was good (I had to steal a bite!) with fries which were actually really good, with a nice sprinkling of spices with an assortment of dips including garlic aioli mayo (my favourite!). My mum had a tartine (the Grilled Chicken) but unfortunately it seemed like the chicken was of the 'lunch meat' variety rather than slices of chicken breast. The Montreal tartines with chicken had a different kind of chicken and I was a little disappointed by this variation. Although each restaurant has a different executive chef I would expect some sort of standardization in terms of the tartines. Oh well they were sufficient. The cocktails that we ordered--the special Very Berry Cocktail--was expensive ($14) and tiny, served in a champagne flute. While the main ingredient was prosecco I felt like a cocktail like this would best be served in a cocktail glass. But than again, I'm no bartender. 

This Holts underwent a renovation a few years back and the rest of the store is of high aesthetic quality. But like any high-end department store or boutique in Toronto I always feel like the service is severely lacking. All of the sales associates--save for one in Louis Vuitton department downstairs--has been so fucking snooty. Why is this such a trend? I KNOW you work on commission, lighten up a little bit and I'll buy more. Crikey. Anyways thats for another review.

Bottom line: Holts Cafe is fab to the eye and super chic. The food is 'ok' and the service is unforgettable. But its a nice respite from the crowds of Bloor or the mediocrity of neighbouring food options."}
{"text":"I have been going to the cafeteria style restaurant on the lower level for years.  Not really impressed to be honest.  But last week a freind showed me the 2nd level restaurant. Seating is limited, so make reservations.  I've now been twice in a week.  The service is good and friendly, the food is excellent.  I had the chopped salad with chicken, onions rings (best onions rings i've in a while).  My partner had the steak and eggs salad which he really liked, and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert - this was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute lunch spot! Food is beautifully plated and fresh. They change up the menu seasonally, so it's good to experiment while you can, although there are certain mainstays like the chopped salad and the Holts burger. Desserts are always a great size and very yummy as well.

The brunch tartine is one of my favourites, served on toasted Poilane bread flown in from Paris. The atmosphere is airy and light, in the shoe department of the Holt Renfrew flagship and overlooking Bloor Street. Art is nice, too. They have daily flatbread and soup specials which are worth checking out. 

The food here is always well prepared. It's on the mid-range expensive side, but it's lovely for people watching and the ambience is modern and refined. There's something for everyone on the menu, and it makes a great restaurant to take a break from shopping in!"}
{"text":"Holt's Cafe is a stylish, clean and modern cafe for the ladies that lunch taking a break from shopping. There are four in total and having only been to the downtown Toronto location,  I can only speak for one. The restaurant in narrow with a long window wall bringing in beautiful light all day. The menu changes slightly and they always have specials. Their soups are delicious and always fresh. The day I went I was lucky, the special was an extremely tasty butternut squash noodle-free lasagna. The layers were paper thin sheets of squash. My friend and I examined the layers with awe, I can't imagine how long it took to make this dish... not one I will be trying to imitate anytime soon. The food is definelty made with care, fresh and there's something for everyone. They also just started serving Belmonte Raw, which is a raw, top quality local juice company."}
{"text":"What happens when you walk in during lunch hour, and the host and manager say you'll have to wait 45 minutes? No this isn't an effin' riddle. 

You simply go online and make a reservation that is for 10 minutes from now. Isn't technology and the internet great? Great for me. Not great for the restaurant that lied to us after I asked if we could sit at the bar when they told me no tables were available. No, I get it. They need to make sure everyone with a reservation gets a table. However, when we entered the restaurant, there were plenty of tables available and the bar had 4 people at it with 8-9 empty chairs. 

And there were three of us.

Mr Manager Nathan, you stupid little boy, I'm not impressed by your overpriced suit you got on discount, or by the fact that you have an inferiority complex because you're a 5 foot midget. Ooh, I'm getting mean. Sorry. I take that last part back. Maybe Holt Renfrew head office can give you a few tips on how to work the floor (instead of aimlessly walking up and down between the tables), how not to lie to customers, and how to actually run a restaurant with a bit of class. Maybe take a trip to Gramercy Tavern or Eleven Madison Park. You can learn a few things, you little child from All-White-People Suburb, Ontario.

The fact is, the food was fucking shit for two salads and a chicken pot pie for $100+. I mean, Toronto tries so hard to be like New York, but this is total amateur hour. The waitress was kind and helpful which made up for a lot, however she was not attentive and never followed up until dessert. 

You guys, I think I was being pretty generous in this review, if not a bit rude. I just hate being lied to.

I think you're done here..."}
{"text":"A wonderful light filled room for a ladies lunch or brunch. I love all the tartines and salads. They are big enough to share. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"LIKES: 

1. GREAT SERVICE
2. GREAT VIBE /AMBIENCE 

DISLIKES
1. Burnt Burger 

I ordered the chicken dumplings to start and then I had the burger and sweet potato fries. My server was amazing; very attentive and informative about the menu. 

The chicken dumplings were the best i've ever had seriously! 

The fries were out of this world; unfortunately the burger was NOTHING to write home about and I did not appreciate that it was burnt. 

I would go back just avoid the burger dish."}
{"text":"it is nice to go there if you'd like to go shopping and have a different kind of lunch. the seating area is ideal and different.

The food and service is only average. been there 3 times and it has been only average consistently. Wait times for orders are long. had to send back food each time as it was really cold (surprising eh?). it seems they are understaffed leading to longer wait times and delayed food delivery. 

i really would like them to see stepping it up with the food. not impressive, just average. wine menu is small but GOOD.

however given it is freeriding on the HOLTs reputation and the location you get still a different shopping experience."}
{"text":"Holts cafe (50 Bloor St West, mezzanine level) Famous BLT salad pancetta, breaded tomatoes, creamy greens, need not say more! Having a good day? Add a side of truffle chips and stay healthy with a Holt happiness drink. What we loved? Valet, manager greets guests, designer shoes on same level! #ladieswholunch"}
{"text":"I have hard time understanding why there is a diner in side a shopping centre but I come here time to time for quick snacks and sweet treats. But mostly I like to come here for sleek modern diner-inspired style of interior. It looks cute and cool, and view of Bloor Street is cool too. 

Foods are generally salads and open sammies but they are just ok. Interesting ingredients are used in the sammies but it doesn't translate to good taste. But I liked pork sandwich and holt club sandwich. And dessert is where the money is at. They are delicious and coupled with teas or coffee they are perfect for a lengthy chatty afternoon with gals.

As much as I want to love this place I can't justify the prices. They are overpriced and sides and salads are ridiculously priced. I can't justify other diners around me too. They all look like rich aging housewives living off husbands' bank account, and trying to enjoy the fortune while they can before their hubbies dump them for younger women soon."}
{"text":"Conveniently located and with such good looking food - cute little desserts, and all kinds of panini sandwiches and salads.

We tried the grilled vegetable panini - the veggies were a good portion of peppers and eggplant and perfectly grilled.

The pesto, brie and chicken panini was great too - the pesto was delicious with a generous slice of brie on the sandwich

The sandwich bread was quite a lot of bread and kind of empowered the rest of the sandwich. Although the sandwiches were enjoyable i kind of like the Starbucks paninis better - OMG can i say that?!!!"}
{"text":"....So apparently this cafe doesn't exist. 

That's right, according to the 30 something Chinese sales clerk in the men's section - the one with ghostly pale skin who thinks she's auditioning for a role on a Korean drama - this cafe doesn't exist. Update your records, Yelp!

So this is what went down today, Sunday May 28th at noon. My family and I were shopping in the neighborhood when my toddler started getting fussy. I remembered that there was a small cafe here. When we walked in, I approached a clerk standing by the cashier nearest to the escalator. She was not doing a damn thing at the moment. So I approached her and asked, \"Excuse me, where is the cafe?\" She looked up at me with a blank stare and mouthed the word \"No\". 

SHE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE AUDIBLE, VERBAL SPEECH. 

With a rather confused look, I repeated my question, only to get the same pantomime expression from her. 

Needless to say, we immediately left and went to Sassafraz instead. And on the way out, I saw that she got on the phone. So there's no way in hell she has a speech issue. Just a deplorable rudeness issue. 

But LITERALLY I've never been confronted by such rudeness, incompetence and carelessness. I've shopped all over the world, but I can tell you that this is the first time an idle clerk has refused to even speak to me!

And in case you think it matters, my entire family was dressed well and my toddler was very quiet and well behaved while we were on the store for the sum total of two minutes."}
{"text":"Cute spot but busy! Jostling shoppers and coffee breakers make stopping for a piece of cake a bit of a rushed event, still worth it for the champagne cake in a white chocolate shell."}
{"text":"What a waste of money. The panini I had was a Chicken Club and it was pretty bland and gross. Lacked a lot of salt and flavour in general, with the chicken breast (ick) being dry and dusty.

The pressed juices were good but at $4.95 for half a bottle, I'd rather walk to Whole Foods and buy something for that price (or cheaper!!) with double the amount.

The only good thing was the shrimp, but that was not cheap at $3.50 PER SHRIMP.

Forget it. Ain't coming back here. I should've known better but I was just so hungry.....

There are so many better places to eat than Holt's Cafe."}
{"text":"Definitely prefer this Holt's Caf√© over the one in the Holt's at Yorkdale. For one, this is a proper service (wait staff take your orders and bring you the food).

This isn't usually a place of grub for my parents and I unless we happen to be in Holt's shopping. My dad bought a pair of Bottega shoes and we decided we were thirsty. The place has been renovated (but a long time ago), and it's nice. We had a lovely booth by the corner and decided to order a bottle of Veuve (because for those of you who know me, there is nothing like Champagne during the day!) and a chicken pot pie to share. We also decided to order fries which were freshly fried and crispy. YUM!

My dad was extra thirsty so he decided to order some of their fresh (and healthy) juices. 

Great place for a snack or post-shopping drinks. Service was great and it was not busy at all (so a nice escape from the hustle and bustle within the city!)"}
{"text":"Their frozen yogurt is to die for. Seriously, I strongly prefer this to other places. It's delicious and has a very subtle citrus taste to it.

They also serve delicious healthy lunches. If you're looking for a breakfast, lunch or afternoon snack, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Came here around 5pm for a quick bite before dinner because we were starving! There was two other tables when we arrived and pretty quiet. The host let us picked our seats which was nice because I like sitting by the window so I can look outside.

We ordered 500mL of Pinot Noir Joseph Drouhin - it was fantastic as well as truffle chips (chives, grana padano), a holts club (grilled chicken, bacon, fontina, avocado, spicy mayo and arugula) and the holts burger (aged white cheddar, bacon, sauteed mushrooms and roasted garlic aioli). Truffle chips tasted like kettle cooked chips but a little too salty for my liking. The holts burger was exactly what it sounds like - just a burger. It was really well made for a burger but it was still just a burger. I didn't really like the holts club not only because it was an open faced sandwich but it was also dry. The grilled chicken looked more like chicken cold cuts than grilled chicken if anything.

Our server (I forgot to get his name), was fantastic. He gave us recommendations and suggestions for wine, super friendly and was already around at the right time. PLEASE bring back the lobster mac n cheese!

I'd go back if they bring back the lobster mac n cheese but other than that.. it's really nothing special."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, it's a nice calm break from the hectic shopping. Service is great and always very attentive. Food is high quality and has good presentation. Their cheese board is delicious!"}
{"text":"Can I give a rating less than one star? Because if I can that would still be generous. 

We had a large group of 18 for a joint birthday party originally for Sunday at 1 pm.  They called us the night before to reschedule for 1:30 pm, and we agreed, even though it meant one person wouldn't be able to make it. 

When we got there the hostess wouldn't seat us unless we agreed to pay everything on one bill, stating that we had agreed to it already. We hadn't. She eventually seated us (past our reserved time).

We had high tea and the usual finger foods.  The food isn't anything different than any other high tea place so don't set your expectations too high. We had two servers: Heath was attentive and informative, but our other server Jenny was the opposite. When it was time to settle our bills, no receipt was given and when we paid with card she conveniently forgot to mention that gratuity was already included. Which is not surprising given the large group size. But what was surprising was her inability to refund anyone who had given them two gratuities. 

Luckily they only burned a few people and the rest of us didn't tip them twice. But the cherry on top was when they billed us for 18 people instead of 17. At no point was this ever mentioned and only when one of us carefully examined the bill did we discover the discrepancy. Like the double dipping of tips, they claimed they couldn't change the bills.

I've been to many restaurants and I've never been treated in such a deceitful manner. The only thing this place gets 5/5 on is the level of unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"I came here on the weekend and ordered off their brunch menu. The cafe is located in the first floor of Holts and is hidden at the back area. My party arrived around 12:30pm and the cafe was pretty empty as there were just three other parties.

Coffee and lattes are on point for a cafe but I've tried better lattes in my opinion. 

We sat down and they gave us the menus with the brunch menu on top. Our party ordered the wild mushroom quiche, shakshuka, and apple crumble french toast. We also added a side of smoked bacon and farmer's sausage. 

The wild mushroom quiche was good. Flaky and moist and it came with a side salad. The shakshuka felt more of a eggs inside spaghetti tomato sauce. The apple crumble french toast had too much whipped ricotta on top making it super heavy with cream. The cream definitely overpowered everything on that dish. The items overall were just warm and not too hot which just ok.

The smoke bacon was good but felt like they have been sitting there for a while since it came lukewarm. The farmer sausage was a complete disaster as it was too salty in my opinion. Each side came with 4 pieces. 

As in terms of expensive, pretty expensive to my standard. As it cost $18 for a french toast and $6 for sides of sausage which cost $1.50 each for underwhelming sausages.

Service was great as expected from a Holts cafe. 

The food quality was not on point as some menu items did not live up to the standard of a Holts cafe."}
{"text":"Nice and airy. Service was okay. But the food took forever! We must have been waiting for an hour for a burger and salad. Food was good. Nothing to rave about. I probably would not have a meal there again."}
{"text":"They had wonderful meal. The sea bass was great, fresh and hopefully ocean wild as was told. The fried sweet potato was amazing but surprisingly wine glasses was not nicely cleaned... It's downgrading. It's a pity that such a nice white wine was served in inappropriate glass!"}
{"text":"I come here for drinks pretty much every time I'm in Yorkdale, which lately, has been quite often. The drinks here are fantastic. The alcohol used is clearly not your average quality (this can be tasted and felt). I also love trying out different cocktails that the bartenders recommend/make up. I find that one drink here is plenty most of the time (max two), whereas if I went elsewhere in the mall, i.e. Moxie's, I would need multiple drinks for the same effect. All the bartenders are professional and authentically nice. This place is so underrated."}
{"text":"We went to Holts caf√© in the Yorkdale mall. Very surprised that you can have foie gras north of Lawrence Ave. It was great!! We also hade the Arctic Char  and the deep fried Nori roll. Service was good. Need a more extensive wine list though. We are fans!!"}
{"text":"Even though I've worked in the area for too many years, I've actually never sat down here for a meal. They have sandwiches, salads and pastries. I really should give it a try! Lately, I have been grabbing tea latte to go (i love tea latte!) and they use Sloane Teas which is always a nice surprise. Already tried Holt's blend and the Earl Grey. Next up, oolong and then snow dragon green tea. And they serve illy coffee, so one of these days I'm going to order me a latte. Yes please!"}
{"text":"The Grilled Summer Tart was one of my favourite items that day.  It had an arugula pesto, grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, and herbed goat cheese.  This summer start actually looked like an open-face sandwich and was very healthy and made with fresh ingredients.  All of the ingredients went so well together and I especially liked the herbed goat cheese and the flakey pastry of the tart.  The herbed goat cheese was my favourite part of the Grilled Summer Tart!

The Compressed Watermelon & Feta Salad had an artisanal lettuce bouquet, basil, mint, edible flowers, aged balsamic drizzle, and olive oil.  The ingredients in this were also very fresh and high-quality.  It looked so beautiful and colourful too.  The edible flowers were delicate orange petals that actually didn't have a detectable flavour at all.  The cutest part of this salad was the cubed watermelon that was topped with feta cheese.  P and I both thought this combination of sweet juicy watermelon paired with feta was an interesting one.  When you have the juicy watermelon paired with the feta, it makes the feta taste differently than when you eat the two separately.

The Pickerel was paired with creamy Jerusalem artichoke, French beans, and shaved fennel.  This was another beautifully presented dish that looked like fine dining food.  The piece of pickerel was topped with the shaved slices of fennel and sat on top of the French beans and artichoke.

This seafood dish was the second favourite dish for me.  I loved how fresh, moist, and juicy the pickerel was.  The seasoning wasn't strong at all which gave way to the freshness of the fish.  I was thoroughly delighted with how great the pickerel was prepared and cooked.  Kudos to the chef for preparing such a perfect piece of fish! ^_^

We also liked the French beans (so fresh and crunchy) and I liked the shaved fennel.  The creamy Jerusalem artichoke was wonderful too and I wish I had a spoon on the side to scoop more of it up to go with each bite.

The Strawberry Shortcake was not your typical kind of shortcake in a cake form.  Instead, it arrived in a cute dessert sandwich presentation.  It was made with a shortcake biscuit, pastry cream, strawberry compote, cr√®me Anglaise, and Chantilly cream.  It was a really cute dessert!  I found that this was a unique take on the traditional strawberry shortcake dessert."}
{"text":"to be honest the service is quite slow and the food is extremely overpriced.  they tend to weight everything and a piece of shrimp is 3 dollars.  LOL,  makes me laugh that they think people are stupid.  you can easily spend 15$ here for lunch, and honestly, for what?  You could do down the street and have a nice sit down meal whereas holts cafe is sort of a sit-down, but a fast in and out set up ...overpriced for what its value is.  

I will say however that they do have decent food, at first it wasn't as great but there are a few things they do well.  I like there boxed sandwiches to go.  As well their salmon steaks and chicken protein and salads are decent.  All very healthy and clean meals for those looking to be health conscious."}
{"text":"I LOVE their bakery ~~~~~~~~~~ they taste good although personally I do not really like apple pies yet the taste was good to me~~ Sadly it was only a pop up store and there no seats for you to sit down and enjoy the afternoon and have to sit down in the doodcourt inside the Yorkdale Mall."}
{"text":"Place is fancy but food is overpriced and crap. It's very sad, because this place has potential to be great. The location is excellent. I have been here way too many times because my friends want to go and every single time I get disappointed. I hope I NEVER go back, such a waste of money, seriously!"}
{"text":"just a quick review here.  came for an early dinner.  very healthy French inspired menu. Pleased to see they had a full bar :)  ordered the soup of the day even before our drink order but server never brought it so I cancelled it and she apologized and offered the excuse that she didn't think I confirmed it.  plus had to ask twice for water so service is certainly subpar and inattentive for the name branding and the price. Our meals,  however, were quite flavourful and refreshing.  I tried my first open faced \"tartine\" French sandwich with grilled steak which was very good and my friend's chicken butternut salad (forget name,  sorry)  was even better (I liked the slight sweetness). Left hungry (due to the lack of soup) but hey,  if it maintains my figure,  so be it.  no discounts nor freebies were offered for order mistakes so a little disappointed with the establishment 's service policy.  would recommend the Holt cocktail,  did not enjoy the tart taste of the renfrew cocktail nor the blandness of the mojito. would like to try kiwi lemonade next time... in no rush to go back, though."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the sandwiches are amazing! We just arrived after the lunch rush so it was quiet and intimate. Our food came out quickly and was delicious! I will go back to eat and try something different on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you are ever craving a pick and choose, cafeteria style lunch place with fresh food, a stand-alone hot beverage stand and yummy bite-sized cakes, head on over to Holt's Cafe!

Located on the lowest level of the Holt Renfrew Centre on Bloor, this cafe is always a great reward once you have been shopping for hours and have worked up an appetite.

For main lunch meals, Holt's Cafe offers a WIDE VARIETY of soups, salads and sandwiches. For sandwiches, they have freshly wrapped, pre-made sandwiches and they also offer large panini sandwiches, which are thrown onto the grill right before you take your first bite.

Some of the sandwiches I have tried there that were absolutely delicious were the blackened chicken caesar sandwich, the garlic shrimp panini and the avocado tuna on whole wheat.

After you are done your main lunch, why not indulge in a hot drink with a little dessert? 

The cafe has its own stand-alone cappucino stand, with a nice selection of coffee, latte, tea and hot chocolate options.

And last but certainly not least, Holt's Cafe has a large amount of different desserts to settle anyone's sweet tooth.

The only thing to be warned is that this cafe is PACKED during the working day lunch hour and you may have to shell out more money on certain food items.

Overall, Holt's Cafe is just fresh and delicious! I give it an A!"}
{"text":"Aida was in a sour mood working the lunch counter a recent Dec weekend. She barked my order and didn't go into the details of the different sandwiches. But she did ask if I wanted a salad. When I inquired if it came with the sandwich, she only shook her head. If I am going to be upsold, make me feel special!

While this was happening, an older gentleman pushed past me to see what else was available for lunch. When I turned to look at him and give him a WTF look, he said my purse was in the way. Of course it's my purse. Blame me while you push past me to make your way. Not a fan of old money men who have absolutely no manners.

At the end of the day, it's nice they have a cafe that you can stop for a sandwich/coffee while you're shopping. But not worth the stop if you end up feeling uncomfortable /regretting you stayed there. Maybe I need to dress up like a banker next time I go there.

The chicken sandwich was delicious though! I do recommend the food!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had lunch there a few days ago on a Thursday - the mezzanine leveled Cafe - the one where Corbin, celebrity chef works as head chef and is a big reason why I wanted to try the restaurant.  The ambiance is lovely - definitely an enchanting and special place to go have lunch.  Service is fairly good as well.  I have to say, when it came to the food, my main course was a little...disappointing...for appetizers, we started with Canadian baked brie - it was a small round brie that wasn't all that soft for having just been in the oven.  It was accompanied with some sort of orange marmalade-like compote and corn chips.  All looked ready to go into a miniature museum.  We ordered truffled potato chips and each chip came out fairly brown (you'll see in my pics).  Overly cooked, in my opinion.  Then came my entree - I ordered the osso buco since that's something I don't eat everyday - although the flavors were nice and round, it was incredibly DRY.  OMG, was it ever dry.  Osso buco should be so tender, moist and juicy...this was just the opposite.  I should've ordered the turkey pot pie like my girlfriend.  I of course, had to order dessert, and had the sticky toffee pudding - I'm a sucker for it if it's on a menu and that, was a happy ending to this meh of a meal."}
{"text":"Its a beautiful restaurant! I actually got a wonderful place to sit, right beside the big sash windows and it was drizzling snow that day. Had an amazing view while enjoyed their minty mojito with soup of the day! Loved the place, its etiquette, food and location! Oh not to mention, the washroom is huge and pretty! :) Enjoy guys!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience whenever I visit as I get to take a break from shopping. Service is attentive as well and all my requests are met. While some say its a little expensive, I wouldn't mind it all."}
{"text":"I have to justify for the cafe. It is cafeteria in a upscale store, you can't expect the same pricing from CAFE DOWN THE STREET. I've used my Holts icon privilege points to have meals here or Yorkdale location. The service has been consistent and wonderful. And I've received the service from the waiter or waitress who don't even know if there's tips. I mean the meal is 100%covered by points. I got free crafted coffee, tea for myself and my guests. I ordered the tuna salad, and the tuna tartar was just the way I wanted. The burger was slightly over cooked.  But minimal compared to what I've gotten."}
{"text":"Excellent food - all perfectly cooked, hot and flavorful without being too salty. Great service as well. The dessert selection could use some work but otherwise I was quite impressed."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday. I didn't expect this cafe to taste amazing or anything since it was in holt renfrew. 

However their food did surprise me. It tasted really good and it has great decor. Service was also good, but then again your in holts haha. Would come again price is also affordable and comparable to other brunch places."}
{"text":"There are two locations at this address: 

1) a quick cafe in the basement with some pre-packaged fresh made sandwiches and other already prepared foods, and

2) a higher end \"fine dining\" restaurant upstairs on the second floor.

Review of downstairs: Delicious sandwiches. Nice coffee. I come here often for a quick meal. Four stars.

Review of upstairs (\"fine dining\"): It was quite a few months ago when I visited for lunch. I remember the food was quite good but more than anything I remember it being really really cold. The building was blowing cold air on me. I am usually the last person to complain about temperature. I let the waiter know and he said this problem is oft complained about by customers who sit where I was sitting (near a window with a big air vent at the bottom...which is many of the seats), and they have had experts examine the problem, but determined nothing can be done because of the way the restaurant's heating and cooling system is designed. He said quite a few tables in the restaurant don't have that problem but unfortunately none of those were available right now. Food, while good, was also a bit expensive for what it was. Two stars.

I average out the review of each location to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Recently opened inside Holt Renfrew at Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Holts Caf√© is a delight of healthy and comfort food. Perfect for a nice relaxing break in this very busy mall. It has a beautiful modern airy d√©cor and it's not very big. The food is great, I ordered a croque monsieur and a kale salad. Both were delicious. You have to order at the counter and then they bring it to your table. The staff is very nice and courteous, they made sure my water was always refilled. In the style of European caf√©s, they feature a full bar, and all the espresso drinks we love to enjoy. There are also many pastries and sweets both at the drinks bar and at the food counter. Will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch with a friend. I ordered the house citrus smoked salmon tartine and she ordered the creamy chicken pot pie. We both got iced teas as well.

Definitely a very enjoyable meal. The food was absolutely scrumptious. I really loved my tartine a lot! It was a lot of food for both of us. We couldn't finish our lunches, but we still somehow managed to polish off 2/3 of an apple and crandberry crumble shared between us!

I love the decor of this cafe. Really beautiful and light, with a great view of Bloor street down below. Our server was so attentive and very good. He was able to recite the daily specials and was even able to explain the dishes more to us when we asked. Definitely a plus!

This is a place I will come back to for more great food!"}
{"text":"Servers are always friendly, and food is always nice. If we started our Holt's Cafe experience with their Yorkdale location, we would never have come here.
We came here discovered the Yorkdale location made a mistake of overcharging my wife's ICON benefit on things we did not get to order. They take pride in the brand and actually comp our lunch as an apology on behalf of the Yorkdale location.
Their menu change all the time, so you may not be able to order exactly what we had.
We ordered the Duck Confit on Pretzel bread, and Miso Black Cod. The duck was seasoned perfectly and the combination ingenious. The Black Cod was seasoned well and the touch of Kimchi sauce was just perfect.
We, of course, finished with the frozen chocolate souffl√©. Never disappointed.
Yorkdale Holt's Cafe should REALLY change learn from these folks before they ruin the brand for good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Called earlier to make reservation Sunday night and was confirmed for 6:30 pm. Arrived and was told they were closed. If she told us they are closed by 6:30, we would have come earlier! So disappointed.

UPDATED:
This is the third time we are here. 1st time they allowed us to make a reservation at the same time they  shut down the kitchen. 2nd time was an impressive experience as we were served by a server who knows what she's doing and talking about, and the food were done perfectly. 3rd time....is not a charm. The four pieces of foie gras came in uneven pieces. Not the end of the world, but the toast were soggy, it completely destroyed the otherwise perfect foie gras. What is worse is that it came at the same time as our entree. So, by the time we finished the app, the entrees were getting cold. It got worse. I ordered the gnocchi, and it was just mush swimming in sauce that was more like watery soup. It took a good minute or two before one of the servers came out to realize what happened to my entree. They offer to make a new batch right away, and replace our horrible app with something else. Meanwhile we \"enjoy\" the almost overcooked arctic char, which was saved by the sauce. A long while later, the replacement app arrived....not impressive, but not horrible. A little while later, my replacement gnocchi arrived. It was done more properly, but it was a small portion and not too impressive.
Then, they have NO dessert whatsoever left. We asked about it before we started, but no one came to tell us until it was too late.
At the end, they still charge against my wife's ICON benefit, but at least they complimented my part of the order.
I know this place is new, but they really need to improve with this inconsistency."}
{"text":"Just stopped in at the Holts Cafe for a quick lunch with a friend. The space is bright and has a very nice energy about it. The highlight of the experience was the excellent service from Jesse, our waiter. He recommended the soup of the day, and just as he said, it was delicious. Jesse was efficient, accommodating, and very professional. He turned an ordinary lunch into a perfectly lovely dining experience. I'll be back again just on account of the great service!"}
{"text":"Holts Caf√© is a trendy cafe on the mezzanine level of one of Yorkville's institutions, Holt Renfrew. The cafe was an elongated bright space with a red and light grey color scheme. It's an ideal setting for a casual lunch, business lunch, dates, or mid-afternoon shopping break. 

Mango Mule ($7)
- Mocktail
- Sweet and refreshing non-alcoholic beverage

Grilled Jerk Shrimp ($14) 
- Containing jalape√±o pineapple salsa
- Only had a slight kick due to some regular clienteles complaining about the heat level
- The jerk shrimp along with the sweet and juicy pineapple was a fantastic combo.  

The Fragrant Steamed Mussels ($13)
- The seafood delicacy come together with the help of white wine and various spices to create a lovely aromatic smell
- The broth itself was light and savory
- Generous helping of mussels 

Chopped Salad ($19)
- Decent option
- Too light due to lack of French vinaigrette

Pickerel ($27) 
- Perfectly cooked dish
- The fish was lightly seasoned and complemented the creamy Jerusalem artichoke and French beans
 
Strawberry Shortcake ($10)
- Was literally a platter of sugar, which probably doesn't suit everyone's palette
- Very sweet
- Could add a few more strawberries to balance out the sweetness of the shortcake biscuits

 Chocolate Mousse ($10)
- Definitely an airy and rich dessert

Overall, our lunch at the Holts Caf√© at Holt Renfrew Toronto was a very pleasant dining experience. Despite it being near 75% capacity, I noticed that all diners were being attended to appropriately, which I am not surprised considering the brand namesake. Furthermore, our server (Joe) was attentive and personable."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disappointed with this place. My plate came COVERED in a dusty and HAIRY residue. The proposed solution was to re-plate it which I think is utterly heinous. I guess they thought I would be okay with eating just the top layer of food and leaving the bottom. Really? The worst part was that it actually smelled absolutely delicious and I was starving. 

I thought the chef here was the same guy that helped rundown restaurants turn things around... I hope this is not the sort of quality assurance he teaches the other places."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend Kevan. Not a place I could  afford to eat at often but the whole experience was lovely. Had sweet potato fries and the BLT salad. Divine. Service was quick and efficient. Ambience nice. Price well it is Holt's so not cheap. Would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had the a few apps, the slow braised brisket and the banana cream pie.

\"Truffle Potato Chips\"- it was average, taste like Miss Vickie regular flavour chip.  
\"Saut√© Scallops\" - It was pretty bland but the scallops were jumbo size.
\"Slow Braised Brisket with mashed potatoes\" - The red wine sauce was delicious with the brisket and mashed potatoes but I have to say, the brisket was a little on the dry side. 
\"Banana Cream pie\" - the filling was average but the pie crust was very difficult to eat.

I give this 3 stars because the service was really good.  Although the food was not fabulous the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"It's always a stop here for me either for a quick sandwich or my usual G&T.  Always enjoyed the airy, bright, and clean lines either at the bar or in the lounge area.  

The food is good enough, I never had any issues with it, I only wish the portions were slightly bigger for the prices.  Appearance of the food is above average as well as the salt/pepper/sauce dispensers.

Service for me has always been efficient, friendly, and attentive.

However, being inside Holt's on the 2nd floor with men's clothing on the 1st, do expect the majority of patrons to be women - not that there is anything wrong with that.  I along with my male colleague were the only Y-chromes in the room beside the servers at one sitting. (No, I am not - but not that there is anything wrong with that either...)

The Law has eaten and returns for beverages while walking down Bloor on occasion..."}
{"text":"The Cafe is located is located on the 2nd level at the back of the women's shoe department. Upon entry the doorways are lined with the daily menu, so you can decide before hand whether entering this cafe is your cup of tea or not.

The cafe itself is quite beautiful. Like a modern diner, with retro red chairs that swivel, it gives off almost a lounge feel with the sleek grey couches lining one side, a bar on the other, and banquettes that allow you to take views of Bloor street below.

I came here for an early dinner, just about 6 pm on a Monday and the cafe was pretty dead. Including myself and my dinner mate there were 2 other females seated in the cafe. 

Our cheerful waiter told us to sit where ever we please and graciously brought us over the menu. Before laying eyes on the menu she asked to take our drink order. We asked if there was a drink menu and she alerted us it was on the back of the menu. They have an extensive wine/champagne list as well as some delicious cocktail options. However as soon as I laid eyes on the Iced Lemonade I had to have it.

She soon returned with our drinks and helped us settle on 2 sandwiches The Holt Burger which is a cafe favourite and  one of there specialty sandwiches called Les Tartines - A classic French open-faced sandwich on Poil√¢ne Bread, a rustic sourdough \"boule\"
that is toasted and served with a variety of delicious and fresh ingredients, we opted for the grilled chicken breast version.

Iced Lemonade - Very refreshing, nice and tart with a bit of pulp. Completely enjoyed this.

Grilled Chicken Breast Tartine - with red pepper, arugula, truffle honey and ch√™vre. This was totally not what I expected. The chicken breast was sliced very thinly and laid upon the toasted sourdough that was spread with the chevre and honey and topped with a heaping pile of arugula and slivers of red peppers. It was very difficult to eat, steak knife and fork required, I had to saw through the crust of the bread which was really tough but the bread itself was soft and tasty. However I just found it too hard to eat and I didn't enjoy the combination of ingredients and all the arugula was like a salad on my sandwich.

Holts Burger - with smoked bacon, Gouda, onion marmalade, and garlic a√Øoli. I totally understand why this is a cafe favourite! Burger was very flavourful, thick patty, cooked perfectly medium-well, good bun held together really well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of toppings. A very good burger indeed!

Truffle Potato Chips - with sea salt and chives. This was my side with the burger, another cafe favourite. They were pretty tastey however I found some chips to be a little overdone.

Onto to Dessert, as a PB lover I definitely knew what I wanted!

Reese's Pieces Ice Cream - with chocolate truffle bar and peanutbutter cookie crumbs. This was also a cafe favourite. The icecream taste exactly like reese's pieces and the truffle bar with peanutbutter cookie crumbs tasted exactly like a peanutbutter cup however it was lacking the silkyness of the milk chocolate.

I also ordered a Tea which came in a cute little white pot but it was probably the most bitter tea I've ever drank, it was palatable but far from the best.

Overall not a terrible meal, a good place to drop in for a bite after perusing Holt's. The plating here is gorgous, service was pretty spot on, but the food is hit or miss. I'd stick to odering Cafe Favourites which are highlighted on the menu with stars and the dessert selection and cocktails are safe bets too!"}
