{"text":"We went into Maple Street Biscuit Company just a few days after opening, but you couldn't tell they had just opened. Everyone working was helpful, friendly, and it looked like they had been here for years. After placing your order they ask you the question of the month, (ours was what is your favorite band) and when you hear that called out your food is done and ready to be picked up. The food came out pretty quick, but even if you have to wait it's worth it. The apple butter is absolutely delicious, some of the best I've had. The sausage gravy on the five is very tasty as well. Chris, the manager, was another bright spot. He was very attentive and routinely made his way to each table to make sure each guest was well taken care of. Overall I highly recommend Maple Street Biscuit Company. In an ever growing food market at Concord Mills, Maple Street stands out as a gem you won't want to miss. Friendly staff, amazing food, check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot ... the menu is a little overwhelming at first glance, but do yourself a favor and check this place out. The chicken, the gravy, the biscuits ... they were all worth the price!"}
{"text":"First time trying and it was good! Love the atmosphere! You place your order then find a seat. The line moves pretty quickly and we were easily able to find a table as many people were finishing up their food. Food came out quick. I ordered the chicken and biscuit with  sausage gravy, which had plenty of sausage and was very tasty! My only hang up was the temperature of the food, want as hot as I would have liked. Overall though breakfast was good and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cozy, fast-paced restaurant. Food quantities were generous and good quality. The coffee used for the latte was fairly thin and bitter. We tried the Goat Smash (you might want to ask for the jelly sauce on the side unless you don't mind getting sticky, they pour it all over), the Five-and-Dime (ditto with the gravy), and the home fries.
The service was prompt and smooth despite the crowds, which I suspect will begin to thin significantly once the novelty wears off. 
$30 for two biscuits, home fries and a latte isn't really the best value for breakfast. I'd place the value point of these biscuits at $5-$6 tops, not the $8-$10 price that's currently being charged.
Overall, we enjoyed the food but the prices will likely give us pause before returning. For $30 we could have two largr meals plus drinks at many full-service casual dining restaurants."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite casual breakfast spot. Immediately upon walking in, I felt like I had made the right choice for breakfast. Warm organic lighting and an open bright dining room. My wife is big on coffee and wanted me to take her somewhere that had coffee options. I was taking a risk bringing her here because I had no clue what the coffee offerings are. She doesn't drink straight up coffee, she enjoys lattes or chai lattes. As soon as we came through the door we saw an entire coffee menu on the wall with everything she hoped for. A friendly gentleman at the counter named Tion greeted us and asked if we were first timers. He then offered to walk us through the concept and the menu. Tion's energy and enthusiasm about the food made us feel welcomed and confident in our ordering. I ordered \"The Farmer\" because I really wanted to try the housemade apple butter and I added a fried egg. My wife ordered the \"Bam, Yo Yo\", I think. We also indulged in a chocolate chip cookie and a Dirty Chai Latte. Every morsel exceeded my expectation. A gentleman named Chris stopped by to check on us and stayed to talk to us about the concept and more menu items. He then proceeded to bring us cinnamon pecan biscuits to sample. They are amazing. Can't wait to get back.

Let's talk about the food: \"The Farmer\" Flaky, scratch made, buttermilk biscuit. The all natural fried chicken is well seasoned is definitely a star. Thick sliced pecan wood smoked bacon and cheddar cheese. Topped off with fresh house made apple butter. Sensational. 

\"Bam! Yo Yo\" is a delicious combination of their house-made vanilla bean waffle with asiago and pecan smoked bacon baked inside the waffle. \"INSIDE THE WAFFLE\". And their incredible all natural fried chicken with a ball of honey butter on the side and the best maple syrup south of Canada. So Damn Gooood!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was on point! Very friendly personable staff. I love the question they ask you for when your order is ready. Today was about bands! You'll see what I'm referring to when you visit.  Prices are reasonable, especially when your bussing your own tables so no need to bring tip money. The one thing I would change about this place is the maple syrup...yea, I said it...the maple syrup! I mean maple is in the name for gods sake! They serve it in small plastic containers and it's served cold. Now going into this place I envisioned warm maple syrup over waffles and the French toast biscuits...nope! 

All in all, the rest was great. They even have maple flavored coffee for you coffee folks!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good, crunchy, buttery biscuit??? I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt because I might have just ordered something I didn't particularly love or completely understood. I got the Squawking Goat and everything would taste good on its own, but combined, it wasn't harmonious. If I were to eat everything separately, it would be super good! 

The hashbrown cake was undercooked, if it had been cooked a bit longer, it would've been 10x better. My FAVORITE dish was the one with the shiitake mushrooms. The gravy at this place is on point though! 

Above all, the staff is what makes this place feel like home. Everyone is super welcoming and would check up on you or just simply want to learn more about their customers. I hope they keep this up throughout their progression for the success of the business. I would like to see some renovations to the Squawking Goat because it has potential to be good (maybe less of the Asian Chili sauce, kinda tastes weird with goat cheese). My review could possibly change in the future in the case that I find the right dish for me."}
{"text":"New to the area the Maple Street Biscuit Company in Concord. Originally from Jacksonville Florida Maple Street is serving huge knife and fork biscuit sandwiches with a spin on the traditional.  This is not your grandmas biscuit!  With toppings from goat cheese to sauteed spinach and more traditional toppings like sausage gravy and pecanwood smoked bacon, there is probably an option for you.  They also serve chicken and waffle options and bowls for those with aversions to big tasty biscuits.

For lunch your options include fresh salads in addition to those giant biscuits. Most items at Maple street are house made including their jams and jellies, house roasted coffees, and of course biscuits and gravy. 

Interior is comfortable with serve yourself coffee and beverages including iced coffee, tea, and sodas.

{"text":"Thankfully, I do not live near this place or else I'd be 700lbs. This is hands down the best biscuit I've ever had in my life. I live a couple of hours away, but I may have to relocate. This place is just amazing. 

The food is so good the employees could throw it at me, but they were actually extremely helpful and nice.

Everything is fresh and the biscuits are actually made right there. They've been featured on the Food Network. They have other locations in other states. I am very happy they came to Concord."}
{"text":"Don't have much to say. Everything was great!!! Coffee, biscuits, waffles & service. I'm so glad to have a new breakfast option so close to home."}
{"text":"First time visiting.....I'm thoroughly impressed!

The Squawking Goat ......5 Stars
BAM! .....5 Stars

Mmm mmm mmm Goood!

Can't wait to return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I stopped in this location Wednesday morning while I was on that side of town before heading into work.  I ordered the squawking goat, jelly on the side, and iced coffee to go.  The movie name thing is a little weird and slows things down but sat and waited for my $14 breakfast.  Got to work and realized I didn't get my pepper jelly! I was so disappointed and looking forward to this but too far to go back. It was still good but alittle dry without. I might try again but would eat there to make sure my order was correct, especially since I paid so much for breakfast!"}
{"text":"That was great! We were greeted by an employee who could tell we were \"virgins\" to Maple Street. She quickly provided us with some decision making tools to make our pick easier. This was a delicious experience. The \"five and dime\" and chicken and waffles was very good. It was plentiful and very filling. They offer a veggie gravy in case you don't do sausage gravy. And you can opt for the gravy on the side. The drip coffee was tasty and OJ was traditional Tropicana. The owner/manager came by to check on us and was very nice and gracious. He thanked us for coming in and made us feel totally welcomed. We will definitely be going back. 

It was very busy at 9 am -probably due to the Memorial Day holiday. And they have only been open for a couple weeks. However, the move in and out was seamless.  Our timing was great. This is a winner!"}
{"text":"Living nearby I passed this place many times, and I was really looking forward to trying it out because I'm a lover of biscuits!! Inside is very nice and clean, it has a cute local friendly neighborhood vibe to it. They have a lot of different biscuits to choose from, and they even serve waffles! I ordered the iron goat biscuit with a medium egg. The presentation was okay, so we're the biscuits. The goat cheese was a bit overpowering and the dish lacked flavor. It was good, but I couldn't get myself to finish it. We also ordered the hash browns to share, boy they were so undercooked! My mom had the Ralphie (biscuit & gravy) with the mushroom sauce, I actually really enjoyed this! Definitely recommend! I love the service and staff, they're service exceeded expectations and they continually checked up on the customers. I think the staff is really the highlight of this place, the food was honestly mediocre but the staff and service is what makes me want to come back and hopefully give the other menu options a try(:"}
{"text":"For them to be only open for a week 
 this place is ran like a well oiled machine. Their staff greeted me as soon as I came in and gave me a menu and told me where I could order at. This a casual sit down or carry out restaurant with a modern country kitchen vibe. Known for their flakey buttery biscuits they have several biscuit sandwiches. They also have other breakfast items such as waffles and hashup which I had. Hashups are a dressed up home fries that have chopped smoked ham, peppers grilled onions and cheese. They were very good and well seasoned. 
I also got a fried chicken biscuit both were a very big size and I have to admit the chicken was very good and I can't wait to try the chicken and waffles when I go back. Kayli (took my order and was most polite and patient as I skimmed the menu trying to decide what I wanted) she answered all my questions and served me with a smile! After I placed my order she then asked what was my favorite band I responded Maroon 5. She told me that was the question of the month and when they called out my order they would say Maroon 5 instead of my name which I thought was pretty awesome. This is a great breakfast or lunch spot,  and can't wait to go back. While they have a variety of coffees and teas they do not have mimosas."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food is delicious, the staff is so friendly and helpful, and everything is fresh. I had my 11 month old with me and they helped me get the high chair set up and came by and checked to see if we needed anything. Got the Five biscuit and it did not disappoint. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We walked in and had immediate help suggesting items to get since we were new. The staff was so friendly and it was a nice relaxing environment. We had some chicken biscuit with gravy and it tasted amazing and we got it for a good price as well. They even brought out a free biscuit with icing on top for desert we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I got a salad with chicken and it was good. The coffee was really good. The person was a little slow behind the counter but I guess that's to be expected when you first open an establishment. The portion of chicken that I received on my salad was kind of disappointing. I thought  for the price it would have more chicken. Overall, it was fine. It nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Went here after about a week they were open. It was around 8am on a Friday morning. The line was short, about 3 people in front of me, but, since everyone is trying to understand how the restaurant works, it takes a while for the cashier to conclude each order as they take their time to explain the menu items. It took me about 7 minutes to get to order something (not bad). I think this is okay, but, ideally people need to decide BEFORE getting in line. Maybe the restaurant should put someone before people walk in line to avoid such back up.

The food: A bit \"strange\". Not your typical breakfast place. Their focus is obviously biscuit. The menu shows items that are a bit complex. My conclusion is that their key items are the biscuit, gravy and chicken. The food items reminded me about a biscuit place in Asheville that we were not even able to get in due to the line.

Since it was too complex for me to figure it out at 8am after a full week away from home, I decided to order something customized and simple: Bacon, Egg and Cheese on a biscuit. Since this is not something on the menu, took a while for them to understand what I wanted and to enter the order. I also asked for a medium coffee. When the total came up, it was a bit shocking: close to US$ 10 ! Yes, this is not a fast food place, I would expect to pay more for better ingredients, but, this was way too much in my opinion.

The coffee wasn't great. I don't like flavor in my coffee. Coffee is supposed to taste like coffee, not maple with coffee.

The manager came in and asked for my experience and I told him exactly what I wrote here. He agreed with me that what I ordered is not exactly what they are focusing on, and asked me to not give up. He was nice enough to give me the cinnamon biscuit with glaze. It was really good !

Overall I think that this place is not worth 5 stars but not terrible to deserve less than 4. I'll give 4 specially because of the very friendly personable staff. The food was mediocre, not really worth the price. The staff and service is what makes me want to come back and hopefully give other menu options a try (such as the waffles).

Another update from 5/30: Tried to get a quick breakfast today, at 7:30am. About 5 people in line. I waited about 10 minutes, only 1 cashier, and again explaining all the items. I had to leave as I had a meeting at 8:00am and could not wait too much for breakfast. They need to change that quickly or people will start to get somewhere else."}
{"text":"I think Maple street is a place that's original, fresh, and overall pretty good! I had the Grits bowl with scrambled eggs and bacon, wifey had a chicken biscuit blt. It was moist & tasty. I also got an order of fried green tomatos. Very tasty! Only negative is the tomatoes were cut too thick other wish a very good appetizer! I look forward to trying more on the Menu!"}
{"text":"Checked out the new Maple Street this morning for their grand opening.  We were obsessed with Maple Street when we lived in Jacksonville, FL, so we were so excited to hear they were coming to this area! This new location was just as good as we remembered from Florida and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good. I had a Maple Sticky, I believe was the name. Chicken biscuit with bacon covered in maple syrup. Seems each menu item is decadent. Definitely cannot indulge this way every day--or even every week--but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth meal from Maple Street. The food is good. However, this time I was very disappointed. I had been eyeing the Sweet Grace waffles, so I decided to get them today. We called it in for take out. When I got home, what I saw is in the picture below. Although, I had to assemble it myself. The strawberries, whipped cream, and syrup were in teeny tiny plastic containers. There may be a total of 2 strawberries and 1 T of whipped cream. Is this worth $9? I am really upset that I paid $9 for this."}
{"text":"The five and dime biscuit is great the chicken is cooked perfectly with cheese and bacon. The gravy with a kick is awesome what a combination can't wait to try some others on the menu the employees are very nice"}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing biscuits and gravy! If you want a clean, courteous and delicious experience this is the place to go! They go above and beyond expectations."}
{"text":"This place is sinfully delicious. It's comfort food at its best. The chicken biscuit is my favorite. The manager was very attentive and exchanged my niece's meal because she doesn't like maple syrup. Everything includes a hint of maple syrup unless you ask them to put it on the side."}
{"text":"Good environment and good people. Their coffee is good as well as the food (that I tried). They are community focused. Very clean place."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to visit based on all the hype. We came in around 12:30 this afternoon. We did call first to gage a wait time. A woman let us know they had open patio seating and a few places left at the community tables. When we walked inside we joined the line of people waiting to order at the counter. I'd say the line took about 15 minutes. However it only seemed to take that long because multiple people had their heart set on waffles, only to find out once they got to the cash register that the waffle machine was broken. It set back the line and definitely disappointed many customers. In the future, perhaps the manager should put out some sort of sign so customers don't waste 15 minutes of their time. I had decided to get \"The Biscuite Frenchè\". However when we finally got to the front I was also informed they couldn't make it due to lack of cinnamon. Not impressed. In the end I decided on \"The Sticky Maple\" and my boyfriend got \"The Farmer\" and wanted an iced coffee (they were also out of that). We sat down and thankfully the food came out quickly. Honestly, for $9; it was just ok. Didn't rock my world but it tasted fine. We were getting ready to leave when a worker came up to me, asked me how everything was and reminded me to clean up my plates. I didn't appreciate that especially since up until then I had seen other workers kindly taking plates from other tables. All in all, I wasn't impressed. Like I said, food was ok. But not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Family breakfast was amazing. We had the pecan cinnamon biscuit to share. I had the Five and Dime and it was great! My kids had the waffle and there was not a scrap of food left on the table. Friendly and helpful staff with great food will make this place a regular stop for breakfast!"}
