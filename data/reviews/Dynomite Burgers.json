{"text":"I feel like I need some Lipitor after my visit to Dynomite Burgers...and that's a good thing!  I went with the Chinato burger and was very happy with my choice. The mortadella was crispy and salty and complimented the rich, juicy, beefy flavor of the burger patty.  The balsamic onions did their job perfectly by providing a nice touch of sweet and sour to prevent the burger from being over-rich. The tomato mayo was delicious too, although a good amount of it escaped onto my hands and the burger wrapper below. I must have went through a trees-worth of napkins. This burger was MESS-Y!  The side of fries, while certainly not the best fries I've ever had, were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. No complaints there.  In fact, I have no complaints at all. Although if there HAD to be any gripe it would be that it can be pretty chilly in the winter, standing outside waiting for your burger order to be completed, but that can be avoided by calling ahead. They even have an online ordering system.  Overall, this is easily one of the best places for a burger in Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best vegan burger in Cleveland, please do stop by. As a previous beef burger eater, I can say that this is actually tastier! The texture, the seasoning and the toppings all create this delicious burger! My co workers have been asking questions left and right about this place because it smells so good! I called in my order and it took me about 10minutes to get there.  I was there and back to work in about 30min which is why I have time to write this review! The young man who took my order was friendly and attentive. The young lady who rang me out was respectful, nice and funny! Speedy and excellent customer service! I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"So last weekend we made a point of making it to Dynomite.  I had read about it and thought it sounded like a neat concept.  A Cleveland concept for sure - upscale burger joint serving alcohol (We had Great Lakes!) located on a triangle of space in a former beauty salon  with Ikea-like tables and chairs on a patio with a huge round fire pit - located not far from Cleveland's version of Broadway!  Love the idea!  Love the burger choices - named after the chef's other Cleveland restaurants!  The only reason it did not rate a 5 is that I would have liked to have been able to choose how the burger was cooked.  I like my burgers rare - the burger I had was medium!  The gentlemen we met as we approached the restaurant was super friendly and let us know they were opening in 5 minutes.  The young woman that took our order was great - letting us know that they did not yet have their full liquor license so they could serve only beer - no wine yet!  My husband and I frequent the theater district and as we ate we discussed the fact that we would definitely stop here for a burger on the way to a show - even in much cooler weather!  Not sure what they winter hours will be!"}
{"text":"I am trying to review the Progressive Field location.  The burger was good, however that is the only good thing in the review. How dare they have the intestinal fortitude to charge $36.00 for Two tiny burgers and 2 Bottles of Pepsi. I am taking my son to a ballgame not to an expensive dinner. The owner has no compassion for a family outing only greed to take advantage of families I will attend many more Tribe games but I will Never patronize any restaurant owned by these people from Dynomite Burgers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and my husband had the fish. I didn't realize that the turkey would have mayo along with cranberry sauce. They were very nice about remaking it as I am not a mayo fan. Outdoor seating (takeout window only). We enjoyed being able to chill out and drink a beer as well."}
{"text":"The best part about Dynomite Burgers is that you can grab an acceptable burger and some fries and eat outside in the plaza when the weather is nice. Also that they serve beer and milkshakes. Despite the Zach Bruell pedigree, the burgers are edible but not spectacular. They're in the big messy burger category, so be sure to grab plenty of napkins. Probably don't have to say this but if you're a vegetarian you're better off skipping the veggie burger and sticking with fries and some soft-serve. The veggie burger I tried was crumbly and not particularly flavorful and topped with weirdly dry vegan \"mayo\" and a big bunch of cilantro.   In short: Dynomite is no Shake Shack, but isn't a terrible option if you're in the area and want a burger."}
{"text":"I asked for my burger to come with no sauce because I can't eat mayo. When I got back to the office it was smothered in sauce.  Apparently the workers don't care.  I won't go there again."}
{"text":"Super long wait during lunch time. Passable flavor on what appears to be half a hamburger. patty.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've had a few burgers here. Not inexpensive. Somehow they all end up looking like they were run over by a truck--messy! Shakes are good. Fries are just OK."}
{"text":"The burgers are never consistent in taste and quality. The owners/managers are rude and not pleasant. If you order fries, make sure you ask for them without salt if you don't like overly salted fries."}
{"text":"I love this place! Yes, the burgers are a little messy to eat; but it is only because they are overflowing with deliciousness. The pickles are also super yummy, I recommend getting a side order of those. The staff is very friendly. This place is great if you are in the area to visit the Playhouse and want to eat someplace less formal than other restaurants in the area. Only downside? Finding someplace to park if you are only in the area to get your burger fix. It's tough to find street parking, I usually park a street or two over and walk to indulge my burger craving."}
{"text":"My first impression wasn't full on.  I did have the veggie burger and it was awful!  I cut it in half and it melted like butter.  The taste was not right, too many beets in the mix.  Just wrong.  But I have been back and the food is good.  Fries are excellent and the burgers, sushi, and mac-n-cheese are spot on.  So lesson learned, go there but don't get the veggie burger!"}
{"text":"A good burger and shake, but it's unfortunate that it's located just beside one of Cleveland's smelliest sewer manholes. While the dining tables are far enough that it's not a big concern, I have to wonder why the owners of this establishment haven't made some kind of request with the city to change the air around the order window. Not the most appetizing smell."}
{"text":"The burgers are above average for the price and I appreciate the outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  However, the lack of posted hours and broken online ordering system causes confusion."}
{"text":"No good!  20 minute wait for a sandwich and a milkshake!  Food was sub-par!   The $5 milkshake was not worth $5, half melted.   A homeless gentleman decided to steal a chair from our table and sit next to us with the strongest scent of urine I have ever smelled!"}
{"text":"This place is closed during the winter and they finally opened up last month for the season. Located in a busy area right by Playhouse Square, it's the perfect place to grab a burger and sit at one of the tables outside, I mean that is the only place you can sit as Dynomite is just a super-sized cart without wheels. You walk up to the window, order what you'd like and wait.   Being my first time there, I ordered the Dynomite burger, which is considered a specialty burger. They offer regular burgers where you can add the toppings you'd like (they charge you for nearly every topping). They have other specialty burgers named after local restaurants. I also ordered fries and took my order to go. I waited about 8 minutes or so, and there was only one person in front of me.   The burger made my mental list of worst burgers I've ever had, yikes! I live about two minutes away;  walking distance and my bun was 40% soggy. The worst part is 70% of the burger wasn't thoroughly cooked and pink, which I hate and am absolutely disgusted by. The fries were hot, fresh and yummy!   Employees are dry in conversation and don't ask how you'd like your burger made (KEY QUESTION WHEN ORDERING MEAT). Prices are fair, and I love the location.   I would try this place again, just because I really like the location, if they fail again, there's no impressing me after that."}
{"text":"I live next to this place and it was exactly what the neighborhood needed. Nice place to grab a beer, eat a burger, and watch a fire in the city. And they play good music. Not a bad deal.  Burgers are large, fries are pretty good, and the soft serve is nice treat. They are heavy on the sauce, but that's ok with me. Try the Cowell & Hubbard."}
{"text":"First time at Dynomite Burgers, even though I work just a few minutes from the place.  I am a big fan of Zack Bruell, and this has been on my short list of places to try.   A co-worker and I walked to Dynomite for lunch.  I had purchased a $10 gift certificate from Restaurant.com (hint, hint:-).   I ordered the chicken sandwich $6.00 and fries $2.50, my co-worker ordered the Parallax burger $8.00 and a side of fries.  There was a short wait, but not bad, and the weather was just perfect, so we really didn't mind the wait.  Once our order was ready, we found a table on the adjacent patio (there is no indoor seating, the restaurant is a walk-up),    There was a group of people right next to the patio participating in a  lunch time Tai Chi session, which was fun to watch.  The fries were hand-cut, nicely portioned, but as other Yelpers have mentioned.....very salty.   There was a sufficient supply of ketchup in our to-go bag, without having to request it....which was nice.   My chicken sandwich was nicely made, a little messy (in a good way)  buffalo/tabasco sauced chicken breast, topped with pickled vegetables (yum), spring greens, bleu cheese mayo and a homemade bun.  The only complaint was that the chicken was a little bit tough and kinda stringy.   My co-worker thoroughly enjoyed her burger.  My sandwich was probably a \"3\" but the experience was definitely a \"4\".   It was also pretty cool that there were beer and wine offerings, which would make for a very nice evening meal on Playhouse Square.   I will return, but will probably get a burger."}
{"text":"I'm giving it only three stars mainly for the price. Burger, fries, and milk shake $14.50. I had the parallax burger. I asked for medium and it was medium. The patty had good flavoring. Toppings included white cheddar cheese, bacon, red onion, and a BBQ mayo. I am not sure if it was the seasoning of the burger or the BBQ mayo, but it had a good flavor. The only reason I say this is there didn't seem to be a ton of mayo. The bun was good. Fries are similar to Five Guys. Strawberry milkshake was good. There may be seating. When I was there several tables and chairs were chained up, so people had to sit on the concrete walls. If it was a nice day and I was with co-workers I might recommend Dynomite, however I would caution them about the price."}
{"text":"Found the finger tip of a plastic glove in my burger. Yuck!!! I would never re-visit this spot. Dirty in my opinion. I tried to call the owner and received a call from another one of his restaurant managers. He was nice but not the same. This restaurant manager never took the call."}
{"text":"So I guess open 11:00am-3:00pm is at staff discretion?  We were walking up to the window and the cook looked right at us, closed the window as we arrived, and walked behind the back wall of the kitchen at 2:40pm.   All we wanted was a milkshake...Not cool.  The food is decent, but the service can obviously use some improvements."}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this place! I work in Downtown and I always love a new spot for lunch. Dynomite Burgers is very exciting for me since I love Zack's restaurants! They have all the Chain Restaurant Burgers (L'albatros burger, chinato burger, parallax burger, etc.). It is perfect when you're on your lunch break and or the restaurants are jam packed and all you want is one of their big hit burgers. Service is quick, fresh, and tasty! Very good prices and everything is a la carte."}
{"text":"Having lived in NYC for many years, I was a frequent visitor to a restaurant Shake Shack.  While they have locations in other cities, like Washington, DC, NYC is where they got their start & gradually began their expansion throughout multiple boroughs.    If I was in the mood for the ridiculously long lines & the novelty of an Olive Garden style alert device going off when my order was ready, & had money to burn for their overpriced menu items, it was a welcome opportunity to enjoy a burger that had the taste of a backyard bbq.  Dynomite is similarly styled in terms of taste & size, although they offer a significantly more exotic menu, Shake Shack's willingness to combine lemonade & ice tea, be damned!    On a recent trip to Cleveland, I actually managed to visit 2 locations, as the weather was great & I felt in the mood for summertime fun food & went with the Cowell & Hubbard Burger both times.  Onions are not my thing, because I have a hard enough time attracting the ladies, so I opted against them & they knocked the burgers out of the park both times (metaphorically, fortunately, as my second visit was at Progressive Field & who wants to go chasing after a hamburger outside a baseball stadium?)  While I do prefer a bit more autonomy with my burgers - frankly, I don't know Big Zack, or care about his namesake burger & what's on it, & just want one with mozzarella cheese & bacon, the end result was pretty good if you're visiting the area.  Definitely better than standard ballpark fare, although locals may have better options to recommend outside the stadium."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers...a must for downtown lunch.  All of the burgers are exactly as they are from Zach's other restaurants.  Quality is outstanding.  Had the L'albatross burger which is a personal favorite (the blended peppers are awesome). Zach was there and also recommended the chicken sandwich, which I'll be trying next visit. Simple, quick, and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Cleveland now has it's own homegrown version of Shake Shack and it is great.  It might be a bit pricy, but those burgers and shakes are amazing. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers.  There are basic and specialty burgers named after Zachary Bruell's restaurants.  Prices are higher than normal, but worth it.  There are just a few tables located at Star Plaza, so there is often a requirement to take them back to the office- very inconvenient or eat them \"on the fly.\""}
{"text":"Wish they could cook these to order!  Ordered medium with specification \"please cook through\" based on previous experience with burgers ordered medium that were virtually uncooked burgers in the middle.  Too cold to eat there with temps in the 40's.  Got back to the office -- burgers were super rare again -- not even warm in the middle.  LOVE the Bearnaise mayo but please cook the burgers to order!!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first day. The fries had a little too much salt and the burger was good. I got the parallax burger. I would've liked a little more sauce on it. The wait for my food was a little long. I felt like I was waiting forever and they didn't give me my drink until my food came out. It was so overpriced."}
{"text":"The people that work here are fantastic.  I asked for a grilled cheese and they created an amazing sandwich!  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty bad.  The Lemonade seemed to be from concentrate, and not mixed correctly, the fries had a very strange taste, which reminded me of a sugar substitute.  The burger was very thin, and the sandwich as a whole tasted basically like ketchup and bread.   The staff did not tell me that I would be charged extra for lettuce and tomato, and I did not realize until I looked at my receipt.  The amount of lettuce and tomato on the sandwhich was very small.  The food is very expensive, especially since it seems to be of very low quality.  It was really the worst meal I have had in a long time.  They now have swing dances right next to Dynamite Burgers, which is why I was there when I got dinner there.   It would be a convenient place to eat if I am there for swing dancing, but based on my experience they are missing the chance to get as much business from that as they could.  I have no desire to eat there again, and would not recommend it."}
{"text":"This walk up burger stand is right outside my work, so its difficult to resist getting fries and a shake (or a beer) everyday during lunch! The vegan burger is a big portion size, and although the menu says \"cilantro mayo\", staff confirmed its vegan mayo made with tofu. The fries are thick and delicious. Only dislikes were too much cilantro on the burger, and tiny little nats that were flyin around the tables set up outside."}
{"text":"Great staff but the veggie burger is not that good. Would be better to use a garden burger patty instead of the bulky bean patty they make. The patty has too much beet flavor that I just don't like. Their fries are decent though."}
{"text":"Good burgers good fries. If you want healthy, non greasy food you shouldn't be eating at a burger place it the first place. The fries are like you get at the fair and the burgers are messy but yummy yummy.       My only complaint about the food is that they don't ask you what temperature you want your burger cooked. Mine was pinker then I would prefer, and also uneven, half was a medium well and the other half was more of a medium rare .        Also the location is great unfortunately the continuous stream of buses on Euclid make it hard to hear what anyone is saying and gas you out with exhaust.       It is nice to have something cheap in this location that's not subway."}
{"text":"A \"Shake Shack\" for Cleveland? No, it can't be!  Finally, a quick place for a burger in the evening in downtown. Oh man, we need more of these!   It's a cute location- on the corner of e12th and Euclid, it boasts an outdoor seating area with a roaring fire place. Oh how cute! I exclaimed.  He ordered the Chinato burger. Solid choice, and it was good. I ordered the Cowell and Hubbard burger. Wowza, that was good. I ordered it on the fact that I had no idea what Fontina was. And oh man, it was GOOD on my burger.  I thought the buns were also delicious as well. I liked Dynomite a tad differently than B-spot- yes, they both had the double meat idea, but Dynomite Burgers are so much more...do-able. Like, I felt like I could finish my burger....which is a good thing.  The milkshake...was not like a Shake Shack milkshake at all. It was sweet...and didn't taste like salty caramel. Nonetheless, it was a good milkshake as it was super thick...but a tad too sweet for my liking.  If you're downtown, want to sit outside, and grab a quick bite to eat, stop by Dynomite! It's worth the food explosion in your mouth! (heh heh)"}
{"text":"Wet, soggy, and messy burgers.  I went with my coworkers today for lunch.  We each ordered a variation of their burgers. Mine was not cooked through and was very messy. One friends burgery actually fell apart on the ground. The fries were pretty greasy. Not worth the price we paid. I don't see what the fuss is all about as these are just average street food burgers, nothing really special."}
{"text":"Dynomite is a seasonal burger shack that just reopened for the season on April 1st. Playhouse Square has recently been spruced up and it looks great. The sign above Euclid is impressive and the chandelier is a little bit odd. The arches remind me of the Short North in Columbus. The outdoor patio is perfect for relaxing downtown with some good food and drink. Dynomite has a few white and red wine varieties and beer on the menu. There are around 6 suggested fancy burger offerings themed after the chef's various restaurants. There are also customizable burgers starting at $6 with extras at 25 cents to $1 for bacon. The buns are quality bread and not throw away grocery store style. There are also salads, chicken sandwiches, vegan burgers, chili and other sides. This will be one of my regular stops for a quick bite to eat when the weather permits. There are so many different things I would like to sample on the menu. I urge the reader to come try out Dynomite and see the new improvements to the Playhouse Square District."}
{"text":"I was unable to get the online ordering system to work - it wouldn't let me choose a location which is the second mandatory step of placing an online order. Giving up, I instead called to place my order at the Playhouse location. After being hung up on once I got a friendly lady to take my order. She asked me when I wanted it for. I asked how long it would take and she said just 10 minutes. This was about 12:50p on a Friday.   When I arrived just after 1p my order was ready. I was really the only one near the place. I approached the open window at the northeastern corner of the shack and paid. I was instructed to then go to the southeastern window to pick-up my order, which was odd since the same person handed my food to me as took my money.  Anyways, the food was good - greasy as anything - but good. I got the burger named Dynomite which contained jalapenos, red onions, Pepper Jack cheese, and a spicy mayo. The burger was definitely spicy, but not too much. The bun was a good sized - not overwhelming. The meat was cooked medium (and I wasn't asked how I wanted it done so if you have a preference I guess try asking). All in all I liked the burger.   I also tried the Peppadew Peppers. I love these from Market Wine Bar. The ones here looked the same, but the flavor was different and I have to say I prefer the ones at Market. These ones had a large amount of spice on them - perhaps thyme..... It changed the flavor from whatever I'm used to at Market.  Dynomite is a great spot for a quick lunch and if it's nice outside there are many tables set out in front of it on Star Plaza. The fries are good too."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy grabbing lunch here when I worked downtown. This isn't a restaurant, it's a little food box on the plaza at Euclid &14th. The burgers are good, the fries are from fresh cut potatoes and the milkshakes are great. The prices are a bit pricey but it is downtown lunch spot."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it reminded me of the Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park, New York City. Zack really had the opportunity to teach CLE how simple good fresh burgers can be created, enjoyed and eaten in a sophisticated yet uniquely CLE comfortable outdoor Spring/Summer urban setting.  The food you eat should leave a memorable imprint and inspire you to return back for more. It doesn't matter wether it's hamburgers or hot dogs. If you can't get the basic's right then you'll miss the opportunity to create a lasting impression. Unfortunately Dynomite misses the mark. My friend and I kept our order simple: Cheddar cheese , raw onion, lettuce, tomato. ketchup and mayo. The employee at the counter didn't bother to ask us how we would like our burgers cooked.  Dynomite sway's towards the mediocrity of it all and insult's a generation of current Clevelander's by serving sub-par burgers and soggy french fries in what appears to be the real deal. It's an illusion.  So disappointing as it could have been CLE own Shake Shack."}
