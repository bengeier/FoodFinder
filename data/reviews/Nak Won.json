{"text":"I love the finch station location more but this One is much closer. Same food menu as finch location but the prices are higher. Looks busy always. I love the food so I go but the service is horrible. I went with a friend but my friend didn't wanted to get something as she had already had dinner prior to meeting me but I wanted to come and eat so the waiter takes my order and gives my friend a stare. And says that's all you guys getting with a tone and turned her face and walked away. I was so surprised. I had my food and I won't be going back. Also I paid with cash and the waiter assumed the change is for here and never returned it."}
{"text":"The fried rice omelette was a solid choice for a midday meal! Service was solid and the food came out right away."}
{"text":"I come to young and finch quite often.   I usually go to the owl but recently I found the broth a liitle warm there so I cam back here.      I have mixed reviews like everyone else.  Pork bone soup is ok. But nothing special.  Side are very basic but just like the owl they tend to give then when you get you food.    I don't expect too much with services and that what exactly I get"}
{"text":"My favorite dish of theirs is Gamja Tang, it's a pork bone soup. And some other dishes are also quite nice. However, the reason why I only give 3 rating is bcos of their horrendous service. Every waiter, and I mean it, every one of them is rude and made me and my friends felt really unwelcomed; like we were there to eat free food instead of paying for them.   But since I like their Gamja Tang a lot, I only come here whenever I feel like having this pork bone soup."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to Nak Won was one I will never forget...there was a COCKROACH in the cold side dish they served!* I was absolutely disgusted. I showed the server, and she did not even apologize or address the issue. She simply took the dish away and gave us another dish of the same thing!!   Once our bill came, I asked politely if there was anything the owner could do  for a discount since there was a cockroach, and she just smirked and shook her head.   I would very strongly recommend nobody to eat at this restaurant. The food and kitchen are clearly very dirty and the service is despicable.  * If you have a strong stomach, check out the photo I posted."}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone here on the service. The service was terrible; it was slow and the waitresses are not friendly and do not take their time to answer your questions. A new customer who does not know what food to order is not given any recommendations other then: \"Everything here is equally good and popular.\" All customers are given a seat immediately, but they still have to wait a long time to order and to eat. However, I do not blame them so much for their service; for a big restaurant, two waitresses is far too little; I blame the owner for not hiring more people. Very slow service, especially for weekends.  As for the food, the most popular dish I saw was gamjatang. Unfortunately, it was my first time eating here, and I did not know what I should've ordered. Instead, I ate soon dubu, dolsot bibimbap and some meat and rice dish. The taste was not good, however, it was not terrible either. In other words, if you can cook, just eat at home. The Korean food at Buk Chang Dong in KoreaTown is much better. The soon dubu here is not spicy and tastes funky. It just seems to be salty red soup.  One of the positive things is the various amount of small dishes of foods that they give you...10 foods!  The pricing was okay, but I'd rather not pay for terrible service and okay/bad food. If it's your first time eating at a Korean restaurant, please do not go here, it will give you a bad impression. But if you must, do yourself a favour and do not make the same mistake as I did; just order gamjatang. Most people order it, so it must be decent.  Well, I wouldn't come here again.  Oh, and the restaurant has an excessive cooking smell that makes your clothes smell like food...and by excessive, I mean a lot more compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been here several times before. however when I came to dinner today it was horrific!! at the beginning when they give us the tea the teapot was not even half filled. Then we asked the lady to fill the teapot for us. The lady totally forgot and had to ask her several times and during the time she was trying to ignore us. later on the lady gave our teapot to the next table. but that wasn't the most frustrating thing. Finally when we waited the food to come over she misunderstood the order that I wanted which was writing clearly from the order sheet and repeated her several times since she didn't speak English. She was expecting me to know Mandarin even I have a Asian face but doesn't mean I would understand. PLUS the food has changed its a very bad quality I DONT recommend any one going!"}
{"text":"Went to dine here with my friend who came from western Ontario. The waiter that served us would just dump the food on the table without saying a word and had a bad attitude the whole time. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. The hot stone bibimbap also tasted bland"}
{"text":"We came here for a dinner. Food was not too bad, but the service was horrible! There were only two ladies around and they looked impatient. We were basically ignored. There is one help button on the table, but do not bother as no one will come to help, like non-functioning at all. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Got yelled at for asking tea. Did not give us tea until we asked them 10 times. Horrible service."}
{"text":"This place is good for Korean food on the cheap or when you just have a craving for Korean food.  It's pretty busy which is a good sign.  Most dishes are less than $10 and  you get a bounty of complimentary side dishes along with your meal.  Apparently they are refilled free of charge but I've never had the urge to refill as I want to eat/enjoy the food that I order.  Service is really fast and the food has been consistenly yummy the handful of times that I've been."}
{"text":"Been eating here since 2012! Me and my gf went here after having dessert at cafe princess. All meal came with banchan! The sweet potato side is to die for. I recently had their sweet and sour pork I was surprise (not the red sauce you'll hope for) it's really good. Don't come here on dinner time specially Friday because it's really busy and will take time when you ask for something."}
{"text":"The yelp reviews are true,  the service was really meh. But they give many side dishes and food are actually pretty nice.  Their kimchi are legit they are spicy. Not like some others they hv either overly sour or salty but that one i had was just right. The pork bone soup i had is large in portion. But its a little too oily to my liking. Other than that, it is pretty good in terms of the reasonable price and food quality."}
{"text":"My work colleagues and I went for lunch, having seen the pleasant reviews for this place. The table we were seated at was crooked and wobbly and my co-worker banged her elbow on the edge by accident. The waitresses ignored us for a good ten minutes before getting our orders. If the place was packed it would be understandable, but it was half-full at best.  The one redeeming point would be the food. The side dishes were okay, typical as in any other Korean restaurant around the local area. The tempura lunchbox was huge, bigger than most I've seen. But the batter was greasy and oily, even for shrimp tempura. The oily fragrance was so overpowering that my head was hurting after a while.  Despite these minor flaws here and there, it would have been fine overall. But we waited ten minutes after asking for the cheque and eventually we walked to the counter to pay and get out. We each paid individually and I paid the usual amount before the waitress stops me and says \"...You're not paying for tip?\" (I initially gave an extra dollar as tip, which seemed decent given how much we had to wait) But actually having the audacity to grab my sleeve and ask for a tip was insulting. I threw in an extra dollar but it felt more like charity than an actual tip for the atrocious service. My co-workers also paid extra after the waitress kept asking for more charity.  Long story short: this restaurant is on the blacklist. The abundance and general quality of food may have been the saving grace but the overall terrible service and disrespect for customers marred it all. The next time any waitress asks for more 'tip' I'll throw in a nickel, maybe."}
{"text":"One of my go-to korean places to eat at. Located downtown so it's super accessible. They recently upgraded their menu to include pictures for ALL of their dishes. It's nice and convenient if you want to try something new or want to bring friends or fam that aren't knowledgable about korean food.  The free, refillable banchan are good. I find that one or two seem to change each time I go though...  The gamjatang and bulgogi are so good! I also enjoy their new combos that they've added where you can get kanpungi or tangsooyuk with your noodles. Fairly good prices and I haven't had a huuuge problem with service. Though the ringing bell helps. I find if you go to the older woman you'll be told to give a tip. Usually the younger girls are more chill and lax. So beware. But overall, really solid place to go. Delicious and filling. A good bang for your buck. I have yet to have a bad dish and will continue to bring friends over."}
{"text":"Delicious pork bone soup,a bit on the salty side,but easily offset by pairing it with the complimentary bowl of rice.  Seafood noodle soup (jam pong, sp?) is not as good as the one from Kachi (which I consider to be the gold standard).  Bibimbap is comparable to other Korean restos."}
{"text":"I have my day off, went to CIBC bank to settle some stuff. Past by Nak Won so headed in to look for kimchi fried rice. Unfortunately I don't see that in the menu, ordered Kimchi Stew instead.   It was very spicy  for me. Oh god, but I like it. The portion of the food is enough for a big eater like me. Love how they serve grain rice instead of plain white one. Lunch special $8.99, $10.16 after tax.   The ambiance is nice and it just located 6 minutes from my place.  would come back to try their BBQ."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good service. The kimchi pork bone soup on a cold winter day makes me so happy!"}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time, came here almost every week. Today service is super bad. We know Korean server always have bad attitude/no service but this is unacceptable!  Is Saturday and they only have 3 servers. We seated for almost 20min and not even a glass of water.  She bring us the bill without us asking and is only 9:45-store not close till 11 and ppl still around eating and no one waiting.  We end up didn't give her full 10% tips and finally get her attention and she ask us it's not even 10% something wrong with you?!  OF COZ! because of your attitude...and she like ya is normal because is Saturday....well, that's not my problem, I didn't come here to eat free and price is not that cheap, is your problem that it's understaff and if you don't want to hire more ppl to save cost, you gotta \"s*ck it up\" and deal with the situation you created and not giving attitude to your customer...I will not return again! Come here if you ready to eat with getting attitude!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are soooooooo rude!! I ordered pork bone soup with potatoes and they didn't give me potatoes. And their reason for that is: \"pork bone soup with potatoes doesn't come with potatoes. \" what a joke! They are so mean and rude to customers!"}
{"text":"Both times I came here there was a lot of seating available. This place has legit Korean ppl working here which is nice for a change. The English is limited depending on who serves you. I got the pork bone soup with cabbage. I would say its good, but the pork bone is not very meaty. Nice and spicy though. Of course, they also give you lots of taster sample of potato, bean sprout, seaweed, jap chae etc.,  I have yet to try their bbq short ribs, but I may be interested to try it next time. Its conveniently close to Spadina/Dundas area."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! In addition to fast and usually friendly service (there have been times where they are super busy and its more efficient than friendy), they have awesome side dishes! I actually come here mostly for the side dishes, but enjoy their pork bone soup, any kind of cutlet, and bim bim bap in the stone bowl!  They also have lunch specials from 11am - 3pm!"}
{"text":"The fact that each location has different prices for the same item is deceiving. Also that one location will change pork for chicken and one says its not allowed. But i love the food!"}
{"text":"Came here on Easter Monday with a friend as our original plan was to eat elsewhere but it was closed early. We thought why not try it out as my sister does enjoy their food very much. I ordered the jajangmyun while my friend got the ddeokbokki. We weren't very hungry since the plan was to have apps and drinks before karaoke. The ddeokbokki was pretty good. It was sweet yet had a good spicy kick to it. The jajangmyun however was definitely not my cup of tea. There was not enough flavour to the black bean sauce and it basically just tasted like plain noodles to me. The service was pretty good and was quick to realize our buzzer wasn't working. Maybe next time I'll try another dish but for now, it's not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"terrible service. waitress gives attitude when asked for water and side dishes. Food is very salty with no flavor. would not return"}
{"text":"I came here tonight for my birthday dinner with my husband.  We were promptly seated and we thought everything would be fast.  WRONG!  It took the waiter 10-15 min to respond to our bell ring (located at the side of the table) to take our order.  The restaurant was still pretty empty at this time.   Took them another 10 min before we were served.    When we wanted more service,  I had to press the bell more than 10 times before someone finally turned up -  that was another 15-20 mins wait.  When we finally rang the bell for our bill, 10 min passed by and  no one showed up,  we ended up having to go to the cashier and pay.  While the food was decent,  service was one of the worst I've experienced.  It was slower than a snail pooping!  All the owner (I presumed was behind the cash register) did was managed a really lame \"sorry\".    There was a limit of a 2hr seating -  we certainly did not take advantage of that while the restaurant took full advantage of that 2 hours with their extremely slow service.  Never will we go back there nor recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is a good Korean BBQ restaurant.It doesn't look that fancy but just like the saying,Don't judge a book by its cover.The staff are accommodating.The food are affordable and it taste good."}
{"text":"Very bad service. This lady who served us kept giving us looks/attitude. Like what was mentioned in other posts, our server was very careless and unfriendly. Long wait for services too. However, we noticed that she was very friendly with the other group beside us, who were Korean speaking customers. Not sure if anyone else noticed the same.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"Before my review, I'm going to preface this by saying that I have been to this location several times before this incident (I work across the street). I enjoyed their food but after this terrible service, they turned me off and I will not be returning.  Last Friday night my girlfriend and I came for dinner. They were busy, but it's a restaurant, they're supposed to be busy. Things took a turn for the worse almost immediately. The first person to greet us, and I believe it was the manager, welcomed us and pointed for us to sit in a booth. So we sat down.   Immediately, she forgot to give us menus. This was a just a sign of things to come. So I walked to the front and took two menus from the pile of menus at the front.  A few minutes later I realized they forgot to serve us tea. So we had to ask for tea.  After looking at the menu, we ordered two of the same beef stew. We sat there, getting hungrier by the minute as we waited patiently.   5 minutes went by.  10 minutes, nothing so far.  I realized they forgot to bring us side dishes. So we had to ask for the side dishes, too. The side dishes came but they also brought out our rice at the same time. Normally at Korean restaurants, the rice comes out with the entree.  Another 10 minutes went by (20 minutes total), and wondering what was going on, my girlfriend rang the bell for service.   The waitress comes to our table and I quote, \"what do you need?\" (How rude). We asked her to check on our order and for a refill of the side dishes because we were starving.  She brings out more side dishes and practically throws them down on the table, two at a time. But we eat them anyway.  10 more minutes pass (30 minutes total) and we're still here waiting for our entrees, with cold rice and empty side dish plates. I pushed the bell for service. The rude waitress walks by and looks at our table without saying a word.  I had enough and we start to leave. Half way out the door my girlfriend asked for the manager. She took her sweet time coming to speak to us.  When she finally did, the manager made a BS excuse that their computer sometimes does not work specifically for that table. She urged us to stay and have dinner. But having already wasted enough time experiencing lousy and rude service we chose to leave.   And because of that, I'm not planning to return. There are many better options for Korean food in the area.  TL;DR: - waited 30 minutes for food that never came - had to ask for menus, tea, and side dishes on three separate occasions - rude and passive aggressive waitress who said, and I quote, \"what do you need?\" - incompetent manager who made poor excuses rather than admitting mistakes - turned a loyal customer into an frustrated Yelp reviewer in one night"}
{"text":"I have no issues with telling others to come here (Yonge/Finch location).  With every meal, you get TEN, yes TEN, side dishes with your order.  This includes the following:  - glass noodles - kim chi - bean sprouts - honey potato - fish cake - and a few others  The value is there for the meal.  The portions are very generous for the price that you pay.  I did notice that the service is slipping a bit, but I feel that like in most Asian restaurants, this is somewhat normal (cheap quick food, with low service).  It took awhile to be seated when there were empty but uncleaned tables), they didn't come by when I rang the bell several times, but I think it was because they didn't have enough staff.  Overall, I have been here a number of times and wouldn't have issues with returning."}
{"text":"Food is so so,I ring the bell,i wait when server take my order,waited almost 40 mins still the waitress did not come to my table take my order. Waitress looked at me when I wave and goes back to the kitchen.  Server in the past come right away compare to the 2 new korean waitress ignore customer."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean experience!!! Not often you find a restaurant in Toronto/Mississauga that is comparable to eating in Korea!  Fast friendly service,  delicious panchan(free side dishes) and authentic traditional Korean meals.  There are BBQS at each table to cook your own meat if you want that experience.   Great late night menu (Korean style fried chicken, YUM)- they're open until 2am with full LLBO. Highly recommend this restaurant!  Excellent food."}
{"text":"I came here to try out the pork bone soup, which I enjoyed. Other reviewers have commented that it is too salty, but I did not have a problem with mine, although I did not drink very much of the soup.   There is also a nice selection of appetizers included in the meal. Pretty good for about $8!   The downside about this place is the staff. Our waitress had quite a brusque manner, borderline rude. But I supposed this is sometimes what you have to accept for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"terrible service, waitress really pissed me off !!!!!!!  byebye, Nak Won!!!"}
{"text":"I come here often and have tried a number of their dishes. Almost all of their dishes are better than those in other Korean restaurants around the area. pork bone soup, tofu soondubu soup, beef sullungtang soup, and bibimbap are all soooo good. The best thing is they give you a plethora of side dishes, more variety than any other Korean restaurants I've been to thus far. The only downside is the rude attitude of the waitresses here."}
{"text":"Oh Jesus Christ. Why did I even come here. I came here twice I believe 2 years ago. Food was mediocre, service was pretty average. So the first time I came here, it was okay. Until when it was time to pay for the bill. I paid for the food portion and the waitress was demanding a tip.  2nd time I came here Hoping things will get better. I ordered the bulgogi dish and I couldn't finish everything so i requested a box. I got the box and there were some side dishes left so I was putting my leftovers into the box and the side dishes as well. The waitress was like \"you can't bring side dishes home.\" I asked \"why not. I don't want to waste them.\" When it came to paying the bill, I gave her a $20 and she asked for how much I want the change to be. I said \"exact change please.\" And she said \"no tip? 10% tip please.\" So I left the 10% tip and walked out disgusted. I didn't even get decent service and then they have the nerve to demand for a tip."}
{"text":"This is another place I've been eating at since High School, and it's always clean. With that said, Nak Won is great for some good comfort food. What I like the best about this place is their appetizer salad that they serve you before any dish you order. I'd really like to know the secret to their dressing, in fact I'd probably order a whole dish of their salad if I could because it's soo YUMMY! Mmmmm~~~"}
{"text":"This is a shame.  I like Nak Won in North York a lot, so want to give this branch a try since it is close to work.  But what a big disappointment! This really is not good.  Try pork bone soup today and it's nothing compare to North York location, the soup tastes spicy alright but sour, and not in a good way.  What's more disappointing is the side.  I love side dishes served in North York branch because the portion is generous and taste so delicious.  But the side here tastes very bland except noodle is editable.  I don't think I would ever come back to this branch but I will continue frequent North York location."}
{"text":"This is a very good spot for yummy Korean food.  The price is very reasonable and they give generous amount of side dishes.  Pork bone soup here is one of the best I've had in Toronto.  The side dish is delicious as well.  Service here is quick and efficient, and you can actually ring the bell if u need assistance."}
{"text":"I'm so full right now I could die.  Lunch specials are cheap and tasty.  I went rogue and tried a dish I've never had before: Took Baeki Bulgoki ($7.99).  It's part soup, part rice dish and fully in my belly.  A tad on the too oily side, so I personally wouldn't make it my \"standby dish\" but definitely good for a once in a while treat b/c its very tasty.    Will definitely return here to try other items.  (Will remember to take photos eventually ;p)"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, china-town atmosphere  Always have the Kimchi pork bone soup and as a white guy I gotta say thumbs up!  They provide you with 4-5 types of appetizers, for free, as is standard in most Korean restaurants like this. I'm pretty sure they would give you refills for them too but the portions are so large for the main course you wouldn't be able to finish everything!  Fast service, pretty consistent and from other friends who ate the noodles there , there are other great dishes too!  Huge menu as well"}
{"text":"Of all the pork bone soup places I go to, this has come out as my top choice.  I just want lots of meat ok. This place has the best meat on the bones and good amount of apps. Your dinner doesn't come with a free korean pancake like Oh Geul Boh Gol's though, oh well, -1 star!  Life Lessons: - Ever ordered not-pork bone soup at a korean place withOUT a Korean friend? It silly, don't do it. Find a korean friend. - Eat Pork Bone Soup two nights in a row, and you will dry up and feel like that guy in life of Pi."}
{"text":"Great batch of ban chan to start. They didn't skimp like some other places. One of my favourite dolsot bibambaps. Rice is crispy. Beef is soft. Not an overload of rice amongst other ingredients. Done bowl is sizzling hot and makes the best crispiness in the end. No lineups. Menu is long but good variety of Japanese and Chinese. Though I'd stick to my personal rule of eating Chinese at a Chinese restaurant or from my mom. Table service button worked and attention was quick and fast. Washrooms were big and relatively clean. I'd return!"}
{"text":"Their $10 \"chicken\" Bi Bim Bap is almost a rip-off. Virtually no chicken on it! At first, I thought they made an error. My bad that I didn't look at the reviews before stepping in. There are a ton of good Korean spots in the area, be sure to check them out before jumping into Nak Won."}
{"text":"very very bad unrespectful awful service. I was told by one waitress that we cant get cold dishes refilled because we only ordered one main dish. The fact was that my friend went in and ordered food earlier and I came after her so that waitress didnt know I ordered food. When I asked to get refill she showed a very disrespectful look and refuse to refill. Just because my food was ordered later and didnt come up she thought I didnt order anything"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service.  Having sat there for 30 minutes without being served wasnt the bad part, the bad part was waiting for our food for a good 40 minutes with no water or tea after asking for it several times.  Food was mediocre, hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Came here after karaoke with 7 other friends of mine. The restaurant was small but had a cozy feel to it. The food was good and was quick considering the number of people we had. It was just the service that wasn't as good. The servers didn't make us feel welcomed, more like rushed. The bill process took a long time and when I asked about the tip I was ignored...  Would come here for a quick bite from time to time, but I'd much rather go to a nicer restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay food... But..... Terrible service, severe understaffed. We pressed service bell, no one came, it wasn't until we continuously pressed for like 10 times, a waitress came. After that, our water ran out, no one came. A waitress passed by, we asked for water, she completely ignore us TWICE. Ask for more side dish, they said they ran out, and they are still dishing them out to new customers... Just horrible... Will never come again even though we live 2 mins away."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible. Not that they do not want to serve you, it is just not having enough staff for the task. Why would a business do that to itself?"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews as I tend to be lurker more on Yelp but I am so glad to have legit Korean food near where I live! I am a big fan of the don katsu. The sauce is amazing. My boyfriend gobbled his up! And I would highly recommend the tang sooyuk (sweet/sour pork). It's not overly greasy yet maintains its crisp. Among other things I ate were bossam and cold noodles. All of which were awesome. I plan to come back again :)"}
{"text":"The worst service you will find! Never come here! D???????d???????????????????????????tips???d tips ??????????? ????????????50cent?????? ??????????????????????"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup was alright, although it's quality was worse than I remembered from a couple months ago, and there were less side dishes than before. The service was terrible, we were not offered tea or water and waitresses did not respond to our calls."}
{"text":"It's been more than a year since I've come to this Nak Won location and things have seriously gone down hill.  I came with a group of 4 on a Sunday around noon and the lunch menu that we use to rely on has been changed to only be available on the weekdays! This was only the start of our disappointment as the service we were provided with was not very friendly or timely. We waited a good 25 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering and when my friend asked for a refill on their awesome potatoes side dish, the waitress gave us the cut eye and threw the dish on our table (maybe this lady was having a bad day but she was pretty rude).   The food quality was ok, I ordered the katsu with egg and rice, it was good(cooked well) and the portion serving was pretty generous, it's just the service and the lack of a lunch menu that ruined our experience."}
{"text":"I was with my friends for a nice lunch. I had a really terrible service last time so I was hoping that it would be better this time. The food came in one at a time. I ordered stone bowl bibimbap and it was alright, but kimchi chigae wasn't great, and dumpling soup was definitely below average and it took them 40 minutes to make it! Considering that it wasn't a busy time, there is no excuse that they couldn't serve it faster. I would rate it 1-star, but the quality of the side dishes and the actual bibimbap earned them an extra star. There are so many other options in NY area and so I am not coming back."}
{"text":"I was craving korean food my first night in toronto. We were looking for another korean restaurant and couldnt find it so we stopped by Nak Won instead. Bad choice! We arrived around 10pm and was told the restaurant closes at 11. We ordered kimchi fried rice and soon doo boo. We were told the kimchi fried rice came with pork but it did not. Also, the rice was very mushy and the kimchi tasted horrible. It is very hard to mess up on kimchi fried rice but this place succeeded. The soon doo boo was okay, nothing great. We were very tempted to leave after the first few bites. The service was also terrible. They were too focused on closing up the restaurant and not asking if we needed anything else. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Decent place for affordable, comforting food with fairly quick service. Not a bad place for dinner if you're craving Korean food. They have call bells at the tables so you don't have to struggle to get your waiter's attention. Though we didn't ask for refills of the banchan, we saw other tables asking for them and they got it with no fuss.   I had the dolsot bibimbap and enjoyed it. I added a bit of spice to my taste. My friend had the bulgogi and she really liked it. Perhaps I'll give that a try next time.   Overall, it was good for the price and I'll likely visit again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night. The place was kinda packed during rush hour and they didn't have enough waiter/waitress to serve everyone. I got a beef dol pot bibimbap, it was kinda disappointing cuz they gave very less meat and a lot of veggie to make it look big. And it didn't have too much taste other than the spice sauce.  I REALLY DID NOT LIKE HOW THE WAITRESS HAD HER FINGER INSIDE THE COLD DISH WHILE PUTTING THEM ON MY TABLE, I hope they do fix that!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service... slow and not courteous.... not even going to rate the food because I will NOT come back based on customer service only.  3-4 waitresses for like 20 tables is not gonna cut it..."}
{"text":"I visited this Nak Won location for the first time recently, usually used to the First Markham Place location. The food, was great, the ambiance and decor, amazing, service, not so much. The appetizers were amazing, the japchae and tofu dish were my favourite. I got the Gamjatang which was only 7.99 before tax + tip which was a bonus. This Nak Won location is set up beautifully, very sleek and modern. The service on the other hand; we had to press the button every time we needed something. Only one or two waitresses smiled and one of them even asked for a bigger tip! Of course, I gave it but I was very confused because we had given the proper tip and our total order was very small."}
{"text":"When I first came here to eat I was blown away by how good the food was but...  the more times I decided to come here to eat the more i've become disappointed. They are not consistent at all!  For one thing they are always seemingly packed here and there is a breakdown in communication with the wait staff and the customer as they first enter the place. A lot of waiting and guessing.  It may be because or related to the \"door bell\" that the servers have to respond to everytime a customer needs something. (I would be pissed too if I had to hear that all day) or it may be because of the lay out. (long and narrow)  Ive pretty much ordered the same thing everytime I stop by. Dol sot bimbimbop, Soon tofu or Kimchi jigae.  Each time they get worse in taste. Either no taste at all or really Salty..   So this place is pretty much on my blacklist now.  (Dont get me wrong though.. Im still a fan of the one at First Markham Place.)"}
{"text":"I admit my visit here was a weekend and it was on one of my usual hangover recovery days BUT I was neither hungover or lacking sleep so this review is totally legit.  Walked past this place many times, you will always turn and look because they have most of their dishes on display in the window.  This time we decided to go in after a friend recommended.   So inside, its a standard layout but I did like that it was not too crammed and not too busy and obviously very clean.  The tables have these buzzers which I have not seen anywhere else but it did mean quick service as and when needed. Dont know how they would manage if it was super busy.  I ordered the Took Baeki Bulgoki (yes had to look it up in the website) - its a beef sirloin type stew. Massively flavoursome but just a tad bit too much salt in the broth. I did not even manage to finish it so super value for money.  My two buddies ordered a pork dish and a sizzling spicy chicken dish, they were more than happy so really could not fault this place much more than saying I wish they did cheap draught beer like Train does, then hangover Saturdays/Sundays would be more varied."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a hankering for some Korean BBQ and we decided to try this place out. We should have left immediately when they refused to serve us the table BBQ option -despite there being 2 hr before closing - but we were hungry and ordered a la carte anyway. The food was fine, nothing spectacular, but the thing that stood out was the abysmal customer service. We were constantly pressured to order quick, eat fast, and leave. This is Monday night so I guess the staff wanted to close early but try to exercise some subtlety. Not only did they rush us, they couldn't ever do their jobs adequately. We ordered soups, but they gave us no bowls. We ordered shareable entree's, but they gave us no plates or cutlery. By the end of the night, we left without a tip and they had the gall to demand one from us.   Hopefully no one else will have the misfortune of going here - I certainly won't make the same mistake twice."}
{"text":"Debatable between 3-3.5 stars.  Nak Won is my go-to Korean place when I want solid Korean food. You can't go wrong with the pork bone soup. Actually, I think that's the best pork bone soup I've tried in Toronto. Lots of flavour, no lack of pork or bones, and good amount of thoroughly cooked potato.  One time I found a little bug in the potato side dish, so now I question their cleanliness."}
{"text":"I really like their Pork Bone Soup because it is spicy which is my favorite taste. However, it takes too long to be seated. I been there once at about 6 PM Friday, and I had to wait for 40 minutes before I finally got a seat. The price is fair. This is a perfect environment for 4 people group because their tables are big. I mean it is bigger than other tables that I sat with at different Korean restaurants. And I like their button which I can press and a waiter shows up. Convenient!"}
{"text":"Bad service  Don't even try to take out at this place  They make you wait forever and they just basically treat you like you're invisible  I just ordered a simple japchae and they can take more than 30 minutes to make it  Like seriously?! And this is not the first time that this has happened. Last time my dad and I waited for almost an hour and even though we complained they don't give a fuck. There's so many other great places to get Korean food. Seriously not worth the money and the time"}
{"text":"I went to Nak Won with the help from Yelp. Everyone in the restaurant was Korean so that is a good sign. The food itself was very tasty but there were some downsides. I was a little disappointed because I wanted the table BBQ and I thought that they had it, also the kalbi ribs weren't served with lettuce wraps. We ordered the kalbi ribs and japchae. both were yummy. The ribs were amazing."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was good. The hot stone bibimbap was alright but the portion was a little small. They didn't have all the side dishes that other yelpers have posted pictures of (ie the sweet beans). It's got a lot of competition nearby, but I'd come back if I'm with a large party because it's a little bigger than the other places. If it's just for myself and my husband, we'd probably choose a different place."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up over the many years I've come to this place. The menu is massive and dishes are generally good. Don't really remember any particularly bland tasting ones. Expect shit/sub-par service and cold shoulders.  Note: For sit ins, don't forget that you can ask for side dish refills up to three times. They don't explicitly mention this anywhere but it used to be written on the old menus/pamphlets. They only have lunch specials ($1 off) for certain dishes between 12noon - 3pm. Also ask for drinks right away."}
{"text":"decent hit or miss Korean place...  ordered the cold noodle with beef....literally got ONE SLICE of BEEF  no joke. see pictures lol.  the Dundas / Spadina location is the best out of all locations ."}
{"text":"Located very close to the Finch subway station, Nak Won is always pretty busy, even on a weekday night.   Pros: - Location is very accessible by TCC (on Yonge, just south of Finch Station) - The variety of those little side dishes is astounding! This is primarily what I go to Nak Won for. Generous amounts of glass noodles, kimchi, potato, bean sprout, seaweed salad, and a variety of other cold dishes that are all more tasty than the main course itself. Overall the food is fair, but lacks any distinct or memorable flavour. - Hot Stone Bibimbap: Was nice and hot and the egg was done right: runny. The vegetables were crisp. The beef had very little taste, and needed to douse it in hot sauce - Pork cutlet bibimbap had a generous portion of meat. The cooked egg on top looked very unappetizing with a big mess of green onion thrown in the mix, however  Cons: - Service is admittedly very poor. The pressing-the-button to call for the server did not work out very well if used more than maybe 3 times. We were waiting a very long time to have our order taken, and it had not occurred to us that the ONLY way to contact a server was with that door-bell button. Once she took our order, the waitress did not bring out the water until much later, and did so while carrying about six glasses in her hands and sliding two hastily across the table. Our appetizers came at the same time as the meals, whereas I would have preferred if we had it to nibble on as we wait for the main dishes.. When we asked for more water, the waitress wordlessly plunked a large plastic carafe full of water on our table.  If you're willing to put up with the sub-par service, it's comfort food for a low price, and at a convenient location. Side dishes are the only thing that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Newest Nak Won opened close to my house so I headed over right away. This took over the Kazan location and the interior looked mostly the same as before.  Guess they didn't have to renovate as it was pretty nice inside already.    Seating here is comfortable and atmosphere is more relax compare to the North York location where is small and extremely busy.  They had a lot of staff which was friendly and prompt.  How I miss this place as you get all the banchen!! Around 10 to be exact as I was so disappointed at the Owl in Richmond Hill last time I went there as they gave us only 2-3 banchen.  Food is as good as all the other Nak Won and they even had purple rice as well.    Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 4/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 4/5 Parking: 4/5"}
{"text":"RUDE PEOPLE, SMALL PORTIONS AND BAD SERVICE.  No smile, no friendliness, impolite, and slow, even when the store was not busy.  There were four of us and we got a kimchi jjigae, bibimbap, teriyaki bento and fried pork cutlet.   Bibimbap was bland and so much \"burnt\" hard rice. I mean I know bibimbap is supposed to have a bit of that, but you could not even bite through it and it did not even taste good. Furthermore, the pork cutlet was very dry, and there was barely anything in the bento box. Like literally, some of the box spaces were not even filled with food. Portions were so small. The portion of the jjigae was decent, but it was supposed to have in pork in it. But, it had like three small pieces and the soup was way too salty. Literally there was so little in it, it was practically nothing but soup. So much for \"stew\".   They gave us a lot of side dishes (6 types), but there was barely any quantity on it. When I asked for more of each side dish they questioned me because there was like 1 piece of kimchi left on the plate and said I had to finish it. Then, they only gave like three of them out of six side dishes. I mean they're free right, so I have the right to get more.   Lastly, they had the audacity to ask for tip, as if they were entitled to it. They literally just thrust their hand and said 10%. No other explanation. They would not let us leave unless we gave 10%. I mean half of us tipped but others who did not like the service did not, because tip is based on if you think the service was adequate or if you like it. One person did not get their change because they said it was tip (which was over 10%). Plus, they were so rude and impudence to demand tip. If they wanted tip then they could at least ask nicely. If it is the store policy to have tip, at least write it down on the menu (but it shouldn't be a policy because tip is not something you are entitled to.)   Disappointing food, but way more disappointed in the service.  I have been to this place twice because I thought I might give it another go as it might have changed and be different and better. Obviously it stayed just the same, bad."}
{"text":"I came here once before and today for the second time, but I don't recall getting side dishes. Or maybe there so many of us that they gave us barely any and so I thought we didn't get any. The first time was decent and I was in the area, so I thought why not go again. So, I got a pork bone soup. It was pretty good for its price and was a decent portion.  Service was inadequate though. They were not friendly, impolite and practically rude. Moreover, at the end as we were leaving they told us that tip was not 10%. Everyone tipped though, but according to the worker we had not tipped 10% of the total bill and demanded more money. I mean rude much, you had crappy service and you still have the brazenness to demand us to tip more! Tip is based on my opinion of your job and my decision. We did not even have a large group where tip is mandatory. We only paid her \"mandatory tip\" at the end because they did not let us leave if we did not. Even more, is that they made each of us go up to the til and pay there. They did not even come to us at the table to give us the bill. We all wanted to split it but still! Is it not supposed to be customer first? Are restaurants not supposed to cater to us and SERVE us? Service is part of the experience at a restaurant and it not just about food. You need to either tell people you charge mandatory tip (it should be put on the bill first of all not just straight up demanded, and people should be told in the beginning), ask for it NICELY and politely, and just serve people better.  There are other restaurant that serve good food and have great service for good prices. Decent food, awful service, not coming again. Losing customers in the end costs more than a few dollar tips. Went to the downtown location too, I thought it would be different. Nope."}
{"text":"- this place closes early... like 10:30pm early.....even though the sign says 11... - beyond that.. pretty solid eats. - their PBS (pork bone soup) comes in a variety of spice levels... and they hook you up when it comes to delicious, marrow-oozing, meat off the bone... well, bones. - love how they have the buzzer system to call waitresses for attention."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I certainly would.    I visited this place with two friends at 9:00 PM and from the time we entered the door, the staff clearly wanted us to exit.  I almost felt like I was causing a tremendous inconvenience for them to keep the restaurant open for us, although they close at 11 PM.    We wanted to order the table BBQ but they stated it was too late for that.  Undeterred by this setback, we ordered a variety of dishes - bulgogi, spicy chicken, glass noodles, spareribs and soup.  Food was edible.    Service was consistently below expectations.  Individual plates had to be asked for.  The soup was brought out without a serving spoon.  It was difficult to get the attention of a server, despite only having two other occupied tables in the restaurant.  Although inattentive when we needed things, they seemed overattentive to get us to leave.  They prematurely tried to clear our table but at this point, I simply wanted to leave the restaurant anyways.  I would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the food at Nak Won. Taste is good but I need to drink a lot of water afterwards.   Price is reasonable. Service is ok.   However, the long waiting time is a problem. They need more people."}
{"text":"Could have been the owner... but heard saying in their language \"didn't even order much and staying this long what is this? \" something like this... 90 bucks for 2 hours.. Think of it this way,    a dinner for two for two hours may cost me that much depending on what one may order! and above bill was from a single person. Logically 2 people will spend that much if careful about the budget, wouldn't you agree? Anyways... I was not pleased with this comment and decided not to include any tips at all as a protest. And the lady says about the bill as no tip was inclided \"This is not including tip\". HA! I do apologize to the servers as they were just up to par. But if the owner is thinking this way about the customers...repeat visit they will not get..I am a customer, not the owners cable bill. I will take my business where I am appreciated with an owner who thinks first of the customers. As I am also working in the same field, this is a disgrace.  WHAT A DISGRACE. Sayonara."}
{"text":"Food only so so. Pork bone soup overpowered with black pepper. Potato was luke warm in the soup. Marinated beef on hot plate was not hot.  Lim Ga Ne across the street is way better.  Would not come back as there are much better places close by."}
{"text":"I heart Nak Won! Particularly for lunch or dinner, dine-in (they also do take-out). If ever you are super-duper, keel over and hold-your-stomach hungry for some spicy goodness... GO! As soon as you order, an array of little appetizers will arrive to stave your hunger and get your stomach ready to digest (kimchi is always among the apps).  The only reason I didn't give Nak Won a full 5 stars is because, after having sampled the entire menu, I just think they're sub par when it comes to beef ribs and soon dubu. Their prices reflect this, I suppose. But with so many options for Korean food in the area, you're bound to have a place or two that area especially good for these items (i have my favs, check for future reviews). This place is good for guests who are doing Korean food 101. I've often brought friends and suggested they order some meat katsu, bulgogi, kan poong ki (sweet & spicy chicken) or bi bim bap (veggies, rice, beef, fried egg, & spicy sauce). Those \"safe\" items + the appetizers are a great introduction.  As far as I know, they don't serve dessert."}
{"text":"If you're craving something hot and satisfying, I recommend trying the soups at this place. My roomate and I always come here around the afternoon and the evening time and order either the Soft Tofu Stew or the Pork belly grill lettuce wraps (both of which are reasonably priced). We realize we come here at least once every week haha its kind of an addiction really. The service is ok, sometimes a bit rude but the food comes out pretty quickly which is always a good thing. If you ever want to try some korean food, this place is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Very peppery pork bone soup, can't say if this is my favourite or not but it's pretty good.  It's conveniently located as well right at Yonge and Finch.  Services is inconsistent though, sometimes some are nice, others just plain don't care about you.  I don't mind going here for quick cheap eats though, table cooking is alright but I'd rather stick to the cheaper items like their pork bone soup."}
{"text":"It waa a second time I tried out this place.  It was my friend's birthday and she highly recommended this place.  It has been almost two years since I came here.  I didn't have a good experience last time, so hoping for a better one this time.   The decor was still the same with a darker colour seatings and tables. The waiter and waitress were surprisingly very friendly.  My friend requested for the all you can eat grill option, so I thought I should tag along since it is her birthday.  The side dishes were a little bit of a disappointment as none of them tasted really good.  I think the only better one was athe marinated sweet potatoes.    There were a great selection on the menu and we tried almost every type of meat with the beef short ribs being my favourite.  It was so well marinated with salty, sweet and slight spicy flavours.  The pork belly was so fresh with a slight bounciness to the meat.  The spicy pork belly howevet had too much sugar which can quickly make the grill dirty, so I would recommend to stay off this one.    All in all, the food was pretty good with better service.  My only complaint was that the heating unit was not working, so I had to wear my jacket during almost the entire meal and the food got cold really quickly.  Hope that they would fix this problem next time I come here."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Pretty typical Korean food. I think its a little more salty than what I've had at other places, but not by a big margin. Portion size is quite big.   However, my main problem with this place is the service, or lack thereof. The last time we went, we waited over a half hour to get our food after we placed the order. Also at the start, we didn't even get menus, and it took the waitress at least 10min to come after we rang the bell! So the bell is kind of pointless... the place is clearly understaffed (2 waitresses for a full restaurant on a Saturday lunch). One final point is that the banchan comes out just before the food (I'm not sure if this is typical in Toronto, but I'm used to it coming out shortly after placing an order). That being said, the variety of banchan is pretty good compared to other places I've been in Toronto.   I hate waiting a long time for food, so I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I try to go once a month to get my fix for lunch. I get the bulgogi beef bento box, and it comes with a soup, salad, gyoza, potatoes, and a bunch of delicious apps. I love putting the noodles in my miso soup. The atmosphere is a bit old, but honestly, the great food doesn't even allow me to be bothered by it. The service is pretty basic, but they have bells for whenever you need something. The price is right, so if you're looking for a great deal, I'd check this place out."}
{"text":"This was my first time having the AYCE BBQ option. Pretty good quality meat. My fav was kalbee- juicy and flavourful!   The place was huge, however it wasn't too busy on a Friday night during prime dinner time. Service was ok. Every time we used the call bell, a server showed up at our table right away. However, we had to put in our order 3X for a can of pop and refill for tea and ask for hot sauce 2X before they remembered to bring it to us. At the end, we had to ask for our bill a few times before they brought it over. As you can tell, I wasn't hugely impressed with their service, especially when the restaurant wasn't busy.  I would go back again and give this place another shot. The BBQ was delicious and maybe a different set of staff will make the experience better."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to this restaurant, but this time I ordered to go. Considering I wasn't going to receive service, I didn't tip.  I always order the same combo, seafood tofu soup with roasted fish, but this time the tofu soup has nearly no seafood in it. Horrible. I'm not sure if it's just this time is special, or because I didn't tip and they want to \"revenge.\" Scrolling through the review, this restaurant notoriously craves for tip, so I guess I'm one of the victims.  To be fair, I think the taste is okay, price is about the same as other Korean food, but there are other options with better service.  Nakwon, OUT."}
{"text":"Def a 1 star!!  This is actually my very first comment on yelp. I hate to comment negatively, but unfortunately I just could not stand the terrible service I experienced there. My mom was craving for cold noodles so we decided to go there for dinner.  After we got ready to order, I pressed the bell, waited for 5 mins, no one came. So I rang the bell again, still no one seemed to care about us. I rang the bell for 5-6 times in total and finally the server came, because my mom stood up and waived at the server...... Mom and I were a bit unhappy at that point so I told the server that I tried to call her for 5 times already. She did NOT say sorry or anything. We were starving at that point so I just went on to order the food. The most TERRIFYING part is that after we done ordering, she took the menu away with a big sound, I felt like she would throw the menus on our faces if she could.  The service was just WAY TOOOOO TERRIBLE! and we just told her we are not gonna eat there. Mom and I just shifted to another Korean restaurant that was next door, experienced excellent service and food there!"}
{"text":"work on the same street, so Nak Won sometime are my lunch option and after-work quick fill up before heading home.  when they first opened, it's great, even you order lunch alone, they give you such huge amount of banchan that you almost would feel sorry that you couldn't finish all of them.  and then for a while, I saw that their food safe sign out front had change from Green to Yellow. now it's back to Green again.  but few months ago we tried it, beside the soups, most of the dishes they do are not as good as other Nak Won locations. we ordered Pork bone soup and Tofu & pork soup, it's just okay, and the banchan are smaller and quality has gone downhill. the seafood pancake we ordered doesn't have much seafood in it. I missed the full packed seafood pancake... the banchan, the japchae, was sticky and doesn't have any vegetable mixed in with it.  Tonight I went there again with my co-worker, we both ordered pork bone soup, my soup has 3 pieces of pork bones, and 2 small quarters of potato... I want more potato!!! and of course, the banchan are no good.  the pork bone soup tonight was so salty that I can only have a few spoonful of it.  5/15"}
{"text":"I gave them an extra star only because of all the side dishes they give and I love them all. No nonsense service: if they are busy then you gotta wait, figure out what you want before you call them over or they'll leave, when they are ready they will come over to you, and they will bring you everything you need eventually. Super fast service and food, in and out restaurant. They won't smile at you, and no five star service if you can live with that, but at the same time there's no fake smile, if they are pissed you will know.   They food is pretty decent, I usually have the pork bone soup, the mackerel with tofu soup or the bulgogi in soup. Everything is usually tasty and consistent. We come often for good economical fast Korean food. It gets a bit chaotic when it's too busy. Will definitely come back but maybe not during the busy times."}
{"text":"very nice restaurant ? food quality is the best in this location  my boyfriend and his dad are korean ... they really love it  so do I"}
{"text":"This is the original one of the chain. Now they have 3 opened including this one. Great food, cheap price. It is coward so make sure you get there early."}
{"text":"I wasn't really blown away by the food in the place. It was pretty good, but nothing special. We ordered a combo for two people: Korean bacon cooked on a grill at your table with soy bean soup. I really enjoyed the side dishes, which had a really great variety, but kind of small servings.   Also, the servers didn't crack a smile once, which I found kind of off putting. They sort of wordlessly put food down and picked up plates. Not what I've come to expect from most Korean places I've been to.   The place was clean with comfortable booths, so other than the service it had a nice ambiance to it.  I don't think I'll be back here again, there's too many other places to check out in the area."}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes just to get sides. Me and my gf finally left after ordering our food and completely forgot about us."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 13 with reservations.  I read most of the reviews prior to coming here, so I was expecting \"terrible service\" among other things.  This place is quite large, given the store-front. There's like 30 tables. It also seems under-staffed; three waitresses. You could hear the service bell ringing constantly throughout the meal, which wasn't a big deal. There was definitely waiting involved here and there. Sometimes we had to ring the bell several times (at 1-2 minute intervals before a waitress came)  A spoon and disposable chopsticks are provided. Warm tea is provided.  On the menu, there are lots of items to choose from.  They offered 7 side-dishes, for each group of 4. Potatoes, fish cake, glass noodles, bean sprouts, kimchi, potato strips or something, seaweed salad or something. Quantity was there. We did one re-fill, so not sure if we could have gotten more.  I went with the pork bone soup (without any additions). It was a decent size bowl. Soup was flavorful and spicy, though it was pretty much just a bunch of pork bones (the ones with more bone than meat however), along with a few potatoes and rice cakes. Which is fine I mean, that's what I ordered right?  Overall, didn't have any issues with it. Price wasn't too bad either compared to other korean places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I think I've eaten here a total of four times. The service at Nak Won was probably the best I've ever had, although they had a lack of staff for quite a large amount of customers throughout the restaurant, but they also gave us free drinks on the house so that's a plus. The food was extremely good and came out quickly as well. Overall, the entire experience was great."}
{"text":"As a resident of the Yonge-Finch area, I come and dine here pretty often. I've visited their Markham and Chinatown (Spadina) locations but this is got to be the best.  The dishes are amazing. I especially like their pork bone soup and broiled mackerel! Also the complementary appetizers that are typical of these type of restaurants... my mum is always asking if we can go eat here because she craves them. I love the potatoes, and always hope that people would be modest in offering me the last piece :P  The service is alright. There's always that button for you to press but sometimes the waitresses can completely disregard the little ringing noise so you'll have to flag them down. The pricing is pretty decent too, so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Came here by myself on a weekday afternoon and there was still plenty of seating. Got kimchi chigae from their lunch menu and it was delicious and cheap. Service was great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is near my work so I often come here for lunch and sometimes even dinner with my coworkers, friends, or my wife.   Overall I think this place serves great food from its side dishes such as the honey glazed potatoes to the kimchi. Even staple dishes like the pork bone soup .,  bulgogi bento boxes, and bibambap rice bowls are recommended items on their menu.   They have a lunch menu for around $10. Most of their items are between $8-15. With the side dishes, you should be quite full with ordering one item.  The bento boxes include salad and dumplings. However, when I ordered my bento box with bulgogi, they forgot to give me soup in one of the sections of the bento and replaced it with a dumpling!   They never have the Korean beer, even though it's on the menu.   What isn't the greatest it's a service. Once you get seated it takes a long time to get water or even the menus. When you come here, expect to wait a lot. Even the service buttons that's located at each table does not work all the time, which means you have to press the service button at least twice to get someone to help you. They sometimes forget to bring you what you asked so you have to remind them again. We had a group of six one time and we ask for 6 glasses of water and they only came with five. We never got the 6th glass.   In terms of food, one of my friends ordered a chicken katsu which did not come with the sauce, and we had to tell them to take it back and add the sauce back. For the side dishes the potatoes with honey is always a hit, but with a party of 6 they only gave us 4 potatoes and expected us to share. Not sure how that makes any sense.   The food itself is great, very flavorful and spicy just like I expect it to be. It is full of authentic decor in the restaurant,  wooden booths and the flat Korean chopsticks . My favorite is by far the pork bone soup, it spicy and goes really well with the rice that they give you and the side dishes of bean sprouts, fish curd, kimchi, and seaweed. I will probably keep coming back because it's close by but you just have to watch out for the service that you get."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday afternoon intending on trying out their lunch specials and eating a bunch of side dishes. They were decently priced, but not as cheap as I had hoped for. I had their Donkatsu Bento Box and my friend ordered their Chicken Teriyaki bento box. The bento boxes were relatively empty-looking and were just enough for a lunch meal.   The Donkatsu had a surprisingly yummy sauce but the chicken itself seem quite dry. The fried dumpling and salad weren't too complicated and did its job - slightly seasoned and was kind of filling.   I have to admit, their dinner service is a lot more lively and the food seems better prepared.  Overall, im still a fan of their side dishes (especially the glass noodles) and would return on a dinner occasion."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was great! We enjoyed a flavourful beef hot pot lunch and got excellent value for what we paid. The complementary appetizers were delicious (bean sprouts, kim chi, potatoes, and seaweed) and the staff had no problem giving us more because we gulped them down quickly. We were also given complementary soda - perfect for a hot day! While the service was somewhat slow, the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food we got compensated for that. We will definitely come back if we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food here is great. Authentic Korean dishes. I really enjoy appetizers, and I recently found out that you can ask them for refills free of charge. They will gladly give you more. It's usually busy, but worth the wait. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My meal looks like something I threw together in a rush at home. The meal wasn't even hot and the service is horrible. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"In short, decent food but terrible horrible service.  I've been here for a couple of time. Honestly, I like the food here and normally I'm able to deal with bad services, but this time it was just so bad. They forgot our water and we had to call them several times until they actually get what we asked for. When we talked they don't even look at us and when they served they just slammed the stuff on the table and walked away.   Then we asked for the bill. The total came to be about $35, we gave them $40 and said \"can we have the change.\" We waited like 10min and they never came with the change so we asked again. This time a lady came and looked at us with the change. We took $2 off and the lady was like \"hey you must give 10% tips. 10% 10%\" but we told her the service was bad and we don't wanna give 10% and so the lady was saying something in korean we couldn't understand.   So yeah overall, it was a pretty bad experience.   Good restaurants don't ask for tips. Tips are to be given as a courtesy as good service deserve it and not an obligation. Don't think we'll be returning here again."}
{"text":"*Ding Dong*     *Ding Dong*   *Ding Dong*   Crap is some kind of waitress ever going to come by?!?!  Had the Gamjantang Style dinner (aka Pork Bone Soup aka PBS) and holy salt lick batman!  Hate to say it, but my fav is still the version and Galleria Market on York Mills west of Don Mills.  Anyways, I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"The gam ja tang sends me nose to the heavens wow.....just wow their food was sooooooooooooo juicy and they provided so much flavourful meat soaked in the jucies of their special recepie.....I highly recommended This they even provide so many condiments which are so fresh that they are practically growing from the bowls wow.....and all this for 7 dollars daymn just stop it ayuh i can't handle these amazing prices!!"}
{"text":"I come here somewhat regularly because I love their gamjatang (pork bone soup). The flavour of the soup is delicious and the meat just falls off the bone. The restaurant is clean and service is efficient. Although not very personable, they get our food out in ample time & they give us more side dishes by request for no charge. I recommend the pork bone soup, they give generous portions and it has spice options. My favourite thing to order from them and for $6.99, the price cannot be beat. I recommend this place for their food and not their service (waiters are fast, but not very friendly nor patient - I don't know if they are burnt out or what, but they never look very happy)...I, for one, don't really mind (my focus is on the food) but keep in mind if service is important to you."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food.  I love the food at this resturant,  this is one of the major reason why I moved from downtown to North York!  I've been here at least 30+ times in the past 3 years.  I think they have 3 locations now? But the food is the best at the finch and yonge location.     Personally, I think the side dishes are the best amongst all the Korean restaurants at yonge and finch area.    They are always under staff, so the staff aren't necessary the friendliest.  Also, please don't go on a date after eating here, cause your hair and clothing will smell like BBQ!!!! I have to run home and shower everytime after I go there.  :)"}
{"text":"Staff are slow and always made mistakes. I was a frequent customer but now the service turned me away. The food is good though."}
{"text":"What does it take to get a hot tea refill...or just a glass of water for that matter? Apparently, at Nak Won, you have to tell three different waitresses five different times and wait ~20 minutes on top of all that for any sort of liquid sustenance to appear. I was literally about to get up and grab a pitcher of water from the cooler myself. I don't think anyone can expect great service at a Korean BBQ dive on a Saturday night...but the service I experienced most recently was sub-par by any standard.   But, what does keep me coming back to Nak Won is its pretty decent and moderately-priced grub. The seafood pancake (~$13) is a great hot appetizer and can be shared among a group of 4 easily. Their kalbi is pretty standard -- nothing mind-blowing but tasty just the same. But I do think their soups are generally very good -- I especially like the gamjatang (~$7) that includes super tender pork bone, potatoes, and rice cake. The cold appetizers/small plates they provide for free aren't too shabby either, I loved the variety -- everything from pickled veggies to bean sprouts and glazed potatoes.   Another note on service, the food *does* come out rather quickly, as does the check (of course). Everything else, like water or even napkins, takes about a year and a half to obtain from the waitresses. The call buttons on the table don't work, neither does yelling \"chogiyo\" across the room, so you really just have to sit there and hope one of the waitresses sees you frantically waving your hand. Decent food, okay prices, but not-so-great service. I'll probably consider other Korean restaurants before visiting Nak Won again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while. But recently that past two times i was very unimpressed.  They literally told me that hot pot took too long to eat and they still had almost an hour to close.  They indirectly kicked us out.   Worst part is when we were leaving they seemed happy. Sigh."}
{"text":"They really need a better ventilation system.Every time I have a meal here, I leave smelling like a mixture of all sorts of Korean food.I really don't appreciate that.  The pork bone soup is always salty and sometimes repulsive to eat.Go across the street to Lim Ga Ne if you want to try something better.Or even the Owl which is down the street on Yonge.  The other dishes are mediocre and sometimes I am not sure why I find myself  back here.It may be the fact that it's so close to the subway station.  The service is REALLY slow if the place is packed.Last time I was here,I had to consistently ask for a glass of water, which I received halfway through the meal.The excessive use of salt really gets you.  The side dishes are alright. Good luck trying to get refills when the place is busy. Oh and don't bother pressing the button to catch the attention of a server.They ignore it most of the time.  If you came with a group and want separate bills,walk up to the cashier and they will charge you separately for your meal."}
{"text":"First thing you will notice coming here is the traditional Korean wooden furniture and the Korean ambient in general. Since I'm not an expert in Korean cuisine I asked the waitress to recommend me a chicken dish. I was surprised that appetizers were complimentary and plenty. My order came in a metal dish all hot, spicy, fresh, and tasty! Waitresses here are friendly but are not good at multitasking. Booths are spacey but the isle is narrow. Washrooms are downstairs. I surely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try traditional Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Every time we eat at this restaurant likes been like pulling teeth. Straight off the bat, I will say I AM NOT A FAN (not anymore) OF THE PLACE! It has been our go to place every now and again...but after the last time, my dining companions and I will be boycotting this place. The sad thing is the food at this place is pretty decent. It is the service that is the definition of nightmare...I'm not even talking about glacial slow service, I'm talking about rude servers that not will bluntly ignore you or yell at you. I don't think there's server a time that we've received service the first 2 times requesting it. Last time there, it was so bad that we didn't get the water, bowls, spoons and simple utensils requested. We had 5 people and ordered 4 dishes to share, but apparent by their standard, that was not good enough for them. The lady serving us completely ignored most of our request...come time for tipping, stopped us demanding 10% minimum (to which we refused). Service tends to forget that tips are earn and not an entitlement. Most of us, had worked in the service industry once or twice, and can understand the downside of the industry...but the service we received was absolutely unacceptable. I will never return to them with my business or those of my friends. On the other hand, their food was good. There are some hit or miss but their Kamja tang was memorable. I would skip the fish stew as it was a chewy mess. The side dishes are good but beware how stingy they are with refills. I would pass because it is very generic and standard."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and we were greeted and seated promptly.  I'm not a big fan of Korean food but I do like pork bone soup.  We ordered 2 pork bone soups, spicy.  They came out sizzling hot and were still bubbling after 2 minutes.  The soup base had a lovely flavour and tastes much better than the FMP Nak Won. However, we asked for spicy and it wasn't that spicy.  Nice that they serve purple rice here too.   The sides were not so good.  Put it this way, we never finished them or asked for a refill.    We were sat at the window booth and they are really uncomfortable wood seats.  Next time I come, I'll ask to be seated at the regular tables.  Service was ok.  Washrooms were clean but extremely dark.   I would return here again, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Actually this restaurant is interesting in a sense that last time we came here to celebrate my fiancee's brother birthday and ordered seafood pancake, porkbone soup. It was extremely mediocre and I thought I don't think I will come back.  On sat, my fiancées co-worker suggested all you can eat. The bulgogi beef was thinly sliced and tasted good. The shrimp and calamari were marinated nicely. Service was pretty good, everytime we rang the bell, they came very fast. I think I will be back for more Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"0/5 for service The staff insisted to seat our party of 13 at their table of 10 in their 70% empty anf spacious restaurant.  They also adamently denied to give us extra seatings at an adjacent empty table.  Here is the story:  We had a party of 13 in total with 6 adults and 7 kids.  Yet, even though we explained this twice to the very tanned tall waitress that the table of 10 she showed us would not be enough for our 13 guests, she still insisted not to give us extra seatings.  Now there was an empty bench table directly next to the table of 10 that she had showed us.  So, we suggested to her that maybe we could take that table also since 10 seats certainly would not be enough for us.  She looked at us and said no, and insisted that 10 seats would be fine.  Then, the shorter and slightly chubbier waitress with glasses came and she also insisted that we could not take the empty spot.  Their reasonings were 1) it gets busy on sunday 2) there were two folded up wheelchairs leaning against the side of that table from another customer.  Now it was already 12:30, and yet the restaurant was only 30% filled at best.  Those folded up parked wheelchairs could certainly be asked to be moved elsewhere.  But seeing how tactless these waitresses were with their customer service skills so far, we did the job for them by kindly asking the other customer to place the wheelchairs elsewhere.  The other customer had no problem witb our request. This restsaurant is very roomy so there were lots of space for those wheelchairs.    So, we took up the bench table anyway and moved the tables slightly closer to the bench table but still with a slight opening between them.  That same second waitress with glasses returned angrily insisting that we cannot take up the bench space.  We could only respond with what we felt like they were trying to accomplish.  \"If you don't want us to eat here, we can leave and take our business elsewhere! \" \"Your restaurant is so empty and you are telling me that you cannot seat our party of 13?\"  She had nothing better to say but to say that we could not move the tables together because she had to serve the food.  \"Lady, there is already a small opening between the tables!\"  Obviously, we have the problem solving and anticipation skills that this group of waitresses has yet to learn.    Now, here I was, taking a general photo of this mostly empty restaurant.  That same second waitress came and bursted out saying that it was against the law to photograph in the restaurant.  Ha!  Take notes Yelpers!   Environment 1/5 The best part about this restaurant is that it is very roomy and not a lot customers.  You can guarantee a spot for sure, unless of course they don't offer seats for you!  So be prepared to just squeeze and maybe even share a chair while all around are emty tables and chairs!  In addition, we happened to kill a small white spider on the table, near my two year old's eating area.  Now I suppose these house pests are common, but this certainly added additional taste to our experience here.  Then, a fly dropped into a cup of water.  They say these things happen in threes?    Oh, and our friend at our table told us that the washroom was super dark with only a small lighting on top of the handwash sink.  Food 1/5 Appetizer dishes came at the same time as our main dishes.  They didn't offer glass noodles until after we asked.  Overall Their current 2ish star rating is not without reasonings.  There are plenty other korean restaurants in the gta.  Take your business elsewhere.  We certainly will not come back by choice.  Or maybe there might not even be a restaurant to come back to."}
{"text":"Came here today with my husband for lunch around 1pm. The place was probably only 1/4 full when we came in but filled up quickly.  Since I'm not Korean and can't read the Korean on the menu nor fairly familiar with Korean food in general, we took awhile settling on something, because the menu quite big and everything kind of sounds the same, pretty generic, from the English description; just seems like the same bunch of ingredients repeating itself, but I know that must be the same case for non-Chinese looking at Chinese restaurant menu :) Of course some items have pictures in the menu and then you can always go back outside of the store and examine the plastic versions of their meal offerings in the window.  I finally settled on #50: BBQ spicy chicken on hot plate with rice and my husband, #36, the dolsot bibimbap with beef.  Food got to our table quickly and the portions was generous. His bowl was large and I had enough chicken portion to bring home for another meal. I find his bibimbap a bit bland, but that's probably because I generally like to eat rice with something saucey. My dish used dark chicken leg meat and the pieces were plump and tender. The spicy level was just right IMO, I was afraid it would be killer spicy and I wouldn't finish the dish but it was all good. A bit of a sweetness to the spice sauce. In comparison to the side kimchi, I find the kimchi more hot without that sweetness. I like to love kimchi but I'm just not a fan as I'm not really into pickled stuff in general. Although I do like kimchi flavored instant noodle :)  Anyhow, the rest of the side dishes were also good, I do love them all except for kimchi and the pickled turnips. The glass noodles portion was pretty generous for a tiny dish, and we got 2 rounds of these appetizers before calling the bill.  One thing I must comment about the spicy chicken is that it didn't sizzle when it was served. Even the stone pot bibimbap my husband ordered sizzled a bit when it was served. I had seen sizzling hot plates in other Korean places so I think that was suppose to happen when you order something on a hot plate, and people from nearby tables would admire your meal as it gets presented to you sizzling :) None of that happened today.  Generally service was pretty quick considering how busy they got and that there was only 2 people serving and cleaning up simultaneously.  Another I think they can improve on is by turning up the fan or AC a bit, especially on a warm day. The place a bit too warm even when we first walked in.  Overall, I enjoyed eating here today and would come back again to try something. So 4 stars."}
{"text":"Been here a few times,  the all you can eat bbq meat is pretty good minus the high price! This is coming from someone who lived in Korea for 2 years.   The service is friendly and attentive with the Korean style call button.   They give you the sides which is always  a win.   The gamjatang is hit-or-miss, some days the broth is good some days it's flavorless. The meat can also be tough or tender as well.   The bibimbap is ok, I've tried the regular and hot stone, nothing special or bad about it. It reminds me to not order it at this place again.   The bulgogi is good but usually good at most Korean restaurants.   There are definitely better Korean places to eat at. I go here for the convenience.   The handful of times I've been here.. I'd give them more of a 2.5 rating."}
{"text":"It has been a year or two since my last visit to Nak Won. We had always went to the Markham location but it is a huge hassle to get to. I remember liking Nak Won, mainly for its large variety of side dishes. Plus they were refillable :) When I found out they had a location at Finch and Yonge, I was excited but I left a bit disappointed.   First of all, we went on a Saturday at around 7:30 and I expected there to be a line up. There was only one party in front of us and we quickly got a seat. I really like the décor of the restaurant, it had a homey, cozy feel to it with all the wooden furniture. There were rows of booths, which we liked because it felt more private.   I ordered #36 Dolsot Bibimbap because I read good reviews on it. Bimimbap is vegetables/meat on top of rice and you basically mix the ingredients together before eating. And the result is a yummy and balanced spoonful for your mouth. The presentation was very nice, everything was organized with the fried egg on top. I can't handle spicy so I opted to not to add in the spicy sauce. The Bibmibap tasted a bit bland and was not flavourful as I hoped it to be. I then tried to add the spicy sauce into a small spoonful and unfortunately it did not help. The spicy sauce is actually not that spicy and had an odd taste so I didn't add any more. It was still decent but bland. My friends ordered beef in a stone bowl, some fried fish and pork bone soup. They all seemed to like it. I tried the beef and it had a sweet taste to it which is I found quite pleasant.    I came to the restaurant fully expecting poor service and that is what I got. The servers did not smile, say 'you're welcome' or even acknowledged us when we said thank you.   I have to say that the side dishes were my favourite part of the meal. We loved the noodles, seaweed and sweet potatoes that we kept asking for more. I would come back just for the many yummy side dishes."}
{"text":"Not a bad place when craving Korean food as it is right on Yonge street in R Hill. Their menu looks slightly different than the other Nakwons in the GTA. They also serve purple rice.  Six side dishes, consistent with their other locations, sometimes you do get up to nine.  Service is ok as well, no complaints, their server call button is always useful.  Minus marks for the size of the bulgogi, other restaurants usually have this for $17, but it is $21 before tax/tip here and comes with such a small amount.  Their soondubu tasted good, although it either didnt come with an egg or it was just scrambled very well in the soup before being served to you."}
{"text":"The food is good. We order the pork bone hotpot, it is really big, lots of food for the price. The server is polite.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"What happens when a few yelpers get together to eat some pork bone soup? A scene fit for the discovery channel, that's what. There were bones flying everywhere, broth was splashing, there was so much mayhem I could barely hold on to my utensils (dropping my spoon had nothing to do with my clumsiness).   I Came to Nak Won last night for a UYE and my fellow yelpers and I certainly did not aid the coming pork shortage. Most of us were here for the gamjatang (pork bone soup) and that is what the majority of our table ordered. At Nak Won you can order a single bowl ($7) or if you are with a friend you can get a pork bone soup hot pot that will be served on heater to keep it bubbling, this option is slightly more expensive at $20. I opted for a single bowl which led to mocking by Jen K as to how much bigger her hotpot was compared to my single bowl (but I say it's not the size of the bowl that matters but rather the taste of the soup!).   The soup itself was pretty good; the broth was a bit too salty but did have a spicy kick that led to some sweaty yelpers. The portion of pork was big with about 3-4 mammoth sized bones full of meat. The meat itself was not fall off the bone tender but still had a nice flavour. This particular gamjatang comes with rice sticks which are something I am not used to, the rice sticks did add an interesting glutinous texture but didn't add much in the way of flavour. Unlike other pork bone soups I've had this one did not have any seeds in it (not sure what those seeds are but they sure taste good) nor did it have any green vegetables, I enjoy a little greenery in my soup and this was sorely missed. The banchan (side dishes) we were served were very good, the best of them was definitely the glass noodles which had a great flavour and texture, the kimchi was also good.   The restaurant itself has a great layout including some private booths on one side and open tables on the other. The service was not great, you are given a bell to ring when you need service but you will need to ring it at least 2-3 times to get a waitress. Overall I enjoyed my experience at Nak Won, not the best gamjatang I've had but it was definitely serviceable. I will be back, but next time I will be ordering the giant seafood pancake, that thing looked amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the newest location for Nak Won; I visited here with a friend to satisfy my craving for some gamjatang (Pork bone soup).   This location is much nicer and more spacious than the location at Yonge & Finch. The décor is modern and clean. The restaurant is quite open with booth seating along the walls and regular tables in the middle, there are also some more private booths towards the back. We were here on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was about half full and we were seating very quickly. The menu offers an extensive selection of Korean dishes along with a few Japanese and Chinese dishes.   For my dinner I ordered the gamjatang (Pork bone soup) but sadly I was disappointed by the bowl that was placed in front of me. My disappointment stemmed from the fact that the pieces of pork in my soup were quite small and not as meaty as I am used to. The meat in my soup was more fatty than usual, I generally struggle to finish a bowl of PBS but I finished this one no problem and had room to spare. Aside from the small portion the broth was pretty good; it had a nice kick to it and was garnished with plenty of sesame seeds which are always a welcome addition. A bonus was that this location serves purple rice which added a different flavour than I am used to; it was a nice deviation from the norm.  My friend and I also shared a kalbi (Beef short ribs) appetizer; again the portion was miniscule and came with maybe 5 pieces of beef. The ribs were not very tender; I would recommend you skip these as the $8 price tag is not justified for such a small portion. My friend ordered the beef bibimbap which I tried and it was pretty good. The best part of our meal was the banchan (complimentary side dishes) our table was loaded up with about 10 of these side dishes, my favourite included the fish cake, seaweed with spicy sauce (the spicy sauce was AMAZING), the glass noodles and of course the kimchi but overall the entire selection of banchan was well done.  The service on this night was a little bit slow; each table is equipped with a bell to summon the waiters however on a couple of occasions our bell was not answered. Other than that the waitress actually spoke English and was very courteous. Overall if I had to go to Nak Won this would be my branch of choice but I don't think I will be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"Food: I'll be honest with you, I judge Korean restaurants based on their side dishes. Nakwon offers a variety of sides with a free refill (sweet!) I usually order the pork bone soup which I find consistently good. The portions are one of the most generous I've seen at a Korean restaurant (tasty broth and plenty of meat). They also serve purple rice with is definitely a bonus.   Service: There is usually only one waitress when I visit so I don't expect much, however, I don't usually expect much from a Korean restaurant anyways. I haven't received any negative attitude from the waitress but from the other reviews, it seems like other people have...and I am not at all surprised by that. During my visit today, there were 2 servers - both very friendly, quick and attentive.    Final thoughts: I prefer the Nakwon at Yonge and Finch and First Markham Place, however, this is a pretty good pick for downtown. Prices are fair, portions are generous and location is easy to access."}
{"text":"I ate here and was very disappointed by the level of service and quality of food.  * Service *  Being Asian, I'm used to bad service but this Korean place took the icing on the cake for being the most inattentive servers.  I went during lunch (12-1 pm) and was craving bibimbap and thought you could do no wrong with a new place ordering a simple rice and toppings dish.    The first sign of warning that the place is bad is when no one is there especially during lunch time on a weekday.  I should have took notice but I was hungry and ignored this sign.  * Food *  Side-dishes:  SLIMY and WARM.  The glass noodles were not only extra slimy but had an odd \"sand-like\" texture.  I love this side dish so upon tasting it the first time, I did not touch it again.  All of the other side-dishes had an off-taste and were warm (not refrigerated).    Bibimbap: SLIMY and little meat.  I know there's not a lot of meat in this rice dish but giving only 2-3 super thinly-sliced meat of fat was very disappointing.  The egg sunny-side up was at least cooked but was just under to my taste (the white-egg part near the yolk was still present and 'slimy').  I never knew how bad bibimbap could be until you tasted slimy vegetables from the cucumber.  I'm not sure if it is because the cook (doubtful a chef would work there) did not wash and dry the vegetables properly, but it just tasted slimy.  Traditionally bibimbap is also supposed to be served in a stone bowl which I love, they served it in a typical plastic noodle bowl. =/  * Over view *  I will never be visiting this place and to their other locations (I believe I ate once at at FMP - First Markham Place, and never will again).  If I'm ever craving a good bibimbap, I'll take TTC to eat either at Kimichi House (at Dundas Station) or multiple places at Christie Station.  I'm just thankful I didn't get food poisoned by this place.  Then again, I didn't even eat anything so what's there to consume but slimy and luke-warm food?"}
{"text":"A old woman who is with short hair took mistake of my order and had bad service! I will not come next time"}
{"text":"Rude waiters, gross food. 'Nuff said. Don't waste your time at this crap-shack."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst korean food I've had in Toronto. Right off the bat from the banchan to the final bite of the main. Atrocious by Toronto standards. This restaurant shouldn't even exist in the remotest of villages."}
{"text":"I got the chicken katsu for lunch. It comes with a whole selection of korean acoutrements to start. The only edible one was the noodles, the kim chi was mediocre at best. The chicken itself was ok but the sauce was wayyyy to sweet. Like pure sugar. Katsu sauce is supposed to be curry! I won't be returning. Steer clear!"}
{"text":"I miss the kazen that used to be here, the tappanyaki was really good and unique. Only to see another nak won appear. But I'm glad it's nak won, cause I like this location more over the yonge/finch and FMP location. There is lots of parking here and there isn't a wait line cause the place is large enough. the ventilation is still not the greatest but better than a lot of other Korean restaurants where i come out smelling like KBBQ.  The food: We ordered the usual things we usually order, pork bone soup, ginseng chicken, short rib in special sauce, short rib in egg drop soup. The dishes were good portions, they come with this purple rice. The prices, seemed higher than the other locations (even the T&T in the same plaza has higher prices) however I haven't been to nak won in over a year so I'm not sure if prices changed or if I remember incorrectly.  They just give 1 salad to share for 4 people instead of 1 salad each, and they didn't have the chapchae noodles or the potato side dishes I liked most. However the side dashes were still really good.  The service is quick as always."}
{"text":"Walking into this location I felt the decor was much more welcoming and suitable than its sister location at First Markham Place.  It didn't have that OPEN emptiness and pretentious feel.  The SERVICE was just as good as their sister location, which isn't really a COMPLIMENT unfortunately and if it was some impatient unsatisfiable customer they would definitely be in a contest with the wait staff to see WHO can piss who off more.  Tip #1 - The service bell can be HEARD by everyone in the restaurant except for the staff working here.  Simply wave to a wait staff and ask but DO NOT expect a response or smile however your request will be satisfied.  The Pork Bone Soup came out FAST and the portion size I'm quite happy about.  The MEAT was falling off the bone however in comparison to the soup of other places it lacked the additional seasoning but was still flavourful and spicy.  The Seafood Pancake was the last to come out and like the same item from other restos, it is just as DELICIOUS as ever and I will always order this wherever I go.  The Dolsot Bibimbap I'm just going to say it was nice.  I'm not much of a RICE person so I cannot comment on it extensively.  I have nothing bad to say about it at the same time its the same thing I've had anywhere else.  The Big Beef Rib(Kalbi) dish #46 (approx. $19) was tender and tasty however it was a bit out of the norm of my expectations for the same item.  This one was on a Hot Plate with 2 Rib Bones mostly meat removed and with Meat Chunks scattered on top.    I love seeing this dish at other restaurants with BIG pieces of meat ATTACHED to the RIB bone itself.  It also has a bit of a Soya Onion Sauce/Slurry.  I think their sister location does it this method that is more common.  2 different methods but I love them all the same without bias.  I have to say it was a BUSY place for a Tuesday night and we even saw guest waiting at the doorway which is nothing like their First Markham Place location could ever imagine.  TIP #2 - They provide each guest with a glass of watered-down Tea which you'll drink often to clear your tastebuds from one dish to another however if you remember the service, you should ask for a TEA POT of Tea so you can serve yourselves rather than wait to get their attention and for them to take your cup inside to refill.  Would I return? I probably would now that I have the KNOWLEDGE and ARSENAL to make my own experience more enjoyable.  Sometimes I just like to TORTURE myself but at the same time good service can be just as scary."}
{"text":"New Nak Won location in Mississauga. Good food and friendly staffs. I like sitting in the cozy little booths. Personally, I recommend trying the Bulgogi or any of their stews. Been here a few times already and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"So I had a hankering for some Korean food and didn't want to drive all the way down to North York and so decided to go to Nak Won in Richmond Hill.  We arrived and there was no wait as it is quite a big space.  We were asked if we wanted to bbq or just a regular table.  As we had two young kids we decided to just do the regular table.  The menu is quite extensive offering traditional fare, Korean bbq and Cinese Korean cuisine.  We decided to order the soon dubu chigae, dolsot bibimbap, and the bulgogi dinner.  We were given 6 side dishes but in all honesty of the 6 side dishes only a few were good enough to eat.  While it's always nice to get more it's only good if you can eat it.  The kimchi was terrible and tasted bad.  The potatoes and fish cakes were pretty much the only side dishes that weren't a disaster.  The entrees arrived quite quickly.  The tofu hot pot was pretty good in terms of flavours and textures, but slightly on the bland side would have tasted much better with a little more kick to it.  All the ingredients were fresh so overall 3.5.  The dolsot bibimbap is pretty hard to mess up and tasted just as good as anywhere else so would give it a 4.  The bulgogi dinner was good but a bit on the fatty and chewy side.  It was marinated okay so overall 3.5.  Overall, it was worth it to not have to drive to north York, but if I could would have given an overall of 3.5.  Definitely worth trying if you live in York region."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom on Easter Sunday as we were craving Korean Food.  We got the Tempura plate to start, which was very tasty, it was battered instead of the usual panko crumbs. My mom got the bibambop which was very plain and flavourless (did not come with any sauce)  I got the spicy rice sticks, which were also very plain in my opinion and not well seasoned, you can get spicy rice sticks that are much more flavourfull at H Mart and way cheaper.  Overall, the service was good and very attentive, and theres a little button you can press if you would like your servers attention, and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is yummy. I came here late so it wasn't busy at all. I like that they have jajangmyun which not all Korean places have. It's very yummy and a good portion for the price also. Will definitely come back and recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Wish I read the reviews of this place before we went... The service is really just has bad as everyone says. We came on a Sunday night as a group of 7. No ayce for us as $30 each seemed a little pricey.  I got the rice cakes and the pork bone soup with my boyfriend. Food wise, it was okay. The side dishes came out fast and they were nice enough to give us two sets since we were a big table. Some of the dishes looked a little dry like they have been sitting out a while. Our food came out shortly after. They are a bit on the saltier and spicer side but overall it was decent. Some of my friends had asked for mild, but their food come out same as the regulars.   When it came time to pay, she bought us the check right away before we could ask her for separate bills. After I asked, the server walked away before I was done talking and she kept sighing and rolled her eyes at us! I wanted to tell her that the two couples that ordered together were going to pay together but didn't get the chance to with her whining. When we paid the two bills together, she rolled her eyes at us again! She was so disorganized with the receipts, just throwing the merchant copies everywhere. When she thought she was missing one, she rudely snatched my copy out of my boyfriend's hands.   Needless to say, I probably won't be back. There are tons other Korean restaurants close by that are much better!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. We came in and ordered the pork kimchi chigae and gamjatang. DO NOT order the chigae. Comes with 2 small pitiful pieces of pork belly. Asked the server about it, they didn't understand and couldn't add anymore. Food is not good enough to return and service is mad slow. There are other options in yonge finch area."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for Korean food; definitely one of my favorite's in the area. The wait times on Friday and weekend nights can be quite long, don't expect to get immediate seating if you come during dinner time. Even when you are seated, don't expect to be served until you wave them over or if they are trying to kick people out to get more people in-line seated. (Look for an electronic bell on the side of your table for your convenience!)   The food is pretty good (but I've had some Korean friends say otherwise) and the prices are excellent. It's definitely not high quality Korean cuisine but I think it will satisfy most people. One noteworthy mention is their free side dishes; from all the Korean joints I've been to, this place has the biggest selection of side dishes and they all taste pretty good.  Overall I recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good Korean food at a good price."}
{"text":"Read my review below, and you'll know I love this place.  Hey, I'm the duke here :)  I just needed to update my review for one reason..  Yesterday, I tried the Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup) for the first time.  IT. WAS. IMMACULATE.   OH MY TASTEBUS.  They sang with joy.  I am getting this everytime from now on.

{"text":"New Nak Won is amazing!  First off, super awesome transit friendly location, right at the corner of Yonge and Weldrick. Get off the bus and walk right in.  There is so much seating room here, it's ridiculously amazing.  Next thing I noticed : The servers here can speak proper english. WTF. I was taken aback by this.   Anyways, as soon as I was seated, I knew what I wanted. Gamjatang and nothing else.  I ordered it.   4 minutes later, they brought out the banchies (banchan yo)  OMG THERE WERE SO MANY. SO MANY DELICIOUS NEW BANCHANS.  Usually, at old Nak Won, there's only a few I really like and the rest are just meh..  This time, I loved all of them!   The new ones are like a green pancake, spicy fish cake, grilled EGGPLANT YO, different types of kimchi and more. Check out ma pic.  So good. SOOO GOOD.  The Gamjatang was just like at the other locations. HUGE AND FILLING.  But the piece de resistance..they now have purple rice here. WIN.  New Nak Won is amazing. I want to go back errday.   Side Notes:  1. The tea cups are mad cute. See Jenn K's pic. 2. EAT LOTS OF BANCHAN 3. I did notice that most prices are a dollar up from the finch location, but I'll happily shell that out yo.  Total Bill : Gamjatang + Tax = 9.04 + tip"}
{"text":"mmm pork potato stew is always a must, stone pot bim bi bap is also awesome. i like they give you many plates of apps unlike some of the other restaurants... just dont ever count on a water refill or extra piece or napkin, you will never get it."}
{"text":"The Nak Won @ yonge and finch is one of the best ones out there! The service is always quick, and they will always attend to your needs. There's no 'forgetting' to bring you something, and if they've done something /wrong/, they will quickly apologize. However, I do agree that a few times the service has not been up to par- once or twice, they have been quite rude in seating us, it seemed as we were being rushed.  The gamjatang is by far my favourite; I've tried pork bone soup mostly everywhere and this one is the best! I love how the spice is JUST right, and the bowl is big enough for all the pork- unlike some places that have it overflowing. I especially love the touch of dubboki cakes inside the soup, so yummy! Their side dishes are some of the best side dishes in a korean restaurant, I love the jap chae, seaweed, beans and potatoes! They're flavoured so well. Their other dishes are also pretty yummy! Ugh, it's so unfair how I crave korean food almost every day now because of this place."}
{"text":"This used to be at least a 4 1/2 star for me, every time I was in the area I'd convince family/friends to meet me here! introduced quite a few Korean food newbies lol Their service was great and GamJaTang was really really yummy and good portions.  BUT recently the few times i went the GanJaTang was horrible (one time was to introduce two friends to it, I was embarrassed) Gunky, and tasteless and there was maybe 3-4 pieces of small bones. The service was definitely not as good as before (I wonder if they changed cooks or owners)  FINALLY, the last time that made me decide- :( to never go back- was for my brother's 27th birthday, there was 9 of us and they put us at the biggest table, in a semi private enclosure. This would have been fine because they had a bell we can ring for service, except the servers seems to have a knack for ignoring it.   It took us so long for us to wave down the server each time to: 1. order 2. get water 3. ask for more gas in our canister 4. remind her of the fact we are still waiting for new gas canisters (while raw meat is half cooked on the grill) which was suppose to be table cooking style but because she was so busy, she dumped the whole plate of meat on the table grill and left it sitting there before we realize they started cooking but wanted us to finish cooking. I had to stand up and stare her down outside our room so she would remember that we were still here waiting for our food. At which point she still took 2 other tables orders and served one table before coming back to us??? It would have took her 1 minute to refill it in the first place when she removed the other one and we could have been eating for that 15 minutes while she forgot. 5.To get us cutlery for the cake that the SIL brought for my brother. 6. to get the bill 7. to get change for the bill  The service from this lady was just horrendous, we had NINE people for dinner and we had a cake so we asked her for cutlery she brought FOUR spoons and FIVE bowls?!?!?!?   She was never rude at any point but the carelessness is what made me even more upset, everyone at the table was starving and trying to make the best of it and it just got worse and worse. got to the point where we were pressing the bell continuously for 2 minutes and nothing!   So I'm sad that one of my favorite staples in Young and Finch is no longer on my go-to list, but hopefully if they revamp the service and food in the future I can come back with an empty stomach ready to chow!  GamJaTang table cooking 19.99 Beef table Cooking 27.99 (not worth it at all, bad cuts of meat and we didn't get to cook it) 2 different tofu soups, which was only ok 8.99-10.99 Rice cakes which my sister loved 7.99 Bibimbap which looks good and my brother seem to enjoy it a lot. 10.95"}
{"text":"Never again! This used to be a very nice place to go for the Korean food. Now the place is outdated, cleaning supplies stored right near the customers tables, food brought on the server on wheels, dirty dishes  left on the server right next to the eating patrons, decor is falling apart. We ordered bulgogi, they were heated up, not freshly cooked, warm, not hot. Red wine was warm, not even room temperature, really warm. Not returning for sure."}
{"text":"Always a big fan of this place for Korean food despite what the reviews have said. I've always enjoyed my time and experience here. They also have a variety of appetizers to start off your meal. They offered 7 side-dishes: Potatoes, fish cake, glass noodles, bean sprouts, kimchi, potatoes strips, and seaweed salad. I especially love the potatoes with this sweat kind of sauce. I ordered the Kalbi Bibimbap and the kalbi was quite good. They gave about 5 pieces of kalbi which was decent amount. Customer service was good and the staff were friendly. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday evening but the place does get busy on weekend evenings. In my opinion, it's still one of the better Korean restaurants around the area so I would recommend to anyone looking for good Korean food."}
{"text":"Okay place to eat when you want korean food and its the closes place to go. Good place to eat with friends. Favourite would be the bimbimbaps and pork bone soup."}
{"text":"This place was legit. Other than their over extensive menu, their food tastes great! Wish we could've had more to order or bigger bellies to fill."}
{"text":"Hits the spot! If only I could, I'd order and eat more! I had the sizzling spicy pork and it was exactly how I wanted it. Traditional Korean goodness. Definitely coming back for more dishes to try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite korean restaurant - I would give it a 5 but the service is horrible. I've been here more than 15 times and each time we have to ask multiple times for things like hot sauce, more tea, more appetizers because the first waitress would forget/ignore our order - even at non busy times like 4.30pm.  The food is delicious though and good price for it. The appetizers are a good selection and it is really nice of them to give us refills. I've had mostly the bbq, spicy beef stew & bimbambap and never been disappointed with my choice and never had friends complain about their order.  If you get there between 6.30-7.30pm - there is always a wait so be prepared to wait... but well worth the wait and the line moves fast!"}
{"text":"Wish i had looked up reviews here first. Anyhoo, food just isnt good here, save yourself some money and go to korea house at dundas and elizabeth st  This place is the equivalent of a pho place run by chineses people."}
{"text":"First Korean restaurant that I've tried. Did not disappoint. My favourite has to be the seafood pancake. Flavour was good. It had a nice crunchy outside texture but soft on the inside."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. The service is slow in Friday night only 4 tables . the side dishes were not fresh at all tasted stale this location is not reccomended for nakwon ... The porkbone soup was doused with spices too spicy and hot not good. Not a happy camper here not returning at all the server has an upset face when gave a complaint ...."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the service is rude but the food is good. Many times we came in 45 min before closing (enough time to eat) but they seemed to not want to serve us. They wouldn't make us what we wanted because they said it took too long to make and we wouldn't finish eating before close.   Another time I paid in cash and they didn't give me my change. They expected it to be a 50% tip?? I had to ask for my change and they seemed annoyed!    It's sad because I like the food, but the unwelcoming service doesn't make me want to go back."}
{"text":"The food is bland but worst of all the service is horrible. Anyways you get what you pay for. But I have had much better Korean food in other restaurants for the same price. Won't ever visit this place again."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 stars - 10 side dishes AND honey potatoes  - They have a split platter of Dukboki (Korean spicy rice cake) and Bulgogi (grilled marinated beef) which is great to share!  - Everything else is pretty decent  - Price is good  Service: 1/5 stars - I've been here multiple times and I have been to their other locations and I can tell you that I have never experience exceptional service. At best their service is decent but at worst (and this is often) the staff is rude and the owners alike.   Conclusion: 3/5 stars  I come back for the food but since I've found out about Oh Geul Boh Geul I haven't been back since (they have even more sides!!)."}
{"text":"Oh look, I'm back already! This time I tried their Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box with Tempura ($8.99). Another winner!  The chicken is perfectly grilled with lots of sauce and is accompanied by delicious roasted potatoes, salad (I can't get enough of this dressing!), their amazing glass noodles, rice and miso soup. The tempura consisted of two pieces of shrimp and four pieces of vegetable.  Another happy food moment!"}
{"text":"Food was great, I don't find their service extremely bad like other reviewers, maybe because I went there myself, experience might be different if you go as a group of ppl. I think their food is good quality and taste good compare to all the Korean restaurant around that area especially the side dishes, I think the portion is bigger and better than most Korean restaurants. I would highly recommend this place to people around that area and want Korean food."}
{"text":"This is a decent restaurant to come to for some korean food. Why?   First of all, their food is mediocre. Nothing is really good enough for me to go like \"PRAISE THE KOREAN FOOD LORDS\"   Here's what I got: 1. Jeyook Bossam - steamed sliced marinated pork served with lettuce and oyster kimchi - meh  - marinated pork my ass ...it didn't really taste like anything and it ESPECIALLY didn't taste like anything with the lettuce wrapped around it  - oyster kimchi was pretty good though  - meat was a bit tough for my liking   2. Kimchi Jigae - decent, i have had way better   3. Gamjatang - not bad, but could be better   4. Jajangmyun - pretty good...too sweet for my sensitive taste buds   Other than their food, the other reason why this place is decent is because of the waitresses. Personally, I find them pretty cruddy and just rude? They don't seem to give a flying fk about their customers and they tend to not pay attention to their surroundings. Like look ahjummas and agasshis, don't you see my waving arm that is about to break off? STOP TALKING AND GET WORKING  Oh yeah, their banchans were fairly okay. Nothing outstanding about them. They don't particularly have a side dish that really stands out so yeah."}
{"text":"THIS IS MADNESS CAUSE A YOUNG SERVER HAS POOR MEMORY.   The one I go to at finch station has the worst Korean female server ever! She couldn't even handle 24 people seated at different tables. Got the bills wrong first of all and never bothered  listening to customer's problem .   Second,avoided all questions that was asked about what food each and every person ordered. Even blamed me for not paying.#whatswrongwithher? And she said I forgot that I took your receipt which was quite funny  and hectic.   Third,  I was about to leave the place when she called me and for sure knowing the fact myself, I had paid previously on the 1 order of food I had called out.   #likeitneverhappenedinthebeginning. OH MAN! cuz she literally ripped it right in front of me right after I paid my bill.#ISAWITWITHMYOWNFREAKINGEYES.  I had my friends to protect me for not getting this shit right.  Just want to shout out . GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER WAITRESS."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the Finch location over this one. I came here a couple times with friends and family and had mixed experiences.   The Good: Great authentic tasting food. Friendly staff and good service. The seafood Soontofu and grilled mackerel I got were delicious and the pork cutlets tasted alright too. Prices were more or less average.   The Bad: I cannot stress enough how disappointed I was with the portion sizes. The seafood soontofu looked like it was in a miniature sized bowl, the mackerel looked like an humongous anchovy, and don't get me started on the pork cutlets. Paper thin and two small pieces drowned in (I'll admit pretty tasty) sauce. Normally I \"complain\" about there not being enough rice for the enormous helpings of meat, but in this case it was the other way around. The only thing that seemed appropriate in size were the grapefruit slices that came with the pork cutlet!   Now you may be looking at this review going: \"he wrote a tiny blurb for the Good, an essay for the Bad, and not even a mention of the Ugly.\" Well, I guess the restaurant could've used some renovation but that's not the point. Normally I'd give this place 2 stars because generally when I eat at a place that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, I like to be full by the end of it. However, the friendly staff and the fact that the food was actually really good albeit lacking gives this place the extra star."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time and likely because of its hours, I came a lot during university. I revisited recently after a few years hiatus and the food was not bad, but also not as homey as I remember.  I got the gamjatang which was pretty standard and came with good portions of meat. The pork belly wraps were a highlight for me - very flavourful and had good ingredients for putting together. The cold slushy noodles were bland despite the sauce. The side dishes, despite being many, weren't that great in taste.  All in all, not bad, but not a stand out either in an area where there are SO many Korean joints."}
{"text":"Nak Won has always been a favourite of mine for the wide selection of Korean dishes that it offers. Ranging from weekday lunch specials (bento boxes), large hot pots, kbbq, sizzling hot plates, and of course, a variety of soup options. I have frequented the First Markham Place location many times, so I was curious as to how this location will compare.  As I made my way into the restaurant at 10:00pm, we were informed that they were closing up by 11:00pm, which would probably be enough time for my guest and I to finish our dinner. We ordered the Gam Ja Tang as a quick option.   We were presented with the same amount of delicious appetizers as the First Markham Place branch. My favourite is the sweet potatoes.   But why I rated a 2 star for my experience is because of the service and attitude the waitresses were presenting. It was as if they were in a hurry to get home, as the bill came at the same time as our Gam Ja Tang! They informed us that they had to close their register and had us pay before we even have a chance to eat.   As we ate, the waitresses were pacing back and forth behind/in front of us. It was a very uncomfortable eating experience; feeling as if they were pressuring us to finish eating as soon as we can.   Though the Gam Ja Tang came sizzling hot, I felt that it was made hastily, as the potatoes and meat were quite tough to eat.   As we were preparing to leave, they started to close the lights on us. We weren't even out the door yet! A very unpleasant and frustrating dinner to have to endure.  All in all, Nak Won has been consistent with the portion and quality of food. But to save yourself the trouble, avoid coming in near closing time. Not even an hour before closing."}
{"text":"At one point, Nak Won was my favorite Korean restaurant and I was proud to bring friends and family to eat solid Korean food with decent service but that time has long gone. Last time I frequent this establishment in May 2014 the service has gone to a deplorable level.  Me and my friend simply made a request for a side-dish refill - and asked again as we have not seen in for quiet sometime - and the server simply yelled at us \"It's coming!\" and the server who brought our side dishes were grumbling in Korean which we did not understand. You could have eaten in a prison cafetaria and you might not notice the difference of the service quality. That would be the last time I eat at Nak Won."}
{"text":"I visited Nak Won first around the time they had just opened. Although, there are several Korean restaurants in Richmond Hill this one definitely doesn't send the area into Korean food overload.   The place is equipped with tons of seating and I found the service to be quite great compared to some of their competition. In fact, we pretty much never had to flag down our waitress for anything.   One thing - I wish they had a greater selection in their soondubu varieties. I'd love to get a soondubu with vegetables or soondubu with mushroom without having to make a specific request each time.   I'd come back for a quick, delicious meal anytime, though."}
{"text":"I got the kimchi tofu soup and it was disappointing. A few observations on the dish: - it lacked substance and contents, it was mostly broth - the broth lacked \"oomph\" and depth of flavor, it was mostly one-toned It wasn't bad/horrible, it was edible, but there definitely are better Korean tofu soups out there."}
{"text":"I've been to Nak Won a few times before but earlier tonight, the service was the worst. They sat us down in a dark corner. I raised my hand a couple of times and buzzed to get a refill for water and it took the server 30 mins to come to our table. He banged a whole pitcher of water like he was mad. When we tried to get the bill, the server snapped at us and told us to pay at the counter. Idk if they changed how customers were supposed to pay but before, the server would always give us the bill and bring the debit machine to our table. I don't mind paying at the counter but I don't like it when servers give attitude and snap at the customers. Never ever going back there. Their servers are the worst."}
{"text":"Very poor service, and servers were throwing stuff across the tables. Would not recommend this place, since the food is usually lower quality than I've previously experienced at other Korean restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Having had chaban a few nights earlier... This doesn't compare (spicy chicken, bulgogi). I liked the booth idea, except for the guy clearing his nasty throat every three seconds (neighbour). Wouldn't return.  Also prices high."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan. I live literally a stumble away from this place but the first time I went, it was my friend from out of town who suggested it. This little gem is nuzzled away in between Crazy Wings and what I believe is a Karaoke place in North Korea Town. The place is quite small, the décor is nothing special at which is probably one of the few areas where it loses points. Another areas is service, but I don't think it's the worst and most of the time they're quick and efficient. It's not McDonalds, I guess the smiles aren't free...  If you sit in one of the closed booths, there is a button on the wall (unless someone took it home as a souvenir) which you can press and the server will come. Buttons are not consistent for all the open area tables, you either have it or you don't. Nak Won has a TV and you will enjoy it if you watch Korean soap operas!  My favorite part about this place is the appetizers. They're free and are usually brought our first thing. You get small round dishes with bean sprouts, cold potatoes in gooey sweet sauce, glass noodles, kimchi, fish cakes,  seaweed (not like you get at sushi places, this one is saltier, with more of a sea-taste to it) and little bean dish. The beans are tiny, dry-ish and kind of sweet. I'm not sure how to describe it, but just imagine tiny beans al dente! Now that I'm a \"regular\", I've tried more than just my standard beef Bibimbap. I tried a beef stew with glass noodles, which I wasn't crazy about because it was quite sweet and just not my cup of \"stew\" at all. The menu says they have chicken, pork or beef bibimbap but that's a lie. They only have beef...I mentioned a couple of times that they never seem to have chicken but never got a straight answer. So I got over it! Bibimbap is delicious and bigger than the one I have had at other Korean place.   So, in summary: Cons: bathrooms are downstairs and aren't very nice, décor, lack of other bibimbap options. Pros: bottomless appetizers, gyoza (TO DIE FOR), fast service (although not the friendliest), bibimbap!  Pros most definitely outweigh the cons and I will take anyone who ventures out into this part of the city to Nak Won!"}
{"text":"First glance - the restaurant is very clean and spacious with lots of seating. However, I visited on a Monday during the day, so it was pretty quiet. Our waitress was not the most friendly and did not give her name, but the food was spectacular! If you're looking for something tasty and quick, I highly recommend this place, but don't come looking for great service.  * On a side note, I got the Chicken KalGookShu which comes traditionally bland. I asked if I'd be able to make the dish spicy and the server said not a problem. That was the last I saw her until paying the bill, though.   Accommodating and quick, but not present."}
{"text":"this actually deserves no stars. when we were paying, the waitress forced us not to count our money. we actually paid the right amount of we were planning on not tipping the waitress. then she said we were missing 10 dollars, and on top of that, we were missing the tips. this is canada. we do not have to pay any tips. she only decided to scam us because we were teenagers. finally, when we were about to leave, they forced us to leave because they said there weren't enough seats for people waiting when we literally saw 20 tables available.   do not come to this restaurant, the short waitress with the short hair, will scam u. she needs to be fired. if u go, u will regret it!   side note: the service was so bad too, it did not deserve any tips. we kept asking for them to come, but they didn't. do not come to this bad restaurant! u will get scammed for your money!   note to manager: that short waitress probably kept it for herself, fire her/check her pockets!   this is the worst restaurant i have been to. never come here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cozy, has a homey feel. Service was great.   Food: I ordered the Beef stew, the meat was a tad chewier than my previous times at  the Nak Won by FMP, but here they definitely were really generous with the portion size. The sides were awesome, and they kept refilling it for us.   Overall: Great for late night. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant is located in China town. All meals comes with delicious small side dishes. They are all pretty tasty.  I had cold noodle soup called 'Mul NaenMteon' in cold beef broth with spicy chilly peppers paste. It was pretty good. All menu has pictures of food, so it's easier to pick and very good."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service sucks balls!  If you must go, avoid going when they're almost closing. They will tell you they're closed even if you're trying to finish up your food.   They actually stood behind my friends and I and bitched about us. We had 3 more minutes to finish up our food but they made us feel super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to check this place out after I saw the neat looking plastic food models for some of the dishes displayed on window; a common practice which is mostly seen at many Japanese restaurants. The food displays gives Nak Won this appeal that would draw your interest to it.  I finally checked it out for a quick bite after a joyful karaoke session at Twister Karaoke next door. With our appetites going, our hungry group were given one of the small enclosed booths.  The menu features a mix of Korean and Japanese cuisines including some Korean takes on Chinese dishes. I was definitely hooked on the ban-chan that were served before the mains, especially the potatoes with the sweet glaze and also the japchae and the sliced fish cake. I had the pork tonkatsu with stir-fried egg and rice which was pretty tasty and comforting. Our food did get brought out at a reasonable pace and the dishes looked good enough. The guy across me had this sizzling plate of Kalbi which looked real good even though I'm not a keen fan of ribs of any type. Even more sassy was that it was served in this bovine-shaped hot plate.  Perhaps one of the most interesting features at this place which I had never noticed in other Korean restaurants was the red \"Call\" button used to ring the wait staff's attention. It was a pretty nifty feature and I'm glad got a chance to \"play\" with it whenever we needed someone to come tend to us.  Our experience was decent, and the service was alright which was not overwhelming and also not neglectful. The food looked and tasted comforting enough, with a quick-fix level type flair. I'll be back next when I'm in the mood for some Korean food. I might also check out the Dundas location when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Was very underwhelmed. This must've been the worse bibimbap and kimchi stew I've had. The rice was soggy and I had so much trouble eating it because I got so sick of it. The stew was hot but bland. Not very flavourful at all. However, the side dishes were amazing and they give you lots. 8 dishes per order. Also, they have a bell at each table which was neat. I probably won't come back though considering all the other better options in the area"}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was mediocre. I got a rice-based dinner; all the ingredients tasted fresh, though I felt the sauce was applied too heavily. Calling a waitress was very difficult; we had to press the button 2 or 3 times to call one (with several minutes of waiting in between, just to confirm that they didn't hear us). I heard an unconfirmed rumor that you get much better service if you're ethnically Korean and speak the Korean language."}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again! Ever! The service was soo crappy. The girl didnt seat us first when we went in, then when we did she asked how much ppl n I said 5 when there was only 4 (my bad) but when she bought over our water I told her dres only 4 of us. And the next thing she does is slams the menu so hard on the table next to us. Maybe if the place was packed and dre was limited seating, I would understand but the place was basically empty except a couple of tables. We got so pissed that we walked out. Will Never ever go to that location ever! As if she is paying us to eat there!! Hol~ if you want to eat at Nakwon I would def recommend you to eat at the yonge and finch location. This place doest even deserve one star. Arrrgghhh!"}
{"text":"Decent Korean food. They give a lot of sides. I really like the potatoes - they are very sweet. I always ask for extra side order and it's free as long as you don't ask too many times. Had a seafood jajangmyun. It was a huge portion, enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubby for some face stuffing Korean bbq.   It wasn't the greatest and I was surprised how they had all the meat and fish on one plate separated by a sliver of lettuce. I was kind of grossed out by that, how everything was just all up in each others business. I stank like short ribs when I left, they totally need to step up their ventilation system.  wasn't a fan :s"}
{"text":"Very competitive pricing. Appetizers are generous in varieties and are provided for you complimentarily no matter what you order. Their famous #19 GamJaTang is just $6.99 and fills most if not all sizes of appetites. Taste is not authentic, however, it is rather unique and delicious. Other dishes are very decent too.  I am a local frequent customer and have been here more than 50 times."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the service was pretty pathetic both times. The second time I came here, the place was crowded and for some reason, there were only two waiters working. It was Mother's Day, so it's expected that a restaurant would be packed with customers, hence there should have been more workers! I continuously pressed the button on the table to call for more water as I was becoming extremely parched and no one came by. Also tried raising my hand up and they just dashed right past me.   I ordered the BiBimBap the first time and it lacked a lot of flavour. However, I wouldn't necessarily say it tasted bad. The second time I came here, I ordered the Chicken Katsu and my goodness, what was I eating. The chicken was more than 50% burnt and it felt like I was eating bitter breadcrumbs. The pieces are super skinny and there was barely any meat on it! The salad they give on the side was surprisingly quite delicious, but also a bit too sour for my liking. Plus, the place has no wi-fi so be aware! If this place didn't serve honey garlic potatoes as one of the six side dishes, I would be more than glad to give a 1-star rating instead."}
{"text":"Terrible service and ridiculous long wait for food. Come here if you have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"Well, this is...ummmm...I kind of don't know what to say. I walk in and everyone (the customers) were just sitting there eating or waiting to order/for their food to come out. I stood there for about 3 minutes, waiting for the waitresses to come out and point me to a table but I just gave up and sat myself down. Then a bloody waitress finally emerges from the kitchen, I also had to grab a menu for myself. Anyways, moving onto the food...  I ordered bulgogi ddukbokki, and waited. I received the banchan and the tea first. Let's just say there were a lot of banchan. 8 dishes! I couldn't believe it...8 small dishes of banchan: Kimchi, glazed soybeans (my absolute fav.), seaweed, japchae, odeng strips, bean sprouts, glazed sweet potato and pickled daikon. My only complaint about the banchan was the seaweed and japchae were way too salty and the daikon tasted funky. There was also a simply salad as the appetizer? I don't know.    Main course. Bulgogi ddukbokki. Lots of bulgogi, yay! (Actually a bit too much.) Sorta upset that the ddukbokki part was sort of a letdown. There was maybe like 5 long rice cakes in the whole thing and like the rest of it was mushrooms and ONIONS! (I'm a huge hater of cooked onions, just find them too mushy to eat especially when they've been sitting in gochujang sauce for a bit). Overall, it was alright but next time, I'm going to order their popular dishes."}
{"text":"Dishes we had:  1. Gam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Soup) 2. Kim Chi JJi Gae (Kim Chi Stew) 3. Hae Mul Pa Jun (Seafood pancake)  Decor: Acceptable korean restaurant decor, not romantic. You are gonna leave smelling like Korean food. (Good or bad, depending on your prespective). As others have noted, service is somewhat lacking here. Seems like they are a little understaffed.  Ban chan (korean \"appetizers\"): Good variety, all were excellent.  1. Gam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Soup): Fantastic and delicious. Huge portions left me stuffed (and I can chow down). This dish really seems to be a specialty of korean restaurants in Toronto. Compared to other restaurants serving the same, a little stronger on the ginger, but not in a bad way.  2. Kim Chi JJi Gae (Kim Chi Stew): Again, tasty, slightly different from other korean restaurants. The Kim Chi used seemed very fermented as opposed to the kim chi served as appetizer, which was quite new. It was good, but didn't blow my mind. (Then again, I've appreciated many Kim Chi Jji Gae's w/o it blowing my mind)  3. Hae Mul Pa Jun (Seafood pancake): My only slight complaint. This was a thick, beastly dish. This was huge in diameter and thickness, explaining the strange high cost (compared to the hot stews, etc). This would have been much much better if they had made it half-thickness, with more of a crispy edge (it was thick and almost doughy. WAAY too much carbs for our modern diet).  Overall, it was awesome, and I would come here again."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a student of Korean food, but I do know what I like, and I like Nak Won. The bulgogi, spicy chicken, and glass noodle sharing plate are all excellent, and the ban chan is hearty and tasty. The decor is garbage, but the place is roomy and the service is, though smile-less, prompt and courteous. No complaints."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon lunch brought us to this korean restaurant on the busy intersection of Finch and Yonge. Parking maybe a little tricky, but that is to be expected for this area. They provide the usual korean food offerings and we got the staples of bimbimbap, bolgogi in soup, pork bone soup, and japchae to share. The bolgogi was incredibly sweet, almost like it's been candied by the amount of sugar in the soup. The pork bone soup was a little past my spice tolerance, so I stuck with bimbimbap and the japchae instead. I found that mixing the sweet bolgogi soup and pork bone soup gave a much better balance of flavor. I enjoyed the soups alot more after that creative discovery.   The side dishes were a little lackluster: shredded potato, chunks of potato in a glaze, glass noodles, spicy tofu, and the kimchi. Nothing special to give an additional range of flavor or textures to the meal. In summary, it's was okay but I'm sure there is better examples of good korean food. Delivers the usual staples but nothing too special to keep it in mind for next time."}
{"text":"Very terrible experience. When the pork bone soup was served, the soup was hot but the meat was cold near the bone. I suspected that they had reheated the meat from goodness knows how long ago. My suspicions were confirmed when I had a terrible stomachache and diarrhea last night. This is the first korean restaurant that has given me diarrhea - no wonder they are a yellow conditional pass for food cleanliness.  When I confronted them the restaurant had the audacity to claim that nobody had been sick at their restaurant. Needless to say I will not be going back and neither should anyone who wants to stay alive."}
{"text":"Oh goodness.. what a terrible experience. I wanted to go to Hashi Izakaya, which is just a couple doors down from this place, but majority ruled that we go here for dinner. Got seated as soon as we walked in.. alright, so far so good. Spent some time deliberating over what to order. When we had decided, they took FOREVER to come by and take our order, despite us ringing our call button every couple minutes. They only bring you your sides after you order, so those eventually arrived afterwards. The sides were the standard kinds you usually get at Korean places, about average quality. They give you disposable paper place mats to eat your meals on at this place, so while the four of us were waiting for our meals, we started using the back of one to play Pictionary. When a waitress arrived with two of the four entrees we ordered, she already had a disgruntled, sour look on her face. Either she was in a really bad mood or she hates her job. Maybe both. She just started arbitrarily all-but-flinging the plates on the table, mumbling the names and not even bothering to figure out who they belonged to. The two dishes she brought first were mine and the girl sitting across from me, us being seated furthest away from her. Of the two people sitting facing each other closest to her, one was missing her place mat (we were using it for Pictionary) and the other had it in his hands (he was drawing on it). The waitress paused and stared at what he was doing, then in the biggest display of passive aggressive attitude ever, yanks his own place mat from under his elbows and places it in front of the other girl who was missing hers. Okay. I would understand her behaviour if she was trying to serve my friend her meal and wanted to ensure there was something under the dish. But no. She didn't have anything else to serve us and just stormed off. The other two dishes didn't show up for another five (the guy's meal) and then ten (the girl with the missing place mat's meal) minutes. So.. what the heck was the point of all that? The food itself was horrible, too. Maybe I just ordered a bad dish.. I can't be sure. I ordered the dak kalbi jungsik (marinated and BBQ'd spicy chicken on hot plate with rice). The dish was mostly onions, with a few pieces of chicken that were mostly gristle, connective tissue and cartilage. Horrible. It wasn't even a decent sized portion for $12. When we finished our meals, it also took forever and a day to get our bill. I think the fact that we were sitting in a booth didn't help because they just seemed to forget about us, but the call button on the table should mitigate that fact.. Whatever. I'm not coming back here unless I get dragged and the meal's free. Waste of time and money in an area overflowing with better options. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Yep, I totally agree with all the reviews here about their bad service. Even though the food here is pretty good I doubt I can put up with the exceptionally bad service for another visit.   Environment: Nak Won has everything going for it in terms of restaurant location. Right off the Finch station terminal, the Yonge/Finch area is a vibrant neighbourhood with lots of people both living in the area and also commuting from. There is potential for lots of customers but also lots of competition around if the food/service isn't good. To me, the service is a deal breaker in this case that prevents me from visiting again.  Upon stepping into the restaurant, you can immediately feel that the environment has poor ventilation and is extremely stuffy. I don't understand how a restaurant that also offers kbbq can have such poor air circulation. Near the end of the meal I felt light headed from the stuffiness.   Food: I had the short ribs egg drop soup which also comes with a bowl of rice and some complementary cold side dishes. Overall I find both my soup and the side dishes to be really good, which adds some point for the restaurant. The side dishes I like the most are the potatoes, seaweed, and bean sprouts. However, they don't allow any refills. Even though the soup bowls we ordered are around $10 I did find some of the other dishes quite pricey, especially the bbq items, where one serving of raw meats are already above $10. No idea how good the kbbq is, but given the poor air circulation at this restaurant, I wouldn't suggest going for the bbq items.   Service: Woot the fun part. So I remembered I have been to Nak Won once before, but left without ordering anything because me and my friend weren't greeted by anyone nor were led to a table when we came into the restaurant, so we just left. Well this time it's quite the same deal, we didn't get any attention when we came in and that was during slow afternoon hours. We decided to sit down because there was already a menu there on the table that we went and took ourselves.  So they have this bell on the table which you can press to request service. Well let me tell you, that thing is absolutely USELESS. I can't recall a time that it actually worked and someone paid attention to the ring. You basically have to stand up and wave your arms violently to get anybody's attention. Did I mention we came at 4pm on a weekday afternoon, there were barely any customers there.   Bonus: we walked out of the restaurant smelling like we just had AYCE kbbq, even though we just had a regular meal."}
{"text":"This place is OK if you are in the area and just want a quick Korean bite, but there are much better options if you're OK with taking a slight trek down Yonge.  The place is large and fairly clean. Decor is modern. I'd say for the most part, it's all spacious and comfortable. The menu is fairly extensive and contains pretty much all the standard Korean menu items. I've never tried having Korean BBQ here so I can't comment on that. For their standard dishes, the quality is passable, but nothing particularly outstanding. However, their prices are higher than the average Korean joint, so relative to the prices, the food quality isn't up to par. I am not a fan of their banchan (side dishes) -- while there is decent variety, they tend to be overly westernized items that I rarely see anywhere else.  As for the service, I haven't really experienced any of the rudeness mentioned by other reviews. But the service is definitely lacking in pleasantries. The courtesy shown here is less than any other Korean restaurant I've been to in the GTA, which is odd. They also tend to be slow with responding to requests (e.g. for more utensils or side dish refills). There are some nights where it seems like they are just understaffed."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get some Korean food. I was starving when I got here so the food tasted especially good so my review might be biased! I got the gullang tang or something like that which had beef brisket in there. The broth was great, had a lot of beef flavour and portions were big enough to get me full!  My sister ordered a fish soup which had a million tiny bones you can choke on at anytime. I wasn't a fan of that but she seems to have the agileness required to avoid the bones. I would say if you're not prepare to do a lot of \"prep work\" for your food, don't order anything with fish in it! I'm pretty sure she spent a majority of the time picking out the bones than actually eating. But I did get a taste of the broth and have to say, it's pretty good.  Service was decent since there was a bell on the table to call the waitress over when needed. Love it when restaurants have it! Great place to head to if you're in Chinatown and looking for some cheap Korean food."}
{"text":"This place doesn't wow, or really differentiate itself in terms of Kfood. But that's not to say it's any worse then any other place out there. I would say this place errs a bit on the better side of the scale of things.  Service can rarely be spotty, but most tints it's quite reliably fast and efficient.  The food is pretty on par for what you pay, and quality also.   I find it hard to fault the place honestly, but it definitely has room for improvement. If your in Richmond Hill and want some good korean food this is pretty much the place. But I wouldn't tell anyone to go out of their way to try this place either"}
{"text":"Despite some questionable Yelp reviews, we decided to try out Nak Won on my mom's recommendation.  She had mentioned one particularly enjoyable side dish of pickled chayote she had last time she dined there.  We were a group of 3 adults and 2 kids and ordered:  Jajangmyun, Spicy squid stir-fry, Jampong and spicy cold buckwheat noodles.  I only got to try their banchan which were all pretty decent and my spicy cold buckwheat noodles were very enjoyable.    The buckwheat noodles are the chewy kind where they add potato or sweet potato starch to make it more chewy.  I personally don't mind this version but if you're looking to experience a 100% buckwheat noodles, this dish may disappoint.  They serve the hot sauce for the noodles on the side so you can control the heat.  Their hot sauce was a nice balance of heat, savory with a tinge closer to the sweeter side.  Adding hot mustard and vinegar to further suit your taste, this dish was a winner for me.  I did not get a chance to try the other dishes so I can't comment on those but everyone enjoyed their meal.    However, the service could have been better as we were interrupted multiple times throughout the meal for no apparent reason at all but for the ladies to just chat us up.  Strange, no?    Will I return to Nak Won?  Maybe...if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"A special person to me likes this place.. needless to say its good.  soondubu"}
{"text":"I used to go to the First Markham Place and Finch location and I didn't like their food and customer service. So when my friends suggested coming here and I was a little skeptical.   This was my first time coming to this location.  I was definitely impressed when I first walked in. The decor of this place was very sleek. They have black marbled tables which made the place look very modern and the furniture seems to be well maintained. The menu might need a little makeover to give a cohesive modern vibe in the restaurant.   I ordered a soon tofu and we ordered a seafood pancake to share ! The seafood pancake was huge!! We each had at least 3 pieces! The rice was included and they served purple rice which was a super plus for me. They gave a lot of side dishes and when we asked for refills they didn't hesitate to refill them for us. One thing about the side dishes was they don't have the sweet potato which other locations do carry. The soon tofu was delicious, I ordered mine no spice. And I loved the seasoning in this dish ! Also, there were a lot of seafood and  tofu!   The service here was pretty good, it wasn't busy so the server was very attentive. They gave us an entire jug of water when we asked for water. The waitress even helped me closed my takeout container because I struggled to close it. Yes, the struggle is real! The only thing I would comment is they don't do split bills on food items, we wanted to split the seafood pancake into 3 bills but the waitress seemed to be confused. A lot of restaurant can do split bills in food items, they really need to upgrade their system!       Comparing to all the Nak Kwon locations I went to (Finch and First Markham Place) I was very satisfied with the food and service with this location. This Nak Kwon is probably the best one they have!   Give this place a chance because you might be surprised !"}
{"text":"Wow.. what's wrong with this place? It used to be my go to Korean restaurant for years. I can't even call it Korean food anymore, it's more like Chinese food with a hint of Korean essence in it. This place is permanently removed from my dining list."}
{"text":"Avoided it like the plague a few years ago when the food was super mediocre and the service was terrible.  We decided to give it another shot a few months ago, and it is now one of our go to Korean restaurants in Chinatown.  Lots of selection in Korean dishes. The lunch specials until 5pm look amazing and are well-priced. Unfortunately, I have never made it hear for lunch. We had five side dishes with our meal, and they were not stingy with top-ups. Our side dishes were: honey potatoes, jap chae noodles, seaweed salad, kimchi, and slices of ?gluten strips.  We both ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and were satisfied and full. Service was pretty good, and the restaurant was half full.  Overall, it is a great restaurant to satisfy your Korean cravings in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible service. The waiters were rude and constantly ignoring us. It was extremely hard to communicate with the waiters/waitresses because none of them could speak English. Furthermore, when we asked to refill the kimchi bowl that was given to us as a side dish, we were told that we have to pay extra for that, even though in any other Korean restaurant kimchi refills are free.   Disappointed, we ended up not giving any tips, except one of us, who gave them a 30 cent tip, after which the waitress came up to us and said \"you have a problem with the service?\" To which we said \"yes\", then she took that change, threw it on our table, and said \"you want me to be angry?\". This was shocking."}
{"text":"I came here around two weeks ago and finally had time to update my review for this place.   Dined here on a Friday evening and the place had a good crowd of people. Waited under 10 minutes for a seat. My friend and I were sat, given one tea and one water. After we were ready to order, we pushed the service button like three times before calling a server passing our table to take our order.   Received our food after awhile and again they got my order wrong. The server had dropped the good off and walked away. I couldn't get the attention of any server for at least 10 minutes and numerous times pressing the service button. Finally, I told the server and she said oh okay then walked away. I was confused? Like 10 minutes later she comes back to take back the food I ordered. After awhile, she came back with my food and basically dumped it on my table.   This experience was just disappointing. Never again will I come back."}
{"text":"This Nak Won is da bomb!   So this place rocks, it's so much better then the other Nak Wons! Even though they have some servers that travel to all locations. The quality there is just so much better then the rest!   The Food is amazing I've gotten so many dishes there... All so delicious!! Best part is when the servers recognize you and they act so much friendly haha! I've gotten away with 2 Arizonas without being charge.. Wasn't sure if that was a mistake or on purpose, but happiest day on life mmmhm. One time my Gf and I did table cooking and lettuce, to get more lettuce we had to pay more... So that was a bit of downfall since the table cooking meat is 3 times more then the lettuce given :(. Still those free Arizona aww yea definitely never forgetting those! Might not happen to everyone but I'm sure when it happens it's like ahhhh yea!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for as long as I can remember, coming once a week during most weeks. I have tried a few other Korean restaurants near Yonge & Finch, and Nak Won is average at best but they do give out a variety of free side dishes and I've always been a sucker for that.  What finally prompted me to write this review is the unacceptable level of service - so absolutely horrendous that I have no choice but to stop coming altogether.  To keep a long story short, the waitress made me wait 25 minutes before I was able to order. After that I waited 45 minutes for my meal to arrive...it never did. During all this waiting I was subject to total rudeness for no apparent reason. The service at Nak Won had always been random - you never know if you would get a nice waitress or a particularly vitriolic one. This time, I got the latter and it was just too much. I decided that enough was enough and left the restaurant.  I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"When I think of Nak Won, Shania Twain's \"You're Still The One\" comes to mind.  You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life  Yes, Nak Won was the second Korean restaurant I went to in my entire life back in high school, and 15 or so years later, it's still the one I go to when I crave Korean food. Sure there's a gazillion other places that popped up since then, some with even better food, but Nak Won's just the comfortable easy choice time and time again.   I know it's not the BEST Korean food, but it's a solid 3 and time and time again it's proven to be that way. So much safer than going into a new place, getting ripped off and end up with bad food or skimpy side dishes. It's also super convenient - right at yonge and finch, easy to hop in and grab a bite before heading home on transit. They always give you 6 or so side dishes, soy beans, kimchee, sprouts, sweet soy potatoes, and some other varieties.   I love that their soups start at $6.99. I like their Pork Bone Soup. A lot. I also like their rice dishes such as the bulgoggi rice for $7.99. And before I mastered the dukbokki dish, I used to eat it here all the time too. And while service isn't the fastest, I like that they have a bell on the wall so it lets the waitstaff know I'm ready to order or pay up."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for lunch. I have heard either really good things or bad things from people regarding this restaurant. Service probably could've been improved but it wasn't overly bad. Their side dishes are pretty good too. I really like the fishcake - not overly soft and the taste was sweet and saucey. I didn't like the pork bone soup at all. The meat was clearly boiled too long and it tastes mushy. The LA kalbi was pretty good but it wasn't the most tender. I've had better before. Overall I think food and service couldve improved. I would come here again but definitely not for pork bone soup - there's cheaper and better out there."}
{"text":"I've been to at least three Nak Won chains out there, and I like this one the best.  The side dishes are plentiful and you can always order more. There are at least 6-8 side dishes at dinner time! The side dishes usually include kim chi, kelp/seaweed, pickled radish, potato, bean sprouts, soybeans, and japchae/glass noodles.  I've ordered many soup stone bowls from their menu and all are good, and I usually pick them based on whether I feel like having a spicy dish or not that day. Their pork bone soup can be very spicy, so be sure to ask for non-spicy/regular pork bone soup if you do get it. Their kalbi is expensive ($15.99 for the meal with rice), but it's cooked so well and the pieces of kalbi are well-marbled and meaty. Their bibimbap in a stone bowl is also very tasty when you add the extra hot sauce.  This is my go-to comfort food now. :)"}
{"text":"This was my go-to Korean restaurant downtown but I have found a hidden gem further North in Chinatown. However, I still prefer this one to the ones further east along Dundas.   You will find affordable and good eats here. My favourite is the Kimchi Chigae. Their free apps has gone a bit downhill the last time I visited - less options and poorer quality.   The service is good and I like how every table has a buzzer so you can easily get someone's attention if they're all in the back."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  At least the one near Finch station.  Usually, the waiting time for the mains feels reduced by at least fast service for the side dishes.  Nak Won?  Nope, came the same time as the main courses we ordered.   The middle-aged waitress there also has a bit of an attitude problem and ignored the tea requests our table puts in.  Well, not ignored.  Just got back to us like half an hour after we asked.  They seem to be severely understaffed in the kitchen.. please, make your resto smaller if you don't have enough chefs to serve your customers within 15min.     Previously at this Nak Won branch, I had the gamjatang - which tasted like every other pork bone soup I had in any other Korean restaurant.  Quite filling and not too spicy.  The mul-naengmyeon (cold noodles) I had at the FMP branch, however, was horrendous.  It was strangely sour - I understand it's supposed to be seasoned with vinegar, but it was stomach-flipping bad.  I believe I had two bites before abandoning the dish completely.    Most recently, I tried their beef brisket soup dish with glass noodles, leek, onions, etc.  It was not flavoured as well as the pork bone one, and if I wasn't hungry after the waiting time I would deem it as bland.  All I tasted was the pepper they spiced the soup with.  Actually, it was bland regardless of my hunger.    Please save yourself the trouble from coming here and visit Buk Chang Dong instead, just a five minute walk further but two stars better."}
{"text":"Pretty clean and large place, first time at this nak won as I always goto the fMp one....menu is pretty similar, this place has ayce korean BBQ for $26.99 but we were just here for lunch  Got the bulgogi and the pork bone soup Pretty good, lots of side dishes to choose from, service was good, had the door bell to ring"}
{"text":"if you like korean food, dont come here! terrible food and awful services! If you really want korean food, you might as well cook it yourself. Overall if you really want to eat here, just stick with the free rice noodles!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Nak Won and picked it up. The restaurant was about a third full for Sunday lunch. I would not go here, especially if you are getting the Jajangmyeon ($9.99) or the Dumplings ($9.99), which is what I ate. I to  I eat jajangmyeon (or the Chinese equivalent of it, zhajiangmian) a lot, think once every month at least. This is one of my favorite dishes and I have never seen such a disastrously made one. The sauce looked almost sad, as if they didn't put enough fermented bean paste into it and replaced whatever they did not put in with corn starch instead. The sauce did not have the right consistency, tasteless, and not even close to being salty enough. When you fry the fermented bean paste, you are supposed to make it more flavorful, not less. I would have preferred to go next door to one of the supermarkets in the area, buy a packet of fermented bean paste and put it on my carbs.  I could not finish it - I took four bites and then took personal offence from the dish.  The dumplings looked, and tasted like, they were store bought frozen dumplings. The dumpling skin was 100% mass manufactured, not hand rolled. When you look at the filling, they are placed perfectly center of each dumpling. I actually finished the dumplings because I usually eat frozen dumplings anyways - but I could have saved $8.00 if I did."}
{"text":"This Nak Won location is the better one compared to the first Markham place location. I noticed the main difference here is food and service. First off.. This location serves purple rice with everything, the Markham location only offers steamed white rice.. The service at this location is also better, possibly because there is usually less traffic (though it does get busy on the weekends).   The spicy pork sizzling plate is my favourite..and it comes with a bowl of purple rice!   Nak won always offers a large selection of bottomless cold dishes with every meal such as pickled radish, fish cake, Kim chi, etc!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends and the lunch menu is a great value! So many appetizers that also come in a large portion. Don't let the prices fool you, it's a good value overall! Today, I went for dinner today because lunch was good. The KIMCHI.. oh my God. It was the worst tasting kimchi I ever had. My friend thinks it was actually rancid and spit it out. The cucumber which is usually my favourite Korean appetizer was also disgusting. It didn't even look good. The sauce was all vinegar and there were only 4 slices of cucumber on the large plate. The actual stew that my friend and I got were pretty good. Also enjoy the purple steamed rice. Overall, I think the food is okay for the price paid. The restaurant looks quite fancy inside and has a lot of seating. Despite the outward appearance, the washrooms were among the worst I've been in."}
{"text":"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. So if you come in with a group, specially the weekends, don't expect to be treated well. You have to do everything they're supposed to do - from writing down your order to summing up your bill total. And they expect to get a tip from their shitty service.   Never really had an extremely disappointing encounter until about two weeks ago when a group of my friends went out for dinner. They were very dismissive of our presence - gave us a pen and paper to write our order down and got mad at us for asking for the bare necessities - water, utensils and extra napkins.   We ignored it because it was a cheap place so we didnt expect much. But when they gave my boyfriend his order- the friend mackerel, gamjatang and steamed rice set, he complained to me that something did not smell right. It turned out to be the fish. When he touched it, it was not hot as a matter of fact, they served him a raw fish!!!! And when I went to go complain the server seemed mad that I even complained.   After this incident I dont think I will ever come back here. Disgusting and rude staff. Stay away from here!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow but the food was very good. I always get the beef dolsot bibimbap. During a cold day it's comfort food and hits the spot."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with a friend on her recommendation. She ordered the pork bone soup and I got the bibimbap. She let me try her soup which was great! My dish was cold which I didn't expect, but still thought it was good. I think I'll try it in the hot stone dish next time. The table sides were good too.   Service was a little slow, but it was ok since we had time to catch up. I'd go there again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, so I was excited to see the signage for this popular chain restaurant overtaking a somewhat cursed corner of a plaza right across the street from Mississauga Chinatown!  4/5 Service - pretty good, answered all our multitude of questions, came promptly after we pressed the button, brought extra sides - even pancake that was on the house, understood English  Food - Rating depends on what you ordered.  Bimbimbap looked good, but Seafood Stew (w/ Soju combo) was soo heavily MSG/salted, we couldn't finish it.  Even though it was a stew, my mouth was instantly dry eating it, and that was followed by lotsa water.  And trust me, stew was $40 with prawn, clams, mussels left in it, I would've definitely finished it if it was edible!  Menu - Half the apps weren't available.  I wanted to order KFC (Korean fried chicken) from the back page entitled, \"Night Menu\", but waitress said that that was AFTER 10pm but there was absolutely no indication on the menu.  Overall, clarifications need to be made on the menu.  If something isn't available, REMOVE IT.  If KFC isn't served until after 10PM, indicate it.  I would go back again to try other items on the menu, but I would be very hesitant in checking out the stews or anything else that can be overdone with sodium."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night for dinner with a couple of friends for AYCE KBBQ (seemed like a pretty good idea on a cold winter night).  To be honest, nothing really stood out for me. We ordered all the meats and veggies - it was all... meh. Not great, not horrible. I wish I had more to say - but unfortunately I just don't.  Service wasn't that great. It wasn't even busy, so I don't really understand why half of the things we asked for never arrived. We had asked for rice and water numerous times, it never arrived. We asked to have our gas refilled, it took them over 10 minutes (my friends were tempted to just go grab a can and change it themselves - cause the table with the gas containers were right next to us).  Then when we asked for more lettuce (there were 5 of us, and so far we only had 4 plates of lettuce), they told us that they will start charging extra for lettuce. I mean, it's an all you can eat place, we ordered a ton of pork belly which they didn't charge for it.  I don't think we will be going to Nakwon for KBBQ anytime in the future.. so the hunt for a good KBBQ place continues!"}
{"text":"I came here twice, and asked for a bibimbap and both of the times, the food was really good, there is a lot of side dishes and I loved the kimchi bibimbap but I didn't felt very welcome there.   (Pic of a vegetable bibimbap without meet)"}
{"text":"They change the menu recently, the price were risen maybe 20%. The waitress was still ignoring any guest as usual."}
{"text":"I like the kalbitang (beef rib soup) a lot. Service is fast (though the table beeper can get annoying), just try not to go when it's super busy."}
{"text":"Good yuk-kae-jang.  The last time I was there, the panchan looked a bit tired and wilted.  Don't expect overly friendly service."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place. But lately it seems they have been lacking a bit in terms of food quality.   We ordered the sweet & sour chicken. The dish was $ 18.99 but most of it was batter and fat. Very little chicken...I would not recommend ordering this ever.   I had the spicy tofu seafood soup (came w/ rice). Always consistent and tasty. Though I wouldn't mind more spice to it.   The thing I love most is that they give you lots of appetizers. More than any from around the neighbourhood. You can always ask for more, though at this location, they are stingy with the sweet potato.   Service is fast."}
{"text":"I love the appetizers they give us here without charge. The food is pretty good too but thats because its loaded with MSG. The worst thing about this restaurant is the service. Their staff is HORRIBLE. They are rude and impolite. They always act like they want us out of the restaurant asap."}
{"text":"There are so many Korean food options when you are on Yonge so I wouldn't pick here as a first choice. Overall, food is ok here but service was really its downfall.  We ordered a set dinner for 6 for the BBQ along with a few other items on the menu. All of our food came pretty quickly initially but any sort of follow up was near impossible to get. Tables have the buttons for service but no matter how many times you press it no one will come (it was not broken lol).  We tried asking for more of the appetizers (Kim chi, pickled celery, bean sprouts) and the waitress kept forgetting. We asked a total of 4 times and still never got it! We just gave up.   Maybe I'll give them another chance down the road as the food was OK but if I end up with the same experience again, definitely not."}
{"text":"Use to be a regular here but prices have gone up and the side dishes have had less items be available over the years.  Isn't a place for relaxing and taking your time as they depend on high turnover and will rush you out the door.  However the food is decent and still at decent prices, great for fast eating at a good price.  There is usually a line during busy times so try to get ahead of the crowd."}
{"text":"We've been going to NakWon for over three years at the Yonge/Finch location (North York). In a row of small Korean places, this one stands out as always busy and relatively clean and welcoming. The dishes are inexpensive and the food is tasty. It takes the waitresses a while to warm up to you as a repeat customer, but all in all the service if prompt, but no smiles are offered. Plus this place is open till late at night, so if you have a craving for Korean food, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Food is good. Many side dishes. They have the button which is easy to call the server over."}
{"text":"-Pork Bone soup is ok -Side dishes are good and kimchi is nice and spicy  -Staff are not very attentive"}
{"text":"ehhh not bad - 2.5. but not really good, and some of their prices are too high for what you actually get.  ex. some of those $30 hot pots... there's really nothing much in there and no real special soup taste.   I doubt I would really come here again by my own choice since there's a whole bunch of better cheaper options in the yonge/finch area."}
{"text":"Super slooooow service and loud trollies! Servers don't pay attention to your needs. Would never come back!"}
{"text":"good food and atmosphere. though I think they have problems with their heating/air conditioning. it's always very hot. I usually order the kalbi beef which is my favourite."}
{"text":"The sides and food cost is what keeps me coming back.   There are many to choose from in this Korean area.  However, the food is pretty good here.  The service I can do without."}
{"text":"Poor service + so-so food = Won't be back.  So we were a group of 6 and decided to eat closer to home this time as we normally would go to K-area in North York.  We ordered the regular pork bone soup, dolsot bimbimbap, soon tofu, and the cod soup.  The pork bone soup was thin and missing some flavor.  Soon Tofu soup was a bit better.  Bimbimbap was not crackling or smoking when it came out  so the rice did not crisp up like how it's use to.  The best was the cod soup (non spicy) which had great fish and clean taste but for $14.99 I find it was an expensive soup.  The ban chan was nothing special compared with some other Korean resto's I've been to.  They had some pickled celery ends (first for me), spicy potatoes, kim chi, jape che, and the spicy tofu.  Later I noticed another table had some bean sprouts and had to ask for it.  Service was choppy and almost non-existent.  Luckily you have the button of power and can summon them when you need something.  Overall, I would drive another 15 mins and go elsewhere as there's so much better Korean places in and around GTA."}
{"text":"Right at the intersection of Yonge and Finch, this place gets a lot of traffic. However I have to say compared to the other food options in the area, the restaurant doesn't really stand out to be a must-go. I've been there a couple of times and overall the food is not bad. Portions are good and service is decent in shop. However some of the server's don't speak English very well, and I had a hard time ordering  over the phone with them on several occasions. They have also forgotten the rice in my takeout when I ordered a dish that came with rice on the side. When I called to ask if I was supposed to have the rice in my takeout they apologized right away and said they'd give me the rice next time I come in. I appreciate their apology, but they didn't keep track of who I am and it is also weird for me to go back and ask for extra bowl of rice that they forgot to give last time haha. Overall it's not a bad place to eat if I were recommend to friends, but there are definitely much better options I would recommend nearby, and probably would only go in if the other restaurants nearby are packed."}
{"text":"Hey people I've been to this sport for the first time and I must say I love it private boots love the Service I meet with the owner of the spot and he was so nice I recommend this spot to everyone my experience for the first time is 10/10"}
{"text":"Ok food... A little bit salty and spicy... But a lot of side dishes... Worth the price..."}
{"text":"There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad at all.  Service was good, food was good. I wish I knew more about Korean food to rate and compare it to other places, I ate a spicy soup with noodles of which I cant remember the name.   Super close to my home away from home so I will be back again."}
{"text":"This area has lots of Korean restaurants with similar menu items and the all you can eat side dishes. For me, when you are serving something you basically can't alter, you have to have the 'wow' factor and this place just does not have that. I ordered the Spicy Korean Kimchee beef stew and while it was spicy it was more like a pho soup than  a stew. It was was watered down and contained very little beef (I have had this dish before at other Korean Restaurants, and they were much more generous with the meat portions). The restaurant itself was clean though,  but the service was also below par (once again, other similar Korean restaurants I have gone to are quick to refill empty side dish plates and you tea, where as in this place you had to chase down your server) With so many other Korean options in this neighborhood (all very similar in pricing) this is one establishment you may want to avoid."}
{"text":"Its a highly corian place. But the foos is pretty damn good. Dont get any of the individual means... it's not much food. But the bigger stuff is a lot of food. Decently priced for what you want. And again pretty good food."}
{"text":"My family and I love getting the opportunity for an AYCE Korean BBQ luncheon or dinner when we can so we were happy to stumble across Nak Won yesterday. It wasn't too busy and two waitresses gave us lots of attention and help. I appreciated the waitress removing and replacing the grill with a fresh one when our first serving of meat got stuck to the table grill. They haven't done that at other Korean restaurants I've been to. Our waitress also brought a big pair of cooking shears and snipped the grilled meat into smaller bite size pieces for us which is a great idea. The kalbi and bulgogi were the best I have ever had, tender and flavourful. This was our first time having pork belly and spicy pork belly (call it thick bacon slices and you'll know pretty well what you're getting) and we really enjoyed them. The BBQ AYCE comes with purple rice and either miso or pork bone stew. It was our first time trying the pork bone stew which my daughter and I found rather bland but my husband enjoyed immensely. Everyone has different tastes, let's face it, so if we come here again, which we definitely will, two of us will have the miso instead. The cost of the meal is $29.99 each which is in line with what we usually pay for AYCE sushi. The thing I will remember most is our two cheerful laughing waitresses at Nak Won who were so helpful."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Korean restaurant where they give you an attitude about side dishes. For as long as I've been eating at Korean restaurants I've always got unlimited side dishes, I've never once in my life got bitchy and shitty attitude from a waitress about the fact that they won't make a profit if I keep asking for side dishes. What the heck is that! I will never come back to this location, which is a shame because I like this franchise."}
{"text":"I really enjoy dining in Nak Won, the service sucks sometimes but the food makes up for it for sure. I think everyone in North York knows about their gamjatang, which is hot and delicious. The side dishes come in a great variety and are very tasty. They are open until 2am so if you feel hungry in the middle of the night that's the place to go. Me and my friend always manage to get our tummies full for under 20 backs. Long live Nak Won!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the food was okay and not terrible. However, I have never in my life experienced such bad service. The waitresses were all uninterested, rude and annoyed, they ignored us multiple times when we asked for them, and when we asked to pay separately, they sucked their teeth at us. Because of the terrible service, we didn't tip them a lot which resulted in them swearing in Korean under their breath. Overall, we had a terrible experience here and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Bad food, expensive (much of our $55 bbq kalbi was bone and sinew), and mandatory tip for extremely bad service.  And they misled us to think the set meals are all-you-can-eat.  Set meal for limited meat for $55!!  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"great food and service! the price is reasonable and good portion. Came here for kbbq and honestly think that it's one of the best korean restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"On Nak Won's website, it claims that it is supposed to have opened on July 4th. I still recall some time early August, I walked by this location and it was not opened. I have a tweet to prove it.  When my friend and I walked by today, we discovered that it was opened and so we popped in to try it out. There were a lot less people than I expected. Only half of the restaurant was full on a Wednesday evening around 6pm. It got busier was we were leaving at 7:30, but it wasn't full.  The prices are similar to uptown prices. All the soups (tang), including pork bone soup is 6.99. We got a tofu seafood soup with rice. A bit bland  The beef short ribs on rice (gal bi) was 12.99. The portion was generous and it was VERY delicious. About 12 large pieces.  The spicy rice cake with instant noodle was also delicious. For about 10.99 (?) I think. The texture for the instant noodle really complements that chewy rice cake.   The best part about nak won, no doubt, is its bountiful side dishes. there must have been about 8: jap chae, sweet potato, kimchi,  bean sprout, SEAWEED, daikon, fish cake were the ones I tried...I can't remember the other one.    The total for the two of us was $36 after tax and tips.   I liked that they have a bell on the table, even though this restaurant is probably a quarter of the size of the one in markham."}
{"text":"(1.5 stars)   Unbelievable... How can this restaurant operate with ONLY 2 WAITRESS?? The issue with that? Well, you constantly get ignored- there were already few  people left because they were being served. Your orders were forgotten, and being treated differently. That's right, it seemed like the waitresses treat their own people/ Korean better than foreigners. My mother and me told them we were here for the AYCE, we got seated at the tables in the middle, where Koreans get the booths. We both thought that we would get lettuce wrap as well (since it was offered at the Markham location) but nope, only Koreans got it. We asked to have the grill changed, the waitress used MY TONG to assist the changing.... That's very unsanitary.... Oh the best part? Communication issue. We asked to only have zucchini and mushrooms for the vegetable, you could tell the waitress was puzzled by what we just said. She said to give her one minute, came back with the menu and ask to point to her.... Seriously? The menu only said VEGETABLES but we only wanted 2 things in the order....  I would definitely not come back again for dinner... Only for lunch"}
{"text":"I'm in this area often, but I do remember coming to the former Chung Gi Wa here very often years ago.  Unfortunately, after a ton of management changes, and finally, the transformation into Koko Fusion Restaurant, the quality of food went downhill completely.  This was also evident in the fact that the unit was bare bones empty.  Now, I'm glad a liable tenant has finally arrived to attempt to revive this gem of a unit.    With renovations to make this unit a full Korean restaurant rather than the Sushi + Korean/Chinese Food layout Chung Gi Wa had; everything form the decor to the menu has been revamped.  The menu resembles one you would find at Owl of Minerva, however the atmosphere is much more upscale and serene reflected through the slightly higher menu prices as well.  Upon entering, we were greeted in Korean by maybe 3 people, who to be honest, were a bit frazzled at the sight of customers.  However, I'll just pass this on as a new biz flaw, and one that can be easily fixed.  Regardless, everyone was friendly.  Also, unlike Owl of Minerva, there are little buttons on the tables to make it easier to call your waiter/waitress.  Our waitress seemed to have a little bit of trouble understanding english, but charades is a game I'm good at anyways.    In terms of actual food, we ordered the Budae Jjigae which was amazing.  I've had it before at other places nearby but this place definitely did it much better.  Despite being hard to mess up since it's essentially ramen with hotdogs, spam, veggies, etc,, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this dish.   Overall, I really hope this business does well in what seems to be a cursed unit.  The former Chung Gi Wa was extremely missed when it closed, and this definitely made up for it, unlike the previous management and tenants.  I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"My cousin recommended this restaurant since a long time and I finally had the chance to try it myself. Since I love spicy food, I asked the waiter to put extra chili in my pork bone soup and it was really great! My friend took the kimchi bibimbap and she liked it. The highlight at Nak Won is the ocean of side dishes, they are actually really good and are complimentary. I find the portion very big for the price I paid, but apparently it was even cheaper in the past. I think that I would love to come back next time if I come to North York!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and brought my friends here to try it as well. The bimbimbap is really good, I like the amount they give. Dukbokki was always made deliciously, jajamyeon was tasty as well. The waiter gave my friend and I an extra bowl of rice on the side, I found that really nice but we couldn't even finish our food haha. Side dishes are good, my favorite has to be the potatoes! I usually come here during lunch and they have good lunch specials (bento boxes, soups, etc). The amount of times I've been here, I was never disappointed as this is easily one of my favorite Korean restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We were waiting to be seated at the entrance and not even once did any of the waitresses acknowledged me and my friend's presence. A group of Korean people walked in half an hour after us and they were immediately asked where would they like to sit. I boldly told the waitress that we arrived way before them and we were finally given a seat. There's a red button on the table to call for service. A young waitress would come to our table and tell us that she will be right back every time we asked something about the menu options. We wasted a whole hour until they finally took our order. the kim chi soup has tofu, pieces of meat and is very spicy. The chicken came already cooked with the vegetables and all we did was stir it occasionally for it not to burn.    To summarize: delicious food with crappy service"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick bite, but don't expect much.  This is one of the lower-end cheap korean eats in the ynf area.  The service is mediocre (usually quite slow) but the apps are plentiful and the prices cheap.   The food is edible but not great - the jajangmyeon tastes super watery and bland, the kamjatang is really oily and also bland...basically the food here is bland and tastes cheaply made, but edible for a quick meal or for an after-drinking binge.   Since competing restaurants in the area have only slightly higher prices, I would opt for one of those instead if possible. You can get a meal 100X better at Owl or elsewhere for only a slightly higher bill, plus the service is better.  Only go here if you've just left twister drunk and starving. Or if you are too lazy to walk anywhere farther."}
{"text":"Conviently located right at Yonge and Finch. TTC accessible and the food is very affordable.   I've had their pork bone soup and it was delicious.  The portion was surprisingly big for such a low value. The soup is loaded with pork bones and it felt like it was an endless journey just trying to finish it!  It comes with white rice and complimentary side dishes (jap chae, potato, sweet beans, lettuce,  seawood, pieces of fish, kimchi and bean sprout). Definitely one of my favourite places to go for pork bone soup!   I've also tried their Rice Cakes with ramen (not spicy) and it was too sweet for my liking. It tastes like pretty much how it looks. Not the best dish but definitely a gokd value for the amount served. It was only $8.99!  I've read many reviews about this place having unexceptional service but for all the times I've been here it was exceptional. (Perhaps the times I do go, the restaurant is not at its prime). Anyway, the staff was attentive and friendly.  There's also a button at every table to request for service instead of waving at them to get their attention.  It's very convenient and once service is requested, you'll be attended immediately if not, almost immediately."}
{"text":"The plastic food display outside the restaurant was what drew me to Nak Won. The place is spacious and clean. Even though there was only 1 waiter, he got me seated and served hot tea and the menu right away. After I placed my order, I was presented with 6 side dishes and a bowl of purple rice. My favouite side dishes were the kimchi (not salty at all and had the right amount of heat) and the fish cake cut into strips. I ordered the pork bone soup and the lunch special price was $7.99! The stone pot came out piping hot and the soup was bubbling and emitting the fragrant pork bone goodness. The meat fell off the bone without much effort and there was only one small potatoe (unlike some other places that uses big pieces of potatoes to fill up the pot). I barely finished the pork bone and the soup, because you have to finish all the soup down to the last drop! I am now struggling to stay awake at my desk after my tummy has been filled with that delicious and hearty meal. They also serve Japanese bento boxes too - maybe I'll try their tempura next time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 4 years and it's one of my go-to spots for Korean food. The restaurant isn't upscale or fancy but the quality of their food is always consistent and prices are very affordable - stews under $10 and korean BBQ for 2 which includes 4 meats, 1 stew, 2 bowls of rice, banchan with free refills and 2 free drinks for $50. Service is also great - our waiter cooked everything for us and he was very friendly / had a great attitude. Will continue to frequent this spot for my Korean fix :)."}
{"text":"There must be  reasons that I have not yet visited Nak Won until a Yelp gathering.  Small and cramped without any ventilation. I smell like Pork Bone Soup after eating here and even my phone smell like that too! Good if guys thinks that smelling like meat is sexy, maybe my dog would think so?!  If the food is excellent, I would have been OK. But the Pork Bone Soup Table Cooking for 2 ($19.99) is just OK. Taste is just one dimensional: saltiness! I had better for sure. The banchan are run of the mills.   If the service is good, I would have been OK. But service here is non existent. Especially if you are seated in one of the private booth. Why bother to have the bell? I just want to ring it till one of the waitresses comes in and yell at me so I can have some services!  There are so many other Korean restaurants around the area with similar quality of food but services are much better, seating a lot more comfy. The only thing that save Nak Won is the location, right next to Finch Station. But I am willing to walk a mile just to have better food!  7/15"}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner at Nak Won a couple of time since my first review.  Sadly, the quality of food has been going down hill and with the latest price increase, I don't think I will be coming back.  Yesterday night, the 2 soups we ordered were just bad.  Pork and Kimchi Stew (DwaejiGogi Kimchi Jjigae) tasted like tomato soup!    Korean Beef Short Rib Stew (Galbi Jjim) was so overly sweet and has the consistency and taste of Chunk Sirloin Beef Stew.   It was bad..........."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am going to have to give this a 2 out of 5 which is disappointing as I am a huge fan of the Nak Won on Yonge street. My Fiancee and I were exploring the Chinatown area downtown when we noticed the Nak Won and decided to go in, rather than walking up to Koreatown to eat. The first big difference was simply the decoration of the actual inside - the Yonge street restaurant is much nicer inside.   The restaurant was quite busy and there were only 2 girls to take care of about 12 groups - they really needed to have 3 people on today (it was a Sunday Evening). The first issue came with our order. They brought us the wrong meat combination (bacon rather than sirloin) and they brought the wrong soup. Of course, they corrected this, but still it is annoying to have both items wrong. Also, when I asked them for a soda, they simply forgot about it. I had to ask again about 7 or 8 minutes later.   On a positive note, the food was fairly good (what I expected) and our server was helpful in getting us what we ordered, but we could see that she was obviously new. Given the lack of staff, the fact that the overall atmosphere is less \"Korean\" and its location, I don't forsee that we will return to this branch again hence the 2 out of 5 service. I highly recommend the one on Yonge street though."}
{"text":"After recently moving to Toronto, this was the first Korean restaurant me and my fiancee tried - there was a lot at stake as I had promised her the Korean food here in Canada would be authentic which she never believed... Well Nak Won delivered the goods and the nagging has stopped! In fact, we were back again the next day for to order up another one of their lunch specials.   Everything we have ordered here was very good, the place is tidy and nice inside and it is busy during lunchtime for a reason and full of Koreans (always a great sign)... The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the service which is acceptable - more smiles would be nice, but hey, when the food is this good, you can live without it!"}
{"text":"Nak Won is a place I go often. Reason for that is because they have A LOT of side dishes( u can refill it as many times as u want) and for their reasonable prices!   One thing that makes it an *A-OK.* ranking is because of their customer service attitude. When you go during rush hour, the service there are not as good. Maybe because they wont have enough waitress. Anyhow, its still a place of good food and great value."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that there's so many bad reviews for this place. My boyfriend and I come here at least once a month. Nak Won is a good standard place to go (other than the FMP location that place is really gross). They give you tons of side dishes with unlimited refills, and they have a large menu which I can appreciate, as it's probably a nightmare for them to deal with in the kitchen.  We're pretty boring and order the same food everytime, but we're usually happy with these ones: Soft tofu soup, jajangmyun, and the ttukbaegi bulgogi soup (so good...). The food isn't AMAZING -  there's tons of places that specialize in certain dishes and it'll definitely taste better there, but Nak Won is a great place to go when you're hungry but you're not quite sure what you feel like eating."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 2 years almost once a month for lunch with my coworkers. Food is consistently good, and service is quick and courteous. There was a time period where service was god awful so we boycotted it for a while but we couldn't resist the lunch special gamjatang - at 7.99+unlimited sides you can't go wrong! Now that the service is good again we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went to Nak Won for lunch recently & found that everything seemed generally a little worse than when I last reviewed it.  Side dishes are not quite as tasty as they used to be.   Kalbi seemed overcooked and not as tasty.  Pork bone soup (Gamjatang) was okay.  Service is not great. It's still difficult to get a server's attention, but when I was there last, it seemed like they were deliberately ignoring us. When we got service, it was curt and bordering on rude."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying this Nak Won location. It took about 30 minutes to get our side dishes and an hour to get our meal. The table behind us left and didn't get cleaned until 30 minutes later and table in front of us started to serve themselves in terms of getting water and cups.   When the food got here, I was really impressed with the portion of my jajangmyun which cost 7.99.   The service could have been slow due to low staff or because it's Saturday night but still not acceptable. They have a call button at each table but don't bother pressing it because they don't pay attention to it."}
{"text":"I came here this week with a group of 5 other co-workers and we were seated very quickly. There are many tables that can seat 2-4, but not that many that can seat a larger group. Our table had a door bell on it so that we can get the waiter's attention, but thankfully we never had to use it.  The menu is pretty large. The first thing we noticed was that it had a bit of weight to it. I immediately knew what I wanted -- the pork bone soup ($7.99). After a bit of wait, the wait staff brought over some of the appetizers, chopsticks, and a napkin. Unfortunately they didn't bring any plates, so everyone waited until our lunch was served.  The pork bone soup was very good (I've only had it 3 times ever), and it was way better than the PBS at the Owl of Minerva just across the street. There were two large pieces of bone with plenty of meat on it. It comes with a small bowl of rice. I wish there was more rice, since there was a lot of soup. It's definitely salty, but not overly so.  I'll definitely have to give the other dishes a try, but so far Nak Won is my favorite place for PBS."}
{"text":"I've been to Nak Won in downtown Toronto a few times, but haven't been to this location. It's different from the downtown location in that this one offers table Korean BBQ for $30/person. We came here on a Friday night on a friend's craving.  Besides the plethora of banchan, we also ordered a pork bone soup for the table. The pork was soft and tender and the soup was spicy, as it should be. For Korean BBQ, we ordered everything except for the pork belly or spicy pork belly. The LA Kalbi was tasty, but was difficult to consume since we didn't have knives or forks. The slices were quite thick. The bulgogi was the favorite of the evening. Easy to cook and consume, soft, and marinated perfectly. The chicken was tasty as well, but took longer to cook. The squid was huge. It was tasty, but somewhat difficult to cook since it has a tendency to curl. The shrimp were easy to cook, but difficult to peel. The beef brisket was also excellent, but due to its thinness, has a tendency to overcook if you're not observing it.  Overall, I thought the food quality was excellent. Everything was marinated perfectly. Service was really good. The only downside was that they cleaned the floors during dinner service, so you can smell the cleaning chemicals in the air."}
{"text":"I was here on another occasion years ago - like 4 or 5? but I forgot what food was like and felt I wanted to revisit.  The choice is good but prices are a bit higher than in many Koreatown places :) I decided on ricecake and bulgogi in mild sauce. I was brought appetizers and tea but not water. Shortly I got my food and the portion was plentiful but it was spicy although I said mild. From what the waitress was saying, its always spicy but mild spicy or spicy spicy? I said they could just get rid of the sauce and put soy sauce instead but I think I got the dish re-made which was nice. Soy sauce was weak and bulgogi lacked some in flavour and texture. Ricecake and veggies were good. There was also an egg which I liked. All in all 2.5/5, if prices were a bit lower I would consider going back. this way, unsure."}
{"text":"Their rice cake  and ramen is very good. The side dishes were delicious and they were free. The only downside is the amount of food you get. Other than that the food is very good and the area is very spacious. I would recommend if you are looking for something spicy."}
{"text":"If i could i would of gave 0 stars. First and foremost the food was terrible. I love kalbi tang, but the meat was so dried it can be beef jerky. After i paid my bill, i realized they made a mistake so i asked them to recalculate, which they did and as i was walking out the door the woman who got me the change was swearing at me in korean..."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I come here at least twice a month, every time time I come here I get the kimchi jjigae. Altogether this place is pretty inexpensive. Service isn't amazing but isn't horrible, waitresses are fluent in Korean and Mandarin! 1 or 2 of the waitresses are fluent in English the rest have a basic understanding.   OVERALL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place is the best for lunch. I spent many hours of ttc to travel here and eat their appetizers and kalbi beef. Today I was being brave to venture outside the lunch menu and into new hidden territory.   Seafood pancakes have been staple in many Korean restaurants. However, this one was practically oily and the seafood assortment was limited.   The service and appetizers are the redeeming factor. I guess I should stick to the kalbi beef."}
{"text":"The quality of the mean is excellent. Marbling and juicy. Try the spicy pork and tofu soup.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love their lunch combos, very affordable given the portion sizes and variety.  Comes with free appetizers where you can refill it 4 of them free of charge one time.  Their dinner items are definitely more expensive than the typical korean restaurants I've been to on Yonge/Finch or Bloor. Overall great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Good food. Expensive compared to other authentic korean restaurants. 300$ for 7 people. Service was okay. They just gave us boxes to put away our doggie bags instead of actually doing it for us. I would expect to do my own in cheaper restaurants but not when I am paying a 60$ tip! I had asked one waitress to put away the soup to make more room on the table and she simply refused. What?! But they were good in changing the grill plate often. Overall just ok."}
{"text":"As long as it's not busy, Nakwon is the place for average, Korean comfort food. I've always liked their side dishes, most especially the kimchi. Don't expect the best service though during peak hours. Otherwise, I was quite impressed that the lady staff speak English, Korean and even Mandarin."}
{"text":"I recommend the shop because these foods were so tasty!! The price was expensive for me, but there was enough value to eat, although I'm a binge eater. In addition, side dishes were free! I was glad to hear that and I asked for refills. I had a great time on my birthday!        Then, the location is very convenient. There is near by Finch Station and next to Yonge Street. If you want to eat Korean food with your friends or your family, you should go there!!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Nak Won has been my go-to Korean resto at Yonge & Finch for quite some time. Best pre-meal nibbles (i'm sure they have a real name, but they're called nibblies in my book!), great tempura and super tasty soups! Best on a cold or rainy day. LOVE!"}
{"text":"Hired one more server but service is not amazing. Just a heads up"}
{"text":"I came here on a friend's recommendation. Upon entering, the interior decoration is nice and gives a nice comfortable feel despite the tacky dish display store front. The waitress promptly seated us.  I ordered gamjatang while my friends had dukbokki and dak galbi tang.   Free sides with unlimited refills is always a plus.  The gamjatang came out boiling hot, the dak galbi tang sizzling and the dukbokki with sauce that was a bit thin.  The gamjatang was warm and spicy and the meat was plentiful along with the pork bones. It was really good but the only disappointing thing about it was the slightly undercooked potato that came with it. It seemed a bit lacking compared to the one from The Owl of MInerva but good nonetheless.  The dak galbi tang was seasoned nicely and the chicken was moist and tender.  The dukbokki was a very interesting dish since the rice cake thing was chewy and kinda sweet but at the same time mesmerizing to eat. My friend said the sauce was a  bit thin and didn't stick to the rice cake like the last time she had it.  The service was quick but lacked emotion and words. The waitresses were like robots who just did what you told them to. Could use a bit more customer interaction  The prices were fair but increased based on complexity/amount of  different things in your dish. It was a bit weird seeing so much variation on pricing for dishes which are sorta similar to each other save slight changes.  When it came to checkout time and we wanted to get separate bills but they told us we had to go into the back to do so. We went to the back and told the cashier what we ordered while she stared intently at the tip. Kinda weird.  Upon inspection of the back room, I feel like there might have been some minor health code violations.  Overall it looks like a nice place but nothing really popped out at me. If my friends feel like going, I'll go but this is not a place I'd visit of my own volition. 2.5/5 rounded up to 3/5"}
