{"text":"Simply Best Chinese BBQ place in GTA. I have been eating here for the past 10 years. Price is good and food is good"}
{"text":"This unassuming little Chinese BBQ place, located in the \"food mall\" of this Asian plaza, offers some of the best bbq roast pork and duck in the GTA. Perfect crisp on the pork skin. Cheap prices and generous portions, and every rice combo comes with vegetables and a side of soup."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since 2000. They have  one of the best roast duck in TO and excellent roast pork with crispy skin and juicy succulent meat. But my biggest complaint with them of late is the small portion when ordering their combos.  They cut the roast pork so thin that its almost like bacon, you would need to have 2 orders to feel full. If they gave the same portion as Ho Ho BBQ (my favorite place for chinese bbq) I would give them 5 stars, so 3.5 stars because of cheap, small portions."}
{"text":"This is your standard chinese BBQ place. It's in a fairly old fading strip mall. There's 4 fast food stalls in this \"food court\". I got the soya sauce chicken on rice. Came to about $7, which I think is slightly higher than chinatown or FMP. Good portion size."}
{"text":"I've been on a hunt to replace my beloved Pink Hong since it moved up to Markham.  One lucky day, I was visiting Maple Yip in the same plaza to make a family dinner reservation when I happened to walk into the food court where LT is located.  

I was feeling particularly hungry for Chinese BBQ that day and decided to give them a try.  I ordered Char siu and soy sauce chicken as they were all out of their roast pork.  The char-siu was not too lean and perfectly juicy.  The sauce was the perfect honey-sweet to satisfy my craving.  The soy sauce chicken was the absolute best I've had with the meat (including the breast) being supremely juicy, moist and flavourful.  I was in love.  

A few months goes by and I've had a chance to try out their roast pork and duck as well.  Unfortunately the roast pork was not as good as the other BBQ items.  The skin was beautifully crispy but the meat was not as juicy as Pink Hong's.  The duck was also well seasoned and lovely.

Lung Tung will likely be my go to spot for Chinese BBQ take-out from now on until I find some place else that does a better roast pork."}
{"text":"One of the freshest, flavourful and authentic chinese bbq you can get and at a very decent price for the portions.  Been going to this place for over a decade and have never been disappointed ... other than tuesdays when the store is closed.  

If you do not know what to get, the store owner is very friendly and will provide suggestions and give you the nice cuts.  However, when in doubt, the 2 choices on rice is always a good start."}
{"text":"I ended up getting the BBQ duck with noodles I had doubts about this place since I had no idea it would be a food court. But all in all I did search a good place out and this place definitely didn't disappoint me especially if you have a huge soya sauce chicken craving or even BBQ duck. I'm not too sure about the BBQ pork but I'm sure it's fantastic too. Only one pointer if you're not into places that aren't too sanitary this will not be the place for you."}
{"text":"I tried this place after reading Yelp reviews. The place is located in a food court of a small mall, which was queit difficult to locate.

The food: I bought duck and pork BBQ with rice. The fine lady gave me soup and soya sauce along with it. The BBQ meat was crisp outside and juicy and tender towards  inside. I like the food they serve and the sevice was very friendly.

Its not a fancy place, Its not very clean kitchen but food is genuinely good and is served in large portions."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the reviews, and I think my hopes were too high. Food was just average (I ordered the roasted pork and barbeque duck rice). It wasn't especially good nor bad, but I've definitely had better. I wouldn't go out of my way to get Chinese BBQ here."}
{"text":"this is located in a dingey tiny food court in a hidden plaza .... surprisingly the parking lot is always full and you will likely have to park underground.  

most of the people here are coming to either Maple Yip restaurant.  or to one of the two dirty rub and tug places here...  i drove to the back looking for parking and saw them fanning out their \"white\" towels.   

anyways the food is below average .. the roast pork skin was not crispy at all.. hard and chewy like it was a day old.  The actual pork tasted good though.. but the skin was pure fail.   the roast duck skin was once again a fail.. soggy and not crispy.  and they charge 35 cents for green onion and ginger...

this food court cost more than the one closer to agincourt across the street.

i will likely never return."}
{"text":"Went over too get my BBQ fix again..got the Roast Duck and rice and Roast Pork for take out...Decent and filling as usual.  Did I mention I introduce this place too a good other friends of mines..and they all had positive reviews.."}
