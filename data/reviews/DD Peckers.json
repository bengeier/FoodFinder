{"text":"By far my favorite wing place. Don't let the strip mall exterior turn you off. This place has amazing wings at a decent price. Try the Hoisin Honey, my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Sure, it's Super Bowl Sunday, but taking the phone off the hook all afternoon is not cool.  Thought I would email you to let you know and your mailbox is full.  How do you get feedback from your customers?  I've been getting wings here for years and this was about all I could take.  Really???"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed tonight with my hot teriyaki wings. They were burned and had no flavor. I should have went with the hot gold, but I was in a different mood tonight. I am a huge wing fan afficianado, because its in the flavor. I am still hooked on Louisiana Lickers from Quaker Steak & Lube (there's 1 in Pineville now. Also Whooli's is a close 2nd with their Whooli's sauce. But since it was my 1st time tonight I will give it one more shot. :)"}
{"text":"Small wing joint hidden away in an older strip mall- but the food is great! Very popular with the football crowd and can get crowded on game nights. Lots of tvs and good viewing angles if you're there to watch. Service is quick and attentive and the wings cant be beat. I'm particularly a fan of the sampler platter (25 wings) as we like to mix and match flavors. I almost feel bad for not giving them the full 5-stars, but I have to knock one off for ambiance, as the place tends to be a little dingy and loud."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had in the Charlotte area hands down. Fried pickles aren't bad either. Great hangout spot for drinks, sports or food."}
{"text":"Awful. The lemon pepper wing sauce is black for some reason and it tastes like soy sauce. The fried pickles are mediocre at best. The pickle spear slides right out of the fried exterior leaving you with just a really hot pickle. It's a the very definition of a dive, lots of dank inside, bad music. It's an all around nightmare really"}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had, and their burgers are worth a mention as well! Everything always comes out tasting wonderful and fresh, I typically get a side salad instead of fries and I know it's silly to brag on a side salad but it's really tasty! Especially when compared to the sad excuses for side salads other places dump on my plate. They put genuine quality and effort into their food, right down to the sides, and I appreciate every bit of it!   Their wings are top notch, though it's hard to choose a flavor, Hot gold is my go-to at the moment! But I've never had a wing there that I didn't like!   They're a little more expensive when compared to franchised wing joints, but you're paying more for quality you can taste."}
{"text":"We've ordered wings here twice - to go, so I can't comment on the dining establishment itself. Wings are the main attraction, and thus I expect more than average. At best, the wings are decent, and a bit overpriced. Teriyaki and Gold are good. Cajun, Hoisin, Hot... very much over salted. In fact, most of the wings here are too salty. But the pièce de résistance? It's the customer service - namely, the guy who answers the phone. He's horrid. I know, it's the weekend, and you're busy. I don't expect small talk, or even a smile. Heck, I don't even mind curtness. But, I draw the line at snotty sarcasm. But hey... if snotty sarcasm whilst taking your order is your thing? Then DD Peckers is your spot. However, there are too many other great places for wings (I'm looking at you, Moosehead Grille)! Fool me once, shame on you and all that....."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of wings. This is the first place I visited for wings since I moved into Charlotte.  Great wings!! Variety of sources!! But this place is not family friendly environment I think. Some wings with teriyaki source was burnt from grill and my kids complained about that. Other than that, I like their wings. Probably I won't go there with my kids, but I will definitely repeat with my friends."}
{"text":"Being advertised as a wing place, i got the teryakki wings and they were very salty and not that good i would say.  The 3 stars are for the BBQ Bacon cheeseburger, very good beef and tastes good."}
{"text":"Like wings? Alcohol? Sports? Well, do ya??? Then do yourself a favor slappy... check out this hole in the wall!   Food - You will find your basic bar fare with a nice selection of wings including Blazing, Lemon Pepper, Hawaiian, Hot Gold, Hot Teriyaki and many more. If you're looking for a really crispy wing, then this may disappoint. But if you're looking for flavor they knock it out of the park. I have enjoyed pretty much everything I have ever ordered here. They also have good drink specials. And crushed ice!  My Staple: I usually get the buffalo chicken sandwich with the blazing sauce. It comes on a plain bun with shredded lettuce and tomato with ranch or bleu cheese on the side. (I go sans tomato)  It comes with seasoned crinkle cut fries.   Atmosphere: There are probably about 20 tables in this place so it can tend to be pretty packed if it's after work or there's a big game on TV. Decoration is pretty basic. The TV is usually tuned to sports and they have the NFL Sunday Ticket. When the games are on there is usually some fun banter between fans of opposing teams.  Service: The service isn't the speediest when busy but they are friendly and very accommodating.   Overall: A nice laid back place to grab a drink, catch a game and munch on some wings."}
{"text":"Off the hook wings!!!! Don't be scared... Order the sampler (25 wings) and get 5 different flavor a. ( there are 26 to choose from!) service is FAST and great!!! #thisplacerocks!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings.  We like the hot ranch variety but they are all good.  The wait staff is fast and nice.  They explain all the options. Get a basket of the home made potato chips! Yummmm..."}
{"text":"This place is a great dive. The wings are my favorite in Charlotte with a wonderfully-flavorful sauce and not too expensive. Don't expect great service though if there is a crowd."}
{"text":"Total dive but for wings in the Charlotte area - they don't get any better than the ones served @ this place. Plus, they have a Silver Strike bowling machine. Good times await ..."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall wing place! I enjoyed the wings because it was cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Honey hosin looked burnt but it wasn't, loved the taste of it! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte! Great drink specials as well as an excellent staff. Same crew has been working here for years so you know it's a good spot.   Can't really go wrong with any of the wing flavors; however, my favorite are Cajun and Lemon Pepper. (you have to try the Hot Gold though, it's their most popular I believe). When in doubt, go for the sampler! 25 wings, 5 different flavors.   Don't let the shopping center fool you. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Great wing joint. I went there with my Migos for lunch. We were all impressed with the food and attentive, friendly staff.  We're definitely adding it to the rotation."}
{"text":"Delicious wings and sauces are awesome! Atmosphere is a bit like a dive... The staff is extremely friendly and quick. A great lunch."}
{"text":"Hell yes...this place is outstanding for what it is...  The best wings in CLT and as one of my buddies once said, these folks know how to fry up some food.  Spicy onion rings are killer, homemade chips are fantastic.  I found Peckers just over two years ago on an exploratory trip when deciding if we were going to move to CLT.  I am not saying that eating there caused us to move but hell it did not hurt knowing wings like this would be in the neighborhood!  :-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best wangs I have ever put in my mouth. Great hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Horrible wings!  We tried the Hoisin Honey wings....HORRIBLE....the garlic parm wings....okay, and lemon pepper...less than average!  However, the onion rings were good.  Not sure what the hype is all about, but after eating the wings, both myself and my husband had tummy and headaches!  Will NOT be returning......EVER!"}
{"text":"Read the yelp reviews before going, thanks guys. The wings were crunchy, fresh, and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while in Charlotte after finding decent reviews for this place on Yelp.  I LOVE wings, and am always excited to try new places, especially one that offers so many flavors.  We ordered the 25 sampler wings, consisting of Mild, Hot Garlic, Hot BBQ, Cajun and Hot Gold. Somehow I didn't get the Hot Garlic and ended up with more Hot Gold. The Cajun was a dry rub and I liked it. The Hot Gold was a southern style BBQ which I didn't really care for. If you like BBQ sauce on your wings, try it. I don't....     My daughter got the Hot Garlic and she said they were okay. It looked like they dumped way too much actual minced garlic on top of them.  My daughter had the lemonade. She said she doesn't know what sewer water tastes like, but she was pretty sure this was it. The sodas were very seltzery.  Service was a little slow, but it was Saturday during dinner, and it was packed.  We all ended up with stomach pains that night, especially my wife who was up all night. I thought it to be a fluke, until I read other reviews below mentioning stomach pain.  I'm not sure if it was too much seltzer from the sodas or what, but it was enough that my wife won't let us go back.  I don't like judging places on one visit, and with the crowds, I'm assuming people getting sick isn't the norm. Give it a try. The wings are huge and if you live locally, I'm sure you'll end up finding your favorite sauce.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings and very friendly bartender. Wings and sauces are home made. If I'm ever back in the area I'll definitely be back at this place."}
{"text":"Best wings...loved their hot teryaki!  Small place and looks rough on the outside but inside was clean and service was good/friendly.  Lots of tvs and it was a comfortable environment.  Tried 5 different types of wings and all were excellent.  The chili cheese fries were good too.  All in all it was affordable good food."}
{"text":"D D Peckers' wing shack is a small family run wing spot hidden in Pineville, NC.   The fried pickle spears complimented with blue cheese dressing are an excellent companion to their arsenal of flavored chicken wings! Don't be discouraged by the tinted windows. D D's is great with awesome value."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles in town, and the wings are awesome, too. Super friendly staff. Don't be fooled by the low key appearance. Go inside and have some wings and good sweet tea, and belly up to the bar next to one of the biggest cocks I've seen around here :)"}
{"text":"I am a wing fan and I've been going here for years one of the better places in Pineville and in Ballantyne to get good wings. Parking can be bad but normally you find a spot right up front."}
{"text":"Oh man oh man oh man. If you know ANYTHING about wings, and you live in Charlotte, then you ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY MUST know about D.D. Peckers, and if you don't, then you will quickly learn the value of such a wonderful place.   This hole in the wall is a welcoming sort of place, despite it's surroundings. And by welcoming, I mean, roll-your-sleeves-up-grab-a-cold-one kind of welcoming. It is a hive for sports fans, trivia nerds, and wing aficionados alike.   Three flavors to go for- Blazing (if you are a spice fanatic), hot gold, and honey hot. It is so awesome to eat a non-Texas Pete soaked wing in a world full of them. They obviously make their own buffalo sauce, or if they don't, they stole nectar from the gods. Bangin' and I mean BANGIN flavors.  Ordered a side of fries, which were crispy and seasoned. Blue cheese is made in house, and it's thick and chunky and wonderful...also a hard feat to come by.   Just simply do yourself a favor and go. Don't dress up, don't use a fork and knife, you will get strange looks from people like me if you do! ;-)"}
{"text":"Great food and they have gotten better at their service! I always get large chilly cheese fries and Parmesan garlic wings that are cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Sold on the Gold - Hot Gold wings and the gold medal for the:   The Best wings in Charlotte...Best.  You don't have to ask for crispy they come out with the slight crisp and a solid amount of sauce.  Hot Gold - Best.  Drop the microphone.  I am here at 9:00 on a Friday and this place has been slammed for hours.  The difference maker vs. other solid wing places is that the staff and cooks have been here for years and years.  Great service too.."}
{"text":"Best wings ever... Try the hot gold delicious... The fried pickles and fried oysters aren't bad either...."}
{"text":"DD peckers had always been known for their wings. Their beer selection is lacking for sure. Also we waited 40 minutes for wings on a slower night. The wings tasted great and were fresh, but they charge way too much for wings when they aren't really that much better than any other wing joint in the area. I won't be going back any time soon other than for a beer."}
{"text":"The wings are very good for a great price.  I love the honey hot, better then most wing spots."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER!!!  We eat here almost once a week and if we skip a couple weeks we make it up by going 4 days in a row. I love the hot honey bbq and the garlic, my bf usually gets the hot gold, but we've had almost all the flavors and you really can't go wrong. We've also ate our way through their appetizer list and can't complain about any of them, good and greasy and the prefect starter to the main meal. Surprisingly their Veggie burger is amazing, like one of the best I've ever had.  Their daily domestic drink specials are on point and great for washing down the wings. Buy one of their koozies and you'll be set!  All the ladies who work are are awesome. They each have their own thing going and bring something unique to their service. It's not fake sugar coated generic niceties and that's what makes them awesome. They're genuine and that's appreciated.   This place can get packed esp during Carolina games and it may not be the hippest, classiest or shinest place but it is hands down my favorite wings/grab some beers place to go in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years.  I always get the sampler platter (25 wings/5 flavors) and sometimes the fried pickles.  The quality of the food is best when it's not too busy so get here before the panthers games."}
{"text":"If yur a pub sports bar food fan this is one of the best ! Food is great. Good craft beer selection only one problem. Small"}
{"text":"DD Peckers has AWESOME snack food:  Fried Pickle Spears, Wings, and Broccoli Cheese Balls/Fried Mushrooms.....Delish!!! We always get our food to go....so I can't comment on the Restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been going to Peckers for years, seriously, these are the best wings in Charlotte. My personal favorite are the Hoisin honey and garlic Parmesan. They come out hot, crunchy, and full of flavor. As others have said, the place is a hole in the wall, but that's part of its charm."}
{"text":"Great chicken flavors. Definitely a dive bar that I would go back to whenever I'm in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Great food but very busy on Monday nights. They charge $1.50 for Ranch and don't advertise the price of condiments or tell you - a bit surprising on the bill to see such a high amount for ranch (could understand .50 cents but $1.50???"}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's best hole-in-the wall restaurants I've tried. Located in a strip mall, it's a little hard to find this gem, but worth looking. Of course, their wings are great. Other than that it's typical bar food, but the chili is amazing if you want to try something new. Everything I've tried has been tasty. What keeps people returning is a locals bar atmosphere. A small staff that work hard is always something to admire and return for. I've been going here for the last few years and the same people are working, the food is still delicious, and the atmosphere hasn't changed. \"You wanna go where everyone knows your name\" kind of place."}
{"text":"Man......the staff was pleasant, attractive, tolerant,  (even as they were closing!)   The Fried Corn is KILLER! (n I'm orig fr Ohio!)  Overall very nice folks and good food!  (But Really Now; get some fried corn! You Can Thank me later!)  One nice bunch of folks even gave me a \"birthday cupcake\" as I was leaving! (Danka!)  Cool Joint!"}
{"text":"Awesome little dive for piping hot wings that are delicious. Great prices with just enough of a cozy atmosphere. Don't change a thing guys."}
{"text":"Absolute best wings in Charlotte!! My favorites are the hot honey BBQ and hot gold. I usually just do take out, but the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"this was a great random wing place! we decided to go here because the yelp reviews were stellar. it IS a smaller venue but not cramped at all, really comfortable and the atmosphere is relaxed. THE WINGS AND FRIED PICKLES WERE 10/10. we had the small platter (25 wings) which gives you 5 flavors (5 wings each flavor) honestly the best deal for two people. our server was so sweet and helpful with the menu since it was our first time! def can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place! I like it!  Came here with coworkers while on a work trip. When I saw the shopping center where this place was I was like \"really\"??? Boy was I in for a shock.  The place is small and if you're not paying attention you may pass but the wings are great! They come in all flavors and are plentiful.   We had some mild ones, sweet ones, and hot ones. They came out fresh and quickly by a very good and friendly wait staff.  When we left we were stuffed.  Also the bar had all types of beers for my coworkers.  More importantly the price was great... we had 25, beer, fries, liquor, and onion rings all for under $60. That alone will make me come back."}
{"text":"Best wings the wife and I have had in quite awhile. Staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We have been here few times and never in my life have I been in a place of business that blatantly targets a table of paying customers for their race and their heritage. A group of us sat, not bothering anyone, trying to have dinner, when we were attacked by the owner of the restaurant for being Asian. When we called him out on it, he just continued on. He even finished the night by saying \" I will be here next week but that table won't be.\" What a terrible waste of space."}
{"text":"These are the best wings I've had in charlotte. So glad to have found this hidden gem, it's in an uneventful strip mall and somewhere I'd never just decide to go to while driving by judging by the exterior but wow, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great wings, cool dive atmosphere loud and brash...nice experience. Service is meh....food comes out pretty quick, and beers are nice and cold. If the waitresses cared a little more I would consideration last star. The gold, hot and garlic Parmesan were all good...try the sampler if it's ur first time"}
{"text":"I've been all around the United state's  have tried many different  chicken wing joints this is by far the best one of them all. I had 10 pc hot wings with there onion rings and dipped into there hot ranch sauce it is hands down very very good. this place is a hidden gem I am telling you folks ."}
{"text":"After reading all of the great reviews, I decided to get a good amount of wings from d.d. Peckers for my friends and I. And I totally regret doing so. I ordered a variety of Blazing, Caribbean jerk, Hawaiian, and Teriyaki. ALL of the wings were burnt. The Blazing and Caribbean Jerk were edible, however I HAD to get my money back for the Hawaiian and Teriyaki. We only tried a couple pieces of which were totally flavorless and tasted like flavorless char. While getting my money back we were given a slight attitude and agreement that the wings were \"overcooked\". Overcooked is an understatement - every other piece was COMPLETELY black and totally inedible. I don't know what was wrong today versus the other days when these great reviews were submitted. I will not be going back and will tell everyone I know to stay away. Oh and in addition to this, the Blazing wings are also horrible. Their idea of making wings hotter is adding a huge amount of black pepper to the wings. Why not just add more red pepper to the buffalo sauce? It's beyond me."}
{"text":"Great hole the wall place to grab some wings and beers!  You can get 25 wings with 5 different flavors.  All are really good and good size wings too.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a dive but I can't say its not delicious. The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else. The fried zucchini is also awesome. Service and food is great but the atmosphere could use some work."}
{"text":"Great wings! A few months back, I wanted to try this place just to avoid getting food from the major wing joints. I ordered pick up and by the time I got there, it was ready and hot. Got home and it tasted so good, had to go over the bones at least once. So yes please check it out."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a really good wing joint in Charlotte since I moved here a year ago. We stopped by DD Peckers and they have a great sauce selection. We had the hot gold and hot ranch sauces which were both fantastic!  We also had a grilled salad and that was good too. Our server was really sweet and attentive. She forgot to grab us some extra sauce and was very apologetic but she was so busy. Also we had so much sauce on the wings we just added that to the salad. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soo this place isn't fancy but it makes for some great people watching (especially with the lovely Amy C ) and they have some damn good wings.   My favorite were the Honey Hot BBQ. Such great flavor on them!!! And you have to try the blue cheese dressing it's totally with it...and the calories associated with it! Ha!   I'm already looking forward to coming back...Wangs anyone?!?"}
{"text":"Spot-on wings for Charlotte.  I'm rarely on that side of town, but when I am I always try to stop through.  Ordered some take-out(but have eaten in many times) wings for watching football playoffs today.  Got hot-gold, every one of them.  Nice crunch, great flavor(mildly mustardy), with a good amount of heat.  The heat doesn't blow your doors off, sorry all you masochists out there.  Not extremely cheap, but you can't really find 25 cent wings anywhere anymore.  As far as the \"restaurant\" goes, its pretty much a dive bar in a strip mall.  Just telling it like it is."}
{"text":"Truly enjoy the food.  I understand that when we go there, we might not always get the fastest service as majority of times we're going during lunch HOWEVER we like the staff and again, the bar food is fabulous! Also a go-to for carryout (party) wing orders."}
{"text":"Wings were good but service always makes everything worse. The wings weren't spectacular I've had better else where. When I called in my order the guy sounded dry and upset that I was ordering. My order wasn't complex 10 wings and poppers. The jalapeño poppers weren't good wouldn't re order or suggest. When I got there my food was sitting in the middle of the bar no itemized receipt to even know what I actually paid per item....  he barely spoke to me I asked was it blue cheese dressing yes I know what I ordered but means nothing. Of course when I got home both sauces were blue cheese. I'll probably never return due to the service alone."}
{"text":"They have some of the best wings in Charlotte. It's a little hard to spot so keep your eyes open. But it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The BEST wings around!!! Great beer specials and the staff is outstanding. For a wing joint their burgers are VERY good as well"}
{"text":"I feel dirty just walking into this place. I decided to give it more than one shot since I know a few people who love it here, but not again. Also, not sure why people say their food is great... everything I've had from them tastes like rubber. The servers I've had have been nice though, I'll at least give DD's that."}
{"text":"Meh.  I checked this place out after reading the rave reviews on yelp and was pretty disappointed.  The service wasn't very good.  When we walked in, it took a good few minutes before someone even acknowledged us and told us to sit anywhere.  My husband and I went for the wing platter where you can get five wing flavors of five wings each.  We went with what we heard was good including the Hot Gold.  I will admit the Hot Gold was pretty good, but everything else was just mediocre.  I don't know that I would necessarily go back here with other wing joints closer to where I live, but I suppose I'd give it another whirl if I happen to be in the neighborhood.  Nothing to go out of your way for in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best wing place in Charlotte! I've been coming here since I was in HS and it's always great and consistent. All of the flavors are great; my favorites are the Hot Gold, Blazing and Honey Hot. Along with the wings, the fried pickles are fantastic. They serve them as spears vs the normal chips you see and you have to get the hot ranch as well. Ignore the fact that it's a divey or in a strip mall, the food is fantastic and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Wow. DD Peckers is a little diamond tucked away between Park Rd and Hwy 51. Stuck between other small shops and pubs, you'll want to find your way in, sooner rather than later, to try out this pub grub.   The wings. Man. Just the plain old mild are where it's at. Big wings with tons of sauce. The Hot Gold are like Carolina Mustard BBQ meets awesome and had a lovechild. Delicious.   The cheese fries are a little lackluster. Great fries. Seasoned well and crinkle cut. The cheese is just shredded cheese thrown on top. Not my favorite but does well in a pinch.   The fried pickles are dank. Huge spears and generously breaded. Go for a little ranch or bleu dipping action and you're set.   The inside is so quaint. Easy to feel right at home at the bar, one of the high-tops or a booth. Sink into the culture a bit more and come in for trivia or watch the game. Great people run this place and the product and atmosphere shine that fact forth gloriously.   Thanks, DD Peckers. You've got my vote!"}
{"text":"These are the best wings in Charlotte, hands down!!! We've lived here 22 years and have not found better! The southern fried wings with gravy, haven't found anything to compare them to!"}
{"text":"Great ranch, good wings.  Not five star because last time I got to go there was a hair in my food."}
{"text":"Service is good, prices are good and wing flavors are good. Try the fried goodies like mushrooms, or broccoli and cheese balls."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! My husband and I ordered the wings sampler that had 25 wings and 5 flavors. I definitely recommend the hot gold, garlic parm, and regular hot. I also ordered the spice onion rings as an appetizer and would order them again.   It's a small place within a strip mall with 10 to 15 tables max."}
{"text":"Despite the risqué title, this hole in the wall sports bar/wing joint is actually very tame and quaint.  No scantily clad wait staff, and it's family-friendly.   The wall is adorned with license plates, and an old school Frogger machine sits in one corner.    I ordered the hot wings and a side of house chips. The wings, as someone else described in a review, have a great balance of a light crunchy outside and are juicy inside.  I really wanted to try multiple flavors, but as many wings places are doing, they charge extra for multiple flavors, even in higher quantities (this makes no sense to me. - a sermon for a later time).  I did notice, though, that they do offers a sampler platter that discounts it a bit more.  The house chips are good and very salty, but were a bit limp. They have a very generous list of flavors for the wings too.  I only tried the hot, but I thought they were great.  I felt bad for the bartender/server here, as she was all by herself doing tables and running bar too.  Which, led to a little more empty glasses and a bit more waiting.  They need a separate person here for table service during the day,    Still, the star of the show is the wings here, and if you come for that, you'll not leave disappointed.  I chose here because my favorite wings in the area, East Coast Wings, was a little too far off my commute today.  Compared to them, they were very close, but ECW still edges them out a bit."}
{"text":"The girl who picked up the phone said hold on.  You can hear her in the background speaking with a guy at the bar.  Let's say she was more interested than the guy then picking up the phone. I was on hold for 10 minutes and hung up. It took 8 times for me calling back until she picked up and she apologized.because she forgot I was on hold. It's a shame the food is good but apparently the service has gone down."}
{"text":"We came here while searching for the \"best wings in Charlotte.\" I had high expectations for d.d.'s after reading these yelp reviews. It is not easy to find if you don't know what you are looking for. Once we got there, we decided to go with the wings platter. One or two of the wings were decent, the rest were forgettable. Perhaps if I hadn't read reviews and came in expecting mind-blowing wings, I wouldn't be so hard on them. It wasn't a waste of money, but our search for great wings in Charlotte continues."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte my entire life so I have a fond place in my heart for DD peckers. They have pretty much every flavor under the sun and the crisp and crunch of their wings is unforgettable.   The location is a hole in the wall in a shopping center but the unremarkable exterior is made up for by the great flavor of their wings! I usually get take out here, but plenty of people eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"So I'll give it 5 stars based on the reviews , the line at the door, the tables all full and the to go line picking up orders...   Its a small little sports bar atmosphere - There's TVs on every wall .  Tucked in a little strip mall in Pineville.... it's a hidden gem ! Parking is tight and you may have to walk a bit to get to the place from the parking lot ... as the place apparently keeps the parking lot packed!   On to the food...  My order of 10 wings came out record fast ... within 10 minutes ! Not sure if it was the kitchen was ready for the football crowd or what but it was fast !   I tried 2 flavors, mild and Gold wings based on the recommendation of the waitress.  The wings were off the hook delicious!   Tender and flavorful- I have to say the honey were so good and the mild had just enough kick to cause my lips to tingle but not so hot that I ran for water.  Both were Just delicious! Both sets of 5 were very wet . Covered in sauce - so be prepared to use a roll of paper towels...    So if you're looking for good wings .., There here for sure !  Two thumbs way up !"}
{"text":"It's a dive, but it has the best wings in town.  Go for 5 x 5 sample platter and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was served burnt chard wings Called Hoison Honey I complained by phone because they were part of a large  take out order for my family I spoke to the manager and he insisted that they were cooked correctly. I offered to send a picture but he was not interested. I'm tring to including a picture with this review  You decide for yourself Burnt or cooked right"}
{"text":"I decided to give 'em a whirl after hearing about them for the past couple years.  Straight up dive located in a non-descript strip mall like others mention.  The staff was friendly, service was quick, and the prices decent.  I only ordered wings to go:  Honey Gold (too sweet for my liking) and Cajun spice (which is better when dipped in the Honey Gold sauce).  I appreciate that the wings were sized properly--not some wimpy pigeon wings, nor the pumped full of factory steroids size, either.  About what a normal chicken grows when its raised for consumption by regular folk.  Would I return?  Yes, if I lived nearby.  With so many decent wing places nearer my neighborhood, however, its probably a one-off for me.  PS:  The Ron Jeremy pic behind the bar is too funny!"}
{"text":"All of their wings are very good but my favorite are the honey hots.... BEST EVER! Great hole in the wall place to grab a  beer and wings. Great service and the food is always hot and fresh. The place is hidden but I am glad I found it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wings? IMPECCABLE Service? Marvelous  This wing place really sauces my naan, I love it!"}
{"text":"try the gold wings super bomb! wings are huge!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service! Great place to watch all of your sports too! Amazing beer selection and knowledgeable bartenders!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some good wings for along time but I wanted to go somewhere new, so my husband found this place online and we decided to check it out. The decoration is really cool, it has more a bar than a restaurant vibe, there is a wall full of license plates from all over the US and outside that is really nice. We started with the broccoli cheese balls, they were good but I would not order them again. It felt like they were missing some key ingredient, if they had bacon with the broccoli and cheese the combination would've been perfect.  I decided to order garlic Parmesan and Hawaiian wings, the Hawaiian is like a teriyaki sauce with pineapples. For my surprise the wings that were supposed to be one of the best in Charlotte were far from this reality.  The Hawaiian wings were burnt and so SALTY I could barely eat 2?- take in mind I was really hungry. The garlic Parmesan was better but blend, no salt at all. Maybe I had bad luck and went on a day the the seasoning got mixed or something like that but I did not like the wings at all.  My husband got a Real Deal Steak Philly with fries. The sandwich was huge and according to him it was good.  The service was great, our waitress was attentive and very courteous, the price was fair but unfortunately the wings were not good at all."}
{"text":"The location is sketchy at best. As I drove up and saw that it had tinted windows and the other types of stores around it, I thought I may need to bring in my gun. Food was better than average for a wing joint. It was definitely packed out for lunch. I've read so much about the wings I was excited to try. They were good.. I would not say the best in CLT. What I did really enjoy was the Shrimp App. I'll be back but I won't make a special trip to do so."}
{"text":"Still a 5.  Went Friday night with friends for beers and wangs (we all had our usuals) and returned today with another friend and tried the fried pickles.  YUM!  Different.  Usually fried pickles are pickle chips, but DD's deep fries spears in a slightly spicy crunchy batter and is served with either ranch or hot ranch (I went with ranch as I had ordered some Honey Hot wings).  We went early and the football crowd started to roll in as we were set to leave.  Plenty of big TV's were rolling in preparation for the ball games  I love the wait staff who keeps your drinks filled and checks on you without hovering.  My absolute favorite local dive."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte, and their other offerings (philly cheese steak, etc.) are pretty good too. Kind of dumpy inside, and in a dumpy strip mall - we just get the wings to go!  Owner and staff are good folks."}
{"text":"Ohhh DD Peckers - the Wednesday night trivia SPOT.  The owner, Justin, is a riot.  This place has a dive feel with KILLER wings - just make sure you get them well done! NOM.  Everything is good though - fried pickes, salads, cheese fries, you name it.  As for trivia night - every Wednesday at 8:30PM.  Get there a little early to get a seat and order some grub.  Just an age warning - the trivia is raunchy and oh so fun.  Don't bring your kids.  Come to get your drink on, relax and have a good laugh with Justin on the mic.  This place is a blast.  Definintely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Great dive! Gotta try their hot gold wing sauce...Delicious! Also, don't miss out on their broccoli cheddar appetizer. This is a neighborhood hot spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered carryout tonight and was pleasantly surprised. The buffalo shrimp app was really good but was a very small portion for $8. My husband and I split the shrimp po boy and it was huge so I'm glad we got one to share. We ordered the 25 wings with 5 sauces and could barely make a dent in them but the ones we did try were really good and had a lot of meat and sauce on each one. For this area wing joints are pretty slim and I would definitely go here over driving to BWW anytime!"}
{"text":"The wings here are hands down the best I've had outside of Buffalo. It might look like a hole in the wall, but that only adds to the appeal once you've eaten here. Tons of flavors and great sides make DD Peckers our go to for game day food."}
{"text":"I've been on a gluttonous tour of Charlotte's unhealthiest restaurants lately. My latest endeavor was the oddly named wing joint d.d. Peckers in Pineville. I've had my fair share of wings from many a local and chain restaurants, and honestly to me they all seem very similar. Like most wing places, they have a bar, a multitude of TVs, and ample wing flavors. Something unique they offer is their fried broccoli cheese balls, which may induce a heart attack, but at least they taste delicious. Kudos to them for making their wing flavors taste distinct from each other, so many wing joints just douse their wings in different sauces and call it a day, but DD's prepares them with more effort, and my taste buds could tell. Their wings are meaty and tender, and their cheese fries are some of the best I've had. Totally worth the drive to Pineville if you're in the mood for wings."}
{"text":"This place had the best wings I used to order them at least twice a week!! But I ordered from them yesterday and it just wasn't up to par. I was so disappointed in them. I was looking forward to their wings smh. I'll give them another try in the later future"}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for this place, but wow. We live pretty close to it so we frequent the place. The food is always good and the service is always fast and kind. I love the southern wings and house made chips, but everything I've tried has been great."}
{"text":"Not impressed  Visited dd Peckers about a week ago and while nice, not outstanding.  My wife had the Chicken Philly and while not great, nothing to write home about.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with the Blazing Sauce.  You would expect with blazing, it would be very hot but not the case. Never once had to wipe my brow from sweat and a good medium hot at best.  Still a nice place to go and a dive restaurant but still a good option. Just not a first choice."}
{"text":"Little bar with 1 server handling all tables. She does an amazing job though, service was excellent: fast and friendly. But wings are what this place is about, and they do them quite well. Some of the best I've ever had with many options. There is a nice selection of flavors, you can get them regrilled, and the fries and sides are good. The celery was tasty but the ranch and blue cheese are a bit bland. The wings are the perfect size, not huge but a bit bigger than most places. The meat seems like a higher quality than most wings I've had. You can get many flavors by ordering 5 wings at a time: you don't pay more for the smaller quantities. I tried 3 flavors with 1 regrilled and they were all great."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It has the feel of a small hole in the wall restaurant. We had the onion rings which are a must and french fries for a starter. And wings as a main course which were bomb. I will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in town to check out the area and see if we want to relocate here. We are both from the Midwest and always look for a place that has good wings, a low key atmosphere, and plenty of tv's with college football on. This Place has all of that. Friendly workers, great wings, and lots of tv's. If we do move here we will be back"}
{"text":"I really hope these aren't \"Charlotte's best\" wings. After all the positive reviews, it seemed like the place to go for wings, but I was highly disappointed. We ordered a 25 wing sampler, and the Hawaiian and Hoisin can only be described as bad. The Hot and BBQ were average at best. Definitely not good enough to warrant a return trip."}
{"text":"This place is a bit outta the way, but I'm always on the prowl for great crispy wings, with awesome house sauces, and creamy house blue cheese to dip them in.  A few people had told me to try DD's for the wings and maybe my expectations were too high.  The wings were average at best.  The place seems more interested in being a local dive drinking bar than a culinary gem focused on turning out exceptional wings.  My search continues! Any yelpers that have the low down on really good wings, please let me know."}
{"text":"These are hands down the best wings in Charlotte. No comparison. I always order the wing platter to get 5 different flavors because I literally have yet to try a flavor I didn't love. Definitely worth the trip out here every time."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to get hot wings. Don't let the exterior fool you. Other highlights include: house made chips, oyster/shrimp Po boys & fried pickles. They serve a variety of different sauces for their wings but definitely try the hot wings! Dive bar feel with great food & friendly staff."}
{"text":"My friends took me there telling me they have the best wings in Charlotte at the best prices. Well, they were good, and not skimpy on size. The service was good enough and the waitress knew the menu. This place isnt anything to rave about though. If I lived on that street I would go back."}
{"text":"(6/10/18) My wife found this place while taking an employee to lunch. It seems that its a good restaurant for wings without the crass commercialism of the chain wing places. Any place that has hard cider delivered by waitresses in tank top is a plus in my book. The chicken was nice and moist and the atmosphere was homey. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wings the way they were meant to be! We take out from here a couple of time a month or whenever I'm in the mood for some wings! It reminds of a lot of the places I would go for wings back in WNY. My order is always ready when I arrive (about 15min) no matter how busy they are.   I usually order the traditional hot wings. These pack a little heat behind them! Recently, upon recommendation from one of the waitresses I ordered from, I've tried the Hot Gold... they're the reason I'm sitting down to write this review! It takes a lot to convert this former Western New Yorker wing snob to something other a regular hot wing!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the chicken wings that I got. I got three different flavors and it was as if they were pulled out of the grease and not drain at all. The chicken was tasteless am I opinion. I've heard great things about the chicken wings....I guess I came on a bad evening."}
{"text":"Great joint. Friendly staff. My son and I go every Saturday. Wings are best in town."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall chicken wing joint. Large variety of flavors - will need many more visits before I've tried a majority of them. An OK beer selection, and flat screens abound for watching sports."}
{"text":"Swung in for lunch, this was my first time visiting this establishment.... The wings were fantastic.   They had me lickiing my fingers in glee....  I had the lemon wings with the hot gold sauce...  Culinary work of art....  As Arnold would say, , ''I'll be back''"}
{"text":"Very legit wings, place has multiple different flavors. Crinkle fries are a plus too. Great place to grab a beer and smash some solid bar food. Staff is super friendly as well. I'm actually contemplating an order from them as I write this review."}
{"text":"What to say about this dive wing place. A bit hidden off Park Rd Ext in Pineville but once you are there, it's legitimately a great wing place. Is it a dive? Yes. In need of a refresh? Yes. But then again, that's why it is a dive bar. However, in my opinion some of the best wings in town. THE best fried pickles for sure. We had fried pickles---piping hot and you gotta give them a few minutes to cool off. Wings--we did 10 hot and 5 bbq---extra crispy. The hot were a fantastic hot--just what you expect--saucey and HOT. Even the bbq were a bit spicey, or was carryover from the HOT? Also had fries--nothing to write home about. Crinkle cut fries served right from the fryer. The Philly was good too. Bread was way better than I expected, beef was well seasoned.  Overall, great food and definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I'm gonna do you a favor... come here and order 10 'honey hot' flavored wings.  Then go on yelp and thank me.    Take it from a guy who isn't exactly a \"die hard chicken wing fan\" nor do I enjoy spicy food... these honey hot wings are awesome.  Just the right amount of everything.  The restaurant is easy to miss... it's in a strip mall between the Firestone and Laser Quest.    Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in Charlotte, no doubt! These ain't no tiny wings either, they are pretty meaty! They have plenty of different wing sauces & combinations to choose from also. My favorite are the Garlic Parmesan, but the hot gold are pretty dang good as well. I usually don't like lemon pepper, but they have a nice, unique flavor to them at DD Peckers (sorry Rick Ross, these are better than Wing Stop by far).   The restaurant is tiny, but the service is very good and the food comes out quick which is a major plus."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte... Try the Hot Ranch or the honey hot bbq.  The onion rings are great also!  Trivia night is fun... The owner usually calls it out and no guest can hide from his crazy offbeat wit.  Usually a good crowd for Monday night football and such and Golden Tee while you wait"}
{"text":"So, I've been to this place a few times, Probably 10 or 12 times in the past year, so heres a review thats Real, Reliable, and Ready for you to read.   93 Cleanliness!   Ok, lets let down to business, So, I read somewhere when I first moved here in July, that DD Peckers was the best wings in Charlotte, I decided to try it and man, the flavors of these wings are awesome, I've tried most of them. here is my Pros and Cons list.   Pros - Cause i always like to start with the good 1) The wings here are fresh and cooked to order, they ALWAYS come out hot, Crunchy and full of flavor. this SEEMS to be the standard around here. anything from appetizers to Wings is always hot off the press just like you like it.  2) The staff here is very friendly, and very accommodating. half this flavor, half that flavor, 2 ranch on the side, all drums. Never a problem. 3) Cool atmosphere, Im gonna upload some pictures but they have a wall with license plates from all over, A nice bar, and Plenty of TV's for your sports coverage!  Cons -  1) Location matters and it was hard to find this place the first time i went to it. Its off of Park Rd at the corner of Park Cedar DR , Between the CVS and Cook Out, BEHIND the Marathon Gas Station and Dynasty Cleaners.  2) It Looks kinda Shady, nothing on the doors and all Blacked out Windows.  3) It's kinda small, 12ish tables and some seating at the bar, but if you come on a game night or at dinner time any night, you'll wait a while.  4) Bathrooms fill up with trash rather quickly. 5) I think they hand wash they're cups, a couple of times I've got a glass with some residue on it, but they happily always bring me a clean glass. only happened twice. 6) Coke Products but no Coke Zero :(  (Personal Vendetta)   This place is AWESOME, I go at least once a week and will continue to be a regular.   Get Charlottes Best Wings at DD Peckers"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS & NACHOS IN CHARLOTTE!!!! They also have the best blue cheese dressing to dip the wings in. So So Good!!! My favorite wing flavors are Garlic Parmesan & BBQ!! I regret I never tried DD PECKERS sooner than we did but this is now our go to place for wings & nachos!!"}
{"text":"They are living up to all the hype on their reviews. These wings have a great outer crunch with a tasty not over cooked chicken center.  They offer a wide variety of flavors that all tasted great! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My kids and I love the homemade potato chips.  Those are a must. I recommend the wings with gold sauce. It has just enough of a zip. Also love the selection of beer on hand."}
{"text":"I just tried it for the first and NOT the last time. I never knew it was there. Out of the way strip. So we had a half oder of the fried pickles, very good with a great crisp coating. But a half order is only 3 pieces. Also had a half order of the spicy onion rings. A good amount of thinly sliced onions but not very, if any, spice. The wings were large and meat with a really good sauce and the black and blue burger was outstanding. I also had the house made chips instead of the fries. Also very good. The fries looked like normal frozen ones. Most definitely a return visit is in order. And the service was also first rate. Just wish there was at least 1 or 2 more pickles in the order."}
{"text":"I love d.d. Pecker's! There wings are the best! Don't let the divey location scare you away! Great little bar, always has great service - one of our favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love thier wings!  Would give 5 stars but sometimes Thiers not enough sauce on wings.  Honey hot is so good!!! The sweet black chicken...omg....and the garlic chicken is good too"}
{"text":"So after driving over 30mins to get here and also 1st time coming here and as soon as we open the door they say \"we are closed, we lost power in the kitchen.\" Seriously, no note on the door or anything ughhh."}
{"text":"The service was okay, but lacked any caring attitude at all!!  Half answered questions and the bonless wings all had nasty gristle in most bites, fried whole pickles, the only thing I enjoyed were the fries and my company!  I hope not to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I had the sampler with gold, spicy ranch, spicy garlic, Cajun and lemon pepper wings. The wings were fresh and great flavor! Monday was $3 foreign bottles...It local establishment...I am weak for a dive and local 1 of 1 places...I'll take those over mainstream restaurants"}
{"text":"First time here. It's 230 on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed. Ordered 25 of the famous wings. They came out in less than 10 minutes. Ordered    the hot sauce on half and the pepper flavor was different but all in all the flavor was awesome and had the garlic Parmesan on a few and they tasted great as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"DD Peckers! You're so cool. Your sketchy outside is contrasted by your warm and inviting inside. Our first time here we were dining around the Pineville fire station AND policemen. We felt very lucky. We ordered mozzarella sticks as an app and the 30 wing sampler as our entree. It was fun trying all of the flavors. My favorite was the mustard. The dry rub we ordered was pretty burnt, which was disappointing. Everything else was great, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for wings this is the place. Get there early for lunch as it fills up quick. Wings were meaty and flavor filled. The Lemon Pepper wings were great and the Gold were tasty too."}
{"text":"Pretty decent wings for the price. Tons of flavors to choose from. The staff is ok when it comes to politeness, but in the long run the wings and the beer specials make it worth it."}
{"text":"THE BEST WINGS IN CHARLOTTE!  Hands down - was there yesterday and ordered 15 wings with 'hot gold' sauce made extra crispy.  The wings were a great size and the blue dipping sauce was great.  Tons of celery came with the wings.  They serve krinkle-cut fries here covered with a spicy salt - delish.  Just wish this place was closer to uptown."}
{"text":"I just moved here from South Florida and going out for wings are a huge part of my life. I placed a to go order with the bartender and she was very helpful in describing the sauces and made some very delicious suggestions! After trying the wings I have to admit, they're some of the best I have ever had! I will be returning to this location OFTEN."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of months, but so far the best wings I've found in Clt. The restaurant itself definitely doesn't look the best, but the wings themselves are very good. I did a take out order of garlic parm, hot honey bbq, and Caribbean. I enjoyed the hot honey bbq the most with the Caribbean as a close second. The garlic parm was ok, but not quite on the level of the others. The wings were had a crispy outside and juicy inside which was great. The prices are about average for wings. This will be my go to wing spot."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience and food!!  I Had a craving for some good ole fashion hot spicy wings. Googled the best hot wings near me.....this restaurant was listed in the top 5. How and why I don't understand.  Pulling into the parking lot was a surprise, wasn't at all what was expected to be listed in the top 5 best wings. Plastic silverware, drink was mediocre, server failed to tell us the wings were grilled, another surprise when our food arrived.  Bite into the wings barely warm didn't taste any flavor (order a hot spicy with a sweet twist, no flavor at all.  When server arrived asking how everything was, I had to tell her, she graciously said she would take them back and place them on the grill to warm them.  Plastic bowl returned, wings were in the exact placement when she took the bowl.  The kitchen heated the plastic bowl with celery between the wings in the MICROWAVE!!!!  Needless to say at this point I was so disappointed and ready to go.   How and why this is a restaurant in the top 5 needs to be re-evaluated and removed off the list!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would start with \"don't judge a book by its cover\" but I don't read; more of a 'watch the movie' guy.  The parking lot is dark and the sign is barely lit but don't let the lack of light darken your outlook on this wing joint.  It's like opening a present wrapped by someone riding a roller coaster.  Rough outside but just delightful inside.  As the self proclaimed \"best wings in Charlotte\" (it is stated on the menus), I have to say that this claim is not far off.  I have not tired all the wings in Charlotte so I cannot fully endorse this, but I can say they were pretty darn good.  Generous with the sauce, the wings were cooked perfectly.  I also appreciated the plethora of choices when it came to sauces.  I can give my stamp of approval on \"Hot Gold\" as it had a sweet mustard taste with some heat.  I added a side of house chips that were good, with portions above average.  Service was great as refills were constant.  Would be a great place to watch a game.  Lots of traffic in and out as a steady stream of takeout orders made their way from the kitchen.  Will I be back?  I sure hope so.  I mean try and say \"DD Peckers\" without a little smile.  See, you can't."}
{"text":"Kind of a hole in the wall, older place, but I came for the fried pickle spears I saw advertised on Yelp.  They have yummy home made ranch and the breading is crispy and has a good flavor and they use Clausen pickles- or at least that's what they look like.  I haven't tried anything else, except a side salad, which was good."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Oyster wrap had like 2 little oysters in it. Out server was definitely cool though and made the experience nice."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place got 4 stars overall!  Maybe the stars just weren't aligned when I went.  My night started with me wanting to find a good wings place nearby that was open past 10 PM. I was also interested in my church buddys coming here on Tuesday nights when they have .59 wings because we were looking for a closer place to South Charlotte.  DDs was nearby and open, so I thought I'd check it out due to the great reviews.  I walked in and no server said a word to me.  It was pretty busy, so, I sat myself.   No biggie.  After five minutes of no one saying anything, I moved to the bar since there was someone working that area.  Again, no one said anything to me for about 5 minutes.  I finally got a hello and ordered a drink.  After this, I waited 15 minutes for the bartender to take my food order despite the fact that my menu was closed and she passed by many times.  Finally, she took my order, and after bringing it to me, I didn't hear a peep for almost an hour when I finally had to ask for my check to leave.  No refills, no \"how is everything.\"  I can't say I've EVERY experienced that at any restaurant no matter how busy.  To top it all off, the guy announcing trivia swore like a pirate including calling some girls \"b*tches\" which apparently they didn't find offensive.  I find it ironic they would have a sign out front that says \"A Fun Neighborhood Joint.\"  I guess the name of the business should have given it away.  It sounds like a male strip club or something!  Oh and I would rate the sandwich a 4 out of 10.  Nothing special.  Never again will I return..."}
{"text":"Great wings and a fantastic buffalo chicken sandwich! The place is a dive but fun."}
{"text":"Listen, I'm not a big chicken wing fan.  Yes I like chicken wings but my tastes aren't well tuned in enough to discern good wings from bad.  That being said, I think D.D. Peckers is A-OK!  I still like the home town feel of the place, the non chicken wing food is actually really good to.  I tried the shrimp salad (was a bit sad to see it come out fried).  It was actually really good though.  Beer specials could've been a little bit better and the selection is a little lacking for me but either way this is a solid 'hood bar with great servers.  Make sure to check out the license frames on the wall for a good laugh."}
{"text":"They're okay, definitely not the best in Charlotte. It takes a while to even be acknowledged as it's self seat.   I order the \"hot\" wings and they're pretty good. My partner got lemon pepper and BBQ, there was almost no lemon or pepper on them, the BBQ ones were burnt to a crisp. Disgusting.   There has only been one waitress both times that we've gone."}
{"text":"My husband loves coming here for the wings and I love coming here for the chicken tenders tossed in their golden sauce. This sauce has become my new obsession! It's sorta like a spicy honey mustard, but not too spicy, I can't handle too spicy! Oh and their fries are delicious (the fries have to be good in order for me to come back) The restaurant is in a tiny strip mall and it isn't very big inside, but it always seems pretty busy when we go. The service is good and I'm a sucker for dive-ins/bars."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good wings, fries, fried pickes and lots of beer, this is your place.  I have been here many times and the food is always good."}
{"text":"I live right across the street and have ordered take out from here a few times. The food is excellent! Every time my order has been correct and delicious. However, the staff has never been very friendly, especially on the phone. They've never been rude, just not as friendly as you expect in the hospitality business. That being said, I will definitely continue to order take out!"}
{"text":"Waitress was super pleasant and attentive to our  needs. Had the Philly sandwiches, both chicken and steak. They tasted good! Potato salad wasn't my favorite but I'm very picky when it comes with that. Overall nice little place for good food"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time during lunch.  There was a decent lunch crowd and the speed of service was average.  The place had 2 classic arcade games and several large HDTVs and probably would be great place to enjoy a sporting event.  It's a friendly little spot that offers a lot of different flavors of your favorite wings.  We tried the 5 flavor sampler and thought the Honey Hot and the Hot Gold flavors were the best. The others flavors were tasty, but slightly on the salty side.    They don't offer a special \"wing night\" like other similar establishments, but they appear to be doing fine without that type of promotion (although it would be nice if they did offer it).  Another thing they didn't offer were some wet naps!  Overall, it was a good experience and I would return just to try out their other flavors."}
{"text":"So now I'm hooked on the lemon pepper wings. Hot gold are still the staple for my husband, so I always steal a few of his too;) this place never disappoints. I hear the Panthers players love it too. I'm always up for a NFL player sighting!"}
{"text":"I was craving wings and decided to check out DD Peckers based on my husbands co workers raving about it. Not impressed. I ended up splitting wings and a buffalo chicken sandwich with my husband and just didn't care for it. The buffalo sauce wasn't very hot and the flavor was pretty bland. Maybe it was an off night. I wouldn't be opposed to trying it again."}
{"text":"First place I ever had a fried pickle. Damn good stuff. The wings are also really good, they offer quite a few odd flavors, but all the ones I tried are very good even combined. I think the Hawaiin and hot teriyaki or something like that is the best. This is like the one place if we are driving to around or through Charlotte, we have to stop :)  Ps: You guys are lucky, we dont have fried pickles in Miami. and if you can find them they suck and are the chip version."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles in town plus awesome wings. We usually do takeout. Dive bar atmosphere if you eat in. Will remain a favorite!"}
{"text":"I was at Carolina Place and needed a place to have dinner. I found this place on Yelp and it had 4 stars.   It's a small local place located in a strip mall. There's plenty of parking, TV's, and full bar.   We found a table as soon as we entered and the waitress cleaned it pretty quickly. The menu has lots of burgers, wraps, and wings (lots of flavors) available.   I ordered the chicken breast strips on a stick and a side salad. My husband ordered wings in Caribbean flavor and raw fries. The food was just ok. Nothing spectacular. Service was ok too.   I ordered the mild sauce on the side of my chicken breast strips. Personally I think it had a little too much vinegar. The Caribbean sauce my husband had was better. We flagged the waitress down (took a few minutes) and I ordered the honey mustard sauce to replace the mild sauce. It was a little better.   Guess you can just say, dinner was ok. Nothing more."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because I'm meeting in the middle. Wings are sooo good--I'd give them 5 stars. However, the service is 1 star. Customer service and satisfying their guest is definitely not a priority for them. While yes, it is a small wing spot, it gets great business but there's never enough servers working. While they usually only have 2 servers working...everything seems like such a hassle for them, and can be very rude. Not welcoming at all. Rude with to go orders, and I have never seen anyone there working with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend for lunch because I saw one of my facebook friends check in here one day.  They commented on how good the wings were. So, I made a mental note to try them out.  I entered the restaurant and greeted my friend.  The waitress (a blonde lady) came over to take my drink order.  She delivered it promptly.  She came back to take our order and once our order came up and she delivered it to the table we NEVER saw her again.  She never returned to refill our drinks or even ask if we needed anything.    There was a guy passing our table, so I stop him and said, \"Excuse me sir, I know you are not our waiter, but..\"  He abruptly interjected, \"Well, I guess I am now, what do you need?\" So, I asked for a refill of my drink and he brought it back to the table without saying a word.    So, we are waiting.....and waiting....and waiting....almost afraid to ask for the check.  My friend says to him, \"May we have our check?\"  He states we have to come over to the bar to pay.   To make matters worse he acted like it was hurting him to talk to us, like we were bothering him.  BUUUUUUUUUT, was chatting it up with the older WHITE gentleman at the table next to us.     I hand him my debit card, he runs the card and then THROWS it into my open hand.  I HAVE NEVER, EVER HAS SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!!!!! I am standing there staring at him like, NO YOU DID NOT!   I DID NOT leave any tip, and I also took a picture of my receipt just in case they tried to charge a tip on my card.  The food was sub par and the customer service was non-existent!   I will never go there again and I don't recommend it to anyone else.  Especially if you are not of the European decent!

{"text":"we went during the PGA, and the place was packed. Even so, the waitresses were polite and quick, anf.the food came out super fast. the fried zucchini is amazing, cut thick and perfect! the wings are really good as well, and they serve steak fries which are my favorite kind. TVs everywhere, since it's a sports bar. My second visit and I'll definitely be back! Recommended by a friend."}
{"text":"I work not too far from this establishment and the first place one of my new coworkers brought me (to welcome me to the family) was DD Peckers.  He goes to this place for lunch AT LEAST every other week, and he brings a car full of colleagues every time.  I like the wings a lot and I'm setting up an online order now to do a pickup for dinner."}
{"text":"We went here looking for really good wings. Greatly disappointed. We asked the waitress for her recommendations and she essentially told us all the wings were good. We then asked which were the most popular and she gave us some flip answer. The place was not crowded so there was no reason for her behavior.  I will say that I gave this place 2 stars since the service was incredibly quick but the wings are NOT the reason to go there."}
{"text":"Loved it!  The service was great and I had three different flavors... all good! The lemon pepper was great, they put them on the grill for a little char flavor, and it was awesome.  Some of the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Holy amazing wings! This is like s little hole in the wall but the best wings. For lunch usually there is a wait and there is literally one waitress working her butt off and you always have the best service! Would highly recommend this place for wings!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for the past couple of months, but I would never find myself in the position to get to this part of town from where I live.  I did finally get to try it this past weekend, man, have I been missing out!  Don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is easily hidden away in a strip mall off of Park Rd. Extension.  It really lends itself to the whole vibe and feel of the place.  The servers are super relaxed, but you are well attended to... and it really feels like a cool neighborhood regular spot.  We tried the wing sampler... that lets you get 5 different flavors with 25 wings... we thought we would have some left over but within 30min... the plate was clean and I was super happy we decided to eat wings that evening.  On a hot kick.... so we tried the Hot Garlic, Honey Hot, Hot Teriyaki, Jerk, and Lemon Pepper flavors of wings and all of them were pretty awesome.  After trying the five I would definitely get them all again, especially the honey hot.. nice mix of sweet and fire.  My favorite part was looking a the women's restroom door and seeing a sticker that says, \"I [heart] Peckers\".... sorry I just reverted to a ten year old....  All in all a great experience!  Definitely need to check out trivia night and the other flavors on the menu!"}
{"text":"After recommendations of my fellow Yelpers, I had to try dd peckers for their wings.  The wings are really good here and definitely one of the best places in Charlotte.  The wings are big here and the chicken is moist and flavorful and not fried to a crisp like many places.  The Hot Gold flavor is very tasty as others have mentioned.  Love the mustardy flavor to it because I LOOOOVEE mustard anyway I can get it.    The place is small and it's not fancy, pretty much a neighborhood bar that serves food,..good food at that.  For your other enjoyment there are about 10 TVs around the restaurant, 2 video games in the front and a jukebox to the other side of the door.  I sat in the bar area..  The bar stools were very uncomfortable and could use some updating.   Service was spot on considering there were only 2 people working the front.  Price wise, I paid $14 for 15 wings and a tea.  Not too bad considering the size of the wings."}
{"text":"I ordered hot teriyaki wings and cheese fries for lunch. Horrible waste of money. 2 out of the ten wings were undercooked. They were burnt. Or soggy. The flavor was so lacking. I also ordered cheese fries. If you're just going to dump grated cheese on it at least take the time to get it all melted."}
{"text":"It's a decent place! Great wings,fries. Have been here many times, good service. My favorite are the honey hot/hot/garlic hot wings and big basket fries."}
{"text":"If I want great wings I go to DD's.  You can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  You need to try their Hot Ranch.  I'm addicted to this place.  Can't wait go back."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed DD Peckers.  They cook the wings as you ask and the sauces and dressings are excellent.  Some of the employees there have horrible attitudes which is why, if I ever do go back, I will order my food to go from now on.  I'll drink at BV's where they actually like and appreciate their regulars."}
{"text":"Extremely decent wing-noms, and great prices. I'd had D.D's before on take-out, but was reminded of it when we needed a place to have a continuous stream of food and alcohol while watching the first U.S. World Cup game. D.D. Pecker's it was.   Service this time around was a very helpful, bouncy, sweet girl who obviously knew nothing about soccer, but would cheer and boo when the crowd did anyway, and do so while still being attentive. Definite top rating for service. The drinks were strong, which was great. Also, they held no qualms with experimenting to make my favorite drink (Grateful Dead).   The wings, as always, were delicious. I can't handle hot too well, but the Cajun is still flavorful, and I'm a fan of the Gold. My new favorite and new experience was the Hoisin Honey, which was amazing. Crunchy, blackened, and flavorful on the outside, moist and sweet/nutty tasting on the inside. If you've been on the fence about them, trust me when I say that while they're not your traditional wing flavor, they are yum.   We also ordered some onion rings, which were good, but unfortunately we had to leave the bottom layer since there was a large puddle of fry grease floating there.   Great place to watch the game, and has a great atmosphere. Yeah, perhaps a dive, but for those of you out there who are dive-lovers, this place is clean, friendly, and has great food and good drinks while you watch the game. Pull up a stool."}
{"text":"So, this place is a dumpy neighborhood bar located in a not-so great strip mall basically in an alley. For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's \"regular\" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together. So, it is a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Service is okay at best."}
{"text":"Wings were burnt to a crisp. I asked for different set. They weren't much different. On top of that, waitress was rude and never checked on me once after bringing second batch. Never checked to see if things were ok. Never refilled my empty glass. Didn't even bring the tab. Waitress just sat at a table with her friends all night long. I had to ask lady behind the bar to ring up my tab. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"IMO these are the best wings in Charlotte and I have tried a bunch of places that claim to be great.  It's a hole in the wall in a strip mall but they know how to make some fine wings and that's why the place is always busy.  By far their best sauce is the Hot Gold.  Try your wings extra crispy with this warmy tangy sauce and some blu cheese to dip them in and you can't go wrong.  Very affordable as well.  A basket of seasoned fries will run you about $3 and their side salads are always fresh and tasty!    The wings are so good I almost hate to review this place as I don't want it to become too popular!  Do yourself and your taste buds a favor and stop in and try the Hot Gold.  The Hot Ranch isn't too shabby either!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid wings, I recommend the sweet hawaiian ones. they come out real black but don't be scared by the color. Hot gold is also pretty solid and not super hot.  I wanna go there to catch a game."}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte the other night and needed a quick meal before heading home.  In short, the night had been busy and the service suffered because of it.  I would try them again because they served up the best Jamaican style wings I've had in some time.  The chips weren't bad either."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but we did not have a great waitress. The food is amazing. We ordered 25 wings, cheese fries, and fried spear pickles.  Love the grilled wings"}
{"text":"With a name like DD Peckers, you can be sure you'll offend someone. But it's not about the name. Really. Just pretend you didn't hear it.  Finding the place can be a little bit of a chore, since it's not much to look at - either inside or out. And once you're inside, there isn't much room to move around, especially if there's a crowd. You also may not want to look too closely.  The name is actually \"DD Peckers Wing Shack\" - means that you ought to try the wings. So go wild. There are something like thirty flavors on the menu, from naked (in keeping with the theme of the place) to the alluring Hoisin Honey. Try them all if you are so inclined, but it might set you back a bit, a 5 wing order costing more than $4.  I'm old, but that's not cheap. At least you get the celery and dressing included, not like 10 cent wings at the bar when you have to pay extra.  The big downside is the service - it can be pretty slow, so be prepared to wait. And wait. And then wait some more. If you think you might want extra wings, order them up front, because you may not get a chance for a second order."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch some football on Sunday and try this place out. What a great decision! Luckily I got there early enough, this is a small little place but man was the food good! I tried the normal hot flavored wings and wow great traditional wings!  My girlfriend got the shrimp po' boy and she loved it! We also tried the chilli cheese fries and dear lord... Too good.   Overall just a really good experience and will be getting take out for some future games! I saw on the menu they do 100 wings for $85! Sounds like a perfect party idea to me."}
{"text":"Yeah, real good wings ! Went here recently with my son after reading  reviews on Yelp. This place is definitely a hole in the wall dive, which is fine by me . We ordered the fried pickle spears and house made chips as an appetizer, which were both good, not great. The wings were what we came for ,and we were not to be disappointed. Got 3 different flavors of wings. Mild are like a traditional Buffalo wing, hot ranch and hot honey BBQ. The hot ranch was outstanding, a crunchy, spicy, ranch flavor, really good! The mild wing was also excellent. The hot honey BBQ was good, not great.  Definitely coming back again and would recommend this place to any wing lover."}
{"text":"Place is hidden but worth it! We get the sampler platter. My favorite is the hot garlic. It is so flavorful with a kick! Their ranch is awesome. French fries is fresh and always comes piping hot. Side salads are also good. Fried mushrooms are delicious. Be careful biting into them because those are also super hot too. Let it cool down or dip it in ranch first lol. My fiancé loves the hot gold flavored wings."}
{"text":"This is the best place for wings 2 of my favorites are honey mustard an southern . The honey mustard wings are cooked perfect n the sauce is a creme base yum. The southern wings are like a fried naked chicken wing w a side of gravy . Their fried pickles are to die for they are spears not chips an add some cheese fries perfect Friday nite meal"}
{"text":"First time, definitely wont be the last! Overall an incredible experience. Located in the middle of a strip mall, don't let the location or outside appearance fool you...DD Peckers is worth it.  Highlights: - Mild Wings - Garlic Parmesian Wings - Blazing Wings - Fried Pickles  Our family of 5 enjoyed every minute of this genuine wing-shack. And despite the bar & every table full of people, the service was excellent and the food was fast. This is no chain- it's the real deal."}
{"text":"I ordered lemon pepper wings but I swear that's not what I got. It was late and I was in the mood for some wings so of course I got on yelp, and this is one of the first places that came up so I gave it a try. It was my first time there so I was already nervous. I looked at the wings when she gave them to me but it was dark b/c the place is more of a hang out at night so I couldn't really tell if they were what I ordered or not but it did smell good. So I get home and I'm eating them and I'm enjoying them but then I realize it was not what I ordered. Lol. By then it was too late cuz I had already eaten half. And I still dunno what kind of wings they were which sucks b/c I liked them and now I can't order them next time. Lol"}
{"text":"Found this gem while I was traveling. I am originally from south of Buffalo so I take wings serious. This place was great and the wings were awesome.  Not to mention the staff was great!  I highly recommend this place. Been on the road for 4 days and this was just what I needed. Cold beer and hot wings. If your looking for that corner bar feel with good food, cold drinks an great people this is it."}
{"text":"Fact: I sing to myself, \"I'm in love with a strip mall\" when I come here. This is of course inspired by the great poet T-Pain. It may not look like much, but DD Peckers is a great hidden gem.  I like a lot of the sauces here, so for me it's hard to pick just one. The sampler platter is a great option if you have a few people with you. Twenty-five wings and you can do five different flavors. Hot flavors always win for me when it comes to wings. The heated versions of gold, garlic, honey, teriyaki are all great. Hoisin may sound odd for wings, but it's really delicious.   The fried pickles here are spears instead of chips. WIN. I wish everyone would vote spears when it comes to menu decision making involving fried cucumbers soaked in evil. I also like that you can do most of the starters as a half order instead of a full. I don't think the broccoli cheese balls are made in house, but they are a nice little nibble.  Parking can be kind of difficult in this shopping center. I think that may be a blessing a disguise. I mean, I need that little walk after eating that many wings and fried things dipped in ranch."}
{"text":"A total dive with fantastic wings.   They have other options, of course (typical bar fare: sandwiches, wraps, and burgers) but none hold a candle to the wings. To me, the sides are nothing special, either.   The wings are the star for good reason--they're a good size, slightly crispy, generously sauced, and the price point is great. They have a huge variety of sauces, and I don't think you can go wrong with any of them, but my favorite is Hot.   The space is relatively small and the parking lot is kind of awkward, so if you're thinking of catching a game here make sure to arrive early. D.D. Peckers also does a great job with carry out if that's more your style."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first experience at DD's. I've heard really good reviews about their wings, and I learned first hand that those reviews are accurate. I ordered the hot wings and they tasted amazing! They also seem to have good daily beer specials. Check them out!"}
{"text":"THE best wings I have ever had...  No seriously, I know it's in a shady area, I know it's a dive, BUT! They are the best WINGS you will ever eat.   Justin the owner is awesome, say hi to him."}
{"text":"Tried DD Peckers over the weekend after a friend mentioned them.  I was NOT impressed, wings were honestly just Ok, nothing I would try again.  The broccoli bites where horrible and a waste (dry and not even really any broccoli and cheese filling at all. The fries where dry too... I don't drink but I don't think I would even go back for drunk dive bar food."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and sauces. Small place that is in desperate need of a makeover. Other bar food is good. The staff is friendly and food is always quick."}
{"text":"It's a little hole-in-the-wall bar, the wings are so so at best,the service was sort of lacking, it's definitely a locals place, it's a dive bar, so I didn't expect it to be real clean and it lived up to that expectation of course"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall place but their wings are the best in town. Talked this place up to my co-worker who has never been. He had high expectations and love it. If you need your wing fix this is the best place."}
{"text":"Damn that shit was good!! This is the best bad food we've had. Divey little neighborhood type bar with no ambience and we didn't care. Service  was great, server knew her shit. We ordered classic burger with fries, Philly cheesy steak with potato salad, and Honey Gold wings.  Cheeseburger cooked only one way, well done.  But it was delicious and juicy. French fries cooked on the well done side like I asked, crispy and delicious. We order half Philly cheesesteak and the size was perfect and big enough. So good. We got pasta salad by mistake and was told to keep it and I'm so glad they did. It was some kind of Mediterranean style with rotini pasta, pepperoncini peppers, feta cheese. So good. The potato salad was like old fashioned homemade with a slightly sweet taste. It was fantastic too. The wings were sauced perfectly and juicy and cooked the way i like em. Blue cheese on the side was creamy and chunky. Everything tasted hot and fresh. Go in, order a beer or a sweet tea and get some wings and burgers. I'm so mad I'm full, but I took leftovers home and I'm eating that shit later!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident after pulling over to take a phone call. Didn't expect much based on the appearance of the place but thought I'd have a snack anyway. I didn't try the wings but I did try the fried mushrooms with ranch dipping sauce. They were fantastic, tastes just like grandma's. Came back the next day for another taste."}
{"text":"Always awesome, always welcoming and amazing food. Broccoli cheddar balls are to die for. So hot ranch with anything you own."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit! I ordered the hosin honey,ginger and so called lemon pepper. This was in fact the worst wings experience. The hosin honey was god awful....it was like eating burnt wings with a bitter after taste. The ginger wings were just as bad.The lemon pepper was missing the lemon and pepper...hints to why I referred to them as so called lemon pepper.   I wish the waitress would have informed me of the presentation of the hosin wings since I mention it was my first time visiting the establishment.I ended up tossing the wings after tasting one of each flavor.   I couldn't believe how awful the favors were. What a waste of $15.00."}
{"text":"I was in town on a work trip and stuck in the suburbs away from downtown Charlotte. My flight got in late and DD Peckers was one of the only places open after 10PM that wasn't closing in the next 30 minutes.  I hate to admit it, but I was not expecting much when I rolled up to this spot. If anything, I was expecting cheap beer and decent wings.  The wings were described as jumbo, and that an order of 10 is usually a good meal. I got 10 wings and a half order of the chili cheese fries.   The chili on the fries was really good. It was chili with beans, which I prefer, but I know it's not everyone's favorite. The fries were pretty tasty with tons of cheese and chili. Definitely eat them with a fork.  The wings were the star, for sure. They were not breaded and they were very crispy, without being over cooked. The sauces were spicy and tangy (I forgot which two flavors I tried, but they were very good). I remember one of the sauces was peppery instead of tasting like tabasco. I really enjoyed that one. It was definitely worth it.  If I'm ever back in town, I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great homemade blue cheese.. Great \"hot\" wings.. Great spicy onion rings, not heavily breaded and seasoned well!  Staff was quick, efficient and friendly"}
{"text":"Wonderful wings. Hot and spicy! Great homemade chips. The wait staff is fun and informative. Excellent, fun time. Love the hot ranch wings."}
{"text":"From the outside, and maybe even when you first walk in, it seems like a total hole in the wall! But don't let that fool you! They are awesome. Great, great food, friendly staff and great prices. My favorites are the mild wings, their cheeseburger and their french fries! My boyfriend says the Oyster Po Boy is the best he's ever had (which surprised us considering we're not near the coast!). And lately, my teenage son keeps asking if we can come back because he loves their bacon cheeseburger! HIGHLY recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We went for wings. The more I ate them the better they got. The waitress was a little slow to get our order and checks when we were done, but we also went late so I'll give her he benifit of the doubt.   Really though, get the wings!"}
{"text":"Wings! I am addicted.  Here they have a sauce selection that would embarrass many so-called wing establishments. I opted for the sauce-dip all-in-one... the hot ranch. So good. Just creamy and spicy and delicious. Wings are cooked long enough here to render out some fat and crisp up. Nice direct service as well. Got me in and out for lunch like a champ."}
{"text":"I didn't actually intend to go to DD Peckers Wings.  I was looking for a different restaurant when stumbled across it.  It was on my bookmark list to try, so rather than waste more time looking for the other place, I stopped in there.  I was glad I did.  The place is pretty much a dimly lit dive bar & grille type place.  I ordered some onion rings to start with a and 10 wings with the hot sauce.  My onion rings came out pretty quick.  The rings hand made, hot out of the fryer, with just the right amount of grease.  They were thin with the batter just about falling off and very, very tasty.  They reminded me of the onion rings that my family used to get when we went out to the local fried chicken joint on Sundays as a treat.   I had a little bit of a wait after I finished the rings before my wings came out, but my waitress kept my drink filled.  The wings were a pretty good size and well coated with sauce.  They were steaming hot, temperature wise, and spicy hot flavor wise.  Usually when I order hot it is more like a medium to my palate, but these were truly hot on my spice meter.  The only negative I could find was that they were a little over cooked, but not by much so I couldn't give them 5 stars.  This place is pretty hidden in a strip mall and you'd probably drive right by if you weren't looking for it.  But my recommendation is to look for it and you won't be disappointed.  The price is also very reasonable, $7.50 for 10 wings with a wide range of sauces.  I'm definitely going back there."}
{"text":"The place was average. Wings are ok. Nothing special. They are on the small side. I didn't like the fact that they didn't have Medium as an option. Hot was too much sauce and mild was not enough. This is the ONLY wing place I visited that didn't have Medium. The place is clean. The servers were nice. It is in a low to mid-level plaza that is showing it's age. This place has received accolades, but I can think of a dozen wing places in Charlotte that are better."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get wings in Charlotte. I've been wanting to check it out for a while now, but just now got around to it. Wing King Cafe is also frequently mentioned as the best wings in Charlotte. It's hard for me to say which is better since it's been a few years since I've been to Wing King Cafe, but both have amazing wings.   We got the 25 wing sampler with Ginger, Hot Gold, Hot Ranch, Hot Fajita, Garlic Parmesan. All of the flavors were really good and the hot flavors weren't too spicy (to someone who doesn't like really spicy food). The Hot Fajita was definitely the hottest, but was still good to me. It had a strong lime flavor and was my husband's favorite (he loves spicy food). We both agreed the Ginger was the weakest of the flavors we got - it had a teriyaki/ginger seasoning, but didn't have much flavor at all. The charred flavor was good, but I was hoping for a much stronger ginger flavor. The Hot Ranch was a Buffalo Ranch and was pretty good. The Hot Gold was a mustard BBQ with a little kick and the Garlic Parmesan was pretty solid. Overall, there's a ton of options to choose from and I would expect everyone to be able to find something they like.   The service is incredibly fast and friendly. They were happy to provide explanations and recommendations.   We will definitely be coming back next time we want some wings!"}
{"text":"Best wings around. Been a while since we had eaten here, yelped to find best wings as well as googled and this came up over and over again.  Perfect example of a dive bar if I have ever seen one. Staff was all super nice, they all appeared to enjoy working there, family like atmosphere, lots of regulars. Ordered the fried pickles, onion rings and the hot ranch wings.  Had the fried pickles before, they do the spears, looooove the spears.. they were good, crunchy, salty right amount of breading. The onion rings, they were sad.. greasy, mushy... a few were crunchy and those were tasty but most were too greasy/mushy to eat. The hot ranch wings.. OMG... I woke up this morning wanting them for breakfast. The wings themselves were super crispy... even with the sauce.. the hot ranch was not hot by my standards but had really good flavor.. BF has eaten there many times, never tired and he was said he had been missing out. I will be eating here again in another week or so for sure."}
{"text":"I sat at this establishment after driving out of my way and it took 5 mins before even getting drink orders. The waitress/bartender literally dropped the drinks down on our table and kept moving. After I motioned several times that we were ready to order I watched our waitress/bartender take several to-go orders, chat it up with other patrons and never once did she come over and take our food order. We waited 30+ mins. before I just walked out my sister stayed but I refused to eat here. People had come and gone that's how long we had been waiting. NEVER AGAIN! And bet your bottom I'll make sure to leave my experience on every website I can find! Absolutely ridiculous!  I get that there were only two servers working but it wasn't terribly busy if she had enough time to do all that other stuff that she couldn't stop 2 mins to take our order.  Update: She told my sister it was a misunderstanding. She thought we weren't ordering anything. That she thought we were waiting on laundry (BULLS***!). Why would I tell you I was trying to pull the menu up on my phone if I wasn't planning on ordering? And in what establishment does a server not come back and ask if you want more to drink or want to order anything even if they aren't sure you plan to order? Try again with someone who might believe that lie!"}
{"text":"Food is great, too bad I can't say the same of the employees. Poor customer service!!! Waitress dropped menu on the table. Yes, dropped it didn't fall. Also, gave us someone else's ranch with our order and didn't even apologize. Once you arrive they don't greet you , so sit where ever you would like. Horrible."}
{"text":"Wings were pretty good. I will give them 3 stars. Good size and cooked perfectly. This place does define \"dive\" so it caused no disappointment as it came as expected.   I got the HOT wings - they were medium to me but tasty. I got the \"blazing\" sauce on the side and it was not any hotter than the hot sauce. And, it didn't taste like buffalo sauce anymore so I'm glad I ordered the hot wings."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after hearing so much hype about it.  When we got inside it reminded me of one of my other favorite spots to get wings. Wing King. Menu was similar as well. We went with the Honey hot wings and fries. They tasted just like the wings at Wing King which is a good thing. My only complaint would be the wings could've used more sauce. I will keep this place in my rotation."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for some of the best wing flavors I've ever tried.   Go with a group of friends and order as many different types as you can. I tried hoisin honey, hot gold, and cajun rub - they were all really delicious. I can't wait to come back here.  Staff is friendly and served us drinks while we wait for our to-go order.  They even gave us napkins when they saw us sneak off a couple wings from the box as we were paying."}
{"text":"They have some of the best wings I've had in the Charlotte area. Would defiantly recommend them to anyone looking for some good wings."}
{"text":"I've gone in twice for take out. Really friendly bar staff!   First time I got 10 wings (5 lemon pepper/5 honey BBQ). The lemon pepper could've used a little more flavor. Tasted a little plain but wasn't all that bad. Honey BBQ was delish with dripping sauce!   Second time I got 5 hoisin honey and 5 Cajun. The hoisin honey tricked me at the beginning! They looked charred. Black. Look at the pic. Although I feel like these might have been a little overcooked on the outside, they hoisin flavor was still present and the honey drizzled over them fixed it. The Cajun was sandblasted with Cajun run. No complaints with that one. Had a really good kick to it.   Side note: I ordered chips and salsa also. Chips were cold and stale. To be fair, I ordered these at around 10pm...  Overall I'd totally come back to taste all the other flavors!!"}
{"text":"My favorite wing place in Charlotte this far. The servers are friendly and get to know their regular patrons. If you're not there at 11:30 or before on most days, you may arrive to a packed house. I generally get 5 honey hot and 5 hot honey bbq wings. The flavors sound similar but are different."}
{"text":"Wings A++++ OMG we tried the honey teryaki, ginger, gold, lemon pepper, and hawiann. All were fab. The place itself ok. From what I seen they have a very limited selection of liquor and a small selection beer. Sanitation rating was an 'A' at 90.0 and from what I seen it was clean. It almost looks like a bar with food. We also had the burger, quesadilla, chicken tenders, and fries. Everything was great."}
{"text":"This spot looks like a serious dive, but if you like Chicken, Wings, Apps and Great Food, then this is a must stop! Love the Buff. Chicken Sandwich with homemade bluecheese!! Can't wait to try the Wings. Love this spot!!"}
{"text":"YUM! Delicious wings, entertaining trivia host, great prices, super service and fun customers. I used to live around the corner and went here way more often, but even now that I've moved to the clear opposite side of town I still make the trek to visit once and a while.   The location may seem a bit odd at first, it's a strip mall hole-in-the-wall type bar with about 10 four top/3 high top tables and a bar that seats 8 or so, but if you're craving the best bar food THIS. IS. THE. PLACE!  *Favorite thing: Hot Garlic wings dipped in Ranch...or their cafeteria style krinkle cut fries, or their spicy fried pickles. Yeah, it's really just too hard to choose!"}
{"text":"If you like dive bars, don't judge books by their  covers, don't mind a cold domestic beer, unpretentious waitstaff and really good wings, this my friend, is the place for you.  Come as you are, park in the raggedy parking lot. Tiny place that is well worn but clean.  Get a bottle of Miller Lite or Ultra and get some wings to share try the Gold, they are excellent.  I'm not saying this is the place to bring out of town friends but there is a reason this it has great reviews.  So the next time you don't feel like putting make up on or doing your hair, give this place a try."}
{"text":"So good! Wings & burgers are the best. Fried pickles & chili cheese fries are awesome too."}
{"text":"In for bowl game. Awesome wings. Great fries. Good beers. Awesome service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a really fun dive bar. It's small but has a lot of personality. The wings are killer and they usually have some good deals on drinks. This place is great for what it is"}
{"text":"Go for the Hot Garlic wings with Fries to dip in the sauce.  Great sauce, with LOTS of garlic.  Good cold beer as well."}
{"text":"Best wings ever.  Just fantastic.  You may think twice about walking in, but will be glad that you did.  Found a great combination here, parm-garlic with a side of mild sauce is a flavor I can't do without when I go here.  Something on the menu for everyone.  Ample portions, excellent servers!  Do it!"}
{"text":"I didn't get to try the food because the initial service was so terrible, impolite, and disrespectful that I left. It's unfortunate to have your restaurant hindered by a rude, unenergetic waitress who appears to want to punch someone within moments of \"greeting\" them. Doubt I'll try a second time."}
{"text":"Every time I order with the white trash girl named Michelle she gives me an attitude never gives me the right sauce ranch and this last time my wings we cold an no sauce with them except this time my wings were cold she wouldn't make them over so I decided to do this now she always has an attitude with people or color I'm there on a weekly basis so she know"}
