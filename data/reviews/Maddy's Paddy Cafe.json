{"text":"Very inexpensive, We had 2 T-Bone steak dinners, came with dinner salads, we got side of fries, green beans and dinner roles with 2 drinks for about $23."}
{"text":"A unbelievable value and delicious 16 oz t-bone  steak for $6.99. I have not seen cut like this in 20 years. Total bill for 2 people $16.00 . The carrot cake is completely Jewish mother tasting homemade. The cat fish is an excellent value also."}
{"text":"Let me say, this is my new guilty pleasure!!! The cooks are DYNAMITE!!! Oh so dee-lish-us!!! I tell the waitstaff everytime I go that I want to kiss the cook and one day, the waiter told the cook what I said and everyone fell out laughing because the cook had on an apron that said, Kiss The Cook! 

Truly, if you want some food like your mama makes, this is the place to come. The liver and onions pleased my Oklahoma-bred mama, they must be good! The hush puppies are cooked to perfection; never have I had them cooked to perfection in many, many years! The catfish fillets are huge! The fried chicken is fabulous! 

YOU JUST HAVE TO GO TRY IT...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!

The bartender is on point!!! The drinks will melt in your mouth! YUM"}
{"text":"The restaurant is excellent with customer service to match which is a contrasting difference compared to the casino's graveyard shift cocktail server/bartender. Food is great and prices to match."}
