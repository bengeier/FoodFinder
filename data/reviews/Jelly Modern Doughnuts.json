{"text":"Jelly modern donut is everything you want a donut shop to be. Now, I'm not one to put down Timmy's but this place puts Timmy's donuts to shame. In the past week this shop's peanut butter cup donut has become my kryptonite and I'm not afraid to say so. Just thinking about it makes me want to run over right now and grab one!  A plus side: their donuts come in mini sizes  A downside: it's a tad pricey for a donut (1 up Timmy's)."}

{"text":"Jelly Modern Doughnuts is the latest gourmet doughnut bakery café to open in Toronto.   Located on College Street and bordering Kensington Market, JMD is easily accessible via the 506 College-High Park streetcar or a short walk from Bathurst or Spadina streets.  A couple of notes:  1) Doughnuts - they serve a wide variety of doughnuts with some intriguing flavour combinations. We ordered two of the 'gluten sensitive' doughnuts: the maple bacon and the callebaut chocolate doughnuts. Unfortunately, they were packaged in a brown paper bag, and some of the doughnut topping stuck to the inside of the bag.  Upon biting into one of the doughnuts, I was a little surprised at how dense it was. It was a bit of a struggle to eat them, to be honest, due to the density, but I suppose that's to be expected given the gluten-free ingredients. I cannot personally vouch for the tastiness of their regular doughnuts, but I've heard they are delicious. They also offer both small and regular-sized doughnuts, which is a nice touch if you just want to sample a variety of flavours.  Be sure to check out their website menu (http://jellymoderndoughnuts.com/menu/) before visiting them if you are looking to try a particular flavour, however. They bake their doughnuts fresh throughout the day, but they make a different set of doughnuts on each day of the week.  2) Price - it's a bit expensive - a regular doughnut costs $2.75, and a dozen doughnuts will set you back $30 - but nothing out of the ordinary for the gourmet/organic/gluten-free/locally-sourced scene. Certainly more reasonable than Glory Hole Doughnuts on Queen.  3) Service/Ambience - the service was prompt and efficient. The decor is a bit intense with all that hot pink everywhere. But who really cares about that when all you are craving is a tasty doughnut??  Worth a try."}
{"text":"I don't get how people go to a doughnut shop and say something is too sweet.  This place is great, I had the coconut and a bit of the lemon curd.  Both awesome.  I guess haters gotta hate.  Serving sizes were pretty big, and you get what you pay for.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is not for me. I got 3 different doughnuts on my visit; maple bacon, red velvet, and creme brûlée. I found all of them to be disgustingly sweet. And as a red velvet lover, there was nothing red velvet tasting about that doughnut, sadly. Same with the creme brûlée, there was no distinct flavour that if I were to bite into that doughnut without knowing the flavour, I would have no idea what kind it was. Glory Hole Doughnuts are amazing, and when I heard this place was opening and is closer to me, I was excited. Guess I'll have to keep making the longer trip to get doughnuts that actually have flavour, not just sugar."}
{"text":"A popcorn caramel doughnut sounded great until it almost broke my tooth!  They put a whole bunch of unpopped corn kernels on the top of my doughnut, hidden under caramel and popcorn.  I'll attach some pictures.  If that wasn't bad enough, the doughnut was disgusting.  So was the replacement doughnut I got."}
{"text":"As of late, there have been a heap of doughnut shops popping up in and around Toronto, but JELLY is by far, the best. Take it from the guy who has been to Glory Hole, Paulette's (Now Delica), and Dough by Rachelle.  All of the aforementioned places are worth the wait and every penny but there's something special about Jelly that makes it stand out above the others.   When you eat these doughnuts, you don't feel that heaviness after you usually polish off a few. The selections were unique and creative, such as Pineapple Coconut Cream, Peanut Butter, Maple Bacon, and S'mores.  To boot, there are TWO different sizes of each doughnut to choose from (for those people on a diet OR those who would like a sample of many doughnuts rather than just one).  Also, there are gluten free options.    This place covers all bases for picky eaters and for those people, who like myself, want to eat a light doughnut that is still flavourful."}
{"text":"I was surprised to be so uninterested by the donuts in the display case. Nothing looked particularly appetizing or unique.   Decided to try it out anyway. I bought a donut with chocolate glaze (cheap chocolate) and shavings (better chocolate) and a coconut donut. Both were fresh and very average tasting.   Did not like the decor at all, a strange mix of sterility and intensity at the same time."}
{"text":"Bref--the gluten-free donuts are delicious cake donuts (my fave.) Their flavours are original, and I never feel 'cheated' by the g-f selection. The atmosphere is a bit...sterile, but the staff are nice and the donuts solid."}
{"text":"I see ratings less than 3 and I scratch my head. As far as doughnuts go: Jelly Modern Doughnuts is an A. I see the confusion however: most Toronto gourmet doughnuts are just doughnut shaped cakes.   The Setting: It is just a stroll out of the Kensington Market area, I was coming off the streetcar to go to Caplansky's. I noticed their distinct signage. The shop itself is really quite clean. Spotless, just a bleach scent away from sterile. The accent of pink on the white and industrial is a nice shot of visual sweetness. Where Jelly Modern loses me is their seating situation, they have this bench that looks quite inviting and sleek. But it's too low, and uncomfortable. When I imagine a place to get donuts, I wanna be able to grab a cuppa sit and socialize. I almost felt like I was crouching and my taller friend looked even more rediculous trying to fit his behind in a small Eames' inspired chair. That's where one star went.  The rest is perfect. The service was good - very friendly, acommodating, great sense of humour.  The Doughnuts: We forget: Doughnuts are not cakes with holes. I repeat:  doughnuts are not rund cakes with holes.  Just to set the expectations of Torontonians living in the age of gourmet cupcakes, gourmet cookies, that  come in looking for doughnut shaped cakes. I feel like people walk into this place, see gourmet doughnuts, expect cakelets, get upset when they get doughnuts. The topping - donut proportion is good. The doughnuts were delicious, quite fresh.   The Dunk: Would I go back? To grab and go: in a heartbeat. I wish they had more bistro style seating."}
{"text":"The yeast dough is dry and taste like it didn't rise. The icing is too sweet. I prefer glory hole donut instead."}
{"text":"This place had its ups, but unfortunately more downs.   The interior of the store was simple and cute. they displayed the doughnuts well and had a variety of flavours to choose from, some which were out of the ordinary. The excitement really stops there.  The lady (I assume owner) didn't want to grant my request to cut the doughnut(s) in two, which was not a big deal - she gave us a plastic knife to do it. I realized why she didn't want to after trying to glide the knife though. (Spoiler alert: t didn't glide) The doughnut was stale and tough. This was, of course, disappointment Number 1.   The second disappointment derived from its flavour or lack thereof. It was bland, plain, and nothing to rave about, only regret. The doughtnut itself reminded me of a stale plain doughnut from Timmies. The texture was dry and flat. However, the cream in plopped in the center of the doughnut was OK.   All in all, they have a cute store and cute-looking doughnuts, but it's not worth the money or calories. I won't be going here anytime in the future. Nice Try J.M.D."}
{"text":"Was walking past here today and stopped in on a whim and to satisfy my curiosity.  The outside of the store is really nice and modern and I was intrigued to know how these donuts are different.  Picked up two donuts to try at home later:  key lime pie and double chocolate.  We cut them up to share with a few people and no one was really impressed.  The key lime just tasted like a regular donut and definitely not worth the extra $$ spent on it.  The chocolate one was just kinda off.  It didn't taste like a donut and not like cake either.  It was kinda almost like the same texture of a cake pop but more dry.  The chocolate flakes on top were a dark chocolate and I don't think it was too sweet either, it's just a very confusing food.  I had higher hopes for something interesting that I would want to try again but I really don't.  Would probably stick to Tim Horton s if I had a donut craving."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. Like a jewelery store for doughnuts. Everything is nicely laid out, and the the white interior accented by magenta makes for a clean and modern presentation.  The Carrot Cake and Chocolate Whoopie Pie doughnuts were cake based, but left a lot to be desired. They were crumbly, and dry in texture. And unfortunately, the frosting was too sweet to complement the base.   The yeast doughnuts fared better, with the S'Mores doughnut coming out on top. The base had a great chew. The homemade Marshmallow on top was a welcome sight, however didn't have that char one would hope for.  I was most excited about the Creme Brulee doughnut, but it was kind of lame sauce. Firstly, the proportion of custardy interior to dough was out of whack. Not enough filling yo! Moreover, the signature of any great Creme Brulee is that wonderful layer of crack-worthy sugar on top. This had more of a glaze, and it looked like someone ran a torch over it really quickly, but there was no sugar crust to be found :("}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a friend, and how Oprah loved their donuts. With that kind of hype, I was definitely intrigued. I got there around 2:30PM and there was plenty of donuts left, which is unlike the kind of experience you would have at Glory Hole, in which their donuts would be sold out by 2-3PM, especially on weekends. The interior of the shop was quite eloquent, with mostly white and fuchsia colour schemes. They sell their own recipes books, along with other little nick-nacks.   They have doughnuts that were available every day, as well as speciality donuts that would rotate through. My friend and I decided to get the maple bacon, chef's choice (some sort of run icing with powdered sugar and blueberries in the middle), and chocolate peanut butter. We got three of the smaller ones, which totalled around $8. Our favourite was the chef's favourite, just because we found that the other two were quite dense. We both agreed that although they were delicious, they were a bit pricey, and were \"missing a certain something\"...maybe a filling? The topping was great, the dough itself wasn't spectacular.   I probably wouldn't go back just to get donuts, but if I was planning a catered event, the presentation of the donuts is definitely impressive and would create that 'whoa' factor!"}
{"text":"Saw the other location on a food show and was hoping this location would be similar,but  not so much. The donuts that are featured on their website and on their menu that particular day were not available and there was no explanation why. I did not even see coffee served at this place either. The person who took our order could not care less, the location was a bit sterile as well. The donuts we did get were pretty good but yeah they are $30 for a dozen. The best donut was the salted caramel for sure. I wish I could visit the other location as that one serves sandwiches, etc. This location seems like an afterthought that won't be around much longer."}
{"text":"Jelly Modern Doughnuts gave us a free doughnut sampler consisting of Coconut, Jelly, S'mores, Salted Caramel, and Chocolate mini doughnuts on National Doughnut Day!  I loved the added touch of chocolate shavings on the already chocolate glazed mini doughnut.  The salted caramel has always been my favourite here just because of the wondrous salty, sweet flavour profile.  The coconut doughnut had coconut shavings on top but also exploded with coconut filling!  The powdered raspberry jelly doughnut was good but it could have taken a cue from the coconut doughnut with respect to filling.  The S'mores doughnut was tasty, but it didn't really replicate the full experience. Despite having graham cracker powder on top, there was an absence of any graham cracker flavour and texture.  Also, how about blow torching the marshmallow next time, Jelly?  Overall, this sampler made my day!  Thank you Jelly Modern!"}
{"text":"I am surprised this place doesn't have an overall higher rating. The doughnuts are lovely and soft. Favorite has to be the Maple bacon one or the coconut."}
{"text":"Absolutely exquisite donuts, handmade and delicious. They look and taste amazing. Would go every day if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Jelly Modern Doughnuts is finally in Toronto!  I have visited the flagship store in Calgary last summer and have been in love with their doughnuts since.  I dropped by today just after its grand opening and there was a steady stream of patrons.  They had some unique doughnuts - you must try their 'doughnut of the month' & 'chef's special'.  I gleefully took 16 three bite doughnuts home to sample with family and friends!  The only downside is that they are still working their kinks out as a new operation. My order payment was messed up and was corrected by the manager.  Unfortunately, that is why my rating is such.  I hope to go back in a few months and adjust my rating.  Service needs to match the quality of yummy doughnuts.  All in all - check out this place to taste the doughnut deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of doughnuts. Just so you know, I kind of find them stale, disgusting and overly sweet, seeing as my doughnut experience has been limited to Tim Horton's and horrible company meetings.  With that said, I LOVE THESE DOUGHNUTS. Soft, fluffy, delicious.. I could eat a whole dozen and not blink an eye, but I'd probably end up in a sugar coma and feel totally disgusted with myself.  My favourite is the classic jelly doughnut. I've tried the other ones like creme brulee, the tea one, red velvet and the salted caramel but in the end, I like a normal, jelly doughnut."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful summer day in TO so I decided to go for a long walk.  First stop is Jelly Modern Donuts. They had a variety of flavours, but I decided just to get one... SHOCKER! I usually get a half dozen to try a few flavours, but since JMD was the first stop in my 'Kensington food discovery day' I had to stick to one. It was a hard choice but I decided to get the \"3 bite\" size maple bacon donut ($2.25), it's the smaller version of their regular size ($2.75).  It's a yeast donut which I like and the maple flavour is good, but it needs a bit more bacon to get the right balance of salt and sweet. The space is bright and white.  All the donuts were nicely displayed and labelled.  Service was quick with a smile.  Will definitely come back to try other flavours. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The doughnuts weren't amazing, which considering it's a gourmet doughnut place is kind of disappointing. Add in meh service."}
{"text":"The idea is a good one! Artisan donuts as a special treat to savour, rather than gut-stuffer Tim Hortons style donuts. Mom used to make home made donuts for us kids and I loved watching them fry knowing how good they were straight out of the oil. What would be an even better Jelly Modern Donut would be a fresh one. Their display of donuts looks fantastic but as soon as they enter the world, donuts tend to go downhill fast. Just like dim sum dumplings, donuts are best served fresh. How about sitting down, placing an order, and waiting for fresh donuts? I would love that! The interior theme of hot pink and white looks great, clean and refreshing, and the pillows in the window space look inviting as long as you're not in the hot sun. Chairs out front make for a convenient spot to have a donut too. Let's see if they can get the kinks worked out and let donuts rule the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"After pigging out at Caplansky's a few doors down and rolling my fat ass down the street, I stumbled upon this little store that I have nicknamed \"Heaven\"  I love doughnuts. Love. LOVE. I also love bacon. Love. LOVE.   So when I saw a Maple Bacon doughnut I pretty much pushed over a pregnant lady and an elderly woman standing in the doorway to get inside.   The store is really cool. Looks crisp and clean.   I was so full I could only have 1 doughnut but they all looked pretty amazing.   Imma go back. Probably tomorrow.  #jellymoderndoughnuts - mmm mmmmm mmmm"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place but unfortunately it didn't work for me.  Ambiance: excellent  Service: very nice  Maple bacon doughnut: quite tasty  S'mores doughnut: dough was over-proofed (yeasted dough had risen too long) so the doughnut had a sour taste to it.  Unfortunate.  Coconut doughnut: again the dough had risen too long so it was sour but even worse, it was undercooked in the centre where it met the coconut filling.  Wet filling + sour undercooked dough = please give me back my Tim Hortons  and get this sour gunk out of my mouth.  Sad, as I really wanted to like this place.  For the price, the product really ought to be better.  For your money you're much better going to Nova Era Bakery for their doughnuts or to Praire Girl for a reliable though pricey sweet cupcake."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout with friends! Is a small donut shop with a small space to sit and eat. Clean environment and a decent variety of donuts!"}
{"text":"it was a meh. I tried the s'mores and maple bacon. I was hoping for a bit of sweetness, but i got bland and bitter. It was fair priced for the size and look of them though."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that jam doughnuts are pretty much my favourite thing ever. So maybe I am being overly critical.  I walked into this place on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the jelly doughnut, and was told they had run out of them (\"that's a good sign!\" I thought) and then the other guy said he could go back into the kitchen and \"make me one\". OMG yay! Talk about lucky. I was getting a hot, fresh doughnut from the fryer! But, no. All he did was take a regular glazed doughnut from the back fridge and put some strawberry jam on top of it. Needless to say I was pret-ty disappointed. I like my jam doughnuts warm, and to have the jam on the *inside*. But, it wasn't all bad. It was possibly the best jam I've ever tasted, like homemade with chunks of stewed strawberries and full of seeds. If \"krispy kreme\" type doughnuts are your thing, you're going to go nuts for this.  They also have \"cake\" doughnuts on the menu too, and I'm guessing these are the more traditional type, so I am definitely going back to try one of those."}
{"text":"Meh. It's not for me. It reminds me of a fast food joint, but for donuts.  The atmosphere and product... guess donuts are fast food?! But I'm used to Glory Hole Doughnuts (GDH) where the donuts look like delicacies, an art and you can physically see the love they put into their d'nuts plus they're placed in sturdy containers, not a brown paper bag like Jelly Modern supplies.  I went on National Doughnut Day. The guy behind the counter gave 4 people in front of me a free donut for the holiday, but when I reached the front, he didn't mention or offer me one. Thanks alot a$$hole! Those customers didn't even buy anything. You would think they would reward their paying customers a lil' something! GHD gave me 1 of their aprons for National Doughnut Day and they sell them for $30! Just sayin. (Thanks GHD! Love you!)  I tried 5 different types of donuts:  1. Banana chocolate chip - very sweet and tasted like artificial banana flavour and the chocolate chips are on top of the donut NOT in the actual cake donut.  2. Madagascar vanilla - wayyyyy toooooo sweet! 1 bite felt like I was eating a spoonful of white sugar.  3. Lemon curd - again, toooo sweet!  4. S'mores - tasteless! It was bland and not even close to a s'more. I had no idea what this tasted like. 5. Peanut butter cup - the best one I tried. It actually did taste like PB & chocolate.  I was only able to handle 1 bite of each with the exception of PB cup.   I'm not lying when I say, I feel like I wasted my money. Argh! But at least I can now say, \"Jelly Modern?! Been there. Done that. Don't want it.\""}
{"text":"If you get the mini sized donuts it doesn't feel like a rip off, the price of the large donuts seems expensive. I've tried a few different flavours and I would say some are worth the price and some are not. Always fresh though."}
{"text":"WOW - seems like everyone had some haterade with their doughnuts.  Stopped by this pink and white castle today and I was happy with what I had!  My doughnut selection was peach in the middle, some red sauce on it (berry flavoured) and it was delicious.  I got the bigger one.  I was happy with my doughnut!  I found it light and satisfying.  And considering the epic amounts of decay on this section of College St. as a local I'm really happy a bright, clean place has opened filled with doughnuts!  Now maybe I'll be less than impressed with my other tries but these were really good."}
{"text":"All the sweet treats are baked fresh on site with flabours like maple bacon.. hmmmmm yum and s'mores and peanut butter cup, alongside more classic options like chocolate, vanilla, jelly and lemon curd! Oh and did I mention Oprah ate here too? YUP! I now considered myself to be famous."}
{"text":"Jelly...how in god's name are people going back for these atrocious bastardizations of donuts?  As a younger man, I once visited the Sahara during a sand storm. I experienced more joy from a mouth full of sand than I did when I bit into these dust pucks.   These donuts are so bad, I wouldn't even recommend them for use on my own genitalia while a high class prostitute ate it off.  OK, maybe I'm being a little harsh here but these donuts are no better tasting than cardboard toilet paper rolls which we all know have a hole in the centre as features in common.  These donuts shouldn't even be in the same league as Tim Hortons. If these donuts were baseball players, Tim Horton's would be Edwin Encarnacion and Jelly donuts would be Gregg Zaun.   In conclusion, I don't think you want to be ready for this jelly."}
{"text":"What?  Bacon on a doughnut?  I approve.  I hardly eat anything sweet which I find myself defending a lot.  It doesn't help my cause that I don't prefer to consume sugar when I'm going to places like this.   Sure, I could have had one small doughnut instead of ordering 2 LARGE ones.  Call it the Costco mentality in me.  I have to go big because I don't go home (it's an expression...)  I went with a peanut butter cup and a maple bacon and jeez louise I was flying afterwards on sugar that I should not have consumed but yet foolishly did.  I needed the energy because I had a long trek ahead which was going to end with me getting home late.  Besides the doughnuts there are cold drinks as well as coffee or tea available.  The displays to see are just a sight in themselves but I admit, not having ate anything for breakfast and coming here at noon influenced my greedy decision to get more.  The lady I had let in ahead of me because I wasn't ready yet went to town and ordered a dozen to take out and sort of depleted some of the flavors.    Overall the doughnuts were very soft and light with heavy toppings.  The maple on the bacon maple was very thick almost too much but good if you like that sort of thing.  Me, I would have been happier if it was in fact a bacon slice instead of bits... again my greed always comes out so proudly to the surface it's almost embarrassing.  I said almost."}
{"text":"We had shown the website to my girlfriends mom, so she wanted a donut, plus she was going to be watching the kids, so we needed a few for them too. They have regular sized (very big) or smaller sizes. We were going to get a 16 pack of the smaller ones, but the box was way too big, so we ended up getting a dozen of the big ones. At the store, I had a regular chocolate (chocolate callebut) and a peanut butter cup. My girlfriend tried the Smores donut. I thought the donuts were very much like the ones I had as a kid, they were really good, very fluffy, and I really liked the chocolate that they used. Very unprocessed tasting. I wasn't crazy about the smores one, I didn't think the marshmallow was toasted enough, but in all, it was a good visit."}
{"text":"Clean, cozy shop, much like the original one in Calgary. Friendly staff, although the store is pretty cramped, so we took our order to go. Ended up tossing out the donuts though because we were accidentally given a peanut butter donut instead of mocca and my boyfriend is deadly allergic. There was a lot if disappointment there."}
{"text":"The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the prices.......$3.10 for a donut???!!! I'd have to say it's a little pricy. But dear Lord, they are delicious!!!! I got the Nanaimo Bar donut, a special flavour for the month. There's really no complaining to have to do about this dessert. It was so soft and fresh, the nanaimo flavour was definitely present, and it was a good size too! The lady working at the counter was sooo friendly, she greeted me with a nice welcoming smile as soon as I walked in. Great customer service is always a nice bonus! There is really any seating here, so I wouldn't plan on coming here with a laptop or anything like that to get work done. All in all, Amazing donuts, just on the pricy side....."}
{"text":"These are my favourite gourmet doughnuts in the city, and I've tried a few. Some people complain that they're too sweet but I like a sweet doughnut. I like it to be like dessert, not breakfast, and I think the flavours are all really punch and tasty. Of all the doughnut places I've tried in Toronto, this is the only one I'd really bother going back to. A very yummy treat."}
{"text":"Honestly, the worst donut I've ever had. I tried a small lemon curd, and when I looked at the dough, it looked like damp paper. It was sort of wrinkled and beige and not fried, it seem boiled. And the texture was dense like wet sponge. You could get better at Loblaws for a dollar. The best are still Krispy Kreme, they taste and feel light even though we know the truth calorie wise....never would I try these again, and I live close by."}
{"text":"Really interesting toppings. Really sweet could only eat a couple at a time. Way better than typical donuts but way higher price.. Good for a treat once and awhile.. Maple Bacon donut was amazing."}
{"text":"so far its 3.7/5 Too much of dough. You should try bacon maple syrup glazed doughnuts and peanut butter doughnuts.  Apparently they make everything from store."}
{"text":"Went out of my way to try this place and they were closed when they were advertised to be open.  This was also at 11:30 in the morning, not in the afternoon when they might have run out which I would have understood."}
{"text":"Joining the gourmet doughnut craze in Toronto is Jelly Modern Doughnuts from Calgary, now here across the street from the thick of Kensington Market. Their unique touches include confectioneries that are either round or hexagonal shaped with a depression in the centre where they stuff some jelly or creme, and boxes that come with dividers to keep each one separate (I do not see that in any other places). Doughnuts come in two different sizes, so if they ask, go big or go mini... or go home.  I find their goods to be sweeter, and dense. The s'mores flavour, does capture the essence of a s'more much like the Glory Hole version, with a thick chocolate coating and light dust of graham cracker crumbs. Lemon curd was, ugh, very tart. It's not the most exciting donut experience I've had, but pretty decent (though I prefer Von of Danforth), pretty clean, and oh geez what else did I try...  {TTC: 506 to Borden Street.}"}
{"text":"This place has the clean modern look to it with splashes of pink.   It's small, with a big table and a few chairs in the front.  They use no preservatives in their doughnuts, and all fruit used is fresh (not canned or frozen!).  Everything is made fresh and any leftovers at the end of the day is given to charity.   There are so many different flavours here, s'mores, birthday cake, maple bacon, ones with fruit on the top, red velvet ones etc.  Some of their doughnuts use a hybrid cake/doughnut mix which gives it a more cake like texture (I believe the red velvet one is like this if I remember correctly).  They also have a large (regular size) and a smaller version if you just want a little sweetness  I choose the classic dark chocolate and it was yum!  The staff are super friendly and really know their products.  The are planning to expand more locations in Toronto, Calgary and are even opening up some stores out West  Craving something sweet?  Pickup a few delicious treats here!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this store on a late night with friends and we decided to give this place a try, it's doughnuts, who doesn't love doughnuts!  It was a clean place and very modern for sure. The display of doughnuts looked good and very tempting.  When I saw \"Red Velvet\" doughnut, I went nuts. Red velvet anything is my favourite but a red velvet doughnut? I'M SOLD!   It was a decent doughnut and it was my first time eating such a \"fancy\" gourmet doughnut (yes..I called it gourmet..haha) but for $3? C'mon. I would rather get a cupcake than a doughnut if it was going to cost me that much.   I thought the doughnut would be about $2-$2.50 but when the lady told me that it was $3+ for that one doughnut, I almost backed away completely and walked out the door but I didn't and paid for it for the sake of trying it out.  Overall, meh tasting doughnuts (the names of them sounded incredibly delicious though) at such a costly price. I don't know if I'll be back but a part of me wants to go back again just to see if it can redeem itself."}
{"text":"Ya I had to go back and try the red velvet.  The first day I went there was one that was huge!  Unfortunately, repeated vists since then I have not seen the mammoth of a donut that I saw on that fateful day.  I must admit, I really want to like this place.  It's nice, they keep bringing out donuts throughout the day and they open early and close late.  But, our love is not to be.  The red velvet is a cake donut (it doesn't taste like a honey dip which is pretty much all hte other donuts).  The texture was nice and soft (not the best but good) but it was devoid of flavour. It was tasteless.  Mind you I don't like how they put sprinkles on half of the donut.    I ended up removing all the sprinkles, that is I tried to.  I wanted to be good and got rid of most of the icing.  I thought the donut on its own would stand out but nope.  The only thing that saves this is the icing....  Sigh...."}
{"text":"Update Feb 2018: Jelly Modern has devolved into a corporate catering business. They are open weekdays only, closed weekends. Recently they serviced the Google Home doughnut event downtown, and the doughnuts were a mess - looked terrible, tasted stale or soggy. Fail fail fail."}
{"text":"I have been in several times. As a \"drop in\" customer, I have come to realize that Jelly Modern has little interest in drop in customers.  The donuts are good. I mean, it is hard to screw up anything that has both maple frosting and bacon on top.  Where things go a little (ok, a lot) sideways is in service.  This shop closes early in the day. Recently a colleague and I dropped in for an after lunch donut and were told twice that the shop closed at 2.  By 2, the donuts are no longer all that fresh. Sure, they look good in the display case (if you come early enough to see a full stock), yet nothing fresh is being made/delivered here after early morning.  As others have noted, this is a decent option for those who need to cater donuts that are both expensive and unique (though not so unique as to offend anyone.)  You can still get a big, decent 3$ donut here. Unfortunately, nothing about the experience makes it all that worth it."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves better reviews. I love that they have their larger gourmet donuts as well as smaller donuts that they call \"3 bite donuts.\" The maple bacon is incredible. The dough is light and fried perfectly. I always look for a good donut spot whenever I travel. This is definitely one that any donut fanatic should go to."}
{"text":"The shop is really cute and clean. The doughnuts are displayed very nicely and looks pretty. I wasn't that impressed with the taste, and honestly don't think it was anything special, they didn't really have much flavor to be honest. I wouldn't go back  I had: Mini Maple Bacon Peanut Butter Cup"}
{"text":"This location is far better in terms of quality and variety versus the location at Brookfield Place in the Financial District. We visited on an early Saturday afternoon, and there was quite a bit of selection available. We ordered the Peanut Butter Cup and Coconut mini donuts (which I don't see too often at the other location), and they were super chewy, soft, with minimal to zero artificial aftertaste. They honestly tasted like fresh bread - straight out of the oven. Really fresh and delicious. Although, be warned, we were told that towards later in the afternoons, they do sell out of popular flavours quickly. So if you're in the area, come earlier than later.  We found street parking for free just a block east of this place. For two mini donuts, we paid a little less than $5.00."}
{"text":"Jelly Modern Donuts, hailing from Calgary, Alberta, opened its first store in Toronto this year, and it's been on my radar to try ever since. I finally got the chance to check them out yesterday.  Eyeing the display case full of donuts, everything looked delicious. It was super hard to decide! The staff there didn't pressure me to hurry up, and told me to let them know when I was ready =). They have dipped donuts, filled donuts, and cake donuts. I tried one of each! One of the great things about most of the filled and dipped donuts is that they are available in two sizes - great if you want to try out a flavor but don't want to commit to a huge donut.  Cake donut - Red Velvet. Yum! This one was by far my favourite. I'm a big fan of their cake donut. The cake was moist and delicious, and the icing was a cream cheese topped with sprinkles. Pretty large donut. Hard to not want to stuff my face with these after eating it.  Dipped donut - Salted Caramel. The flavours of the icing were yummy, but I wasn't impressed with the donut itself. A bit bland tasting, to me.  Filled donut - Maple Bacon. This fell in between for me. Not as amazing as the red velvet, but better than the salted caramel. The bacon was yummy and fresh, and what Canadian doesn't love some maple to go along with their bacon?  Overall, good, but good enough to draw me back here? Not quite - I would stop by if I'm in the area, but I would not go out of my way to come here. Definitely falls between a 3-3.5 star, for me."}
{"text":"The coconut donut is delish! Not sugary at all and the filling tastes like fresh coconut cream. The donut itself is like fresh soft bread. My only qualm is that the filling is a bit too small."}
{"text":"There is a lot of different varieties of doughnuts here that you might not find at a local Tim Horton's. They all looked very yummy but I found that they tasted pretty average. They may be a bit more fresh here but really I could not find anything special about these doughnuts.  We got a Turtles and a Smores doughnut. Both looked so yummy at first glance.  Lesson learned. Looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a little treat and it was excellent. The place is clean and there is good selection of doughnuts. We ordered the coconut one, it was lightly glazed wtih coconut shavings and a coconut cream in the hole. The doughnut was fluffy and light and the whole thing was delicious and not overly sweet.   Like all gourmet foods, this had a gourmet price tag to match, but if comparable to things you could get at a bakery or Sbux."}
{"text":"Maple Bacon donut was amazing! The S'mores one did not wow me. Would definitely go back if I'm in the area to try another donut :)"}
{"text":"I always get the gluten sensitive donuts and they're pretty good. Much better when  fresh but still good for GF stuff. The only thing that sucks is there isn't much choice for gluten free compared to the rest. So things can get dull in terms of options but still nice to have some unlike most bakeries."}
{"text":"Cute and sweet spot. Really clean and sleek setup inside. Many options for doughnuts and they're all original. Free samples also available (which are always a plus - more so for the purpose of helping you decide.. But they're so good you might end up walking out with a box).   Google lied - they are open on Sundays. Walked there even though Google already said it was closed and as we stood longingly outside the door, the owner (who we didn't see standing behind the cash register) motioned for us to come in.. The door was unlocked the whole time.  They have many doughnut options, but are sold by size not flavour. Flavours are also not listed on the menu as they don't always have the same flavours every day.   (They serve coffee too, but you're a minute walk away from Voodoo Child and just outside of Kensington Market so I'd suggest grabbing a doughnut here, and coffee elsewhere )"}
{"text":"I'm working on a vanilla donut as we speak and I'm not sure if food has made me this happy in like...years.  Seriously, this place is fantastic.  I'm going to get so fat working in the area..."}
{"text":"To be fair, I've only tried one doughnut. I did my best to resist trying any but happened to wander in one day and was just about to escape after looking in the cabinet when the assistant asked if he could help me. Foiled! I had to buy one-it was the polite thing to do.  I went for the doughnut of the month which was nanaimo for September. It was really good! I love the old-fashioned jam doughnuts and cake doughnuts mostly. This was neither. What is was though, was incredibly fresh, light and fluffly. The chocolate ganache was delicious and it was topped with some creamy coconutty stuff to fit the nanaimo description. All very tasty.   It's definitely pricey but I like the size of the \"mini\" ones. They're not very  mini really. The store is clean and the staff were pleasant. It was pretty quiet on a Saturday afternoon. I hope this doesn't mean that they're not doing well. Think I'll pop back to try some more. And possibly eat the pink M&Ms on the counter."}
{"text":"Was getting a bit bored of the selection of donuts from loblaws. Strolled into Yelp and saw how convenient jelly modern is located along college streetcars so I made my way over. Place looks extremely clean with the white decor. Shelves for the donuts were extremely spaced out along with the massive glass display. 10/10 choices as there were just a few too many for me to choose(now I have to come back). Red velvet and carrot cake donuts were on point. The other donuts were squishy and fluffy which is like biting into a cloud."}
{"text":"I haven't even been to this place but just had their doughnuts.....  Thumbs up all the way around. Just roll me straight to the fat house please and tell my cardiologist to stand by!"}
{"text":"Many claim these are the best doughnuts in the city.  I'm a huge fan and am in agreement.  Creamy, fluffy, great and interesting flavours.  Mini doughnut options is excellent.  My only real complaint is the fame has resulted in their really never being enough product left. So you really have to preemptively plan your doughnut indulgence. And let's face it, it's difficult to plan on being cheeky."}
{"text":"I was excited to find this place.  I love anything with lemon curd, so seeing they had a lemon curd doughnut, I had to pick some up for me and the hubby since I was in the area.  It's very pretty inside and the display case is lovely, but it would have been nice to have descriptions as well as the names of each kind... some are obvious, like lemon curd, but chef's special?  And the girl serving me did not seem thrilled about explaining when I asked.    Got 6 donuts to go... lemon curd x 2, peanut butter, strawberry cheesecake, chef's special which had peanut brittle, and maple bacon.  The fillings and toppings were tasty, but we could not get past the density and almost  raw dough taste of the actual doughnut.  Made you feel full after two bites... in a bad way. Even the dougnuts at the Maple Leaf Gardens Loblaws had better texture in the dough - but their fillings and toppings are terrible.  I read a review on Yelp that the doughnuts were fluffy and delicious... maybe they did not cook them long enough on the day I bought them?  The lemon curd was good, but had a bit of a fake taste which I find unacceptable in any lemon desert at a premium price.  Maybe it was an off day, but given the price of $2.75 each, I would rather go to Epi Breads and get one of their incredible lemon tarts... double the price, but a billion times tastier!  Which reminds me, I must go do a review of Epi now!"}
{"text":"Ok I went to the college location and got the whoopie pie donut and the pumpkin tiramisu donut. The pumpkin tiramisu donut tasted neither like pumpkin nor tiramisu, but it was very sweet. The whoopie pie was amazingly sweet and beautiful and a sugar overload. The icing on it was like a cake. It was attractive to the eye and tasted good too.   I have had Glory-Hole Doughnuts and the donuts here. I have to say that these are sweeter, more attractive, and well thought out and presented. Most of all, it is not crazy oily.  I prefer this place.   Check out my pics and \"like\" em if you can.  I took em for you."}
{"text":"If you read my review for Kensington Krawl, you would've found out that was the first time I visited Jelly Modern Doughnuts. I have been eyeing the store for a couple of years now ever since I saw it, but never had the chance to stop by. After my food tour, all attendees were given a coupon for a free doughnut and coffee. I eagerly came back to claim the coupon with a friend of mine.  The first time I was there, I tried the S'mores doughnut. For this visit, I took a stab at the Salted Caramel. I loved both doughnuts but I preferred the S'mores a bit more. My friend got hooked after eating his Coconut doughnut and ended up buying half a dozen for his roommates afterwards! He ended up coming back later on every time he passed by.  I highly recommend Jelly Modern Doughnuts if you love gourmet desserts. Every bite is worth it!"}
{"text":"I had a donut with Callebaut chocolate on top. I'm assuming the rest of the ingredients were top-notch, and the donut was tasty."}
{"text":"oh so soft and fluffy! Love the base of these Jelly Modern Doughnuts.   The flavours are all really interesting and all so pretty. The option of having a smaller size is such a good idea as I can sample more without being on a sugar high. And the smaller size donuts are just so cute!  The interior is simple and cheerful. Though the sitting area is smallish but quite comfortable to enjoy your donut and a cup of tea.   Ordering a box of sampler to take it to any gatherings sure will make your friends really happy!"}
{"text":"Great selection of doughnuts and overall good quality (better than Tim Hortons but I've still had better doughnuts). Atmosphere however isn't great. It's very cramped and not a lot of seating, so don't expect to be able to hang out to eat your treat in the store."}
{"text":"Nice curb side appeal to the donuts and this shop; regrettably it ended there. Donut body was tasty, though by end of day it started to lose its lustre. The toppings were pretty, but very tasteless. We bought half a dozen so we experienced a good range and sadly have to report there was no distinct wow factor.   Save your pennies."}
{"text":"Try to eat at 3 or 4 donut shops when visiting a new city. Jelly Modern Donuts was a bit underwhelming- certainly didn't live up to the Yelp hype I was expecting it to. Still worth a visit, though."}
{"text":"I'm not too picky when it comes to customer service at grab & go places, but it wouldn't have killed the guy to be a bit more courteous. His attitude was pretty offputting. Their donuts come in different sizes, which is convenient if you want to try a few. I had the S'mores and Maple Bacon donuts. The S'mores was seriously stale. I heated up the Maple Bacon and it was pretty good, but not mindblowing."}
{"text":"Get that jelly in my belly!   I've had Jelly Modern Doughnuts on a few occasions, and people sure go nuts for these doughnuts. I'm a huge fan of their lemon curd, and I personally just ordered three dozen of their tasty treats for an upcoming party. This big order of Madascar Vanilla, Classic Jelly and Coconut came in under $100 and the best bit? For $20 you can get them delivered downtown! Hooray for donut delivery!   Now I'd like to take a moment and hop up on my little soapbox and rant about designer donuts. For the past 2-3 years, fancy donuts have dominated cute cupcakes and cakepops here in the Big Smoke. This, I can get behind. What I can't get behind is how ridiculous some of the flavours get... bacon butter pecan chocolate raspberry dream. What the hell is that? Sometimes things taste best when they're simpler, and Jelly Modern gets it right."}
