{"text":"Simply the best place around for a beer. Elwood's is just a gem of a local bar with great beer."}
{"text":"Clean, cozy and cute- this place has everything you need. Great beers, great food with a simple menu and live tunes. In the middle of nowhere, but worth the drive. A true gem. 

We had the chicken tortilla soup which was delicious with large chunks of white chicken meat, the house salad made with fresh quality greens and veggies. The buffalo chicken sandwich was pretty good- but the pulled pork sandwich was to die for. 

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love ElwoodsPub.  The staff are always friendly and the owners Dave & Cathy go above and beyond.  Great food, music and beer selection."}
{"text":"What a little gem hidden away in the woods outside Pittsburgh. Old school red leather cute. Pinball game in the basement. 

As a previous reviewer commented, it's a fry bar. But they got a great fry cook. Awesome hand battered zucchini, Monster & totally yummy beer battered fish sandwich. They do have a good black bean burger that ain't deep fried, and a pretty good pulled pork sandwich.

Tap selection was quality. And 1919 Rootbeer!"}
{"text":"We stopped here a year ago when we were looking for somewhere to eat close to Founder's Field after a day of watching rugby. We liked it so much we thought we would come back to see if it was as good as we remembered. It was worth stopping in again. When you pull up to Elwood's you wonder if you are at the right place and when you open the door it looks you're going to walk into someone's basement bar because the space is so small. Don't worry though - small space but big portions and huge taste. If you are in the area you should stop and I dare you to get the cod and finish it without help from someone else - I couldn't finish it all last year and my husband couldn't finish it this year. I went for the pulled pork this year - it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best wings in town, and for being in the middle of no where, they have the best beer selection! Their seasoned wings are bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there for the first time last night. The  bartender and staff were very attentive, Great fish sandwich. Will be stopping again!"}
{"text":"This place is certainly off the beaten path - we stumbled upon it after visiting Deer Lakes Park. Decent food, cozy environment and great conversation with \"Beer Dave,\" if you're looking to try a new brew or two."}
{"text":"The posting said Gastro Pub. It was anything but. Everything was fried. They had nice live music and you could tell it was all locals. No one else could find the place. A real step back in time."}
{"text":"Thank you Emily, you are amazing,  best bartender waitress, hostess ever!  Our first time at Ellwoods and it won't be our last. The food was delicious, enormous fish sandwich, and the pulled pork was the best. The sweet potato fries tasted like they had cinnamon and maybe sugar, so good!  Live music was great,  acoustic country, perfect. Thanks for a perfect evening out with friends."}
{"text":"Really nice pub that offers great beer and some good eats.  There wings are stellar and you have to get the hot pretzel with cheese.  They have certain nights of the week where people play live music.  Buddy of mine \"bluegrass Dave\" took me and plays some nights here.  Everything from the beer to the food is very reasonably priced and the service is great.  Must stop in if your in the area for a pint and some home cooking!"}
{"text":"A friend and I ran across this place when attending the 2015 Worlds Disc Golf tournament at Deer Lakes State Park. We later discovered that they were a sponsor of the event. It's a great little friendly place that makes you feel right at home. The beer selection was very good. The style and vibe was perfect. I didn't have any food, but what I saw around me looked very appetizing and of good quality."}
{"text":"The inside is nothing to look at, but the food and service was incredible. Got the beer battered cod and was only able to finish half cause it was so big even though it was delicious, my SO got the pulled pork and didn't leave a scrap. Good beer selection, fries were OK, seasoned well. Service was quick. A little more expensive than I was expecting, but still worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Elwood's to hear some live music.  It was our first time at this pub.  It's a small family owned establishment.  We found a table in the back near the hot sauce wall.  We ordered a cheese board and mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were hot, crunchy coated and gooey-just the way everyone likes them.  The cheese board had three types of cheese, crackers and two different types of mustards-a honey mustard and a stone ground.  The cheeses were an Irish Port, Sharp Cheddar and a Smoked Gouda.  My favorite was the Irish Port.  I had never had it before and really enjoyed it.  They have a nice selection of craft beers.  It was surprising for such a small pub to have such a nice selection.  We found out that if you order a mixed drink with orange juice or grapefruit juice that they squeeze it fresh right at the bar.  I'm definitely trying that when I go back.  We met the owner and found out that Elwood was their dog.  He passed away at 14.  The owner was extremely friendly and she chatted with us for a bit.  Elwood's is out in the middle of nowhere with a post office right next door.  I recommend you take a drive and check it out.  I know I'll be headed back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Local business with great atmosphere, menu and price. Elwoods also has live entertainment. The owners are pleasant and make you feel right at home. If you like a great fish sandwich, this is your spot. I love their burgers."}
{"text":"Great little place! Super friendly with 17 craft beers and root beer on tap. We had plain seasoned wings and buffalo wings. They are the whole 3-part wings, so a half dozen is plenty. We finished with an excellent root beer float. Highly recommend this place for casual dining with a solid craft beer selection."}
