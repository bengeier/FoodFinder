{"text":"Best pizza around. Better than any of the chains. Have been buying their pizza since they opened in Heart Lake probably 40 years ago. If you want lots of cheese remember the double cheese and don't order just extra cheese."}
{"text":"Seriously best pizza ever had it for 20 years before moving to NB but still when I go back to Brampton I make sure I get this great pizza. Really this is the best pizza I have ever tasted. If you don't think so it will actually upset me just saying."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I decided to try this place because I was in Brampton. I for sure thought it was going to be really good, but I was disappointed. The crust seemed like there was too much dough and there wasn't enough sauce or cheese to cover a whole pizza. Don't know what happened but I've never seen pizza like that. I thought it was just me but my fianc√© agreed with me. I was actually looking forward to eating it.....the people that work there however, to be really nice though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this experience because of the previous reviews. Our pizza was ok. I found it salty but maybe it was the toppings...pepperoni and bacon. I like the garlic bread though. I don't think I would go out of my way to get it again but if it's convenient I'll try it one more time. Also they don't charge for half toppings if you want to do half and half....I think that's a bit of a rip off but really I go by quality which was average."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try somewhere new as there's not much non-franchise selection in the area...big mistake! Poorest quality ingredients and I'm pretty sure the pepperoni was rotten or on the verge as it had that nasty heavy taste. We threw out the pizza and resorted to no dinner as our stomachs were turned. Do your self a favour and pop a delissio in the oven...this place should be ashamed to call itself italian."}
{"text":"I've never thought to review Venezia but they deserve more praise. Venezia is to Brampton food what people pretend Sonny's is. Which is to say it is an icon. Or at least it is in my Brampton.

It's definitely the best Italian-style pizza in Brampton, hands down. Slices are reasonably priced and they'll top them with whatever topping you want for something like 35c a topping. And they put a LOT on as well as extra cheese to make it all meld together. Like how thoughtful is that?!

Lasagna is also surprisingly amazing. My Italian mother grudgingly agreed that it was very good. And a big portion too.

Seriously, this place's current Yelp rating is a crazy injustice."}
{"text":"I pride myself on being a fair person that's why I'm going to update this review again and blame myself somewhat for my last.

I complained about the pizza being dry. Well,.....Supposedly you need to order DOUBLE CHEESE NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH EXTRA CHEESE....

Well, when I did that my pizza was magically transformed into something that tasted straight outta heaven.

If I could give the owner one tip, please let people know there's a difference between extra cheese & double cheese because In a normal world that is the same thing.

Really tasty pizza otherwise, authentically Italian mozzarella used which is what should be used. I will seldom go back to Caesars or Dominos because I like high end mozzarella."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza and you can get veal sandwiches - that puts it up to five stars.

Ah, service is top notch as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE VENEZIA! I love it so much I actually get offended when people say that they don't think it is the greatest pizza they have ever tasted. Seriously, my heart breaks a little in these moments. 
I order from here very often and have been a frequent customer since I was about 12 years old (I am 25 now). I have had almost everything on the menu in this amount of time but what I keep going back for are the pizzas, panzerotti's and home made feel of the place itself! This is so obviously a family owned place and I am loving it! They do a great job, are always friendly, make the food fresh to order and I am over the moon happy with my order. 
Only down side is that there is no seating inside the restaurant. However, there is a steady flow of regular customers eager for their next slice of the greatest pizza in Brampton."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza, pasta was decent.. they don't have chicken wings, who cares. They carry Italian food and Real pizza.. unlike the other 'pizza places'. I liked the rigatoni pasta and the toppings. Yum! Take out or delivery!"}
{"text":"Venezia is our go to place for pizza in Brampton. While I can't say we've tried all the pizza in Brampton we have still concluded this is the best. I don't think trying all the rest would prove that wrong. 

It's a small family place and the staff are always friendly and make sure we're taken care of. The prices are pretty good and they have a good selection of ingredients. My only suggestion is add procuitto and arugula to the list; best pizza toppings in my opinion! 

The homemade pizza dough is what makes it for me. You can just tell the difference from all the other greasy delivery pizzas. I've never felt short on any toppings either. Just a great take out or delivery pizza! Can't wait to try the panzerotti next time!"}
