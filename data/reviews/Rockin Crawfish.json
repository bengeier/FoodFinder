{"text":"Great spot for UNLV students - close to campus & 20% discount with your Rebel Card. The food was really good and they had amazing waffle fries."}
{"text":"So my husband and I went there tonight for dinner (hubby has been wanting to try it for sometime now). We went in at 9:40PM and the entire restaurant was empty less two patrons at the bar talking with the bartender. We stood there about five minutes before another worker came out from the back (the bartender looked over at us at least twice but couldn't be bothered to greet us) and proceeded to tell us that they had \"last call\" at 9:30PM and they were closed for the night. Pretty interesting, since their hours of operation are posted as being open 5pm-1am daily. Must be rough working a whole four hours and closing down when you feel like it. Needless to say we won't be back, and I'm guessing they won't be around very long since they want to close up shop three and a half hours early and turn away paying customers."}
{"text":"Right around the corner from UNLV!! Awesome decor and great service. The bartender Charlie and server Matt made my experience so enjoyable. Make sure to ask for them when you go in!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great environment! And great service from Shay! Make sure you try the rockin sauce!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The shrimp, crab, crawfish are fresh and I get it blended with potatoes, sausage and corn.  Go with the garlic butter medium!  I can't recommend this place enough.

Go when hungry--you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First timers here and the food was okay. I ordered two lbs of the crawfish, 2 lbs of shrimp, and a lb of mussels. I called prior to see if the crawfish was fresh/live and they said yes & that there was a special, buy one & get the second on free. I couldn't pass up this offer, so I had to try it. When I got there, I clarified to the server that I want fresh crawfish. When I got my food, all of my food was nuke warm & my crawfish was not fresh. Just about 1/4 of the insides were black and I was disappointed.

The only plus I did enjoy here were the mussels. Very plump and larger. But after a bad crawfish experience and ok food, I do not think I'll pay a second visit. Also, The prices are a bit higher than their competitors."}
{"text":"Rockin Crawfish is awesome!

 We had the spicy crawfish and shrimp. The service was quick and very friendly. The food was incredibly  fresh with great flavor. Great place to grab a beer and a game. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! So glad to find this spot. It's close to UNLV. Our family loved the food. Only complaint is the fries were soggy. Definitely going to check them out again."}
{"text":"Hubby found this gem while shopping in the center. We decided to give it a try tonight, and it was delicious! We both had a pound of crawfish each, one lemon pepper one garlic butter, corn on the cob for sides. There was a special, buy one pound get one free, can't beat that! Super juicy and flavorful, with just the right amount of messy. The bartender Charlie was super friendly and attentive. He told us about weekly specials and we'll DEFINITELY be coming back. Plus our date night was pretty easy on the wallet too. Be sure and make room for the deep fried Oreos!"}
{"text":"Since we are huge Crawfish fans, we decided to stop in and I'm glad we did! Customer service is on point thanks Charlie!! We enjoyed our time and loved the food!!"}
{"text":"$25.99 all u can eat. We had 3 rounds. Food was great! Service was really good. Nice place! Come!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how good this place is; the food and service combined is great. I love seafood especially crawfish. I couldn't quite handle the kick in the spices they have for the crab legs but although too spicy for me I love the flavors. I sucked on the crab legs in unison with a swig of my fav Ale. It cooled it down just a notch.  I recommend this place for good food and service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Good service and friendly staff. Shay and Tyler were the bomb. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Great service! Amazing food! The employees are VERY friendly too. I would recommend coming here if you guys wanna kick back and enjoy some dope ass food!"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh seafood, food was very flavorful. Got the garlic butter sauce for my crab, shrimp, sausage, corn, potato combo ...was delicious. Nice relaxed atmosphere, clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"I ran by batteries plus in the same parking lot, right around dinner time. I saw their sign out front that said grand opening, and decided to try it out. I'm in town for work, and I'm always open to trying new places and supporting local businesses. I had fried oysters gumbo calamari and onion rings all on the happy hour pricing menu. As well as a couple of beers on tap. The food and the beer were all great, but the bartender was awesome! I will most definitely come back on a future trip."}
{"text":"It was okay:/

DRINK: I like that they have a bar so if you just want to grab a drink, their bartender was really funny and friendly.

FOOD: Their seafood comes with a choice of lemon pepper, garlic butter, or rockin combo sauce. The Rockin combo sauce comes with actually habanero peppers! If you are like me and can't eat spicy, just be warned that the original spicy level was still to spicy. I recommend getting clams, it is fresh and is really tasty. The crawfish was what really disappointed me...it was way overcooked. It is great that the crawfish is fresh and not frozen, but a crawfish restaurant should be able to flawlessly cook crawfish. I have to say my favorite thing about this place is the garlic noodle. It is a great pairing for the seafood. Tried a few other dishes here, but nothing really stood out.

ATMOSPHERE: 20% grand opening special until mid-February. The staff was absolutely friendly and attentive. I never had to ask for anything because they were really prepared. The brought gloves, bibs, lemon and pepper and all the basics you need to eat seafood. I give them props for bringing me water without me asking when the food was too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment with awesome friendly  staff. Food is second to none. Had the ayce boiled crawfish, shrimp and crab legs. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Place was not crowded and noise level was very comfortable. This is definitely my new go-to place for boiled seafood. Sorry hot n juicy...They edged you out.."}
{"text":"Maybe I just really lucked out with this one, but the takeout poboys here are awesome. I'm in the area often but usually don't have the time or company to dine-in, so I have stuck to their sandwiches so far. The fried shrimp is under $10, large and stuffed with freshly-fried shrimp, nicely dressed, and comes with a huge side of seasoned waffle fries. Service has been friendly and fast, and they play pretty good music while you wait. Eventually I'll order their fresh seafood but so far I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. Had a good portion of snow crabs and clams are fresh too. I got the medium rockin sauce which was the right amount of spice. I am so happy they have deep fried oreos!!! You have no idea how happy that makes a prego lady lol. Place is really clean and our server Shay was very attentive and checked on our table a few times to make sure we had what we needed. Glade we have a seafood spot in the east side of town!!"}
{"text":"Sad experience for me. Prices unexpectedly high-family of mine ordered the crawfish very disappointed the crawfish was very small only a few big ones in one of the dishes -my out-of-town family had to go out to a second restaurant after finished eating here due to lack of food our bill was $100 for four people and all we ordered was 2 pounds of crawfish 1 pound of king crab and one bowl of gumbo! We also got one root beer float and one orange cream float -the floats where honestly disgusting the cups tasted like dirty soap water the soda had no fizz! I wonder if they bought the soda at the $.99 store or the dollar tree? Crab is a delicacy of mine that I love I can't say I loved their crab it didn't seem cooked right the flesh was sticking hard into the shell as if it hadn't been boiled long enough to separate and the shell was extremely hard to crack felt like rubber also like it hadn't been cooked long enough! on a More positive note -seasoning was OK and the service was fast-but I think the service was fast because there was only one other person in the entire restaurant. I was going to go to Sakana sushi but the line was long and the family was hungry I have many regrets about not waiting. Taco Bell would have been a better choice. Long story short I would never go back."}
{"text":"Happened to come across this gem while driving by.  It's in the same strip mall as the Target store.  Similar concept to Hot N Juicy.  I think place is much better, though.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  If you crave crawfish, jumbo shrimp, and crab legs, this place has an AYCE platter for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I finally found some good seafood in Vegas!  Great service, and it's ok to be messy. They will just roll up the paper on the tables when you're done!  The gumbo appetizer was big enough I had to get half of mine to go so I wasn't too full for my shrimp with corn and taters!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great. Great. Great!! 
My daughter, brother, family friend and I came here on a Wednesday night. Quiet and not too busy due to mid week. Place is clean and has a fun concept, my daughter kept busy by drawing in the walls and table (they give the kids chalk). The staff there is very attentive and just seems happy to serve as they are a newly opened establishment. Great value for  the all you can eat option though we came late we were only allowed to have two servings each WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH! Flavors are out of this world good! The seafood was fresh. Best part of our evening dinner will have to be the service!!!! Please visit Shoog and Shay they kept our drinks flowing, Shoog gave my daughter a orange cream-sickle shake (so yummy and that was nice of him).  Both Shay and Shoog gave great suggestions on food and drinks (FULL BAR BTW). WE HAD AN AWESOME TME JUST BEING SERVED BY THEM. DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY GOING BACK!!!! I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY. THEY ARE A ROCKSTAR DUO and everything from food to Service was on point! Thank you Shay and Shoog. Thank you rocking crawfish. Xoxoxoxox"}
{"text":"Hands down the best crawfish. Nice size crawfish, juicy, spicy and DELICIOUS. Charlie was AWESOME, attentive and very kindred. Thanks rockin crawfish you now have me in crawfish heaven."}
{"text":"Preface: It's still their grand opening, so they're still figuring things out. We went here on a slow night. Only one other table when we arrived. Just three others when we departed. It's located in the Target shopping center, near-ish to UNLV.

The service was...alright. Not exactly upbeat and enthusiastic. And we had to ask for every single thing - gloves, tools, etc.

The decor is cute - is all boombox-oriented, pained in bright colors, and there's even a wall of cassette tapes. Very cool. There's a bar with seating and then several tables.

This is a spot similar to Hot 'n' Juicy and Boiling Crab. They have crawfish, king crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, and dungeness crab. They have a couple different seasonings/broths, or you can choose the Rockin' Combo, which is all of them combined. You also choose your spice-level from mild to volcano. They also have corn, potatoes, and sausage to add to it. And you can get fries, chili cheese fries, sweet potato fries, wings, etc., etc. on the side. They did seem to have more sides than at the other similar places. They also have noodles and rice. 

The beer list was ok - better than average, but not great. There was no beer/cocktail menu. We had to ask the server what beers they had, and he wasn't particularly knowledgeable about them. 

So on to the food... The oysters were disgusting. They were, honestly, the crappiest oysters I've ever experienced. Ever. Skip these entirely. They were tiny, very thin, and ick. They were served with slices of lemon and cocktail sauce and tarter sauce on the side. The cocktail sauce was pretty good. The tarter sauce was meh. It would've been nice to have a fork and/or spoon or something. But nope, you don't get those things.

The bags of seafood were served double-bagged and in a black plastic tub. I appreciated the tub as it gave you the option of dumping it all out into the tub and helped mitigate some of the mess. 

The shrimp was quite yum. It was cooked better than at other similar places. The king crab legs were quite substantial and larger than at other similar place. The seasoning/broth was tasty. It was a little thicker than at other similar places, which I liked. The flavor was slightly different than those similar places, but nothing so different or noticeable that you could pinpoint it.

The cajun waffle fries were a good-sized portion and the fries were large and thick, especially for waffle fries. They were served with sides of ketchup and ranch. I appreciated the addition of the ranch, but it wasn't good ranch.

The tools we received, after asking for them, were two cracking thingys and a pair of scissors. The pair of scissors were nice for cutting the crab legs. However, one of those digger thingys to get the crab meat out would've been helpful. I was using the scissors to try to poke the meat out, which didn't work all that well.

Oh, and the bibs are just paper. They are very easily torn and don't have a pocket thing at the bottom to help catch things. In other words, they weren't particularly helpful when it comes to messiness. There were also no wipes offered. And when we flagged our server down inquiring about gloves, we were given latex gloves, which seemed a bit strange. The plastic ones are a better way to go.

The prices here were also higher than at similar places. But since the king crab legs were bigger and the shrimp cooked better, I wouldn't consider it overpriced. The service could've been better. And they can definitely do better when it comes to tools and things to help keep you clean.

All in all, this place could be great. Maybe it'll be better in time. But I didn't get all the 5-star hype during my visit. And seriously, WORST oysters EVER."}
{"text":"First timers after 3 weeks grand opening. Shay was our waitress and was full of Awesomeness!!! She was very friendly, kept everything we needed filled, water, drinks, food etc...
Mike was very personable as well! He came around to all the tables introducing himself and asking if we were happy with everything.

Food: spicy even for original...crablegs big and tasty, shrimp big as well and comes with corn, sausage and potatoes.
It was an all you can eat special which changed the next weekend to 2 -5p...who wants a heavy meal like that at 2pm!!!
Anyways, I will def come back and refer friends to this place, but they def needs to scale down spice level on original. Some ppl can't tolerate too much spice for whatever reasons.
How about No spice in original???

Atmosphere: old school soda machines and vintage pics. Awesome!! TVs throughout made it nice to watch the games if that's what you're into.
Clean and smells of seafood aroma!! Yum

Will Return...."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices have been there 2 times and the food has been great both times. 1st time had the all u can eat bowl 2nd time  had the bowl again. Eventhough  they sisnr have the all u can eat but 1 bowl is filling enough."}
{"text":"I honestly am so glad that I discovered this place. We came here for Mother's Day since I was craving crawfish but didn't want to drive all the way to Spring Mountain for hot & juicy.

The flavor was on point. For it being the original spice level it had a great kick to it. It starts off with some heat then you can taste sweetness. I really enjoyed their combination special which consisted of crawfish, shrimps, snow crab, potatos, and sausages. The crawfish was very fresh.

My 1 year old loved their garlic noodles and so did I. I feel like everything I ate was delicious and the service was outstanding. 

This will probably be my go to crawfish joint in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Like this place so much. Gotta try out their crawfish and you wont regret. Pick on AYCE special you can try out all different kind of seafood with a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Came here and the food was not fresh. The shrimp was still a little dirty and the customer service wasn't great. Disappointed."}
{"text":"My new favorite seafood place. Went again recently and always with company because who doesn't want a little extra help getting messy and full. Let me start with the garlic noodles that I was thrilled to see as a menu option. So delicious with just the right amount of everything and goes well with the all of the menu option. This trip I ordered a pound of snow crab legs for myself and a pound of king crab for my company. We topped both off with corn, potatoes and sausage which gives it a little extra taste if you ask me. We also ordered some gumbo that was sooo good. I normally do not like gumbo with okra in it, but I actually like theirs. The music here is always ROCKIN they were playing Future when we walked in today. I was like \"OKAY!\" lol. As soon as you come in they have this cool wall displaying a bunch of old radios and speakers, I think it's pretty creative. Overall the atmosphere is pretty laid back. The waiters are always nice and right on time with the wet naps (because I don't use the gloves :-) EVER lol). So yes you should try it I was so full and satisfied when we finished I almost left with my bib on. 

WE ROCKIN!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it first opened a while ago. For an early Mother's Day dinner my husband took me here on a Friday night. I expected the place to be packed like it is when we usually walked by but there was only one couple when we arrived at 7 o clock. We were greeted by a young woman with poofy hair and To be honest she wasn't the most friendly hostess I had ever met. She looked up at us from her desk and motioned toward the dining room saying \" sit anywhere\" so we took a seat at one of the tables covered in a paper table covering. a man gave us our menus then recommended we get the special which is 1/2 pound of shrimp, half pound of snow crab, half pound of crawfish, and potatoes, corn, and sausage all for 25$. We seasoned ours in garlic butter and went for the 'original' on spice level. We also got a side of seasoned waffles fries. The food came out quickly. It was hot and well seasoned. The garlic wasn't overwhelming and it was just spicy enough to hit the spot but not over do it. It took us almost two hours to de-shell all the food. We mostly ate everything but when we rounded up our eating experience, we still had half a basket of waffle fries and lots of crawfish. This place is awesome. My only complaint is everyone there seems to be lacking proper manners. We thanked the staff multiple times before leaving (we kept having to repeat ourselves) and still never received a \"you're welcome\" or a \"come back again\". Despite those minor offenses I'll definitely be returning. I need to get my hands on more of those crab legs!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Their Rockin Combo sauce in Med spiciness is so flavorful with just the right amount of heat. I definitely have a new favorite seafood/cajun spot!"}
{"text":"This is a really great seafood restaurant for the whole family. It's a nice, chill environment. Excellent customer service. I recommend coming here! Shrimp Rockin' Combo and onion rings are the go-to on the menu!"}
{"text":"Prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! Fries $6.99 ? What a joke !!! Walked in and there was noooooo one in the restaurant, no wonder... now I know why, the prices are crazy ! No thanks I'll stick to hot n juicy instead. Seafood items Like $5 cheaper. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This spot was great. Got the all you can eat boil and bottomless mimomas. The Rockin' Combo was my fave.  Plenty of food and well worth the price. Our waitress, Lori, was awesome. The atmosphere was good and music rockin. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was great! Let them guide you on the spice! If you can't handle heat don't think you can. We were the only patrons there so we got personal service."}
{"text":"First time here with friends for my bday.  We all ordered the AYCE. It came with 1/2pd of shrimp,  Crawfish, crab legs, corn, sausage, potatoes and garlic bread. The portion sizes decreases after each order, but you get plenty of food. My friend ordered a catfish meal for her son which he loved!  The staff was nice, professional, and very patient. Afterwards they let you write on the walls, which is pretty cool! I really liked this place and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and I loved everything about it, from Matt the Bartender and the Owner Christina, down tobthe great atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was amazing customer service was great! Waitress was always checking on us. They have great deals we will def come back!!"}
{"text":"First timers, forever loyal customers ! My husband and I, new to Las Vegas had seen this place and decided to stop in one night. We sat at the bar with \"Shug White\" . The music was jumping and even though not many people were there , it sure still felt like the party popping . I miss my old bar from home and this place made me feel right at home. I cant forget my bartendar Shug ! He was just great , I love IPA's and he let me sample one , some tangerine idk whatever it is i know he will know next time im in. He also let us know about Happy Hour and the 20% off until the 14th ! Thanks for the great service and we will be back ! 

Dont forget to sign the bar and eat the deep fried oreos !"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I just hate having to peel and crack everything before eating, I'm a bit lazy wheb it comes to my food. However the flavors are delicious and the all you can eat is the best deal one can get. The seafood quality was great as well. The staff was very nice and attentive to our large party. I love the fact that you can write on their walls with chalk. I ordered a vodka tonic but it was super nasty, the drinks aren't as good as the food."}
{"text":"Best craw fish place in town, they are so delicious and great prices, the services is on point and the staff is friendly, me and my wife set at the bar and Charlie was theeeee friendliest and most helpful employee always made sure my drink was topped I'd never had to even ask for a thing, I literally felt like a king, all jokes aside great place and great staff best place to sit is at the bar with the Charlie on the other side."}
{"text":"Flavors resemble that of hot n juicy or boiling crab. Amazed at how fast the food came out. The waitress was very friendly and kept our waters filled. They also had an all you can eat special for 26 bucks of seafood boil, for the win. Overall, i will be coming back due to the a.y.c.e. special and great service. New favorite spot in town, can't wait to go back and try the gumbo. Oh, and waffle fries were seasoned right"}
{"text":"The Waitresses are very friendly their services and amazing they're very aware of their menu coming from a native of the South the food is very good.... I will recommend it to all my friends especially since it seems to be very transgender friendly"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new seafood places, and competitors to Hot'n'juicy. This place definately contends with excellent cooking spice options, convenient bowls that others don't have, and new flavors and dishes to the valley. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"King crab tonight was baller paired with 805!! Rockin combo broth on point! I even got to sign the bar- I luv tortoises. The live crawfish were tasty and the shrimp were a great size. Ordered the rocking crawfish combo broth ( garlic butter + lemon pepper). Fantastic! Cool fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Want burning lips, fingers and ***, must try their volcano sauce. Guaranteed you'll tear up or maybe even cry a little 

We ordered a pound of king crab legs on steroids and shrimp with heads and was beyond satisfied  

Satisfaction guaranteed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Crawfish is fresh, the sauce is made in house and beers are a must!! I had the 805 and the white Rascal and it was... BOMB with the spicy Crawdads!! Also their staff is amazing , so friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!! Can't wait to have some live Cajun music all up in there!"}
{"text":"Just my luck! A place with a great atmosphere, great service and The best food I've had in a while. This is going to be my new go to on the way home."}
{"text":"Cool ambience,full bar,  great service and unbelievably fresh seafood, especially the live Crawfish with the rockin sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! We got 2lbs of shrimp with the Rockin Combo sauce, one spicy and one medium. If you love spicy, I recommend the spicy level. The decor is fantastic, with old stereos and cassettes adorning the walls. We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Great service and best crawfish ever. 
Love their sauce, especially the fresh crawfish."}
{"text":"Food was alittle to spiced, the original flavors you can still taste the spicyness, our orders took a little longer there was a group who actually came in after us and they got their order first before we even got ours, seems like we order the same thing its just they have atleast 8 people in their party. I love the crawfish very tasty and fresh and very affordable our bill was over $44 and we have 4 people in our group plus a toddler. I love the peach green tea, i would come back here again. 

P.s when we got there we were the only people in the restaurant so they were not busy.. ill give it a 4 Stars i wouldvr give 5 but customer service is important too."}
{"text":"Great seafood and service. The all you can eat option is worth it, shrimp, crawfish, and crab"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The smell when you first walk makes your stomach growl. Their sauce w mussels n crawfish was better than most places. My favorite was by far the fried oysters. Those surpassed my expectations so did the fries which were addicting."}
{"text":"We ate our hearts out! You can't beat there $25 all you can eat special plus for another 10 bux you can enjoy bottomless Bloody Mary's or Mimosas! These deals will make any fat kids heart pound. The service and food are great. We've tried most of the joints in the area that service similar food but it looks like we found a new favorite. If you're ever in the area or just wanna try something new defiantly give them a try. This spot is kinda hidden in the Target shopping center but totally worth looking for."}
{"text":"This place was great!! I had the all you can eat. Shay was my waitress she was great too. The medium spice level was a little too spicy for me. The mild was to mild for me. Next time I'll know. The crawfish, shrimp, crab, and sausage were all good. I was there for their happy hour so the beer on draft was $3. The only negative was gratuity was already added to the check and it wasn't pointed out. If I wouldn't have noticed I would have double tipped. I still tipped a little extra cause I had great service. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"$25 all you can eat crawfish, shrimp, and crab .  No brainer.   1/2 off all fried food for happy hour 4-6 during week.   Will come back again for sure.   Prepare to get messy!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome went there to check out the food. Boy we were in for a excellent time.. starting with the employees Shug and Shay the bartenders/ food servers! They were very personable and knew everything from the beer to the food on the menu.. and then also the manager Mike he was the best made us feel like we were at home with friends! The food was excellent I'm not a big fish eater but my wife is.. the catfish Mike had us sample was absolutely great it had a great taste not fishy tasting.. and like I said for someone who's not a big fish eater this place stands up to its name Rockin!!  We had the fried oysters, andouille sausage with clams and the Shrimp Po Boy. The servings were huge we highly recommend this place we will definitely be going often!! Thank you Mike, Shug and Shay for making us feel so welcome and taking care of us.."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Had the clams and snow crab and was cooked perfectly and the Rockin sauce has good flavor and kick."}
{"text":"What a surprise! My daughter invited us because our local favorite Crab Corner closed it's east side location. Loved my shrimp and sausage! I had bites of some of the others' appetizers - calamari and raw oysters. Will definitely go back. Good service - I think Shay - plus Mike, the manager, came out and talked to us."}
{"text":"Brand new seafood joint located near UNLV on Maryland. Their flavors really popped out when I first bite into it. Ordered a pound of shrimp which was about $15.99/ market price. I don't remember how much was the crawfish by the pound but it was very delicious.

Each rice cost about $2 a cup. The Rockin Combo wasn't that spicy at original spice level which is good because I enjoyed it pretty well. I love the garlic butter, usually other places flavor wasn't that good for garlic butter but this place definitely brought that flavor out. The shrimp was really huge and the crawfish was juicy and fresh. The space in this restaurant is a little small but very clean. Need to try their other specials they have so they will see me coming back again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Service was a weak.  

We had the all-you-can-eat seafood. And, the spicy was spicy.  Oysters were great as well. 

Definitely recommend this place."}
