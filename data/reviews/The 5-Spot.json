{"text":"Ill give this restaurant 2 stars, the wings were crispy. The salmon salad, when the plate was brought, this slab of over done grilled (?) salmon on top of huge chunks of greens. The lemon salad dressing was not lemony. Had to ask for more dressing, not much on there. The salad was not fresh, there were some brown starting on the lettuce. When the wings were brought with sauce, one plate, no saucers or extra napkins. I wouldn't recommend except to get some wings. If this is a new place, I guess there is a learning curve on serving and plating. Hope they are quick learners."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop after work. Excellent Arizona beers on draft that frequently change. If you're looking for a nice glass of wine this isn't your place, but if you want a good beer or shot of whiskey and some tasty wings (especially when finished on the grill) the 5 spot is for you.   Other amazing foods include the fried tortellini, boardwalk fries, the Rueben sandwich, curry cauliflower, and the chicken bacon ranch (fried or grilled). I've seen some people complain about the fries, yes they used to be a little weak, but they are now hand cut and amazing.   They frequently have specials, trivia, bands, etc.... so check their FB page for more info. They also have plenty of bar games."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to check out this new bar and the live music. We live down the street and had seen this venue go through several incarnations and we really wanted to like this place.  Got there about 9 PM, they have a full bar which has a pool table next to it. There's also a long shuffleboard table which was piled high with band equipment the night we were there.    There's it's a long divider between the bar and a large sitting area with a dance floor and the stage. Unfortunately the divider which acts as additional seating for the bar did not have enough barstools. The table seating was arranged in the long rows like cafeteria seating and if you wanted to sit at a table near the dance floor  you had to sit with other people you didn't know.  We're just coming from dinner so we didn't try the food although a number of people were eating. We did order drinks. I ordered the 7/7 and was told they were out of Seagrams but would substitute something. The drink that came out seemed water down and was served with a Orange Bendy straw, first time that's happened in the bar. My boyfriend ordered a beer which was served in a large glass and was a good value for the money.  We listen to the band for a while however the acoustics were not very good and the noise from the bar and the pool table interfered.  We may be back to try the food but probably not for drinks and dancing."}
{"text":"The staff and owner are some of the best people I have ever meet! The drinks are cheap and the food is freshly prepped and made to order. The place is always spotless clean and very entertaining! Where else can you go and get a jack and coke for $5?? I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tonite I had the jalepeno poppers at the five spot .  If you haven't tried these things ,do yourself a favor and head on over there and try some .  There entire menu is completely craft . Made to order perfection . This bar/restaurant has it all . Friendly staff . Amazing food and great drink specials.   If your around the 16th St and Bell road area . Stop in and do your self a favor try the jalepeno poppers.   Cream filled jalepeno wrapped in bacon . Cooked to perfection .  Covered in a sweet chili sauce .   I'm addicted..."}
{"text":"This place recently opened by where we live, and we love new places, so we went Friday night. Their angle is that several menu items and drinks are five bucks, hence the name of this joint. They have a full bar, the beer was cold, the food was good, and the service was friendly. We had chicken wings, sloppy-joe sliders, burgers, and boardwalk fries. Everything was inexpensive and a cut above typical bar fair. I'd recommend everything we had. There was a guy walking around we thought was the owner, turned out he was the owner's dad. He helped the servers get food out between stopping by tables to say hi and see how everyone was. He gave the place a real family feel. Everyone on the staff including our waitress seemed happy and genuinely invested in making the place great. I love live music, but we were there too early to stick around for the band that went on at nine. Now that we know, we'll hit this place at a later time on our next visit, make it more of a night out than just a dinner.  Two suggestions for the owner if you're reading this... first, move the shuffleboard table to the opposite wall, when the band is loading in, the game in inaccessible. Secondly, lose the jukebox and just play music. The songs are fifty-cents to a buck each, it's expensive and the jukebox doesn't get loaded up resulting in lots of silence. You're sacrificing your ambiance for whatever you make off the jukebox.  In short, we had a great time, loved the place, the people, the food, the drinks, we'll definitely be hitting this place again very soon. It's a great neighborhood bar kind of place."}
{"text":"Really wanting this place to work as we live close and used to go here at least once a week with previous owners. They're are trying to make it weird \"craft\" food. There is hardly anything on their menu. Can't they just stick to normal bar/restaurant food that's cooked well? Why not burgers, wings, appetizers and salads? Keep it simple and good and more people would come.  Also I've been there twice and each time they only have very very cheap Chardonnay. It seems they are being very cheap with food and drinks. Wish them the best and hope it improves."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for the first time yesterday and were pleasantly surprised. The drinks were good and reasonably priced and Nick the bartender gave us great service, but the food is the main reason we'll go back! The menu is a departure from typical bar fare that includes some interesting options and everything we tried was DELICIOUS!   The $5 small plate concept is genius because it allows you to try multiple options (which we did!) but additional menu items also looked fantastic.   Definitely recommend The Five Spot to anyone looking for a decent cocktail and an awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend the first Friday they were open, only a few food items on the menu but the cauliflower and pickles were very good. Was hoping they'd have some form of chicken wings but maybe that will come later down the road. Saw they will be adding burgers soon as well. Mix drinks are poured well and go fast as they were out of Jack Daniel's on my fifth go around. Hopefully they continue to grow and get better, there's a lot of potential here. Just need to get some softer lights though, felt like I was in a hospital at times."}
{"text":"The menu has expanded! the wings are awesome, the bartender Nicholas is not only entertaining but well informed. The Arizona burger was very good as was the roasted cauliflower app. Lots of beer on tap as well. Will be our new regular spot."}
{"text":"Would like to check this place out again in a few months. The food was good, but excited to see they are adding more selection!"}
{"text":"I ran across this place from seeing it on Facebook and decided to give it a shot. I was thrilled to see the meals were $5 and figured a great place to grab a meal for our family.  The four of us went on a Thursday night and weren't impressed. When we walked in, all the tables were empty but a few patrons at the bar. We were handed one paper menu that was half of one printer sheet. The items were very limited and the $5 only covered the main item and didn't include sides. The items they did have were just weird and not very appetizing. If you like sloppy joe sliders and curry cauliflower, then you will love it! The kids menu was okay and definitely looked better than than the regular menu. On the menu they did have \"burgers coming soon\" printed, so that would be an improvement.  Two kids and two adults cost us $36 with tip.   The staff was friendly but needed to be more attentive and pay more attention to detail. The bartender yelled profanity at a server because of her poor music choice. I did agree with him but he should have been a bit more professional, especially when children are present. If this wasn't considered a family establishment, then it may be more acceptable.   They had plenty of things to do there. They have a shuffle board which the kids loved. They also had TVs, jukebox and darts. They did advertise live music but probably only there on the the weekend.    I gave this place 2 stars because it's nothing special and I would never return. If the menu doesn't change, I don't think they will bring in many customers to eat. It may as well just be considered a dive bar at this rate. I believe the other reviews I saw were made up by friends of this establishment in order to get a higher rating. Try it out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"don't like the bartender..the keg went dry and had half glass in my glass..than proceeding to fill with new keg..bottom of the barrel never is served to a customer..bartender was rude.won't be back.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Finally a neighborhood bar with good food and great vibe. The employees are always so friendly every time I come in. The Portobello Mushroom is hands down amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food. Menu is limited right now but what they do have is fresh and tasty. Great selection of AZ craft beers. Entertainment after 9:00. Tortellini is a great dish. Boardwalk fries are a bit messy but good."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible place.  Not good food, rude bartender.   The sandwich I ate literally made me sick.  Rude staff and disgusting food is not a good combination.  Nice room, though.  I liked the atmosphere, but too many low life power drinkers go there.  Not a middle class joint.  This place is not getting off to a good start.  Avoid the 5 spot at all costs..."}
{"text":"You know the food is good when you find yourself eating things that you don't eat. I can't wait till this place grows up even more. It's new, hot, has live music, and is everything that North Phoenix needs. If you haven't been here you need to try it. Going to my favorite type of review, stupid good! Congratulations 5 spot"}
{"text":"The 5-Spot is a fun bar with TV's, Games, Coin Operated Games and a Juke Box and a Craft Food Menu. They have a special $5.00 drinks and some bar grub $5.00 specials.   We ordered off the regular menu and started with the Coconut Curry Cauliflower. Our Cauliflower was cooked nicely and was tasty. It was garnished with these cute little sweety drop peppers that were very flavorful, tasty and not too heavy.  I really wanted to try the house prepared Whiskey Soaked Rueben Sandwich but they were all sold out of them and a new batch was brining and not ready yet so I went with the Salmon Salad. I received a big generous salad of fresh mixed greens that was topped with a tasty piece of grilled salmon and those really tasty addicting sweety drop peppers. I liked that the salmon didn't have an obvious from frozen fishy taste.....like a lot of places serve. Instead it had a nice and meaty with a tasty char and was flaky. It might have been slightly overcooked but still was tasty.  My husband tried the Cheese Steak with Potato Salad. It was more of a slow cooked braised beef sandwich and the meat was very tender and developed with flavor. It was served on a soft roll that was a little too soft to hold up to all the meat. Still a tasty sandwich and I was told the potato salad was a little different and tasty too.   I like and appreciate that they want to offer something nicer than what a regular bar offers. They have a nice large menu with a lot of interesting different offerings. I'd like to try them again!  The man serving us was engaging, helpful and friendly.  3.5 stars rounded up for all the effort and hospitality.    Give them a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is very new but has a lot of potential. Plenty of TVs for sports, a nice bar, pool table, dart board, shuffle board, and a big area for dining. The menu is limited but we had the Reuben sandwich and it was AWESOME! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a gem! Went last night for the first time, hoping that the area would get something like this place. As others mention, the selection right now is small, but it all packed a punch - made a great first impression. Stop in for a drink and try a few small plates, you won't be disappointed. Let's all watch this place grow! A few more varieties of wine please - doesn't have to be a catalog :-)"}
{"text":"I haven't had the food yet so I can't review that aspect of this place, but in terms of staff and mixed drinks, The 5-Spot is a nice place to be. The atmosphere is relaxed and the drinks are mixed well. The staff are friendly and attentive. Hoping this place becomes a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great $5 plates. The food was fresh and tasty. Great prices for everything. Large draft beer but I wish they had some European imports on draft. We will go back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service/Atmosphere-Arrived around 7:00 on a Friday night and was greeted by a friendly bearded man who happen to be the bartender, and my guess the owner. There is lots to do and see as they have several TVs, pool tables, shuffle boards, darts and casino electronic games and jukebox. All NEW & nice looking!   The place is big, lots of seating in & out and for a small 7pm crowd you'd think they'd have a server there by at least 5 to take care of the patrons. But man, did that bartender move fast!! I watched him as handled the bar, the diners and the live band set up-impressive!! When our server arrived, she was extremely attentive, and friendly. They were all very accommodating to our request! Out of a couple of food options, and they offered alternative options, even working the price down.    Beer-I only ordered a Michelob Ultra as I thought  \"Did I just pay $5 for a simple Michelob Ultra? Thankfully I did not, $3! My husband ordered a Lumber Yard and liked it a lot. The Craft beer is not a small portion either, you get your monies worth for sure!    Food-We ordered the Boardwalk Fries. I was told they're reminiscent to Fries on the East Coast, covered with Malt Vinegar,  Ketchup and Cajun Seasonings. Great  I thought! But they were somewhat greasy and not crispy and could've used more time frying as they were soft still.   I ordered the Grilled Coconut Curry Chicken Sandwich and was delightfully surprised by its flavor!!! The chicken was grilled to perfection, moist and juicy and smothered in warm curry sauce and the micro greens were a perfect compliment to it. All on a perfectly toasted bun! (Try it)   My husband had the 5Spot Craft burger and he was in burger heaven!!! It was a HUGE hunk of beef, hand shaped patty with some kind of sweet & smoky flavor to it, and with just the right amount of BBQ sauce to it. He was totally lovin it and only gave me a small bite to try!!!  He also had a side of pasta salad, which was yummy.   Conclusion-Everything tastes homemade, except the side of hummus. It was on the cold side and so was the 2pieces of baguette slices it came with. I would have preferred those to be warmed up or toasted at least. Which is why I'd give this place 4 stars for little details like that. Along with the long waits for our food.   The live band was pretty poppin though and the food & darinks were pretty good too!!! I'm sure they're just going through \"growing pains\" and we'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly  service.  Glad to finally have a good restaurant in the hood!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and the Reuben and everything was \"crispy\" ..... not at all appetizing! The sever was friendly..4 stars...and the craft beer was cold! Definitely won't eat there again!"}
{"text":"Came to try a new place for lunch.  We had to wait for the tea to be brewed and Definitely worth it, not made from a mix and yummy. Sandwiches were very very good - BLT very generous with the bacon and the Ruben was made with corned beef and not the pre-sliced stuff.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic family friendly place. The kind of bar you can relax in but also order amazing food at. The prices are great, and I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Food was really mediocre and drinks were not good. Beer was bitter on draft, soda had no carbonation and service was slow when the joint was practically empty on a week night. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Great service and an up and coming bar/grill with amazing Asian infusion  Must try bacon wrapped jalapeños"}
{"text":"Fun places the staff is very happy to talk with you when they have time. Newly opened . The owner is quite friendly and willing to take suggestions I plan on going back very soon."}
{"text":"Great local place with a relaxed atmosphere. They have inside and outside seating large screen TVs and plenty of room to seat the family and play table games along with some video games, shuffle board and pool table. Really reasonably priced menu the caprice tortellini and fried pickles are a must try!"}
{"text":"I love 5 spot.  It is one of my go to spots. They have great food and great drink prices. The staff is great. Nicholas behind the bar always makes sure you have what you need!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come and chill after a long day! I come from miles away just because the staff is awesome and their BLT's absolutely rock. Plus, you can't beat 5 dollars a drink!"}
{"text":"Delicious wings and big juicy burgers.  The fries are just the right kind of greasy and flavorful. The bartender was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, tonight is their last night in operation! Come help them sell their last bits of alcohol with drink specials. So sad this area can't seem to keep restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewers saw but I  didn't experience the so called quality food or atmosphere.  Now maybe it was because it was a Wednesday night but from start to finish it was a visit we won't be repeating.  When we walked in we were hit with a very sour smell of the place like they had mopped the place with dirty water or something. That kind of set the tone.  There were only 2 other tables occupied in the place. Halfway through our visit one of the other tables just got up and left without paying. Left us wondering what was in store for us The bartender was the server too, so service was sort of slow. I had the burger and fries and my wife had the cheese steak.  The burger was just ok and the fries were greasy and way over seasoned. The cheese steak was chopped steak with cheese wiz on a bland role. Neither were very good.  No condiments on the tables so we had to ask for everything. Even salt and pepper. The server never asked if we needed anything or offered to refill our drinks.  I hate to say it  but I doubt if it will be around long unless they can survive on the bar and weekend sales. It won't  be for their food or service!"}
